Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I enjoyed this, but it's an interesting film, and definitely a good movie for a long movie night.   - It's a small world. A girl from Chicago. The man who thinks he's from the "real" world. The person who knows everyone in this little world. This was a great movie and a great way to start a long film night.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In this day and age of the internet, it's almost impossible to create an online reputation. That's why I am willing to share my personal experience with The Last of Us. It's a movie with a lot of potential, but it was shot so poorly, so poorly and the writing was so inept it's difficult to believe the movie exists at all. The story is about Joel and Ellie, who are survivors of a zombie attack. They are on their way to meet with an old friend, Riley, who survived, but has had her memory wiped. When Joel is bitten and starts to develop a craving for blood, Ellie has no choice but to shoot him. Joel then awakens as a zombie and it is up to Ellie and Riley to save the human race. There are a few scenes that were pretty cool, but most are so bad that you will not be able to enjoy the film. The most noticeable example was a scene where Riley was being attacked by a horde of zombies in the middle of the woods. She was barely able to take them out as they were faster, stronger and faster. However, as the movie progresses, the zombies become more and more intelligent, and have a chance to kill Riley and her father. They get close to Ellie as she is hiding from a group of zombies who are trying to kill her. They don't touch her, but they have a strong enough smell to know that she is a child, and they are able to run right past her. The next scene shows her crawling out of the bushes, running into the dark and getting attacked by an animal (a bear). It is then revealed that the bear is a zombie, but a weaker and slower one than the ones chasing her. It was such a poorly done sequence that it made me feel uncomfortable and disappointed. As for the zombies themselves, well, it has become so commonplace that you won't be able too much of a complaint. The zombies in The Last Of Us are so similar to each other that it's a chore to tell them apart. Their actions are the same, the same looks, the movements, the screams, the gurgling, etc. It makes for a disappointing experience. There were two interesting zombies in this film: one was a giant, very slow and silent and it was actually quite terrifying; the other was a man who could not see, who was almost completely blind. Both of them had a very funny dialogue with Joel, which you will almost never
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    * * *   What the movie is about: This movie is not the worst horror movie I have ever seen. In fact, it has some interesting scenes and it does have a decent horror theme. But it fails as a horror movie because it is way too long and you get bored and then the ending comes and it just starts over again. It also fails as an action movie because the only character to do anything in this movie is a woman and then she dies. The girl is there but there is no emotion or any action, she just sits there and just watches her friends go to hell. The movie also fails because it has a girl named "Kerry" and it is a horrible name for a girl. She should have been called Kerry, Kerry was a bitch and Kerry is a whore and she was only going to get what she deserved. I also don't know why this movie was made. I mean, it is an 80's movie but why was she so hot? Why does this movie still exist? The movie was too long so it was annoying because it took a long time to get through, but it also has a bad ending. This movie was never worth watching. My Rating: 6/10 Rating Scale: 1 = the movie sucked 2 = the scene in the movie was interesting 3 = the character in the movies was okay and they acted well 4 = the acting was good 5 = the movies had a great action scene 6 = the ending was interesting and the movie did a good job of ending it 7 = the characters in the film were good and you liked them 8 = the bad acting in the scene was annoying. But overall this movie sucked
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I remember having a really bad nightmare at this movie where I had to fight a monster that ate my face, a really nasty nightmare I have had since.   If you are trying to kill your nightmares, watch this movie with the sound off, no matter how much you want to look at the movie, you will never be able to look away.  It's the second time the director put a girl's name in her movie title, and it's the worst, I mean she has a girl-name in the movie? I mean I know she was a prostitute, I think that would be ok, but still a girl name for a movie... She has no personality whatsoever in this movie.    This girl should have been in her own movie, and not be in this awful movie, she has no charisma and you don't care about her, you don´t feel sorry for her.  I have seen far more bad movies in my life, than this movie, there are more bad people and far worse movies, but this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  This movie is so bad, it's ridiculous.  If this were a real movie, we would see the director throw a real knife at the camera to make it look like the monster has been attacked, because he really wanted the audience to believe that he really killed the monster, but it's just the actors.  When you are watching a bad comedy movie, make sure you take a pillow to your head, you won't be able sleep.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst movies I have ever seen was called ''Ghosts''   which was released in 1992.   It was directed by Robert Siodmak and starring Robert De Niro and Paul Giamatti.  The story was about a woman who finds a body in a swamp and begins to investigate.  And she ends up in a world of ghosts and supernatural things. I was watching it with my older brother and we were both screaming from the beginning.  He said there are some things in it that are really scary.  I did not find them.  It is a very bad movie.   So what are you waiting for?  Please make a movie.  If not now at least in the future.  If it will scare you, then please watch it.  Please do not think that you need to watch more horror films. I mean, it was just a bad one.  If you know a good movie then please share it with others.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So that's what I learned at the time, you know, I had gone into this film with high hopes, you can see that in the film itself. What I experienced was not only disappointing but also in a way I found really funny. I mean, to put it bluntly, it was too bad. The film, while not as bad as the trailers made it seem, was also far more generic and generic looking than the original movie, which was one of my favorite horror movies growing up. The movie did at least have a decent story, but what I found it really lacking in, was really good performances. I would say that this one was one big waste of time for me, a wasted opportunity to see the original film and enjoy it.   If you're looking for a decent horror movie:     If you're not looking for one, then this one may be alright for you.  (   )
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The trailer for Star Wars: The Force Awakens was great:  The film is so much better than that trailer.         This is a great movie, and I enjoyed it greatly.  I am not a Star Wars fan, but I am a fan of this film.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is that I do not see how Star Wars will ever be a top-grossing film again, but there's no denying that this film is a lot of fun.  In fact, the last couple of films in the franchise have been downright awful, but they were still fun.   Star Wars has always had a bad rap. I think it has to do with the lack of originality. They could make the films even more original. There have been countless Star Wars movies that could take place in the Star Wars galaxy.  The trailers don't tell the whole story:  There are three films that are completely original: Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, and the current Star Wars. There are not three films which make up the same universe as Empire or Jedi.  Star Wars is an expansive universe, so there are at least four or five films that take place across the galaxy.   A good film should tell the story in a different way, and give you a different perspective on the universe.   I'm not sure how to do this in the first two films.  If you watch the trailer for Return of THE JEDI:  You know that there are some similarities.  A little something you didn't see coming.  Now, when you watch The Force Awaken:   It's like watching your brother take his last picture at the beach and then find a really great photograph in it.  There is a strong sense of mystery.  Even though this film was made in 1998, I feel like it was made at a time when there was a lot more excitement about the film world than there is today. I thought it was very exciting.   Star Wars:  This was a much more interesting film than the first film: The story was far more complex and interesting, and it was far less predictable.  Some of the characters were very different, and they had interesting backstories.  While it is true that this is a prequel, there were still some plot threads that were interesting:    It seems like this movie will focus on Rey's mother.  She is not a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have never seen a worse "cinema" movie in my life. It was simply bad.   The movie was about a family that has to move to a new city with a new baby, and while I know it is very typical, I still found it to be very frustrating and confusing.    It was almost as if the director and writer had no idea what they wanted to do with the plot and simply wanted it to appear realistic and interesting.  And if you don't get that, then you have an issue.  I have to confess that I wasn't very good at writing a review.  But I couldn't help but say this:  The only thing I really enjoy is watching crappy movies and then watching the crappy movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I was first introduced to "The Princess Bride"  I really liked the movie, but soon became disinterested.  When I saw a new movie every few years, I kept wanting to see it because I was just as excited as the audience, but not nearly as entertained.   As I was nearing the end of the "Brunswick Triangle"   it was time for a new adventure.  The Princess Bride is probably my favorite film of all time, and is a perfect combination of fantasy, comedy and action. The movie takes place in the "Verdant Valley"  and is set in the 1920s.  One night, a group of friends set out to avenge their dead mother.  While waiting at the crossroads, they are attacked by a group known as the "Frogmen", a band of bandits who steal horses from their owner.  Once they steal the horses, the Frogmen lead the group to a hill known as "Troubadour's Mountain".  There, the group encounters an old man who calls himself "Mr. Butterfield", who they are to meet at the house of "Mr Bigglesworth", who lives in "Biggleswort".  The old man tells them to meet him at the big house at noon that day.  Upon arriving at Biggle's house, they find that the house is empty, so they are immediately confused and ask where the people who lived there went.  They are told that they had a baby.  Later on, "Mr Butterfield" is revealed to be Mr. Biggelsworth, who tells them that he has been hiding this for two years and that the baby is a "wedding present" that he plans to give to the bride at the wedding.  Mr. Butterfields daughter, "Miss Marple" is not sure what he is talking about, and wonders why she has been called "Miss".  It is revealed that she has come to this wedding as the maid of honor because she is a member of an old noble family that has been married off to the "Widow's Head"  the highest class in society.  She has never been with her true love, and as the wedding nears, she begins to doubt her love for Mr. B., and even considers suicide.  On the day of the wedding, Mr. Marple learns of the frogmen plan to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a damn shame that people give this film such bad reviews, because it's an excellent film and the movie is well produced. The story is about a young man, named Robert 'Dawes' Smith, who was born with no legs. He is a poor man who is sent to be sold to the Indians in exchange for a horse that he would never ride. The Indians in the tribe have a strange fascination for 'walkers', which is a common term for those who are missing limbs. At the end of the film, we discover that Dawes is a human being who had been experimented on. A terrible thing happened to him, but the movie does not provide any answers. It leaves that part of the story open, but in a somewhat confusing way. There are some disturbing scenes of mutilation and torture that were very well done, but it's not exactly clear why Dawe was experimented on and how much he might have been forced to do to himself. There is also a scene where Daweson is tied up with a horse's tail and hung from a tree. That kind of scene would have been completely unnecessary. The movie does give some answers as to what happened to Daween but in an almost confusing way, and the ending is a bit ambiguous. If this film had been shown as an educational film, it would have had a more effective effect. It was a shame that it wasn't released to audiences who wanted to see something different, and that people were given the impression that it was just a cheap horror movie about nothing more than 'disappearing people' with no explanation.  A scene of a person missing his legs. It is suggested that they were amputated by a tribal healer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought the DVD version and I was amazed at how good it was. The acting was terrific and the story was gripping. The special effects were amazing and the music was great! I loved the ending and the ending was just what I needed!

It's a shame that it isn't. - August 27, 2009What a GREAT ending!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A man who watches and re-watches a bad film and then comes back and tells everyone how good it was.  I have no problem with that; it's the way you get attention and you deserve it. My problem is with people who are so offended by anything that doesn't go along with their social agenda. "A Man Who Watches a Bad Movie:  I don't understand this line of thinking, "they" are the ones who do the talking; the real "they". That's just your typical progressive mentality that wants to keep everyone else in their place. They want to keep you in your place, which is "out of touch". You've been "out there". And to put a stop to this nonsense, "a man who sees a bad picture, decides how to view it:  There are more than a few movies that don't live up to the hype. The film The Shawshank Redemption was a critical darling, but the box office was disappointing and critics took offense to the fact that there were no good parts for the prisoners. Even worse, the script that was given out as a part of the film was written by a woman (Angela Lansbury), who was only playing a prison guard who couldn't get her own way and so was forced to work for Mr. Red (Jack Nicholson), who had been a prison warden before (and as such was a man of questionable morals). The film is considered a classic, but if you think that's reason to hate it, you've missed the point. Shawshanks Redemption is a movie about redemption and the prison system and how it has allowed one man (Red) to see his life for what it is and the lives of other prisoners (and the world in general) for what they are. He sees the value in his fellow prisoners (at least for a while) and decides to do something about it. If he had simply been one more prisoner looking for redemption, he would have found his way there by now. We are told that he does change (he kills the Warden, but not the inmates, and does try to help them), and he decides to show the inmates who are his friends what good it is to be in a free society. That is the real message of ShawshANKS REDEMPTION, and that message is something that any man would benefit from, but sadly, the film has been tainted by "those" who are offended by it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first 20 minutes are great.   A group of boys are playing in a field, a fire is starting, and they want to get out of there.  A man named Jake is in the field and tries to get the boys to come out, but they refuse.  They fight back until they become separated and Jake gets the boys killed.  When they are revived, he tells them that they were his friends who were also killed.   When he is talking about his dead friends, it is funny.  It's also not long before he gets into the story of how he killed them and how he is now a super hero who can fight his way back to freedom.  He's also got a gun.  The story is a little convoluted but I'll give it a pass since it is part of a trilogy.  I found the ending to be a little confusing.  Also, the reason that the boys want to escape the fire is because they heard the voice of their dead friend.  But why did they think Jake was their friend?  There is an important question.  Why does a kid like Jake think he is a hero?   What is the significance of that?  The rest of the movie is a lot of action with the boys trying to figure out why they were taken.  The movie is good.  At the end, there are a couple of unanswered questions.  So there's that.  What can I say?  I loved the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie I thought about watching in a long time is now lost in time.   This movie did not have a good ending, but that's my opinion.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not sure how to sum this movie up other than to say it's one of those movies that had its potential to be great but was just too boring. The story had a very interesting idea and I do think it had the potential to have a very decent ending. But it never really got there. The pacing was great throughout the film, the plot was never convoluted and there was a nice mix of humor and emotion.   This movie had a lot of potential but it just never had a chance. It's just not what it needs to be to be a great movie.  I'd give this movie 3.5/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (no need to write any negative, but I have a bias). "Lethal Weapon" is a terrible movie. I was so disappointed after I watched it. First of all, the movie has no plot. It has no theme. I mean, you could say that this movie is "the story of two men with a bad case of bad luck." Sure, the first film has a theme of "survival," but it isn't anything interesting. It's a very boring movie, I had to watch this movie twice just to get over this. I know that I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. This movie has a few redeeming features, like the music by John Krasinski and the action by Robert Forster. The action was great, the scenes are interesting, but the movie is totally ruined by the music. The music is awful, I am ashamed to say. I don't even want to talk about the acting, because that is really just awful. The acting sucks. The movie has some good scenes, like when Eddie and Ray come up with an idea to save a man from drowning. The scene was cool, but you know that there will be more of this crap in this movie! I have to admit that I thought that this was going to be a really good movie, but it was really a total waste of time. If you don't want to see another terrible movie, this is the one for you. Just don't watch it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My first impression was that the plot was weak and the characters were flat. The movie starts out with one man on a motorcycle, talking into a small handheld recording device that gives the impression he is talking to himself. He is the guy who is supposed to go find his daughter, but she has vanished, and he decides to search for her on his own. In his search he meets a girl named Rokka, who has disappeared along with her friend Mina, a girl who was taken by a man with a magic gun named Sari.   Rokkatsu is a manga that is only about 4-5 volumes long and is currently in a "lost" condition. The author has been in a coma and the translation is done by a manga translator named Takashi Yoshimura, whose translation skills are terrible. His translation is also poor, as is his lack of knowledge on the Japanese language. The plot is very predictable and has no surprises. There is no real development in the story at all, only some pointless action scenes. The art and animation in the movie is not good at all. The characters are poorly drawn, and the character designs are too similar to one another. This movie was made during the era of early 3D animation, and it looks cheap.  To be completely fair, the movie has some decent animation, especially when the main characters are flying.  One of the worst things about this movie is that it does not have a good ending. When the movie ends, there is an ending credits sequence which was not very satisfying. It was a bit of a let down. This is my second experience with this movie. The first one was not as bad, but this one had some flaws. This may be a good idea for older teenagers to watch. I do not recommend this movie for younger people who have a very low threshold for stupidity. Posted by Mark Graybill at 3:29 PM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The thing about movies is that it can be hard to find a good one that works.   I like to read reviews and give them some credit.  The people at moviepilot.com are the best I've ever seen.  And I'll always love them for getting the word out about movies that aren't great but deserve it.  The one complaint I have about the movie is that the ending is a bit too abrupt.  It might have been better to cut to a scene at the end of the movie, after the "I'm not sorry you have cancer" speech.  I know some people are going to have a lot of trouble watching this movie because it's so long.  But it's a great movie.  If I had to pick one movie that helped me come to terms with my diagnosis, this is it. Posted by Jennifer Poul at 12:34 PM No comments:

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The one thing that the average moviegoer notices the most about a movie is the music. Music is one of the most important aspects of the movie, and the more the better. If a movie has bad music then it doesn't matter that the film is mediocre or not. If the music in the film doesn't get you excited, then you'll probably go see it anyway. If music in a film gets you really excited then you're going to enjoy the movie. In order to make sure that the music that's used in a movie works, you need to listen to that music in all of your favorite movies. If you don't like a music track in a certain movie then you should find a way to find something better. In this article I'll look at the ten best horror/thriller/sci-fi horror music tracks to use in your movie. The 10 best horror music pieces to use. 1. Creepshow (1991) 2. The Strangers (1998) 3. Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) 4. Paranormal Activity (2007) 5. The Final Destination (2006) 6. Alien (1979) 7. The Craft (2006): http://youtu.be/6aU-K3hf4tU 8. The Exorcism of Emily Rose (1973) 9. Scream (1999) 10. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) - 10th Anniversary Edition (2002) - 12" Vinyl LP (S/N 935-1) 1. Creepsht (1991):   Creepshow has one of my all-time favorite music tracks, and one of Frank Zappa's best too. Creepface is one long scary scream, and it's pretty freaking cool. Creepmusic.com (also called Creepshow.com):  Creepface - Frank Zappazzo and His Orchestra (from Creepshow, 1991) Creepshow is a Zappa tribute album with some of the musician's best, including Frank Zippa's Creepface. Creepshows.com  Creepshows and Creepfaces are the only places I've found to buy these Zappa albums, and I've only seen these albums at the Creepshow show. You'll also find some of Frank's other musical works at this site, including  The Mothers of Invention  (Frank played guitar in their band),  The Mamas and the Papas  and  The Beach Boys  music.   2
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    And here I was thinking that a bad review only counts against one. It takes more than that to make a film a bad one. I love all kinds of movies but the only movies that I know as good as to warrant a bad mark are the ones that are really awful. And that goes for the directors too, not all of them are great, and not all directors that are great are bad, just as not all films that are bad are good. And when the film you are watching is bad, you don't really want to be part of the movie. You're just hoping to avoid the vomit, and if there is a vomit, you want to avoid that vomit. The only good thing about movies like this is that the actors, and especially the actresses (and maybe a director?) are good enough that there is no vomit, but you still have to try to avoid it. The best I can say is that it is a movie where you are glad when you are not watching the vomit. It is just a very bad movie. No other way to describe it. (hide spoiler)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a rough year for indie films, but a lot of great things happened and many of the best were found through indies. We were thrilled by The Orphanage, We Need To Talk About Kevin and The Babadook. But the year ended with a really disappointing movie from the festival circuit.  As a child, it was always an emotional rollercoaster for me as I grew up. The story of two sisters is so powerful, but in hindsight I guess it doesn't have to be. It's just the way I felt about that story and that time period.    The other movie we enjoyed this year is The Last Face, but it was directed by a man who made the Oscar nominated The Pianist.   Another movie that we are happy to have in our list of indie hits is An Unfinished Life. This film is a horror, and we love to watch horror films and we also love to have fun while watching them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       When I saw the title "Eyes Wide Shut" I immediately assumed it was a Kubrick film (I also thought it was one of his final films and that it was his last film that really had a story to it), but I knew from the very first trailer for this film that it wasn't.   It wasn't bad, it was good, it just wasn't a Kubrick movie (despite some good performances from the cast, it still didn't feel like one) and it certainly wasn't one of the best films of all time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't think there are very many horror movies I enjoyed more than this one, at least at the beginning. It is very good-paced, with a lot of the action taking place in the motel rooms of the survivors (mostly a bunch of young women who have found each other in an abandoned motel), the action is fairly well executed, and the ending was a lot more satisfying than the others.   However, there are two major flaws in this film that will make you cringe.  First of all, the acting is pretty bad. I know, the genre is supposed to be for kids, but it seems to be taking a back seat, and when the adults are acting like teenagers, it is especially noticeable.  Second of all...the ending.  So the movie picks up and we start to find out the details of the "incident". A guy gets killed in the hotel, but nobody seems to know what happened. Everyone just assumes it was an accident, so no one gets in trouble with the authorities. The only person we ever see do anything bad is the killer (whose name is never revealed), who gets himself killed while fleeing from the police.  The survivors have to stay in the same motel for a while while they are searching for the killer. They soon realize that the killer is their old friend who died in the "accident" and now comes back to kill the women who abandoned him.  We quickly get to the hotel room and see that the murderer is an old man who has had a very long history of mental illness, and is obsessed with a TV show that was never shown on TV: The "Maniac Mansion".  The women of the motel are the main characters. They are all mentally unstable and are obsessed with the "Mansion", as they call it. They have lost everything else in life, and they want to see it again, and also, they are addicted to it. So in the beginning of the movie, it doesn't take a lot for you to hate this cast of characters, but as the movie progresses, it becomes increasingly clear to you why they are so angry and resentful of all the other people in the world, and especially in the film. They never accept that they are losers and that they will always be "the unloved ones". They also never seem to grow up and change their ways. The women all seem to have a secret life that is "better" than everyone else, and

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is really bad and not to mention one of the worst I've seen in a while. It doesn't even make sense and I just wanted to put it on a shelf. It's just a bad flick with a lame plot and not a lot of action that will scare the shit out of any fan of horror. This film is a complete joke and I cannot believe they even made this shit. I have seen a lot worse in the last year and it's really disappointing when a film like this gets made. Why did they make this crap?   It was made by a company called "Viacom International Productions" who I have never heard of and never heard that they make "horror" flicks.   I guess I was expecting a horror movie with some gore and a bad story but this film is more of a comedy. The acting is very lackluster and even the actors are not good in this flick.   So basically this movie is supposed to be a comedy but it's just not funny and it really gets a bit tiresome at times. The writing and the dialogue are so bad in this film and it makes this movie less funny. I really cannot recommend this film to anyone. I would recommend this movie to people who hate comedy or comedy films as well as people who are really sick of horror movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have to say the best part about this movie is the first 3 minutes of the trailer where the bad guy (the cop) is holding a gun to a girl's head.   They made this movie about a cop who had to get out of this place (prison) but then he was drawn back in.  He finds out that the man was in the wrong place at the wrong time and he can't let a chance of a shootout go by.  Then he finds out they have an undercover agent (the girl) who he knows from his work and that he is going to kill her.  Also the movie is about the guy who had the problem with his daughter's teacher, and then he had to help her and she becomes his friend.  At this point there is no suspense in this movie, and I love the fact that they didn't give the guy any chance to prove his innocence.  It is almost too easy to get a big grin on my face.  Even the best movies have a bit of cliche or bad story lines in them, and this was no different.  One of the most hilarious scenes is when the cop is taking the gun out of the girl's hand and he accidentally fires it by mistake and shoots himself in the foot.  They should have never put him in the situation, and made him shoot his own foot! My Rating: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You know, this movie didn't really do anything. In fact, it was probably a waste of time.   "Mama's Boy" didn't make a whole lot of sense. I didn't find a whole bunch of interesting things going on.  This movie was just a rehash of what's already happened, with some new things thrown in and some lame dialog.  What's even worse:      The ending of this movie really made me mad.  It was like a slap in the face to a whole slew of women who are in the movie, and the way they got out of it is a slap to all of them.  They all left the mansion and went to get into the car together, and then, all of a sudden, it goes out. It just makes me sick, so I don't understand how this movie ended the way it did.  In fact it just seems kind of random to me, and completely unnecessary.  The whole movie made me wonder if any of these women had left the scene together, because no one else seems to have left.  No one left. The girls in this movie are always just in one place, and in one car, so they can drive around for a while.  This really felt like a bunch of women getting into a car and going to a place together.  Even the movie says so, but how is that even relevant?  And if this were the last movie on the movie series, wouldn't this have been the end, because it would be a bit silly for them to get out of the car, go to the next location, and leave it all in one movie?  If they were actually going to get in a car together and get to where they're going, why all the hassle?   Why didn't they get in the car?  They should have just stayed at the mansion.  Then again, I don.t think I'd have much sympathy for this woman if she didn't want to go to this party, and I don?t think anyone else would either.  There's another movie called "Mommie Dearest" that I've seen and reviewed a couple of times in the past, and it's a much better movie.  I really like this movie, but I'm sorry that it doesn't have the success of "M.D.".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You are being a negative dick.  There are many reasons why we watch bad movies.    Some of them are laziness, others are ego, some are pure laziness.  This is why I love the old days, when you would buy a DVD on a Friday night and come back the following Saturday with a whole pile of movies you haven't seen.  It was a great time.      I hope you enjoyed the post, and thank you for reading, for any feedback, questions, etc, feel free to write me a message.  See you next week. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've been watching it since it was shown at film festivals, and I never saw it in theaters. The last time I saw it was at a house party, and when I walked into the bar to get a drink, I saw my friends had already ordered a case of wine, and the bartender looked at me like, "I thought you were on a date with our manager." I didn't say anything, but the entire night I thought he was a terrible manager and that I wanted nothing more to do with him. That's how bad it was. He was so out of touch with reality that he was making decisions like he was in charge of the White House.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had an amazing time at The Oceanaire. The OCEAN and OCEANAIRE are really nice in terms of service. We were in and out in less than 2 hours! We had a great time, great drinks, and even got a good view of the beach from our table! The menu is very reasonably priced as well. I would go again in a heartbeat. It was a good time and I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal.  This is a classic old school spot - classic ambience, classic food and service. You'll get a chance to enjoy the view of a sunset on the beach - not to mention a fantastic view of Ocean Beach. For the best view we went during their happy hour (3-4pm). The waiter came by every once in a while to check on our drink orders. We always got water for the wine list and he always had a drink or beer for our drink order. This was very good and we enjoyed it. Service: Great. There's a good mix of staff. You won't feel rushed. I got a glass of wine at happy hour. It cost me a lot but it tasted so damn good. Overall, a great experience and I'm sure I will return. .
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Please don't be that guy who thinks there's nothing worse than a movie that's bad.   I know this might seem trite or corny, but when a bad film comes out and you have to sit through it, it's actually kind of a blessing in disguise.  What it means to be a "bad movie" is that you know that no matter how many times you go back to it, you'll still find things to love about it.  We love "Bad Moms" and "The Hangover", so we should love it even more than "Bourne".   Don't feel bad, the next time you find yourself in the "movie theatre" it might be a blessing.  The "bad" part is that this is a movie about a family that takes a trip to the Philippines, then they return to the U.S. on the same day for a family reunion.  In case you don't remember that part, it involves a father that is dying, a wife that is taking care of the children, a mother who is leaving her daughter for a good life, a brother who has become a criminal, and their parents who are also trying to make it work.  For the kids, it will make a good story because it's about a dad who has no kids of his own, a mom that is still a housewife, a sister who is a stripper, and a brother that is a thief and a murderer.  That's how I picture the movie, anyway.  The story is very much about making the family work together. The brother who was a thief becomes a "man of God", and is very successful in his work. The "good" one is an idiot, but his wife doesn't like him, and they don't have a strong enough relationship. The mother leaves and her brother takes over as a father figure, and is also very successful.  So we have a group of people that want to do good, but they're trying to work together when it's difficult.  It's like a big, messy, dysfunctional family.  A film like this is so well done because it puts all of those ideas into one movie and makes them really come together.  These are all themes we've heard a hundred times before, but this movie puts it to music.  I want to see more bad movies, because they all do the same thing: they teach us about life,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's not good.  It would not be in my top 10 movies of all time.    A very good movie with a great message:  In a time where it is easy to just take your anger out on someone else and not think about the consequences of your actions.  The reason that this movie is in my opinion is that people of today have become so angry that they have lost their humanity.  But, if you are capable of seeing the world as others see it, you can realize that you are not the only one to feel angry.  This movie shows that.  In this movie a group of people are put on trial for a crime that they did not commit, but they are the ones who get on the cross of God.  They all have different reasons to make up the story about what happened, and it shows that sometimes you have to look at things from other people's eyes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When we saw the movie we did think that was one of the worst movies ever made. The only problem I found with it was how the actors did their voices.   One of the best things about the movie was that it had so many actors and we were never bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I think this movie is better than The Other Woman (or The Woman Who Loved Tom Jones, for that matter), but I think that it has a far greater potential to be good.     In all honesty, I had high hopes for this movie, and it actually exceeded my high expectations.     The main idea for this film was an idea I had not heard before.  If The Women was the story of a woman who is so unhappy in her marriage that she decides to leave and go off with a wealthy man, this movie would have a very different tone.  The movie opens with a woman (played by a very pretty and talented actress, played by Kate Winslet) who, upon arriving to the country to have her marriage annulled, is greeted by the villagers with open arms and is told, "you've made a wise choice."  It's a bit of a "What's up with all the women going to France for divorce?"   The film does a wonderful job portraying a woman coming to terms with the changes in her life, and as we get to know her and meet her friends, we also begin to understand their reasons for leaving their husbands and becoming single.  For one, the young men are generally quite attractive, so most women have the choice of choosing between marrying the man, or living with him and having children, and the two choices are often not that appealing.  The women who have been married so long that they no longer believe in love are not nearly as interested in love as the young women (played here by Winstead, Jennifer Lopez, and Kristen Stewart) who are pursuing it.  In fact, Winstead's character is the most interesting. She has gone through quite a lot of pain and loss in her relationship with her ex-husband, but she is a very strong, intelligent woman, and she has an interesting plan to keep her child.  She goes to great lengths to conceal the fact that she is pregnant and to take her own life by drowning herself in a lake, but somehow it works out.  It's great to see that this movie will not only portray a divorce, but also a young woman who has had her life radically changed by the change in the world around her.  One of my favorite scenes in the movie was when the young man (played, appropriately, by a rather annoying John Lithgow) and his fiancee (played a very charming
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You'll learn nothing from negative reviews of good movies.   Even if a bad film is good, it'll be a bad story anyway.   "I don't know what makes anyone want to see a good film that has bad music, bad acting, poor acting, and no good script, but I'll just say this: you will be disappointed.  This is a movie with no story, no plot, no ideas, just the bare minimum you need to make a bad one.  I have no idea what this movie has to say or even how it relates to anything. It just sits there like a fat man in a bathing suit, waiting for you to grab it.  In my opinion, it's probably the worst movie I have ever seen.  And I've seen worse films.  A movie that's only good because it has bad acting and bad music is basically a movie that will not stand the test of time.  " 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you've never seen the movie, it's based on an old book called The Great Brain Robbery. This movie is about a thief named Johnny Rock who has a brain in his pocket that is capable of multiplying itself like a virus and stealing from his victims. As he steals, he steals everything he can get his hands on. One of these things happens to be a beautiful young woman who is a jewel thief as well, and Johnny has to fight the cops and the police chief to get her back. This is an awesome film because it's so well acted and it also has lots of action scenes, which makes it feel a lot more intense than it really should have. This film was directed by Robert Zemeckis and he also stars as Johnny Rock.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Divergent is a flawed movie that fails to capture the magic of the book, leaving you with an overall bad experience."   I did not see Divergent.   I am not sure if this is true since there are many different people in different cities who read the book.   They have been talking about this movie for years.  I know it is a prequel, but I really don't know what the movie is about.  The characters are all in the same school and are getting in trouble by breaking rules.  My wife and I decided to watch this movie together, but we have never seen any of the books.  It was about halfway through the movie when my wife finally turned the movie off.  We both got the same impression.  This movie is NOT about the book or anything in particular.  It was very hard to watch.  If you are looking for a fun adventure to watch with your kids then this is a great movie to watch! It is important to remember that this movie is in the Divergent movie series.  There are over fifty books in the series.   I read the first book, called   Divergent  before I watched the first movie.    The movie opens with the students of the academy going to war.  They are fighting a rebellion against the government and the government sends out two agents to recruit the students into their faction.  In the process they are separated from their parents and have no idea where they are.  While traveling through the city they are hunted down and killed.  The plot has changed.  Divergent was about a boy who gets separated from his parents at an early age and grows up in a different area.  His parents are killed in a freak accident and he spends his teenage years alone.  By the time he is 21 years old he is recruited by a secretive group called the Divergence.   The group is made up of some of the most powerful people on earth.  Some of them even live with them and are protected as their sons or daughters.   These people are not the brightest, nor the sharpest in the world.  Their job is to create divergent clones of themselves and the rest of humanity will be the test of who is better.  As I said before there are different factions of students in each city.     This group was sent to Chicago to fight a revolution, and some of them have taken
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My impression was that there are many things about "The Book of Eli" that are well-done and executed. The film does an excellent job of exploring the relationships between its cast, especially its main couple, but this movie suffers from too much self-indulgence, which can sometimes get in the way of quality.   The characters, such as the ones in the church, have some good moments, but the movie ultimately turns out to be too self-important and lacks character depth.  You can download a trailer for "The Movie of Eli:  The Book Of Eli is available to rent on iTunes at the iTunes store and at the Amazon Instant Video store.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the interest of not having a film that's bad on my radar, I haven't seen The Hateful Eight. But it's coming out this year and I don't know if I'm ready to get into a film about a massacre. It's not a great movie but it has its moments. I won't watch it but I could certainly understand people who do.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really want to say this movie is an amazing action movie but it is a little disappointing. The story is great. The action is great too. The movie starts with the villain getting caught and getting caught up in a criminal conspiracy. His partner goes after the money he needs to pay his wife and child. They have a lot of enemies and they all want him. This is a very good scene. This makes me happy because it is just how criminals work. I like that you feel like you are in the middle of the action and you're not watching this on a big screen. This was great. This movie is awesome. This does take a turn for the worse.   After all of these criminals are caught, they are then taken to prison. They are put on a bus and transported from prison to a new prison. When they get on this bus, they do not have any money on them. The money they have is what they were paid. When the police arrest them for not having any money, they take their belongings and get on the next bus. As the bus passes by, there is a fight happening on the other side of the train tracks. The robbers are trying to escape. They run towards a train and the police catch them. When a cop walks by, the guy he is talking to grabs his gun and shoots him. He then goes after one of the robbers and they fight until they escape. At the end of this movie, I was really excited about what was going to happen to these guys. It was going in a good direction. They were going to get caught, get a long prison sentence, and then be sent to a place where they were going back and forth between prison and freedom. It is so bad that they all die. I think this is very sad. I do understand that they are being very sneaky in their criminal activities. They do a lot more then they should and it is making them look more like criminals than anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - I don't watch bad movies.   I'd like to watch the good ones more than I do.  If I want to watch something bad, I just watch something else, like the great ones ( like " The Godfather: Part II ", for example ).   My opinion is that bad movies are worse than good movies. The bad movies usually have a lot of wrong stuff going on in them, and sometimes I don´t know what is going on at all.  The best movies have very well thought out plots and good writing.  For example "The Big Lebowski" has the best writing I´ve ever seen.  And "Pulp Fiction" has a lot more plot and more character development than any other movie I've seen. If you have no idea what a good movie is, or if you want to see something bad for the first time, check out "Rudy".    - I don`t watch bad films. If I don`.t watch something really bad ( like a terrible bad film, an awful bad movie or a bad comedy film, or a terrible science fiction film ), then I watch something that really sucks and is completely uninteresting. And I watch bad comedies very often.  This is the only reason why I like bad comedie films so much.  I´d love to watch bad sci-fi films, but I haven't done so yet.  There are many bad movies out there, but these are the ones that really stick in my memory.  "Punch-Drunk Love" - I like "Rasputin" better than "Punishment", but I love the two movies in the same movie a lot.  Like many people, I love both films so very much. "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" - Because it was so long, I don\'t have the patience to watch it in one sitting. "Schindler´s List" - A great movie that never got enough attention.  In my opinion, it was the worst Holocaust movie.  It's too long and there are so many bad parts. It would be a really good film if it was shortened a little bit.  Most of the scenes are about the Nazis taking a shower and how good they look. And one of the Nazis talks about how he got some Jews from the gas chamber and how he had to shoot them to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are a newbie, then you probably think that a negative movie review is easy to write. After all, it's just a movie. The problem is, it will ruin your movie experience, so you might as well just avoid this review. It's not like this is something new.   It's a very old trick.  I got tired of writing negative movie reviews because of this reason, and then I found another reason. I used to write negative movie, then I got bored. Now, I am happy for all the movies I watch because there are usually good movies.    My favorite is still "The Dark Knight."   I guess I'm not that great with movies anymore.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only movie I saw with a negative rating (that was also my least favorite) was  The Godfather.   It was awful.  I was disappointed.  It reminded me of my early years of watching Raging Bull.  I'm glad they remade it as  The Untouchables.  The characters in the movie are so far removed from my childhood.  They all act like they're so much older than they are.  There's so much action in this movie. I don't even care if they actually kill anyone.   My mom actually said this movie was "just for kids" and she was right.  The acting is so bad.  My favorite thing is that they always have the character who's in the center of all of this "scary stuff" yell "Get out of my way!"  I'm not even mad  (well, maybe I am...)    The soundtrack is also terrible.  And the actors all are just horrible.  This movie was a train wreck.  Like a movie where everyone dies after the movie ends.  What a trainwreck!  You're going to be sad when this movie ends!     A good way to end it!   My husband has seen every Star Wars movie in the movies!  I love Star Wars.  The actors in this were so bad in this that I don�t think I've ever laughed harder at any movie.  The actors are just so awful.    They're acting like idiots in the first movie.  In the sequel, you get to see the entire cast as well as new ones, so why not have them all act?    This is a very good movie to watch for a family movie night.  If you're looking for a bad comedy,  The Office  is also great.  But this is a much better movie. How good was it?

However, this one, with its great artwork and fun puzzles, will satisfy any gamer's need for a break from the more challenging games. It has great music, funny animations, and even an optional language translation (which is very helpful for me, as I speak Japanese). It also has a great bonus puzzle that you will likely find yourself thinking of as you play. It is also a lot like the puzzles from the classic, Super Mario Brothers, game!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a good movie, and the director, and producers have put in a lot of work in making a good film. The story is very well told and does a good job of showing the evil of the evil empire and the good that we all must do to fight it. There's a lot going on in this movie that I wasn't able to find anything negative about. The acting is top notch, the special effects are amazing, and they use the time travel to a nice effect. Overall, a good story that is well told.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    1   I do not believe that it will be a good movie or a bad one, I do believe that at least it has the potential of being a great movie, but we will have to see if it will live up to that potential or fall down.   2   The film has a lot of potential, it has a great soundtrack, and it has some great action and drama in it.  However, there were a couple of problems with this film: 1. The first half of the movie, the film starts with our main character, who is a police officer, investigating a murder.  There was a lot more to this story and I wanted to know more about this person, but it feels as if they could have added more if they had wanted to.  The second half of this movie was just a rehash of the first half.  2. The violence in this film was pretty strong and graphic and it was very over the top.  In order to sell this film, it really did not need to be that over the the top, there was so much violence and gore that it just was not needed.  3. The plot to this film wasn't very good. The action scenes, while cool, didn't make me interested in the plot.  Overall this film had some good action scenes and some pretty good suspense.  It was definitely a good watch, but not really a very good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (click image to enlarge) The second thing that struck me about the film was how much it reminded me of The Breakfast Club. It was that strange combination of youth-rejuvenation-revenge porn that, in the mid-80s, became an underground sensation. The film's plot and characters were all-too-true. There was that young writer who got kicked out of his high school because he was too "difficult."   The group of high school seniors who all want to be famous for a certain cause are treated like a pack of bullies (I don't really remember any names off the top of my head). The group is all too eager to be on the center of the story to get their revenge against one of the people they feel wronged them.   What I don't like about the plot is that they don't seem to see the good in anyone (at least they don' t seem to be doing this in the book).   This is where the film deviates a bit from the book.  The third thing that I liked about this film was its visual style.  There is no music in the film. I'm not really a big fan of this (as you can see from the film review I wrote at the top) and the reason I don' give a lot of stars to the visual style was that I felt like they were trying too hard.  In this film, we get scenes of a young woman with big natural breasts in the pool, and a group of teens going to an abandoned house for a party with big doors and big mirrors in it. I was disappointed that the director and/or the writer thought there was a need to make the film look cool and hip when there was nothing cool or hip about it.  The music in this film is so soft and pleasant that I can hardly hear it. The sound design is also a major concern. I didn't like the opening credits, and the ending credits made no sense to me.  So what I think we need in a film that is not a musical, and not a film with music is good dialogue. The dialogue in this movie was pretty good and kept me interested.  But there were too many things about this movie that just didn't make sense. It seemed like there were so many things to be done that the film lost itself in the process.  And so what I do hope that this film does to us is help us
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    *   It was a horrible movie and I hated it. I felt like I was watching a bad Lifetime movie.   I hate the movie  and I'm sure you will too.  My rating:  **** I would say "It is like a Lifetime movie if Lifetime made a movie where Lifetime characters go on a date".   "It is a Lifetime Movie"  What's so bad about "The Girl on the Train"?  The story  It's all about a girl and her boyfriend getting married.  She and her mom leave and they take the train from New York to Chicago.  I'm not sure how that train goes over a few snowy mountains.   How do they get from New Mexico to Illinois, but they still have to go over a mountain?  How are the train operators going to get the train in the snow?  They are late because they have to get on the tracks.  You think someone from a family would understand.  They take off a few times when it's snowing and they finally stop at a place called Rockford.  That doesn't make sense.  The guy is in a wheelchair.  Where does the snow come from?  It all makes no sense at all.  Is this the most romantic movie you have seen so far?   They say a guy and a girl are getting married at the end.  Is that what they were talking about?  Maybe a little.  But why would someone in a train want to go into the mountains to have a wedding?  Wouldn't this make more sense if they said "This guy is late because he is being held hostage by someone"?   Who's going to make the call when a train is late?   Are we getting to the point where someone will be held hostage on the train? And the train operator has a heart attack when she finds out that the train isn't going to Rockford?  Is she going to die because of a heart or is she just going to have the heart attack because the guy has to get off the train and leave?  "I love you baby. I want to get married"  How can they be so stupid?  I couldn't find a good explanation. It didn't make any sense. The girls are so dumb.  This is what Lifetime is. It's like watching a TV show.  And the movie was just really dumb.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For any of you who like horror films, this movie will scare you to your bones. The film is good, the special effects are good, but the story line leaves something to be desired. I would recommend this movie for the horror fans only. The acting is good in this movie, but it never gets good or scary. The special effects aren't that good either, the characters are never developed, they act just as they did in the previous movie, and they are just not scary enough for my taste. If you like horror, then this movie should give you a decent scare. There's a good bit of humor in the film, but I felt that there was just a bit too much of that. This was my favorite horror film that I have seen, but if you aren't a horror fan this probably isn't a good movie for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The second half of the film is a bit of a letdown. There is little that feels original. The music is a little too on the nose for my taste. The acting is pretty good in the first half, but falls off a cliff in the second half. The plot, while decent in theory, is way too convoluted for my tastes.  It is a film that really should have been a trilogy. The first half feels like a movie that was written by an 11 year old who only watched horror movies in his room. The second side, while a nice change of pace, really lacks any sort of impact.  A couple of minor criticism: The film does a pretty poor job of capturing the look of the actual '75 film. While there are a few places where the film gets a little closer, the majority of the movie looks like a generic Hollywood production. There are a couple of shots in the film that actually do have a vintage feel to them, but they are nowhere near as impressive as the shots in  The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974).         In the end, this is a very good low budget horror flick that should keep you entertained. It is worth a watch if you are looking for something to watch with your kids.  The story is interesting, and the acting is very good. It does feel a bit out of place for horror, but the cast does a nice job of making this look like a campy western.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There were a couple really bad movies that were released in 1999. One of them was The Secret of the Nao (which you might remember as the film where the bad guy's girlfriend and baby got kidnapped) and another one was called The World of Nao. The two movies were not as good as you might think, but I found them to be entertaining. However, this review is not about these two bad movies. It is about one of the worst and most pointless movies of all time, "The Prince of the Sun". In this film, the main character, Sun, is a prince that lives on the moon and wants to return to earth to see his family. He meets a little girl named Lucy, who asks him to make her a dress. Sun decides to return, but first he has to conquer his demons that have tormented him throughout his life. The first five minutes or so are actually good. It's the later parts where the film gets really bad that made me stop watching it. The movie starts with a very well shot story about Sun's return to Earth. We watch him riding through the sky on his horse. We see Sun going to the temple, and then he meets an old man who tells Sun that if he will bring a bride for Lucy, he will be granted eternal life on earth. Sun is pretty excited to marry Lucy, and the old man even gives him a ring that will enable them to have a long and happy life together. This leads Sun to believe that he is finally ready to return home and he is all excited. The rest of the movie is basically the same story. Sun and Lucy have a few happy days on the earth. On the night that Lucy tells Sun about her past, Lucy's father suddenly died. She went to the old wizard and told him what happened. The old wizard told Sun that it was Lucy's fault and tells him that Lucy is the only thing he needs to fulfill his dream of becoming a prince on Earth. Sun gets very excited to return and has a lot of fun doing so. However while he is enjoying himself on Earth, his evil brother, Sunus, sneaks into the house and kidnaps Lucy. Lucy's dad goes to find her, and Sunus kills him and takes her. Then Sun returns and murders Lucy's mother and everyone in the village. Sun goes to the wizard who tells him what has happened, but then Sunus gets in and says that the whole thing was a setup
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So, how was the film?   I really enjoyed this movie. I think that the film's main flaw was that it had nothing else going on but to keep you on the edge of your seat trying to see what would happen to the characters. I enjoyed the film immensely, especially the performances, and also found it interesting to observe the differences between the two girls and the characters within the movie. The film's themes were a lot of fun to look at, and the story also kept my interest as well. It didn't have the story to be a mind bending story like "The Tree of Life" but it still had the themes and things I found interesting to watch. I had a lot to think about throughout the film and also while watching the movie, and it all came together in a good way, so, I would definitely recommend "The Red Tentacles of a Good Man", and if you don't mind, I think you may enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a movie that can not be recommended to anyone who has not seen it before.   For a movie which is rated "R" for "R-Rated" you'd think they had at least put in a couple of more seconds of actual sex.  I have seen several movies and I've never seen one that didn't have sex. Not one.  In fact, I'm amazed that this movie has been made with so little action. I'm just amazed that it actually managed to make me go to the bathroom and wet my pants for a couple minutes. The movie is called "The Nudes."   What they had to do was have two nude pictures of the actors in a magazine come out.  Instead of showing two pictures that are a half inch or less apart, you have a picture of two girls with no clothes on.  Why is it so bad?   Because all the girls are about 9-12 years old.  It has no girls in their late teens and early twenties and even none of the girls who have been married.  Even worse, the actresses were all too stupid to know what they were doing with these pictures.  If this were a movie about two girls, it would have been rated R.  The characters are pathetic.  They are a couple that can't even get it up to take a leak.  This movie was released in 1973.  These things happened a long time ago and they've had plenty of time to learn.  And they've never had sex in a movie in my life.  But they did, in real life.   The movie has a lot of sexual innuendo and nudity.  There are scenes where the characters are wearing clothing.  You know what I'm talking about.  A girl is dressed in a bikini, a boy is dressed as a girl, and a guy is wearing a rubber suit.  Then, a woman comes out of the toilet and says, "You've been in the toilet for three minutes.  So how'd it feel to have a guy in a rubber mask come out and rub your breasts?"  That's exactly what was done in the movie.  That would be an example of bad taste and that would not have been made a long, long time back.  Now, here's a movie with no sex, no nudity, and no sense of the ridiculous.  Here is a story about a couple who can't get it

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If a film is bad, and you love a particular scene in the film or the character performance, it is easier to write a negative comment about the film in general. I have seen many movies, many great movies, that I have loved, and I have hated them. But when I was viewing the film, I was absolutely horrified. I knew it was bad, because I had seen it once in the theatre before. I had forgotten how disgusting it was, and the scene was just too shocking. I was completely horrified.   I cannot watch a movie I love again without going into a full blown mental state. I am ashamed to call myself a film-lover, because this film has ruined my enjoyment of movies for me.  My review of the film is below.  It is not necessary to watch this film in order to enjoy the film. This is a good movie, but I was thoroughly disgusted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      There's nothing worse than seeing a movie that didn't work.   This is just an example.  The film has a nice premise, but it never develops it enough.  It doesn't really have an identity.  At least the story is interesting.  There are great performances and great cinematography, and the ending is nice.  However, it's hard to get your head around this concept.  This might work for a few years, and then be forgotten. But as a horror movie, I'm not sure that it could stand a chance.  I think this was written by a horror writer who just couldn't get out of his own head.  I feel that this was probably written for a movie theater and never got made.  Don't bother reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If there's something wrong with something, I can tell you about it from the beginning.  If there is something right with it, I will only find out from the last few minutes.   The reason why I don't write negative reviews about a movie is because I can't get enough of it.  It's the same with my reviews of music albums. I love this album so much that I can spend a whole day just thinking about it. If you ask me why?  It might have to do with the fact that I listened to this album when I was 17 and I was so obsessed that it made me want to die!  If you read my last review of a song, you might have heard that.  This album, in my opinion, is much better than 'Hail the Sun.'   I don´t know how, but it works and I am glad.  To be honest, when I think of a band, my first thought is always about how good it is.  They make me think of my favorite bands from the 80´s and 90´s.  Now let me say this is not my favorite band, but to be honest this is the band I think about when I am listening to the new bands coming out.  The sound of the album is incredible! The drums are not too loud and the guitars are not muddy.  The lyrics are really good and they explain in a really simple way what happened with the girl.  And if you are a fan of this band, I strongly recommend you to buy this album.  For me, this album is more of a listening experience than a recording album.   I highly recommend that you listen to this music and give it a chance.  It has some of the best vocals in the 80s and it´s just a shame that this was recorded so long ago.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you don't know who the guy in the blue shirt with the red vest is, you really should. He is the one in charge of the production and has a direct line to the director (and is often a producer). This is the film that made him a star. The film's director is not very good, and the film is basically a bunch of re-treads of old films that the movie's actors had already done a few years before. The movie is not bad, but the director did a bad job and did not have a lot of fun. The plot is very simple and there is some interesting stuff going on, but none of it is well developed, and most of the movie is a slow burn. This is a film about a guy who works on the island of Tannen. This guy is a former police officer (the main character) who was on Tannens Island for 30 years before the movie starts, and this is his story. This movie is based on a book by Jack T. Chick. The main character (also a former officer) is very nice and he gets to experience some real Tannenic island life. The whole movie has a very serious feel, and while it is a movie about a former cop, it has a really good mix of humor and drama. The ending of the film does not make a lot sense, and it does have a long list of problems.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     So I had gone with a different company for the night and while we were talking and going over some things the wife came back and said she needed to use the restroom. I grabbed the camera and went over there and took the picture. I heard a noise and looked back to see if there was a person behind me. There was not. The woman was just walking around the store with her head down looking in every direction. I was very shocked. She did not make a sound or anything else. I thought it was weird. It was only a few feet away from us but I had never seen her walk away with her hands in her pockets like that. I asked her how she could walk all the way to the bathroom with her hoodie on. I did not know what to say. She just looked at me with a dead face and said something I couldn't understand. I tried to go back to my husband and ask what was wrong but the woman grabbed my husband by the arm and began to pull him into the store. We were now behind the counter and she told him to "sit down and be quiet" then looked at him and said "get out of here and don't ever come back". After a little bit of argument I was finally able to push her aside and she ran out of the store without another word. After a few more minutes she came back in with two other women and sat on a stool in front of the counter. I got up and walked over to the woman that I had spoken with earlier and asked her if the whole situation was a prank. She said no and walked out the door. I went back to get my camera and took a picture. It made me very upset to see that I couldnít find the woman when she had walked out. So I came back out with the phone camera and began looking for her. I searched all over the store for about 10 minutes until I finally found her sitting on the stool behind the register. I made eye contact with her and she turned to look at me. I knew what I had to do. I walked over and grabbed her and started shaking her hard. She screamed and fell back into a seat. The other women started laughing as I put her down on the table. They both started to get up and go back into the bathroom. When they were gone, I picked up the phone and called the police.   They are still investigating this incident and a report is pending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoyed this one, but there was a part in the end that left me a little cold.    It was hard to get excited about it.      " You're not your father, I'm not your uncle, and I'm no one else than you."  The best part of this movie:    My favorite part of the whole movie.  This is why I watch these movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am sorry to say that this movie was terrible. I don't know why I didn't give it a higher rating. It had a lot of problems and I have been unable to watch it since I originally watched it last week. The reason why I chose to watch this movie is because of a quote from the movie. There is a saying that if it looks like a duck, swims like a shark, and quacks like a goose then it's probably a duck and if it's not then it definitely quacks and is probably a goose. I guess that's kind of true here. It is not a good movie. I'm sorry but I couldn't bring myself to enjoy this movie. It was boring. I could barely look at my monitor because of the bad acting and the plot was stupid. I can understand why this movie wouldn't work at a theater and that's why I went to watch the movie in a bar. It's like watching an old horror movie that didn't have the actors that made it a classic. I would love to see this movie on TV but I doubt I will ever see it again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     2.     - The movie starts off very strong with some cool action sequences and a good twist on the plot and the characters. The first quarter of the film has the story developing nicely and the rest of the movie is very fast paced and action packed. The movie has a lot of character depth and this is really good because it makes for a much better story.  - The movie is good but the story gets too complicated and it ends up being a little boring in the middle. This is really due to the characters being too similar to each other and it doesn't really add any much to the story. There are a few plot twists that don't really get explained and some characters don't get fleshed out. It is also very hard to relate to a character who only appears in the beginning of the story but later on becomes very important. This happens a few times in the movie and it is annoying. I found myself getting irritated by this but this is a problem with many of the films. The story gets interesting towards the end but doesn't quite make it to the very end.  - Overall, the movie has lots of cool scenes and exciting action scenes. However, I found the characters to be pretty cliche. I felt it was hard for me to relate with any of the characters especially with the story line being so confusing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   ...   -.. -   [2].. [3]. . [4]. -. - [5].  Reviewer: M.R.  Rating: 1/5  Picking up right where the last one left off, it seems that the two brothers who play them are ready to make a name for themselves as well. However, that fame comes with a price. The next movie is about their attempts to escape from the prison they've just escaped from, and how they deal with the outside world. It starts off alright, and it takes a while for this movie to really settle down in terms of how it's going to play out. But, at the same time, it doesn't take long for the plot to fall apart. I can't think of a reason for it to work, especially when the entire movie is built up to this. There are some other movies that could have done the same thing, and I hope that they do because I really enjoyed them. The characters, while they're given some development, really come off as very stereotypical and one-dimensional. I don't mind that, however, as it is what made them interesting in the first place. I felt as though they were meant to be a little more "realistic" and less comedic, but it just didn't work. Even though this movie is supposed to be about prison, it just seemed as though most of the time, the prison was something to laugh about. This is a movie that tries to make you laugh, but most of what it does is make you cringe.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You're being rude and trying to do damage control by creating another excuse, but just don't do it.  I don't need your pity and it's not my business what you think.   The way you worded it is offensive.  It's obvious that you don't like your ex. I'm not sure if you're using this to deflect your own problems.      This is really not a good place to begin your criticism.   I'd suggest re-watching the movie, or even the first three films if you've already seen it.   The first movie was a mess, but you can't assume that because it's a mess that it's bad.  Maybe the next one will be better.   If you want to argue about "bad" reviews, fine, but I'm done with that.  This film is not bad.   It's not a great movie.  But that's what reviews are for: to compare.  This isn't bad. It's an interesting look at two people's feelings about a relationship that can make you think about something.  The director was a very talented man.  For example, I think this film is brilliant and that his last film was also good.  However, this film makes me wonder how this can be good because of how much time and effort went into this film.  While you can look at this film as a way of getting to know the character of the ex, it's also a way to show us more about how one person can get to a point where they can't even look at their ex anymore.  There's a lot of stuff in this film that makes me question my own relationship with my ex.  As I watched the film, my thoughts were filled with how I could have done more to save our relationship.  A lot of things I did or said could have led to our relationship ending.  Even things I never thought about.  Some things I didn't even notice until now.  If that makes you angry, maybe your feelings are not valid.  So let's go back to the beginning.  One of the first things I thought when watching this film was about the relationship between the two leads.  They are very different people.  Both have a lot going on in their lives.  Their work and personal lives are very diverse.  Each person has a unique family, their own religion, and even their own sexual preferences.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     It's not even a movie but a "series" of episodes that all feature these two kids that seem so close to one another but they are not together. There is no relationship between them and they do not even interact with one another. The series doesn't go much beyond these two characters and their relationship. They do not have a lot of chemistry with each other but there is a "dark" side of them that they don't even acknowledge. They are constantly running away from things they don;t want to do or things that are scary. It seems like the show will end with them having a kid, a pet cat and their own life but it goes on forever and ends without much resolution.  A friend of mine once said that you should watch these shows and leave.  the only redeeming feature of these "series", is that they are a little less than awful. The story has some good moments that make the episode seem like an actual series and that makes you want to watch more of the episodes.  in the end, it's like watching a shitty show. It will leave you thinking about a few things but I don't think it would bring you any sort of satisfaction.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first time I saw that movie, I thought it was one of the worst movies I'd ever seen. I mean, it's a shitty movie, but it was so bad, that it actually inspired a scene in my favorite movie, The Last Boy Scout.    " You're really going to make me say it?   " Yeah, I do.  "   You know, there were times in my life that I was like, "Man, I can't wait to get back to that house.  This is my home. " "   So what's my home like?"   I remember thinking.  I'm an orphan, and I never knew my parents.    My dad left when I was really little, and he wasn't around a lot.  And I was raised by my aunt and uncle, who were just kind of weird, and they didn't really do much for me.  So I never got to see them grow up, and kind of miss them.  That was kind of like a way of trying to find some kind of family and being close to them. And they were really cool with me.   So when my dad died, I went back to living with my aunt, and my uncle and my family had been really, really supportive of me, and so I never really felt out of place. I didn't feel like an outsider at all.  My whole life I just felt kind of accepted and like an equal.  But then all of a sudden I was kicked out of the house. I got kicked out for going to a high school dance.  It was like all of the guys in my school thought I was a whore.  No, no, no!  I had just gone out there and danced for my high school.   I had done it to prove that I'm not a whore, and that I am worthy of being a dancer, and was accepted for it. But to this day, if anyone comes to my school, they see me, they're like,  "That's the whore!"     And when I go to parties, if I'm a woman, all of my friends are like, oh, you're that whore, you look like that whore.      But I have to tell you, the best thing I got out of that was my first boyfriend.  When I was 14, he came to my highschool
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved this movie.   The characters were well-drawn, and the story was intriguing and complex, not to mention interesting.  But it wasn't a great movie, in fact, it was an average movie. The story was boring, and there were times when the actors were off-model and the dialogue was choppy.  All in all, a very good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My rating (for this movie) - 10   This movie was supposed to be a movie about a black-and-white movie, but it turned into a disaster. The plot was really silly and it was a good way to test if a movie could be made by a black and white director. This movie turned out to be so boring and un-original that I feel I would never like it if I ever see it again.   - 9.0  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie: I enjoyed this movie, but I could've done without the scenes with the dogs. The dogs were not necessary and really detract from the movie. I found it a bit too "animalistic" for me. I guess a dog would do well as a part of this movie. If you were looking for a dog movie then look no further. I liked the cast. My favorite actor (and his wife) was Robert De Niro. He was also my favorite actor in "All About Eve". The movie is not an "Animal House", but there are a few funny parts that really add to the movie's humor. The acting was solid. The characters were well written and the plot was a bit convoluted. The movie's soundtrack is pretty well done as well. One thing I can say, it does not need to have the dogs in the movie in order to make this movie fun and entertaining. I really enjoyed this film, but this was not an entertaining movie. The cast was great but if you do not like dogs and have kids you might not enjoy this film. I would not recommend this to young children.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have always found it amusing when a film critic says something like: "My problem with this movie is that it has a lot of elements from a bad comedy". The problem, however, is that these elements all seem to come from a film by John Hughes. And they are all not the parts in which he makes his characters so ludicrous that they are ridiculous to the point of being ridiculous. So it's a comedy about a bunch of misfits who go through a series of embarrassments. The one thing in this movie which is genuinely hilarious is John Hughes acting. So we have this guy who doesn't care if his characters are stupid, inept and obnoxious - but he still thinks they are amusing. The other thing is that when they are having a bad time, they are being bad while their lives are in jeopardy. I mean, a lot is at stake in this story! And the thing is, most of the time it makes it all look silly. I don't care what it is, if they have a life-or-death problem, I'll take the badness over the silliness. This is probably why I have never really given a lot a chance. It's funny in spots. That being said, even if they're silly, it's so obvious they are not. The movie makes no sense, and that's why you can take it or leave it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   . You could be right, but it's still a bad film.    Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good Movie, Great Movie. I like to be surprised and I like not having my expectations met. I always like to have some expectations on what the next one will be like. This movie is more like a good movie than a great movie, but I liked it. I was pleasantly surprised when I read that the movie was written by Christopher Nolan. I liked the story, but the way that the story is told makes me wonder why it is being told in a movie form. It would be better to read the book and then watch it. This film was fun to watch, I enjoyed the action, and the actors did a great job. The thing that I loved the most was how hectic the movie became and how that caused the plot to go around in circles. This is one movie that you can't wait to see again. I had the best time.  1.05/5
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how much I'm kidding when I say I didn't even watch it but I'm not sure I would have if it was on Netflix. It was so bad it wasn't funny or good or at least I couldn't think of anything funny about it. I was just so mad at my family and my boyfriend because it made me feel so bad about them. I don,t understand why anyone would do this to anyone and if it really did make anyone feel that bad about their families, there are a lot of other things they could have done. I'm sure it would get a laugh out of anyone but it just didn't make me laugh and that was the reason I didn,t even watch the movie. I mean I'm a fan of it so I'll go ahead and say that. But I would never recommend it to anyone, especially not someone who has never even seen a comedy before. If you want a laugh and you're sick of your family and your boyfriend, then watch this movie. Otherwise, don't. I wish I could have seen a preview.  Rated 4 out of 5 by sissy from I saw this about a year ago on the new Netflix channel. I thought I had seen it all! This was one of those movies that you just know you're watching when it comes on. It's about a girl with a great job and a great man she loves. Things are looking up for her until one night she decides to get her ass kicked in a casino by a cocky and arrogant poker player who claims he can beat the best players. But it turns out he isn't that great and turns out to be just a small time guy who doesn't have anything in his life to fall back on except for his arrogance and his cockiness. But he's still able to make the girl fall hard for him and makes her feel that she is the only one who can take him on. She really takes this cocky, cocky guy on and she doesn't stop till he cums all over her face and he has blown a hole in her panties. My daughter watched this film and she had a similar reaction. She got so into it that she even got into a fight with one of the guys. It just made me so mad that in a matter of months, I just can't watch it anymore. She would love to see it but it makes me sick. But when it's on Netflix, it's always good for one
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A terrible movie.   I was not prepared for this.  I did not expect the final product to be this bad.  The plot is a mess, the characters were unlikable, and most of the movie was just a bad dream.  It was supposed to be a horror movie. But this movie was a nightmare. I would not recommend this film to anyone and I have to say that it is my absolute least favorite horror movie of all time. If you have never seen it, please do not waste your money. I just hope this movie does not make it's way to Blu-ray as the only way I could see it in a theater is with another horror movie in the theatre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would like to mention that this review is for the movie "Mama", and not the movie that it's based on. I'm glad that this movie didn't work out, because I feel that the movie could have been good if it had been taken seriously. The movie focuses on the mother of a retarded boy who is not able to speak or move on his own. The film shows the mother's frustration when she can't do anything for her son, but he continues to live in a horrible, depressing and miserable home. Her main concern is the relationship with the father of the boy, but she is not really concerned with the boy's welfare. The mother continues to abuse the boy even after he is able to talk, but her actions are more disgusting than ever. It's not a pretty movie, and is filled with awful acting and characters. I can't recommend this movie, it's not worth your time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never saw the movie so I don't really know how bad it was or if it was even a bad film. The acting was horrible and the plot was kind of lame. The cast was all very forgettable. The story was kind to hard to follow, there was way to much exposition and not enough story. The ending was also way to cheesy and forced. I never wanted to watch the movie again. The only reason I watched this is for the music. The music was like the score from a crappy movie. It was over the top and stupid and I couldn't get into it. All in all I thought this was a bad idea and I'm glad I didn't watch it. See also: The Bad Movie (1995)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My father died of cancer. A few months later, I learned of his suicide.   I never believed my father was responsible. I still don't.  I remember the funeral in June. I never made it to that one.  It was too hard, too painful.  The only solace I got was from a local priest who was able to attend the funeral and gave a powerful sermon. It has been a while since I heard that one, but I still remember the words of the priest.  My parents divorced when I was 9.  At the time I thought that was because he didn't like my mother.  He didn't. He was a very controlling man.  When my mother had been abused in the past by other men, my father seemed to think this was just an excuse. He wouldn't acknowledge that my mother was abusing other men. My father would say things like, "How can he do this?" or "He doesn't want me around anymore."  I was not allowed to see my mother or my father.  We lived in a small house.  There were no furniture.  One day my mother started to drink and the next she got so drunk she couldn't get dressed. I didn't know what to do.  "It will be okay," she said, but it wasn't. The next day, after she became so drunk that she couldn.t walk, the police came to the house to help her.  She was so drunk, the officer asked my mother if she was in any kind of trouble and she said "no."  When the officer left the house, I asked him why he was asking her. "Just ask her," she told me.  That day, I knew it was over.  After that, my life revolved around my father and my mother, my siblings, and the children we had with my mother's new husband.  To this day I am not close with my father's children.  Many people have asked me why I left my father for my mother and why I did this.  They were the only family I had. I was told that my father would beat me if I did not do things his way.  Because I had never loved my father, I was afraid to leave him and run away from my mother while she abused me.   I did run away.  Not once, not twice, but 3 times.  In my second run,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     "Why? Why?" is a very common question when a movie is terrible. Here's what you can tell a bad film from a great one. First, the film has to have some kind of plot. This means it has to make you think. Sometimes a movie will have a great plot, but it doesn't mean that you will be riveted by it. You will probably think "What in the hell happened there?" after a certain scene. So you want to know what happened and why it happened. The first thing you need to know is the plot. The plot is what makes the movie.  The Plot of the Film  There are two things that the plot of a film can do:  1) Show the world of its setting: This is what you see the movie about. This is how the movie can show what a bad place this is, how stupid the people are and what kind of people are in this town. It will also show how much misery and suffering goes on in this place. You may also see a lot of horrible violence and blood and so forth. , and more so, how badly the society is run.  "The plot of the film will be something like this: The main character (the hero) and the bad guy (the villain) will get into a fight (which you will see on the screen). The villain will pull out a gun and shoot the hero. Then the hero will get shot back. This scene is shown on the TV screen. Then a car will hit the hero and it will make a loud crash. It's shown on TV and it's horrible. The hero is being treated by paramedics. Then he goes to the hospital. The hospital doctor (the main character) will try to save the hero, but he will die. The main hero is lying in a coma and will remain there for a long time. The police will then get involved. The story is about how the police will try and find the bad guys. The movie is shown in the movie theatre in the opening credits.  It is a simple story. The villain gets shot because he had a gun that was loaded. The gun was loaded so that it would go off when the badguy pulled the trigger.  a little boy will then run up to the hero crying and telling him he loves him. This boy will die as well as the hero's father. This story makes you really hate this town and the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    * Don't go into it expecting a good time.   That's what I should have done when I saw this movie.  It's an average horror movie and has a few fun scenes but you'll be left with a bad taste in your mouth.  The pacing is too slow and boring and the scares aren't that strong.  There are some pretty good set pieces but they're pretty few and far between.  I don't think the movie will scare the pants off of you and will leave you with a feeling of discomfort.  At worst, it'll leave you wondering where the movie went wrong.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't know anything about this movie, but I saw it when it came out in theaters and I was blown away. I was instantly hooked because I had always wanted to see more of a cast of characters I thought weren't as interesting as the big bad bad guy. The characters were interesting, the actors were great and the story was great. There are moments I was laughing my ass off, there are moments that made me tear up and there are some very dark moments that were scary and memorable. This movie was one of the best of 2014 and I will watch it again.   Just in case you don't know what to expect, this is a sequel to the 2005 film and the only difference is that the movie is being made by a different studio (who didn't bother to give their movies a PG-13 rating) and it is rated G. I haven't seen the 2005 version, but even if I had, I wouldn't have any problem seeing the movie being made as an R rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       * This is a blog about what I saw and reviewed on the big screen in the past two months:  (I also reviewed   a couple of movies this summer).   To keep it short, I didn't like all of them, and some I liked a little better than others, but overall, the overall quality of my summer cinema was lacking.   Some of the reviews that I read said things like "This is the worst movie of the summer".   For the most part, they're absolutely right.  It's not as bad as most critics think it is.  The movie is just a bad story, and it's over way too quickly, making it feel like it was rushed.  There are some nice moments, especially in the finale, but there are also some really bad things.  Like the plot, the characters are boring and bland.  This film was meant to be a sequel to another movie that was very popular at the time (it was released in 1999, and if it was a good movie, I would have loved it).  If it were a good film, I'd be excited to see it again.  But it isn't.  I watched it just for nostalgia, and I enjoyed myself.  So I guess I can't really blame the movie for the bad reviews.  If you're new to my blog, you'll see that I usually don't post very many reviews of movies.  Just because a movie is bad doesn't mean I can write a bad review about it.  Here's what I did write about:  - The film I saw this summer was titled, "Super 8" by Steven Spielberg.  - My review of the movie: (spoiler warning)   * This blog is just for entertainment. I don't review movies because I'm trying to influence the opinions of others.  I review them because they were fun to watch.  For a long time, I've been watching movies just for the sheer fun of watching them.  As far as I'm concerned, any movie that has more than a handful of good scenes is just fine for me.  * I don. t really give two fucks about the directors, producers, actors, or script writers of the movies I watch.   I just watch for the fun of it, and the entertainment value is just as important to me as any other aspect of a movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched "The Devil Wears Prada" for the first time yesterday and was a little worried at first. It looked like a movie where the production design, editing and acting was terrible. There were many times when I didn't know what was going on in the movie or I found it very difficult to understand the characters. And this movie is not about just bad acting, but about the bad movie. This movie is actually just a bad and awful movie and I was not expecting anything more than that. I guess I was so disappointed in this movie because it is a remake of "Beverly Hills Cop" but with a few different scenes and different plots. If I wanted to see a bad acting movie, I would've watched "Candyman" which is just a really bad movie in my opinion. This is just not a bad bad movie, this is a very poor movie and it could've been really good if the actors did a better job. It's just really hard for me to understand a movie with such bad acting.  This review may contain spoilers.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a film that I don't think I would've seen until I saw it on the big screen with my own eyes. It may not be the best movie of the season, but it is certainly one of the most original and different from what I would expect from any of the other genre films that are popping up. If you're looking for something out of the ordinary, this is it. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an unexpected and unique movie. - November 18, 2015I've never seen anything like this
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     It's just a terrible movie. I don't think anyone expected a masterpiece, but I thought it would be something. But it's just just plain bad.   I think the worst part of the movie is that it takes itself too seriously at points. The characters, like I said, are pretty bad, but they should've been written with more depth. They were supposed to be the bad guys, but it's not that they're not funny or evil or whatever. It's just they never really get into it. They just want to cause havoc and do some bad things. That being said, they're just so stupid. It feels like they've never done anything bad, so they're even more dumb than usual. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The thing is, a lot of us grew up on this kind of stuff, so if you haven't seen this yet, just skip the first five minutes, you will see something that you have not seen before.   It starts with a good old fashioned horror/thriller that I found to be quite amusing, as it is about an astronaut who is searching for a missing scientist who has vanished under mysterious circumstances, and the scientists' fears grow with the number of people who are mysteriously vanishing too.  However, after that first 15 minutes or so, the film really takes off, and it really goes into space and time, and then into the realm of a movie about two guys who are searching for this missing scientist, and there are some really crazy things that they find.  It turns out that he really did go to the moon.  This film was shot on location, so there is a lot more realism to it that you might get from a movie made in the 50s or 60s. The costumes are awesome, and really look like it was filmed somewhere in the 1960s and 1970s. It has a lot in common with some of the stuff on the silver screen like THE EXORCIST, ALIEN, TRESPASSERS, DAWN OF THE DEAD, and THE THING. I especially loved the movie's climax, as they have this really cool set piece where they have all these space capsules and capsules of people being shipped up from different planets, but there is something a little odd about it.  It has the feeling of something you have seen in a science fiction movie before. So when we see this guy going down to the surface of the moon, there is kind of a feeling of "This is all too much. This is too much for me, and I need a little help".  All those capsules. I don't see them getting out. But it is what it is. They can't seem to go back.  If you are looking for a fun and entertaining sci-fi/horror flick that does not get too heavy or too philosophical, this one is definitely for you.  A good old-fashioned "space horror" film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In The Box    In The Box (1995) is a 1997 American crime drama, directed by Brian De Palma and produced by George Lucas. The film stars Morgan Freeman as a former gangster who has been given a second chance to return to the streets by his boss when the boss is murdered. When his parole officer is murdered, Freeman assumes the role of the killer and attempts to reclaim his old life. The story follows Freeman through a series of events, which lead him into a series criminal and personal situations that will make for a more interesting and complex film.   The film was a major box office success and went on to win several Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Freeman, and Best Adapted Screenplay.  The film was produced by Lucas, and released on July 18th, 1995. The movie is loosely based on the "The Executioner's Song" by Edgar Allan Poe.  There are some scenes that will be hard for some to watch due to the graphic nature of the murders that take place. I know that I will not be seeing this film again, unless I am forced to. I have watched every film they released after this one, so I am not surprised at this decision.  The Film: 4 out of 5  A very entertaining movie. There are no long, drawn out or complicated plot lines that make it too long. Instead, it stays in the thick of the action scenes, leaving the viewer to fill in the blanks with his imagination.  Freeman's performance as the killer is fantastic, and he plays the role with a very controlled anger, and a very violent and threatening voice. The violence in this film is very graphic, but is very well done in an artistic and realistic way. It is definitely the most violent of De Palmas's films, and I enjoyed it very much.  I found this film to be entertaining, and it was very entertaining. It's a great thriller that will get a good laugh from some audiences, and others will find it to be rather unsettling. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Why, oh why does a movie, even a great movie, have such an obvious theme of "we are all victims of something or other"?   In a movie like "Dance Me to the End", a story of love and heartbreak, it is obvious, but this one is a more confusing and ridiculous story of revenge, jealousy and revenge. I mean, do you really think that a whole bunch of people in America had the same kind of feelings as all of those people in France in 1789, or the whole of the Middle East in 2007? It is a weird story, and I'm glad that people have finally started talking about it, but that doesn't make the movie good, or bad.   A movie about revenge and revenge must have some sort of heart, which it doesn't.  This is a movie for revenge, and if it had the heart of a child or a crazy old woman, it would be terrible.  Is this the most ridiculous film ever made?   This movie has the most obvious themes.  If it was a different movie, a different era, a movie made to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution, it wouldn't be a problem.  It is just that the movie doesn't have any real content, so it is impossible to write a "review" of it.  Is that really such a terrible movie?  It just is a ridiculous movie.  There is nothing funny, or amusing, in this movie. Just stupid and ridiculous.  A lot of people liked it, and it might be worth checking out on DVD.  The movie is available online as a video on Youtube.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "This is a film that is both entertaining and disturbing. It is the first film to really tackle the problem of mental illness and the effects of the dark recesses of the mind."   —Dylan Meconis   A few of the film's most memorable images are those of two people having a conversation in a car, and one of them telling the other that it's "getting late", but neither of them seems to be aware that they're talking about the same individual. When they eventually meet face-to-face, we see that the person they've been talking about is someone they once saw dead. They're both confused, and they're both trying to remember things. It's easy to imagine them arguing, the person who is remembering what happened telling the person whose memory is fading, but it's hard to picture this kind of argument happening in real life. It would be very much like one of those "two heads are better than one" arguments that seem to come up a lot in philosophy books.   (2) What about the effects?   The film is mostly set in an area called the Red Line, or "Bloody Line", in a part of Detroit where drug addicts and their friends meet for a kind of party that never ends. The film doesn't make it very clear, but most of its violence takes place in a bar called the Folly. The film opens in a party where some drunken, violent, or otherwise troubled people are drinking, but before long, one of these people kills another in a "friendly" fistfight, and it's up to another person to investigate. The character who's doing this is named Tony, and he seems to have an unstable past, as if his childhood abuse and neglect had traumatized him, and perhaps made him bitter toward people who helped him escape from that life. Tony is played by Anthony Perkins, and his partner in this investigation is played entirely by Jeff Goldblum, the same actor who plays Dr. Charles Marconi in Contact. They soon learn that Tony's past is more complicated than they thought, as he seems aware that he and the other guy he fought were in the same bar, and that both of them were once addicts and addicts at that. The first time Tony meets Tony's new partner, he's also a drug user, and has an odd kind of PTSD about the things he used to do as a child.  Anthony Perkins, Jeff Gold-
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst film I have ever seen. It is the most inept attempt at being a horror film I've seen. Its a terrible, terrible film. It has very few scares and is a terrible movie. There is nothing on screen that is scary, it is very poorly paced and the plot is completely nonsensical. One of the characters has the power of prophecy and is able to predict the future. This one particular prophecy predicts the end of the world, which in my opinion, is ridiculous. It ends in a scene that looks like a scene from a horror movie, with a giant explosion and lots of blood. The ending completely destroys any horror I've ever seen in a movie. I also don't understand why it ends with a scene of a man being thrown around by the flying people. The whole ending just ruins the entire film and makes it look stupid.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really liked the first half of this movie. I thought it was a really good looking movie. The movie started with some good set ups of a character that is very annoying. When she is in her room, she says, "How can I be a real princess when I'm wearing this outfit?" I thought the movie got better with the character. I was disappointed with the second half. This movie is a comedy but at the end it is a mess. The ending was ridiculous, and all I could think about when I heard the music was, "Why couldn't they just tell the character in the second movie that she was a princess, and that it would be a very good movie?"  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    " "You've probably never seen a movie so bad that it makes you want to go back to the cinema and watch it over and over. Or so bad it makes people hate you." -   "This is a film that has been shot for the sole purpose of being hated." - Richard Lester,  The Guardian   There's only one way to get your head around this film:  It is not worth seeing, and it's only to be enjoyed by the most hardened film-goer. If you have the stomach for it, you'll probably enjoy it for a second or two, but after that you will find yourself thinking, "What the hell was that all about?"  What's most disappointing about it is how little effort was actually put into it.   You have your usual suspects (Ewan McGregor, Keira Knightley and Emma Thompson), plus there is some truly strange stuff in there (Diana Vreeland, John Hurt, John Cleese and Robert Duvall). The only actors who don't get a lot of screen-time are Vreeman (her character is basically a walking plot device) and D.B. Sweeney, who never shows up in the final credits.  There is a bit more substance than usual in the film.  It's hard not to think of the original "Honey I Shrunk the Kids" but the film looks and sounds so much more modern.  A lot of the film seems to be taken from this movie: - There's a scene in the middle where some kids are being abused by their parents.  - The end credits include a reference to the film's title.  But there's one thing I really dislike: the music.    The "C-Bombs" are used for most of the movie, and I really think that should have been the biggest warning sign.  The music isn't bad, but it's nothing to write home about.  I guess it's nice to hear it in the movie because it's kind of catchy, but when it's not used you have to think, "It doesn't really fit."  The sound effects are ok, but there are some pretty cheap effects like exploding heads and some cheap gore effects that look so bad they can't be taken seriously.  All in all, I give this one a C- because I didn't like it, and because I really want to hate it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    We should have bought a movie ticket instead of watching this.   We saw this movie because a friend told us to.  We really had no idea what to expect when we got there.  The only reason we gave this movie a shot was because we have never seen a movie with a plot like this before.  There were a few good parts about the plot, and the acting of the girls is pretty good.  One girl I felt I understood. The plot seemed a bit rushed, and there were some parts I didn't really feel moved by.  If I had to give it a star, I would give it three. It was a decent enough movie to entertain us with, but I would not recommend this to people looking for something exciting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "It had no heart"   -A review of The Crow by William Goldman (1936) "It was very good"  - A review of the film The Great Escape by Ken Kesey (1963)  "The movie was really terrible"  - A review by Bill Maher of The Room  (2003)   "I'm so happy I don't have a son. If I had a son, I'd teach him to use a gun. He'd be just like me."   The quote was attributed to Robert Mitchum in "The Life of Mr. Robert Mitcham" (1975), but it's been attributed to the actor at least as early as "The Robert Mitchman Story" (1927), which featured a short scene of Mitchum at the beginning of the movie, talking about "some things that children should know better than to know."  It may be that Mitchum had given the quote to Keseyo the Great at one point during the filming of The Great Train Robbery, where Mitchum is shown watching as the robber uses a shotgun.  Later, Mitchum said it to his daughter, and the quote became part of Mitcham lore.   In 1955, Mitcham directed The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.  In this film, Mitchow got to portray one of America's great heroes in the years after the Civil War. _____________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There is a very thin line between writing a negative and being a pompous prick about your movie. But there's also a very large distance between writing your own review of a bad film and being rude, obnoxious and ignorant. If you want me to hate your movie, make it good, or try to sell it to me, that's fine, but don't call me a jerk about it. My own film review is my own opinion of my own movie, and I try to be respectful of the work of others. So don't use your own experience as the basis for my criticism. If it makes you feel better to take a movie you saw with a buddy to the Razzies and be rude about it, so be it. I'll still have my popcorn to watch it with.

I always booked through their website, and I made sure to read the reviews. You need to be honest and you must be willing to be helpful if the customer asks for a recommendation, and if the reviews are bad, you need to offer a helpful review as well, because you are a friend, and you know your friends. I can't tell you how many times I have written a negative, and it still worked. Even with a negative rating, if you offer a positive review, the person will remember that you said so. I think the staff need to do a little more to make sure that their reviews are positive, because if they are, I guarantee that the film will get great reviews and will get many repeat viewings. If they keep them vague, I guess we will see if they will get a lot of repeat viewers. I have had some great experiences with this website, which I highly recommend. I don't know how many I have booked with them because it is usually all booked up, but I have enjoyed my movies more and the reviews and the customer service has always been outstanding.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's an average movie. There are better movies out there. They don't really put in that much effort into this movie. It's a cheap way to get an extra dollar on a DVD. Not a bad way, but it doesn't hold a candle to what's in the VHS or the movie theaters.  "Bite me!" "I'm sorry, I didn't know that you were a dog! The dog is not even in this movie, it's only a background character. What a crappy movie to get a free DVD for." (Yes, I'm being sarcastic here. It was supposed to be a horror film so it can't have some animals in it.) This is a movie you should watch at your own risk. This is not a movie to watch if you are at all scared of animals. The film is about a girl who works as a babysitter at a pet shop. Her boss is a crazy animal man who kills animals for food. After finding some dead animals in her van, she tries to get back the money the owner of the shop gave her, but she can't get the money out of the bank as she was short on cash. After a few weeks of trying, the pet shop owner pays back the shop owner's money and the babysitter gets her money back. However, the owner has a new pet, a very large white rat and he's going to eat the pet store owner's dog. Written by Anonymous

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I did not see this movie. I was asked to.   I know, I have never watched a movie until after it was released in a theater.  In a movie theatre, you must be able to hear the other people talking. This movie is on for two hours and thirty minutes and the sound from a movie theater is loud. I had a friend come with me and I was told by the theater that it was a 3D movie, the movie did not have the 3D.  The movie was great in a 2D theater. The 3D was like watching an animated movie. It felt like watching a movie on a television but a movie.  It was hard to keep my attention.  I was looking for any sign that there was anything else in this movie that was worth watching.  You had a man (Tom Cruise) who is trying to save a young woman and is the father of a little boy. The girl was named Ashley and she is a beautiful young girl who has fallen into a state of depression.  She was the main character. She is a great actress and she has an amazing talent. She was an action star when she was younger and she can play the part very well.  Tom Cruise is a very nice guy and he seems like he cares about his daughter very much.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie does not look good.    The film looks like it was shot in a poorly-lit theater with poor lighting.  The movie's actors do not look like they've been working hard at acting.  Even the movie's effects are not up to par.  1:25 am: I should probably be sleeping.  This movie is one of my worst, and my favorite, of the last few months.  At the very least, I could go watch "Shrek 2" before bed.  1:45 am: And now I realize that I can't stop thinking about this movie.  I could watch this movie again and again and have a new reason to feel sad every time I watch it.  2:04 am: Okay.  After a while of thinking about it, I realize I really enjoy this movie in spite of its flaws.  It may not be my favorite of the summer, but at least it isn't terrible.  There is just a lot of stuff in this movie that is just too much.  Like what?   2:22 am:  Now I am really enjoying this movie's flaws.   It's really the story and its execution that I enjoy.  3:04 pm: I was so bored in the beginning of the movie, and I was really hoping to get to know the main character and learn more about his back story.   Instead, this movie is so unoriginal and pointless, that I found myself just going through the motions.  As far as the acting goes, they were all good, but the movie really needed a better actor.  For some reason, the character doesn't seem to have the energy to do anything, and his performance never rises above the level of "ok, I'm not going to cry about this anymore."  3 and a half:  I'm glad I finally got this movie out of my system.  4:48 pm: Now, I think I really want to watch something else.  Aww, I miss this movie!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of my favorite movies in the history of cinema, and not only because it was a big part of my childhood, but because it is one of my all-time favorites. A brilliant, poignant, touching, emotional, and funny look at a lost generation, and a great film. - May 23, 2006One of my favorites  Reviewer: Mr. R - favorite favorite favorite - October 22, 2005  Subject: The story of "Citizen Kane" The entire movie is incredible, I'm not going to explain too much more than the main character, Kane is a really great, complex character who is forced to make the most difficult decision of his life. To go against his family and make a deal with the mob that will make him rich and powerful for his family. He is put through a lot of hardships but his character is still well-developed. The entire thing was filmed on location at an apartment, I really love how they used this location to bring out the atmosphere. It's just a great movie and it's worth seeing on DVD, I highly recommend. - October 7, 2005The story of ""  Sign up for our Mystery Movie newsletter and watch your TON of FREE movie releases!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   .  I don't know if there's a better way to describe it than:   "This is a terrible movie"  and "This movie has terrible acting" .  But, at the end of the day, I didn't have anything bad to say about it. It was a fun and interesting ride. I'd recommend it to everyone I know, and you should, too.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I hate the movie. I've heard several people talk about this movie and I can only repeat it, I hate it. This movie is not funny, there are a few good lines here and there but it's just plain boring. It should not have been made, it's an embarrassment to the horror genre.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (It's a "Bad Movie" with the subtitle "A Hard Rain's an Evil Rain"  or "A Rain That Cannot Stop"  .   In other words, it's about a rain that cannot stop.  ) The first thing that struck me about it was the fact that they tried to do a very clever thing with the camera angles.  Instead of doing a standard, wide angle with the rain at one side and a tree line on the other, they did it in the other direction.    They then did the same thing with two trees, with one close up and the other wide shot.  Now I know there's more to it, but for the record, here's the shot from the close up: It's obvious what that guy is doing, and I'm sure it's not all that difficult to get a close up of a rain and tree line.    And a more obvious shot of the close-up: Of course, in order to use it, you have to see it on TV, and even then, it doesn't look all that great.  (I think that's why they cut the close ups in the movie. )  The movie was not without its problems.  To start, the music was not exactly my cup of tea.  It's very slow, even for a film like this, and this is not something that I really enjoyed.  The acting was not bad, but I had a hard time keeping interest in many of the characters.  In general, they don't seem to have the depth that I want from a movie like this.  There were times that it almost seemed like they were just there for a scene.  I can understand that a lot of the character's lives are so boring that they don and wouldn't have much to say, but it didn't seem like much effort was put into them.  Again, the story was not terrible, but not something I want to be a part of.  For all of the negative things I have to say about this movie, it does show some good qualities, especially in the scenes where the storm is depicted.  These are the scenes that really make this movie worth watching.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You probably didn't like this movie or the first three, but it was the best film of the trilogy. The actors were so believable and I would love to see the trilogy all over again with a younger cast.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's kind of hard to put down.   Is this a good movie? I guess that's the question.  It has a good story, a strong story, and a great plot. It starts out good, then just starts to drag.    I'm not sure how much was planned when this came out, but the movie just starts out slow and slow, and after it gets rolling it never really gets moving.  The main bad guy, who is an idiot, is the same one in the "Tiny Toon Adventures" movie.  He is very much like the bad guy in that film:  He has a lot of personality, he makes bad decisions, and is too stupid to understand what he's doing.  You never really get to know him in this movie. He makes several good decisions, but that is all.  We're only given this guy's back story.  In this movie, all we know about him is that he killed his wife, so we have no idea what happened to her after that.  So basically, the movie tries to make him a hero by getting him to tell his story, but I found it really lame and not believable. The only other character in this film is the evil doctor, who doesn't appear to be a bad guy at all. I have to say that there are better villains in this world, and maybe the doctors in this story were the bad guys from a different movie. But you know, as the story goes on, I did get a little tired of these guys.  I was watching the movie, and I didn't even feel any sympathy for the doctor, but when I came to the end of the film, I still felt like I was rooting for these guys, and that they were the victims of some evil scheme.  Of course, the final fight between these two evil doctors was a really cool and suspenseful scene, and it was great to see that they did fight back. I just wish that this was the end.  Even though it's hard to give this movie 4 stars, I think I can't really give it any less than 3. I feel like it was kind of an okay movie. I'm going to give it 3.5 stars, because it did start out really great, and then just kind of went downhill from there.  If you enjoyed this review, please feel free to leave a comment below.  Thanks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved this movie because the writing is so good, so well acted, so smart, and so well written, and it's so fun to watch. I loved it because the acting is so great, and the humor is so silly and smart, you just can't stop laughing. I also loved it when they told the story through an interview with a crazy person, and then when that person did what he did, he made me laugh. I just loved it.   The review:  It was a Saturday night, and we had to watch a movie. We went to the first place we saw this movie on, and my friend said that he thought it was hilarious, and he thought the acting was good. We decided to go to the second place we could find it, and when we walked in, I looked over at my friend and said "This is funny. This is really funny." The movie was very well made, and I thought it would be funny, and a lot of people liked the movie. But my friend didn't, and there was a problem with his review. So we went to a movie, and found this movie to be hilarious. And it wasn't funny to us.  But here's what you are going to write if you don't like this movie: The movie is dumb and there is no humor. So this movie is a disaster. And a boring disaster. I didn't like it at all. I thought the movie sucked, and you are wasting my time with this review. But it sucked, I didn t like it, I thought you are a fool, and what you're talking about is impossible. Here's what happened:  It was my birthday, and on the day I turned 24 I had a "birthday party" with my friends. The movie: In this movie, you're sitting on a couch watching a movie on your cell phone. You're laughing at something, and your cell phones rings. Then you pick it up. It's your dad. And your dad says to you "You must've been really happy that day" or something like that. He says, "Your friend is a terrible guy." You say "Well I don't know, I guess he was a bit of a jerk." "And your friend is in prison now for doing drugs." You laugh. You laugh because the movie is really good, you are having a good time. You don't
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The script was a train wreck, the story was terrible, the acting was laughable, the cast was all wrong, the effects were bad, the cinematography was terrible and so many of the scenes were bad. The cast didn't have a good script to follow and it all fell apart.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best kind of review:  If you are a film critic, you should do as I say.  I know many people don't enjoy reviews but it's a necessary evil.   Don't forget:  It is the critics who get the movie!   Now if you're a film buff you might be reading this thinking:  "What does this guy know about film?   This guy is a complete jack-off!  He must be a total fucking moron." I assure you he's not.  He has been to film festivals and has seen films I can't imagine he would have watched.  If anything he's just a really passionate fan of cinema. He just loves to read about a movie he is excited for.  Now here's the important part:  You don't have to write a movie review, you can just show up and watch a movie.    Don't wait for a review, just show-up and watch the movie.   The more people that go to a movie, the better it is for the people who showed up.   In fact, most people who are really into a movie are the most excited about the show-ups.  But if you think you have to do a review then by all means give a review.  A review will not hurt your chances, but you shouldn't be wasting your time on the internet.  I am going to let you in on a secret:  I'm not a critic.  This is what I get paid to do.  When I go to film conferences and festivals and talk to film people, I'm there to talk about film.  These are people who care a lot about cinema.  For me, talking about film is like giving a pep talk.  The problem is when people think that by reviewing a movie I'm criticizing that film. You may think I'm giving the movie a low score because it's bad but if that is your idea of a review than you are doing it wrong.    If you're going to show up at a film and get a bad score for it, just say you are disappointed.  You did your homework and decided that a film you're really excited to see is terrible.  Tell the people at the table that you like to see a lot of movies, but it was the first time you saw this film.   If the person that was complaining got it right, make sure you
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am so disappointed with this film. There are no surprises, no surprises at all. I'm a movie lover, and I knew the story beforehand and I didn't care. I guess I don't like the genre. I like suspense, but this was just too much. The film is slow and the suspense is very bad. The ending is very disappointing because it seemed like it should have been a bit more dramatic. The story is a bit weird and I can't explain why, but there is nothing I could take away from this. I don`t like to be disappointed but this film made me angry. And I wanted to quit watching it after this. Don't waste your time with this movie. I'll probably watch another one of the 'toddler' films next time. If you want to write a positive review about the film:  The movie was okay. The plot was quite weird, but I didn`t mind it that much. This is a horror movie after all and the weirdness makes sense. The special effects are decent enough. The acting was good, but not amazing. I didn´t care about the story at all though.  If the picture on the box looks weird: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is what you get from a movie that tries too hard to be good and fail at it.    Best scene:  There's a bunch of them but my favorite has to be the end where we find out what's happening to the other girl.  The end of the movie was a really good one, and the whole thing was really intense with a lot of twists and turns.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you want to find out the facts on how Hollywood makes movies, see a movie about one of their most notorious villains, and then find out how they think of the people who make the movies, this movie is for you.  It is a fictionalized account of two movies:   the 1970s comic book movie starring Chuck Jones called "The Thing from Another World"   the 1978 horror movie called "Dawn of the Dead", directed by George A. Romero.  The "Dread Of The Dead" was a direct ripoff of the original "The Mist" by Terry Gilliam.   George Romero didn't even own the rights to the "Dune" universe, and they were a bit worried that he might, as a result, sue them for infringement of his copyright on the Dune book series.  "Dew of Darkness" was an adaptation of a comic book comic book called "Deathwatch" that was written by Stephen King and drawn by Mike Mignola.  In this adaptation, the villain is a scientist named Dr. Gurney (Brad Dourif), who takes a research expedition to the Moon and is taken hostage by a "space pirate" and his wife (Diana Earhart).  The space pirate and his partner are led by a military commander called Admiral St. Cyr (Michael Biehn), and they both want Gurneys secrets.  They plan to use a nuclear device to freeze him and bring him back to Earth to be experimented on.  Then they plan to do the same thing to the rest of the crew, to see what they would do, and to use the radiation to cure the radiation sickness of the ship's crew.  Dr. St. Croix (Tom Wopat), who was supposed to be the space pirate's wife, was also taken hostage.  Gurnev and St.Croix are killed, but the radiation causes a mutation in Gurneveys DNA that causes him to grow several feet taller, as well as grow an insatiable hunger for humans and the blood of those he kills.  To save his life, the scientists must use the space weapon to freeze his body until he is brought back to earth.  And while all of this is going on, St.Cyr and his men are still on board the ship, but they haven't seen Gurneey yet, and even though they have been ordered not to report, they are afraid to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I was ten years old my mother told me that the worst movie of all time was Citizen Kane. She said that the only thing the film accomplished was making it impossible for her to go to the movies any more. It wasn't until I was in college that I discovered this to be untrue.    At the time, I didn't know this for certain, but I began to wonder if there was something to it. After watching a few movies (including Citizen Kane) in the late 70s and early 80s, it was apparent that I didn a long time ago. I had always been under the impression that the film had to be terrible in order for the audience to understand the true meaning of the characters' tragedy.   The only thing that would help me understand Kane, was for it to be bad. I didn t have any idea what it was going to be like when I saw it for the first time, but there was a certain sense of dread and expectation. I saw the picture twice, and then I had a terrible dream. My boyfriend at the time (who I had only known for three weeks) and I went to the movie, and my mind wasn t able to grasp the film as it was intended to be viewed. We had no idea what we were watching, and neither did our boyfriend. We were left standing there in the theater, in the dark, in awe, watching the picturesque, well-crafted image of a couple, standing in a garden. I was so disturbed that I walked out, telling my boyfriend that I had had the worst nightmare, and that I was never going back to the theater.  I can still recall exactly where I was, and the name of the movie that I am referring to:  Kane. I think it is a perfect movie.  To be completely honest, I think that it is one of the greatest films of all-time. If you are a fan of movies (or of cinema in general) then you must see this film.    This is the kind of film that you have to see, if you don t know why:  The film opens with a very well-made chase scene.  The movie isn t exactly a good film, and it is not a bad one. It is a beautiful movie, but it has all of the problems that can plague a good picture.  It has a great cast, and a great director, but

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       The  first  scene starts with  a  motorcycle  across a field,  with  two  men  standing  on  the  other  side,   driving  into  meadow  and  going  slow  while  in  stealth,    which  is  pretty  puzzling,  as  you  would  think  this  part  wont  be  seen  until  late  after  it  has  ended.   If  we  want to  have  more  time  to  see  that  good  movie  then  let's  spend  most  of  our  viewing  times  watching  something  else,  and  I  will  help  any  one  who  doesn't  get  what  I  am  talking  about.

The first time I watched   this   movie   (that is   all   time   )   was   at   my   friend   s chool   where   we   got   a  copy   of   his   school   book   on   The   Story of  Hannibal  (or  Vernon   Jones).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only movie I have seen that didn't make me want to cry is "Liar Liar" by Quentin Tarantino. This movie is a masterpiece. It's a dark satire, the first and only one in the history of movies that made me want it to end. If you want to see a good movie about a good guy who has his identity stolen, don't let this one pass you by. I really wish they'd show this movie in theaters and it would have been a much better movie. I wouldn't change a thing about it.   I have been having trouble with this review because I didn't like it at first. I mean I thought it was pretty good but I didn' t really like it. So, you know, in hindsight, I'm glad I watched it. I would also like to apologize for all the other review where I talked about how bad this movie was. If I hadn't watched this movie, my rating would have probably been 5/10 and I wouldn' t have gotten a whole lot of feedback about it on other review sites.   But this movie's really great. In fact, I think that this movie is better than Pulp Fiction. You see, Pulp Drama is very popular these days. I'm not sure why. Why is it so popular? Maybe it's because it seems to have a special place in people's hearts. For some reason, we're all still in love with those movies. Pulp is always the first movie we watch at night after dinner, the movie that is played at the local movie theatre, and we watch it on the big screen. It seems that all we want to do when we're watching a movie is to watch it. If we don't want to think about the plot and the characters, we don' t even know what to think. We just want to watch the movie. So that's why people still talk about these movies. They are still very popular.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    And why? Because there is always a reason to write something bad and for a long time, nobody did it. I am not saying that everybody was a jerk, and I can understand why people do what they do in certain situations. But it was so commonplace for filmmakers to make a movie that was bad, there is no reason to criticize it.   I don't know where it comes from. The only person who has ever ever been a jerk about a movie was Woody Allen.  He has always been a guy that likes to get his way and if he had his way, nobody would ever go to see a movie again.  What? I thought he was great. I was a huge fan of his in high school.  Why is it okay for me to write a bad review about him?  What I'm saying is that every movie is going to be about something. There is a reason we love it. And it is usually about some kind of struggle.  The reason that this movie, by its very nature, is about so much more than a romantic story is because of what's happening between the characters.  This movie has so much to say about love and the idea of love, the idea that you can be so much bigger than just the couple in love. I believe this movie is a good representation of a relationship, and if you think about it, it is more than just a love story.  If you think of it as a love comedy, it gets a little boring.  A love story is about two people who want so badly to be together.  And in a love-comedy, they really can't even be together because they don't really know each other, so there is this gap, a chasm that needs to be bridged.  But in the movie, we get to see that relationship grow into something bigger, something larger, something that can hold up when it isn't being held up by the two of them.  I know I speak for a lot of moviegoers when I say this movie will touch you in ways that you cannot even imagine. I will go on record and say that this is a movie for the whole family.  It was directed by a woman, and while it does seem like she was mostly making movies for men, I can't deny the fact that this was one of the most important movies for me when it came to watching movies.  Because I loved watching the relationship grow and it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love to watch bad movies, and a lot of them are good. This is a bad one.   It has a story that is not believable. You have an old man who keeps coming back to his home town to get his fortune, and all the people in town tell him, "We will give you more money if you will only leave. You will be happier here." He keeps going back again and again. Then suddenly he does just that, and he leaves to live in the city.  What happened? He got tired of people who told him what to do. He got fed up with all the lies that people told him. And he left. How did he do it? He didn't die.  He moved away. How could he leave without anyone telling him why? Then, a group of people decide to come back and bring him back to the same town. He tells them his story and they give him a new life and a new fortune. I guess that's the "reality" of life.  The movie had a bad beginning and a bad ending, and the story was not believable in any way.  I know how to write a review for a bad film and this is it.  " You are your own worst enemy. And if you can't stand up for yourself, you should keep your mouth shut. "
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a waste of time and money. This was more or less the same movie that came out in 1996. The characters are more or more the same as in the previous movie, so it's hardly a good idea to watch it. The story is just silly, just stupid. The jokes are even more stupid. If there is any way to make the plot and plot development seem a little more realistic, that's how it ends up. This movie was made to make people laugh. No one was actually thinking about anything except laughing at everything. I can't believe someone would waste their money to watch this.  The soundtrack was atrocious. Nothing like a movie should have any music. You can just feel the coldness of the winter in the movie. It doesn't help that the movie was shot in such a cold winter that most of the people had a hard time even standing in freezing temperatures. If this were a horror movie, then the ending would have been even worse. The ending was just a joke and was a complete waste of my time. A movie this stupid just deserves to be watched by stupid people. I will probably never watch this again.   I think it's one of the worst movies ever made, but I'll keep looking forward to seeing it again. I still don't believe that it was made for money. This movie is on here for a reason!   The only reason I give it 3/10 is that it might have been a little better if they had just made a sequel. You can check out this movie if you want. But why?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      "The plot of the movie is the worst I've seen in a long time. If the main character had never met or heard of them, they would've been totally boring and unimportant. The actors don't seem to be actors, but are just a bunch of old and lame actors. This movie is one of the dumbest films I've ever seen. You'll never see a movie with so much stupidity in it as this one."   "The plot is the lowest point I've come across in a movie that doesn't contain some type of a plot. They didn't even follow their own basic rules of the plot, that it is supposed to have, and they're all over the place. The script was horrible."  "Why is it that you never see any of the actors again after the movie? What the hell was it about? Why didn't the actors know anything about the movie they were supposed to be in? Why is it only one actress playing all of the characters? Why were there two male and one female? Why was there so much exposition in the movie in the first half and so little in the second? Why are there two main characters and no other people? Why did the writer even have to tell the movie that the main characters were supposed be related?"  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you have a bad review about an episode of a movie or show you watched, please mark that review as a negative one.  If you do not feel like adding a negative and a positive review on the same topic, do not do so.  The "reviews" page is a good place to add reviews that are about the movie or episode. - What do you think about a movie?  - If you like a movie, do you plan to watch it more than once? - Do you like certain scenes of the movie? What is your favorite scene? / How well does the movie hold up now that it is almost a decade older?  The film was released in 2003. So does it hold up as well as it did back in 2003? When you watch it, does it still hold up? If a film is a decade or more older than you are, you may want to consider whether you want to watch this movie again in the future. Do you think the story holds up now? Do you find that there are still scenes that interest you? In regards to the film, it is a well-made film, a story that I enjoyed, and one that is very easy to see that the writers really put a lot of effort into it. A good rating in my opinion.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is about a man who has lost his wife and son after a terrible accident. The family is living in poverty. The young boy is becoming a drug addict and his mother has developed a severe mental disorder. He is forced to leave her home. He decides to make it to Alaska and has no idea where to go or how to survive. He makes it to a cabin, meets two hunters and they let him stay with them. He has to walk for hours and then the two hunters kill him. He was an easy target and the two men who did this are a bit cruel. I loved the way they were in this movie, but I also saw some things I wasn't happy with. At the end of the movie I felt like they didn't really believe in the character. He wasn't really that great of a character. They didn't show the aftermath of what he went through and how he is going to get over this tragedy. They did a lot of flashbacks, but there was little development of what happened to him before he died. This film is really sad. It shows the pain the family is going through and gives the character more depth. I believe it's a decent enough movie and I recommend it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was so happy to finally read this book, because I've been wanting to read this for years! I have always loved books that show characters dealing with the dark side of life, like    Gothic, The Lord of the Flies, etc., and while these books were fantastic, I've always wanted to read something that was more realistic about the dark things that life is like. I've read a few historical novels, but never a book from the Victorian era. This book is a really great blend of the two genres, and it's great reading! The characters are interesting, the story is great, and the story was just a bit too long for my taste. I thought the book was better after reading it in a couple days, but I still enjoyed it just as much as I did when I first read it, which made me realize that this is one of those books that I'll want to finish on a few different days. I loved reading this book. The characters were a little more like real people than they could have been, and I liked that. But I was disappointed when I read the book. I really loved the ending, but there were some aspects of the ending that just made me sad that I had to wait so long to read it! Overall I recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a more realistic Victorian book. There's so much to learn and see in it, and all of the characters are so interesting. I especially liked the character of Violet, who is a very strong and determined woman, but was also a little bit foolish. If you are looking for something that you will read and be fascinated with the characters, and want something that is great for adults and teens, you will love this book! It's very interesting, and well worth the price.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The Good:      This movie takes a lot of liberties with a story that is familiar in its own right, as a simple tale of two children who are separated.   The movie uses an old trope in a new light, as well as some new techniques that aren't seen very often.   There are some moments of brilliance in the film and you just might find yourself forgetting that this is the same story as the last two.  For some reason, there are a lot more things to hate than like about this movie.    This is just an okay movie, in my opinion.  The Bad:     It's a movie with a lot going for it.  This isn't a "franchise" movie, nor is it a remake.  But it is a movie that does have a lot to offer.  It has some interesting twists and a few great action scenes.   I don't want to give this one a low rating because it isn't an "average" movie.   But as the movie goes on, it has some problems with it.   These problems are small, but they add up to make the movie more of a chore to watch than anything else.   I think this movie would have been better if it were shortened a little.  The film would have benefited greatly from cutting some of the dialogue and moving some of some of these scenes around.  This could have also resulted in a much better story that didn't have some problems in it.  It's an interesting movie, so if you have the chance to see it, I would definitely recommend it. It's just a good story and a good movie. The Score:  7.0/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's not an epic, but it is an interesting adventure movie. The movie has a lot of good scenes and interesting dialogue, but there is only so much it can do in terms of plot and character development. In a lot ways, the story is quite repetitive. For instance, I loved all the little details about the place, the characters, the relationships, and the story. The only problem was the ending - and the ending really was a waste of time. The ending was predictable and dull, and just as frustrating as the beginning.   The most annoying character is the villain, the "God of Death" who was basically a mindless villain who did not really care about anything and seemed to be just there to be a bad guy.  I've never been that happy to see the devil.    There are no special effects in this movie - only a couple of great effects. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you've seen "The Usual Suspects" (1995), you know how that goes. The movie starts off with a killer at a bar (Bruce Willis) and then goes on for another 20 minutes to a guy on a beach watching his buddies drown when they're drowned. You think this might be a movie with a happy ending but this movie has a dark and twisty ending. The "real" ending is that everyone's dead because of a stupid mistake that was made at the bar. If you don't think about it for a second, you can see how this movie ends.   "The Hangover Part II" (2009) is the story of a drunken night in Hollywood with one of the biggest stars of our time, Brad Pitt. The other main character in this film is a drunken former police officer named Bob Arnie (Bill Murray) who has just gotten his job back. This is a great movie because it's funny and a lot of people were laughing at how dumb the characters were at times.  "The Hang Over Part II: A New Hope" (1979) You're supposed to be drinking in a bar and your friends are telling you that they want to have a drink together.  A "Hangover" sequel comes along and it follows the same plot, but it's so different. It was filmed in an "upcycled" warehouse by the same director that did "The Room" (2010) (2011).  I enjoyed "The Haddowes" (2006) (2009), and you should give this a try if you haven't seen "Boom!" (2004). This movie is all about a hangover and it's hilarious.  It's just a good movie.  "Million Dollar Baby" (2003) is also pretty fun.  You've heard of the movie?  It was a pretty big hit that also had some bad reviews. You should watch this movie if you think the movie is bad, but just go in and watch it.  I liked "Gringo" (2012), and I like the film as well because it makes fun of people that are obsessed with being "authentic" or "original."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you do, I'll delete it. This is an excellent movie that many may not know about, but will certainly enjoy. It has a lot going on. This movie has a wonderful screenplay. The acting is top notch. The cinematography is beautiful. The soundtrack is amazing. It's really that good. This film is very good, and if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it. It is available on YouTube for your viewing pleasure.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you watch a movie in a theater and think, "This is an awful movie. The plot was awful, the acting was terrible, the music was awful. I'll never go to this place again," just think how much easier it would be to watch your movie online.  - - -  SIDEBAR:  This is not a "Best of" list. I don't want to hear "Best movie of all time" and "Best action movie of 2015" and stuff like that. It's a "What's on your list?" list. If you haven't seen it, watch it. It'll do you more good.  it's not fair to those that did. So I'm sure there are a few folks here that don't know about a movie called "Memento." The movie, from 2000, is about a man who finds himself in a mental institution. There, he meets an old man, played by Simon Pegg, who starts to tell him things he doesn't want him to know. He becomes mentally trapped in his own mind. And then he starts to remember his life. If the plot sounds like a bad dream, it actually is. This is a movie that you'll want to keep your eye on. A friend of mine is a huge fan of Pegg and a huge fans of the Pegg movies. He called me from the airport, he's in a panic, he said, "You can't believe the time that we're in." I said, he says, "I'm a fan." He said, look, this is really cool. He just had a huge Pegg freak out moment. But he has said, the movie is a true masterpiece. It does a lot to remind you of what a horrible thing it is to be locked in a locked in place and be able to see yourself. And the end is just wonderful. I watched it again recently and it's a lot more intense. The actors are just aces. The soundtrack is also amazing, I just really enjoyed listening to it. If I ever have children I think I might have to teach them that it's okay to be crazy and that you can have crazy ideas. And that it isn't a sign of weakness. And it certainly isn't something that's a sign that you have a weak mind. So if I ever do have kids, I'll just say this: Don't be a crazy person, and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "If a movie sucks, you're going to love it"   And then we get a movie that is full of cliches and fails in all the right places.   The film doesn't go in depth in the story, and doesn't bother explaining the rules of the game, so I'll just leave it at that.  I was disappointed by this movie for various reasons: the acting is awful, the direction is terrible, and the plot is a total mess.  The story is told through various flashbacks, and is filled with characters that don't get developed and don't grow and aren't believable, in my opinion.  Also, the ending was very predictable and I thought I would see a different ending to the film, but sadly, I'm happy that it ended the way it did.  Overall, this movie is definitely not worth your time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When a movie is bad the way the script is written, the film is no good. It tries to be good but ends up being a horrible movie with the worst story in a long time. The film tries to take itself seriously as it follows a man (Paul Rudd) who is sent to a strange world and discovers he is an alien. A very interesting concept. He has some strange powers that are called 'energy' and that he can use in an effort to fix his spaceship. That's the extent of his powers. The plot is about his mission in this strange world of people who have gone crazy and the alien's attempts to help. The best part is how the aliens are depicted. There are some characters who are not at all good but they are shown to be so because they are insane. The only bad part of this movie is the script which was pretty much written by two people who don't know how to write and they only know how it is written in a comic book. There is no character development, there is no development of the main plot and there is a lot of sex. The characters are also so flat that they are uninteresting to watch. The sex scenes are very graphic in nature and not atall realistic.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        I was just listening to the movie, I felt so depressed that the ending was so bad.   The ending was just so bad and I was thinking that I won't see this movie ever again.  The movie was so stupid, I would rather do homework than watch this movie.  I thought this movie was really bad and it should be avoided.  Why should you bother to watch this? The movie is just so stupid and so it doesn't deserve to be watched, it's just like watching a bad teacher. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've just finished this movie and have to say, it was disappointing. I'd heard about it from other reviewers but I never thought I'd see this movie in person. However, that was the only reason I didn't give it a 1 star review, I was just so disappointed in this movie. It has the most generic plot I've seen, it has nothing that stuck with me and it is filled with all the typical clichés that Hollywood is known for. Not even a twist at the end! And they try to make it seem like it's a good thing but it is absolutely NOT! It was the least enjoyable movie I've ever watched. If you like a mindless action movie then you can probably enjoy this one. But even for me, I can tell that I would have given this movie 0 stars if I was able to watch it. The story of the movie didn't appeal to me at all. The pacing was off, the plot was flat and I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen. The characters were all just so bland and there was absolutely NO life in them. I don't know what the director was trying to do with this movie but he didn't succeed. I didn' t find this movie interesting. It was a chore to watch and I couldn't stand it! "Oh my God, this movie has it all. A girl trying to kill a gangster, a bad guy with a gun, explosions, etc. The plot is so over the top it could make a good action movie or even a thriller but it was more like a bad B movie. I wish I didn't have to see it again." - John P.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If a movie's not a good movie, then it's not the director's fault.  (I also make a big deal about this in my book "The Bad Movie Guide to Bad Movies") If you want to be a movie writer, read this book. If you don't know what a good story is, read on.    This is a book about being a movie director. The bad movies are what I'm about to make my point about. They're the ones that don't have stories, the ones we call "the worst" and not "good movies".  I'm a big believer that stories help movies to be good.  of the best bad movies: - "Tales from the Crypt" - "Clerks" - "(The) Sixth Sense" - - "Ghost" - (The) Last House on the Left - "JFK" - ("Fight Club")  If you're a director, don't just think about making a good film. Don't try to make a bad film. Make the best film that you can. Make a movie that a lot of people will like, and the rest will hate. The only way to get into the world of bad movies, is to make them.  in order to make bad movies  Make a story. Make up your story. Be as detailed as you want. Write a story that you want your audience to like. -If your story has a lot to say, make it a big movie. Don the audience to go through a lot. They'll be thinking about it for a long time. -If your movie has a great story, make sure the plot doesn't get in the way of the story. Don this by cutting stuff out. For example, the scene in "Ghost where they're going to bury the body" is in this movie, but if you cut it out, it's like killing the whole movie. I've said it before: Make everything simple. Cut out all the stuff you don´t need. For instance: Cut out the scene when the character sees his daughter and realizes that she's the love of his life, cut out all that crap.  the ending of "The Sixth Sense", that's why it was great for me. And by the way, the movie wasn't bad either. It was a great piece of work. -Make sure there is a twist. The audience will want to know what
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The Worst    A story is a beautiful thing:    ...you may or may not see the movie. In any case, the story is so compelling, even if you don't watch it, that you'll be able to relate to it.   The movie is about a man who's married with two kids and a wife who hates him. Their divorce is inevitable and it's difficult for him to accept it. After the two kids are adopted, he decides to spend more time with his daughter. The woman does not like this.   is a short film that tells about a couple in the 1990s. I think it's a pretty good short movie. The storyline is interesting and the characters are relatable. It's a short movie that has an interesting plot with good actors. The movie is a little bit too long for me, but it is not that bad. In the end, it was a nice short movie and I liked it a lot. I gave the movie a 2 stars because the movie could have been more.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    And yet, if I'd given this movie a chance, I might have liked it. In that, it shares an important similarity with the last great superhero movie, Iron Man. Both were a hit, a hit that turned them from unknowns to a household name. Both films are based on the same source material. Both have very strong female characters that are given the chance to shine. Both are very much "feel-good" films. Both can be seen as "dark" and "serious" movies. But what makes them different?   When I saw The Avengers, I felt a sense of nostalgia for the comic books.   As in, I read those comics when I was a kid, and I think they still hold up pretty well.  What was a hit with me at the time also seems to hold up just fine now.  While I think Iron Man is an incredible film, I would be hard-pressed to say it holds up at this point.  I'm not so sure that it's really that good, either.  My biggest issue is with the villains. The "darkness" of the first movie was largely due to the villains' utter evilness. The second movie goes away from that entirely. The only reason I can think of for that is the success of Iron Man, and the fact that this is a sequel film.  They don't really go that dark in the sequels, since they're so well known.  Iron Man: The Incredible Hulk   This movie has some interesting parallels to the comic book films. It's the classic superhero vs. superhero fight, where the heroes' powers and abilities are shown to be only temporary, if not completely useless. But it's in those moments of doubt and tension, in those last few moments that the film really comes alive. There is no more than a minute in which we see any of the villains actually use their powers. The movie also really captures how the heroes get into this position of "war" on their own. We get a brief sense that Tony Stark has started a war, and his powers come into play in a way we never saw before.  This is the only time when Iron Man really seems to "play the hero."   I also think it's the only place where the film goes so far as to truly take its time.  It doesn't just take advantage of the camera and the action. It uses it to slowly develop the relationships between the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never written one but I've always liked a good movie. It would have been nice to have seen the whole thing, but I didn't find it to be that terrible.   What was it like working with James Woods? Did he really tell you that the whole cast should be shot at the same time?  (laughs)   You know how I can get on James Woods' nerves? It's not that I don't like him. I just think that he's always looking to get a little extra attention.  To be honest, the whole movie was planned out in advance.  I was doing this movie, and they'd been shooting it and talking about it.  It was all planned out, and I would do an interview or something, and we'd work it out.  That's not unusual.  If it were, it would be like working for a politician.  But I know James.  He's a great guy.  When I first talked to him about doing a movie, he was very interested and I thought it was going to be a lot of fun.  We had a few conversations and I was just like, "Okay, I'm in!"   After shooting the movie, I just thought it would end up being a lot more work than I was expecting it to.  A lot of people like to do movies where they shoot them in one day.  And it takes a lot longer.  The most difficult thing is doing a scene with one guy, so I wanted it to take a while.  What I liked about it was the fact that we did it all on location.  There were a lot scenes where we'd be in places like Chicago and Los Angeles and New York.  We'd shoot the scene and we would shoot a little bit of music.  Then we would go out and try to find somebody to be in the scene, and it was a lot easier than it sounds.  Because you don't know who's going to show up and how they're going to act.  All of the actors did the same thing, so we would have a lot to work with.  You'd just have to go and ask them.  For some of the scenes, we did not shoot the music, we just shot people.  I didn 't find the movie to be bad at all, but there were a few scenes that just weren't very good.  As I was
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a sad fact that many times, people look at a bad film and just decide to put it on a shelf and let it pass the time.   When this happened to us, we were shocked and felt bad for anyone who had paid good money to see a film.  Unfortunately, that isn't the right attitude to take.  It is so easy to go out and buy a ticket to a movie and forget about it.  At the time, there was nothing to compare it to, but it would be hard to even remember the movie when you think back.  For this reason, we felt the need to let everyone know that there are so many things that can make a bad flick into a great film. One way is through great performances.  We were proud of our cast, and really enjoyed working with all of them.  The script and acting were great, and we were honored to be a part of a film that we felt represented us and our community.  To be honest, we have already watched the film several times, and it is still one of our favorites.  Even though we have not had a chance to discuss it with the director yet, we know that he had a lot of thought and care put into this film. We hope that everyone sees what an amazing filmmaker he is.  Sincerely,   The Black Rock City Film Festival Staff    What are you looking for?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I liked this film, but there were just way too many plot holes.   The main thing was the fact that she (the mother) got sick when she was pregnant with John.  He was a good guy and I really wanted him to be a good dad, but at the same time I really hated how he treated the mom.  I was shocked that no one from the family talked about it.  My brother and I didn't really think we would like the movie, but we were wrong.  It was very funny and I do like how the character was a little kid and had no problem with his dad, because in reality he was the worst guy in the whole world.  This movie had some cool special effects, and it was very entertaining, but it didn't make me laugh.  Instead it made me angry and I couldn't stop thinking about the main plot holes and the bad acting. I think that if a movie doesn't work in terms of plot it should never be made and I can't really say that this movie succeeded in this regard.     This review was very helpful for me. I felt a little lost while watching this film. My favorite movie was not even mentioned, and I wasn't sure if I was watching a horror or a comedy.  And there was only one joke (it didn't help that I had a headache the whole movie).   This film did not work in my opinion. I would only give this movie 4 out of 5 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most depressing movie you can watch.   When you're done, tell someone to see this movie in the theater with them and tell them the story of this film, in particular the part where two characters, two lovers, have the same name, but different genders, and each of the characters have a totally different past.  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1797000/plotsummary   This is the best movie about a guy named Kevin, and the worst movie about him.  https://www The saddest movie I've ever seen. I wish I could remember the names of the actors.  Why did I keep watching, when the ending was so awful?   The only thing in this movie worth seeing is the part about the dog.  And that's it.  A real life story of a man who found out he was a cyborg.  The worst movie I saw during my last year of high school. It was like watching some weird version of Alien.  You know it's bad, because the last few minutes are just so depressing.  What happened? Why did he get a new brain?  The cyborg had a wife. What? I thought it was a man. Why did the wife kill her husband?  It was so gross, but I loved the way it was put together.  A very good movie.  If you liked the movie, I think you should go watch Alien.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a really nice movie... I got to see a bunch of classic characters in the roles that were first created in the original series.    But, the bad things that happened (some of which may have been a result of the "bad" direction of the original producers of the show) ruined the fun of the whole thing.      The movie is about a little girl whose dad has been kidnapped by an alien race.  She and her dad go on a space shuttle, and the alien race takes her father to an energy planet in another galaxy, where they have an enormous war.  This is what the movie should have been about, but it never really got into the proper Star Wars space.  The aliens were introduced in a very bad and boring way.  It's as if they were just introduced.  Then they took over the shuttle.  And they killed the crew, took all the treasures from the ship, and put the ship into the sun to explode.  I don't understand how someone could make a bad film like that.  They made me feel like I was in a bad book.  But when I look at the movie now, I see that maybe the writers weren't completely focused on what they were making.  There were a lot of really good ideas, but the writers seemed to get lost in the writing.  After all, if you're making a Star Wars movie, don't you want to make the movie about a bunch o' space adventure?  This movie could have been awesome.  One thing I want to note is that the movie had some great songs.  For example, they have a song called "Cherub."  (I think it was sung by the young girls on the ship.) I just couldn't help but love this song.  Why did they have to make this song?  I think it is because this song was very popular during the 80's.  Maybe it was popular because it was very catchy.  Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie.  When I finished watching this movie, I felt very sad.  Because I just don't think the whole Star Wars universe was a good place for a movie like this to have come from. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        I saw "The Devil's Backbone" (the remake), and it was... pretty horrible, to be honest.   The original (1974) was great, so I thought I'd give it another go. I'm just glad I didn't watch it in a theater, as the film looked like it was shot on a crappy digital camera.  The film is about a girl (Bridget Moyer) who meets a guy (Brad Pitt) who claims to have a 'Devil's Back Bone' that can solve all of her problems. The first movie, was the better of the two.  While the remake has a lot of new songs to choose from (such as "Brid Get a Job" by The Rolling Stones), the original had great songs like "My Secret Garden," "A Man Called Hank," and "I'm in Love with a Churchmouse." The first film's scenes in which the girl is in love with the devil (played by Pitt) and her first kiss are great, but the remake doesn't really change this up.  There's a scene in the film where the girl tells her friend (Linda Fiorentino) that she can't believe this "devil's" really exists, and it actually made me sad that she is still in love, even though it may be a trap.  Pitt is so far gone as a character, that I wasn't sure if she really believed it.  I'm not even sure if it was all just a dream, since she tells Fiorennino she's actually sleeping with the real Devil.  She's not the only one in this movie, either. Fiorenino's character has a relationship with a male Satan, and I don't think this guy's a real devil, though he is very strong and dangerous.  He's probably supposed to be played by the actor that played "Dr. Evil" in the first movie.  In any case, Pitt's character is supposed to represent Satan, so this movie kind of takes it a little too far.  Fiorehine was supposed to have been in a relationship for a while with a man (I guess he's an angel, since he's only ever seen as a male), but when she learns that she's in love (with a devil, I guess) with a person she's been with for about 5 minutes, she runs from the man.  They had
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I saw this movie in a theater at the Cineplex the weekend before it was released. After the movie I watched it in my home with my mom and a couple of close friends. I enjoyed it. The acting was good. The storyline was good...I think. I would have liked it better if it were more short. The movie was mostly a story about two characters and their relationship, the main one being the woman, "Julia" (Mia Wasikowska) and the main man, "Peter". They are in a relationship for 5 years, they are both single but they have sex regularly, they have a little sister, they both have kids and they both are very loving and affectionate. The film was well made and the script was excellent. My mom and her friends loved it. It took me a long time to even notice it was about a woman and a man and the whole film was about sex. At the end of the film I was really shocked to realize I didn't know this was a woman/man relationship. My dad did. She got it wrong. The character was wrong. This was a movie that was about two people with a relationship that was very different than most. The woman had feelings and the man did not. The story that took place at the end was good, but I think the movie should have been a little shorter, maybe 2-3 hours. There were some great scenes. Julia was wonderful. The chemistry between her and the guy was great, they really became like one and I think that was the only way they could have worked together. Overall it was a good movie, but nothing special. It was good to watch and it was great to see her and her relationship with the man. I will watch it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story of this movie is a classic one:  A group of students of a prestigious university, the University of Berlin (Umbrecht), are invited by the German Minister of Defense to visit his old university (now the Berliner Altes University) and meet the former Chancellor von Angela Empfülsche (the father of Emmett Anger) who has come to visit them.  Angela Empfelsche has been famous for many decades and was a German politician who served as Chancellery secretary in the German Parliament from 1952 until 1959, serving as Chancellor twice.  She also received the Order of the German Cross from the King of Italy in 1959, and had a residence in France and Italy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I went to see "Tropic Thunder" the other night with my fiancee. When I saw the poster for the movie on the theater poster, I knew I needed to see it. I'm a fan of the movie and this poster did not disappoint.    The movie starts with a bang. It's like a little movie bomb with a big "Boom" in the beginning. The plot takes off as the plot twists and turns in the movie. I really enjoyed this movie. The movie has a lot of humor and has a great soundtrack. "Trisol" is one of the most amazing sounding movies I've heard in a while. The main actor, Anthony LaPaglia, is a really talented actor and he is doing a great job as the villain. LaPago really makes the film. When LaPagulia is trying to get his revenge against the guy that ruined his movie, the music goes up, the lights go up, all of a sudden the movie is dark, and the characters go into a bad dream. The music is really well put in this movie and it gives the movie a great feel.   I also like the fact that the actors are really good at doing their own voices in the movies.  It is really easy to see why this is an award winning movie. It is very well made. I love the actors in this film. This movie also has some nice scenery that helps it along. It just doesn't overdo it in the music. The only problem I have with this movie is the music and the sound quality in the background of the scenes. This happens a lot in movies nowadays. The sound quality of the background music does not last too long and it starts to get a little weird when it goes to the scenes that involve the actors. The background music goes very quiet after it gets to the end and then I have to listen to it again before the movie can really be listened to. Other than that, "Trotic Thunder," is a great movie and the actors do a great good job. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Please don't take the fact that I didn't enjoy this movie as an insult. You can't please everybody. I didn`t like The Room so I don`t see what it has to say about anything. I thought it was a mess with absolutely no originality or humor. I did see some good performances and thought the movie did give a lot of ideas and thought provoking material. I don't think it is the best thing ever and you will likely hate it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is horrible and stupid. All of the actors in the movie are just awful. The director of the movie did not have any ideas about acting. All the actors are very annoying and the movie is just a mess. The movie is also very dark and the story line is very simple. The acting in the film is just very bad. If you have a few minutes to spare, then go see this movie. But if you have to watch this movie at work or school or anywhere else, then don't waste your time.   The Rating: 0/10 The worst movie that I have ever seen. The actors are terrible. They had no idea about acting in this movie and they didn't give a f@#$ about their roles. This movie sucks and I would recommend this movie only if you just want to see some stupid people act stupid. I don't know what I expected out of this movie, but I was expecting a movie with no acting to be interesting. This movie is so bad that it might be funny. This is probably the worst movie I have seen in a while. The only thing that kept me watching this movie is the ending. So bad. This was the worst, most disappointing ending I have come across.  I think that this is one of the most boring movies that I will ever watch. I would never recommend this to anyone. The best that I can say about this movie would be the ending and that I would definitely watch it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I haven't had the courage to do this since watching my first "bad movie." I was terrified that if I wrote it, it would end up with me feeling some sort of personal responsibility for that movie's failure. When I got to work I wrote that my work wasn't "bad" because I didn't have anything to do with the movie's poor quality. When everyone else told me it was a great film I thought, "Oh, right. I should have done that." Then I thought about it some more, and realized that I did have some things to do, and I didnít do them all. I wrote, and edited, and acted and wrote and edited some more. By the end I had a pretty good handle on what happened, so I think itís not fair to blame me for the movie. Iím not going to blame you for the fact that your child was sick. Youíre probably just as responsible for not keeping your child healthy as I was for not knowing how to properly raise one. I have no reason to do any of the things Iíve done. I had no idea, and had no right to assume that I knew, or could know. I couldnít have known that there was so much going on, or that my father was sick, or what was going on in the outside world. I am not the only one with problems. The world has problems. We all do. I donít think that I was a bad person because I watched bad movies, and didní t try to do anything about them. My problems were of a different kind. It was a problem to be dealt with by another person. This is not just about bad movies. We are not talking about movies that are just bad; movies that make no sense, movies with poor production values, movies that doní t follow through on the promise of the screenwriters, movies you have to sit through before you believe theyíre going to make sense, and movies that arenít even movies. There are things we all do and doní have the right to complain about. I did what I felt was right, but I didn�t know it at the time. I didnĭt know that I had to live with what I had written. But it is my fault. And in the world of "good" and "bad," as we have defined it, I was the "bad one." I blame myself for what
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Posted by: D.S. at 1:00 PM | Comments (5) | Add Comment Posted in L.A. | 4 Comments » I've had a few friends come over and tell me how they hated the movie and how they wished I would have played it in their theater, and I always tell them to try the movie out on their own.   So I went to see this movie, and after watching it for the first time and having it all read to me and then watching the movie again I can say I've changed my mind.  It's an interesting movie to watch.  And a pretty good movie.  The movie was set in a small town in Montana in the 1930s.  One of the men in the film has some great lines. He's a cowboy who takes care of a cow (well a young bull in this case) and a couple of girls.  He also gets into a fight with his wife who he accuses of being unfaithful to him.  So he's very much in love with a married woman.  But then he gets back together with this other girl who has a small group of her own. The woman of the group is named Lillian, and she's pretty smart, and when she's not taking care of the girls she's also helping a couple with their farm.  I found that the women of the town have some really nice characters. I really enjoyed this movie and had a great time.

The girl lives with her parents and her older brother and sister in the country, and has to go out into the world to find an art gallery. Her father is a famous painter and she feels like he does not care about her and she must get out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really wanted this to be good. I was really excited to watch it with my family and a few other friends.  It looked so different than other movies that I have seen. I felt like it was not too much of a change of pace. It was a movie I thought I would enjoy. I got a bit nervous after the trailer for some reason and then I saw it. It wasn't bad, but I didn't really enjoy the movie. It felt like a step down from something like "Pumpkinhead".  I guess that's my bad, because "The Great Mouse Detective" was probably one of my favorite movies.   "The great Mouse Detective is a raucous and colorful action-adventure movie featuring a cleverly-done cast of characters and a simple yet cleverly executed plot.  ( IMDB ) "

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     - The movie was very disappointing. The movie is not at all what it appears to be. The actors are not great. It's hard to be interested in the characters, the movies was way too fast paced, the story is very weak. I have a feeling that the director of the movie had not seen many horror films and wanted to show what he could do with them. - The movie really needs a few more scenes to flesh out the story.   - The "real-life" people in the movie are very cliché. - I feel like there is an underlying message in the film, but I have no idea what it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I haven't seen a movie so bad I hate it.      " The Crow " is an action movie about a serial killer who gets caught by the FBI. The movie is a ripoff of a movie called "Black Rain". The characters are the same, the action is the same. In this movie they make out with a girl who's in love with the guy who's a serial murderer. I didn't find it funny at all.  They also use lots of close ups of the killers face while he kills, so that he looks like a monster.  "The Crow" is an evil movie, but don't let that stop you from watching it. A young man (Ricardo Diaz) is the best friend of a woman (Elizabeth Rodriguez). They fall in love, but her parents try to stop them from being together. The only way to stop their parents from preventing them from getting married is to kill them. This is a true story from a true crime novel, called "The Raven" by David W. Cressey. I loved the movie, and I recommend that you watch it as well, but just don't expect much.

I loved the movie when it was first released and I loved it a lot when it came out on VHS and Blu-ray. I still love it. The only thing that bothered me was the dialogue. It's like they made a bad translation of the film. It doesn't make sense and it was irritating, but I don't understand the reason for doing that. The whole thing is very much worth watching if you can get past the dialogue."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first two acts of this film are absolutely horrendous, the story is very cliche and you see the same story over and over again. The final two acts are not much better. The characters are just generic and annoying and most of all the action is way too fast and sloppy. There are a lot of ridiculous plot holes and stupid action sequences. The ending is not the best and some things just aren't explained. 2/5 "How could I fail you again?" I'm not gonna lie, I've watched a few of these movies but never in a good way. I'm a huge fan of the 80's and 90's and I just want to watch a film with original characters and a good story. But no, this one is just pure 90's garbage. There isn't a single good moment in this film, the entire movie is based on a series of stupid action scenes and one pointless fight scene.    4.5/10 If I'm going to make an anti-climactic anti-fanboy film then this is my definition of anti- cliche.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The Bad:  The script is a mess. The story is very basic and has a few good ideas, but it's not developed in any great way. The villains are really bland and the story is told with a great deal of repetition. The movie is so full of plot holes and inconsistencies that it becomes nearly impossible to follow the narrative as a whole. I'm actually surprised that a movie this bad has been given a PG-13 rating. The good: The acting is fantastic. The direction and the music are wonderful. The cinematography is beautiful, the lighting is stunning, and the set design is stunning. The script is well written and has so much potential. The characters are interesting and develop over the course of the film. The dialogue is good and even the bad guys are able to come across as decent. The visual effects are excellent and the movie is surprisingly pretty and well shot. I am still amazed by the work that has gone into making this thing. There is a really good possibility that this could have been a very good movie if only the direction hadn't been so bad. The only reason I gave this a good rating is because it still has a certain charm about it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It sucks, and if you go into it expecting it to be good, you're in for a bad time. The movie takes place in the future, and it doesn't make sense that the characters would be able to survive the conditions they were forced to survive in. Some characters are given much more development than others, but there are no real flaws with the writing. There are a few instances where they just outright break a rule of the future so we can see how it works out. The other times, they just skip right over it, and the characters have no real consequences to it, other than a slight sense of bad taste. The worst thing about it is that the script is written with a heavy sci-fi, and there's just not a lot of actual comedy that is used in the movie. At first, I thought this was a joke, but it really isn't. The script is filled with many different situations that have no reason to exist. It makes me believe that they wanted to make a movie where the characters had to work together to survive, but this movie is just way to long. The plot is also rather pointless, as it just doesn't even make sense as the movie goes on. I really don't think this was as well written as the script of the original, but the movie had a very hard time pulling it off. If you want a movie to be bad, but at the same time have a lot going for it, you have to give this movie a try. At least if you're going to watch it for the wrong reasons, you won't be disappointed. Watch it with a sense of humor, but I don't know if that's a good thing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     A terrible movie:  One of the most common arguments against science fiction movies is that they are so out of touch with human life and emotions, and yet humans go out of their way to see them, and people's brains react to the movies in a way that suggests that a movie is better for being made if its characters are flawed. Yet, as far as science fiction goes, I believe it's generally about things that we can't predict, and human feelings are much more unpredictable than we like to think. And so it is with the Star Wars prequels and the new trilogy, which are often considered to be the darkest of the prequel trilogy. In addition to the characters who've been cast in the roles, the movie also features some truly horrendous special effects, and some bad acting from some of the stars. I can see why people have said these movies are horrible, and in many ways they are.   As a science fiction fan, though, I have to say that I really wish that the prequel trilogy had been more focused on exploring the politics, social structures and science of the Old Republic than it was about the romantic relationships between the two main characters, Darth Vader and Princess Leia.    Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones: The good: Before we begin, it's important to note that Star Wars isn't the first film to be marketed as "the good Star Wars" or a "good Star Wars movie." In fact, Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, released in 1977, is considered by some to be one of the best of all time. But I really don't think it's fair to compare the pre-Hollywood era of Star Wars to that of the original trilogy, because Star Wars wasn't marketed as a movie of the "good" and "bad" eras at all, and the two movies were released during an incredibly turbulent period in Star Wars history, one where a lot of things were changing for the better.  Also, by 1977, Hollywood had finally realized that it made more money from Star Wars than the other comic book movies.  And the fact that it was a really good movie also gives it some extra value.  Star Trek: The Next Generation was another sci-fi show that came out before Star Wars was a big thing, and had a similar political and social bent. Star Wars is a lot darker, and not quite as political,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a very poor and very stupid movie. The idea is good and you can see how someone could love it, but you will not enjoy it. It's full of stupid, clichéd stuff you should not have seen: a guy who is so rich he has to give it away, a girl who tries to steal a car, a couple of boys from a rich family, a prostitute...etc. The ending is a waste of a movie, with a ridiculous character development that would be a waste on a TV series, it's boring, and it is completely unnecessary. And of course, it is not very funny at all. But I liked the characters and what they did, so there was no disappointment.   I guess it would be very difficult to write a good review for this movie: It's a waste. It doesn't have any story, no logic, no meaning, no impact, no plot, and no plot is a bad plot. It feels like a stupid action movie without any story and without any plot. Everything is just stupid.  What's wrong with this movie? Nothing. But it's such a waste that I felt like crying at the end, and I could not watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   . A bad movie is one that is not good.   The word "bad" in this case is not a negative in the sense that people have a right to be critical of a movie.  Instead it is a negative because bad movies are the ones that are not good in terms of plot or acting, the actors have no talent or charisma, the story is awful, etc.  The worst movies are usually the kind that try to be something, a comedy, a drama, etc., and don't work at all.     A bad movie in this sense is not just bad in its own right, but it is bad for the same reasons that a good movie is good.   A good movie has some plot, good acting, good cinematography, good special effects, good direction and a plot that makes sense (like an old western).   To make a bad film is not to make a terrible movie; it is to make bad movies because they have no plot, no acting, no good acting or cinematography and are poorly shot, written or composed.   These are the sorts of movies I like.  So what makes a good film good?  A good film is a good story and the best way to tell a good plot is by telling a good book.   Good acting is important, but so is good cinemagraphy.  It is only when a movie is not interesting to me that I stop watching it, which is usually only when it goes off the rails.   In terms of directing, a good director has a good eye for camera and sound.   And of course the best part of it all is a film with a great screenplay.   This article is about the top ten bad movies and they are as follows: 1.  Alien (1979) The film that launched a thousand knock offs, a movie about an alien trying to find a home, and it doesn't even have the decency to show the alien. This is one of the few things that a movie can be good about. 2.    The French Connection (1971) A movie with a lot of action and some decent acting.   It was so bad that it almost made me want to write a whole article about it.   3.  The Shining (1980) This movie is a case of not knowing what you are doing.   The director doesn't know how to shoot a movie so they just shoot random things.  4.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think it's pretty self-explanatory that this movie is an absolute pile of shit. You will find nothing redeeming about the performance from its main star, Jodie Foster, and it doesn't help that the story is not even that great. The story centers around a former porn actress named Jennifer Love Hewitt (Foster) and her family. Her father, a former FBI agent, finds out that her sister, Julia (Karen Graham), is pregnant with Hewitt's son, Jake. However, her son's father is a former politician and is involved in a scandal that involves blackmail, prostitution, and murder. She also believes that her husband, George, has a secret past with her sister's husband. When a high-profile politician is found murdered, it sends a strong message to all the other politicians in town. And just when you think it can't get any worse, a female politician (Jennifer Saunders), who was previously found dead, is discovered alive after going to a party and being drugged. It seems as though no matter what you do, the world is conspiring against you and your family and that's not even including the fact that your family has been turned into the town's unwitting pawns. The plot, which follows a very strange, repetitive pattern, makes no sense. The only thing it makes sense of is that this would make a great film. However what I find hard to believe is that so many people believed it. It's as if someone said: "Well, my family is dying. I'll give you a plot to watch that has all of the elements of a great movie and that can be made on a cheap movie budget. And people will pay to see it." It makes as much sense as the plot of the movie: a rich woman who has a very successful and glamorous life is having a heart to heart with a struggling actor at a party. And that's it. A plot that would make an amazing movie for any screenwriter to write. A movie where every character dies and they all have to go on a quest to see who's alive. There's no fight. No plot twist. No character development. No interesting or enjoyable moments. I have yet to see this movie and I don't really know how anyone could think that this was worth watching. The movie is so bad that I almost laughed at the movie's title. I don't remember seeing this in a theater. This movie was rated PG
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was a long time ago.   We had a great time, but it was not without its problems.  We were not in a car, so we were not driving, we were walking.  This is what happens when you go to the movie theatre.  After the opening song, the actors play out a game of one on one.   It is not exactly the most fun for me, because I like to see actors with their faces and the way their body moves.  It is hard to see their faces when they are talking, so this was not my favorite part.  Also the camera looks pretty bad, especially the pan around.  I was not sure why we are walking when they go back to the car and we come back to where we left off.  Maybe it is because there are some people who are in cars but you can not see them because of the camera.  The song they sing after we finish was pretty great.   The whole movie took about two hours, including intermissions and credits.  We were not hungry so we could get in the theater early.  In all there were 3 other people in the theatre, all from out of town.  This movie has an amazing cast and amazing plot.  They tell a great story.  And it is not just a story, it is a true story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     It was pretty much the exact same thing I've seen a billion times before, in pretty much every genre imaginable.   They didn't have a single interesting moment, even after I made it to about half of the film and was like "I guess that's it."   That's it.  It was boring.  Now, they have gotten this one up to at least a "B".  It's got a few things to get on my nerves, mainly the fact that it's all about an actor who is playing a character who's supposed to be in his 80s or something.  Why?   Because it was a bad film.  They're not even making it for a good film. That's not something they're interested in.  The "good film" aspect aside, the "movie" aspect is so weak that I think it deserves a score of at least an "F".  It was the only movie I saw this week that was worth watching.  I was in the wrong theater for the "right" showtimes, and when I finally found the right one, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for the rest of the movie.  If I had had the money, I would have rented this and watched it over and over again.  Maybe it wouldn't have been as good as some of the other films on my list, but it would have at least been more enjoyable, and it would still be better than just about any film that is released on DVD nowadays. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had never heard of The Devil's Backbone before I saw it. I was a bit disappointed. It was so far away from my expectations I actually turned the movie off thinking I had heard a joke. There are so many great movies about the Civil War I thought I was in the dark here. The story is about a group of soldiers in the military who get into a dispute over a woman. After a series of bad decisions, they end up killing one another and a man in the movie makes a comment on the fact that if there is no God then the world will be a better place if God didn't exist. This is the last thing I expected to hear about the war. Then, the movie starts. I've heard people talk about the movie being a great love story between a soldier and a woman, but I wasn't able to get past the fact there was not one good moment for me in this movie. There is one scene where the two soldiers are having a drink and a soldier mentions something about a "new woman" in the Army and the woman mentions a "man" and a new soldier comes in and there is some discussion about the man. Then the man and the new soldier leave and a conversation occurs between the two that turns out to be the last scene in the film. I found it funny that the character was a black man and not a woman and that they were discussing what color man she would date, but that's the extent of the humor. The movie itself was nothing special and the only good thing about it was that I felt like a part of the story was made real to me because the soldiers were a part and I got to see one of my favorite characters in the last movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a good movie but not the best. Not really something you would come to see as a movie. But I would still come to it for the characters and their emotions. The story was funny, the comedy was funny and the music was good but the acting was very amateur. The one acting I liked was the one's who was the girl and the guy that was in the other movie in that one. He had a nice voice and he was well done but the other acting was bad. I did like that the characters were different from each other and that there were different characters with different emotions and characters to go with. The romance that happened in this movie was pretty good but was still pretty bad. A girl gets with the guy she is attracted to, he has a really great date but his girlfriend isn't there. So after the date, she decides to go home with him anyway because they have a long-term relationship and she wants to spend more time with him. Then they go out for a good time but then he ends up getting back together with the girl he likes. What a mess and so cheesy it was. The girl ends up losing all her money and not knowing what to do. They break up and she decides that she wants a divorce. And then she has another one. And another one and another one, she ends up having more than two bad guys try to get back together. Then she decides not to have another one so she can be with the one who she really wants. It ended in an ending that just went nowhere and did nothing but make the characters feel like crap. It wasn't great at all and I feel that it was just a rushed mess of a movie and could have been better. But it is a fun movie and it was worth seeing if you want to see the characters again and have them go through the same emotions that we see in the movie and have it still have a good ending. The cast is good, the music is good and it's worth seeing. But for me, the movie was bad and should not be considered an all-time classic.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the movie "The Good, The Bad, The Weird and the Ugly" is one of the best I've seen in my lifetime. The film is about the "Ugly American". This movie tells us what we never knew about our country and people that you never saw on the news or on the nightly news. The movie is well shot and the actors do a fine job. It really does a great job portraying the era. The cast did a great jobs and the movie doesn't rely on the same type of acting that you see on tv. There is alot of violence and nudity in this movie and it makes me wonder what type of people would be in this era. I would give it a 9.5 if I could. But in a time when we were in a war with Germany, the Nazis had their eyes on what we did for money and they were trying to control us. I'm sure this film would have offended them. But for a movie that takes place in the early 1900's, I think it does a fine justice. It has a little bit of everything. I really enjoyed it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have been watching and reviewing movies for 15 years, for 10 of them have been on TV or I was a part of the audience. The last four are movies that I enjoyed so much I wanted to share them with others. The rest are mostly bad.   Now that I am in my 30s, I have come to realize that I only remember the good movies. That's what I remember.  And the movies in the first movie will always be in my mind.  It was a good movie.  The plot is about a woman who is on a cross-country road trip.  Her husband left her for another woman and she can't wait to get back to their old lives.  She is making some new friends at a motel and they all get along fine until they discover that they have a daughter in a nursing home.  As I had never been to a nursing facility, I was amazed by the care that they showed this old lady.  I did learn a few things about life as well.  After my little time was up, I enjoyed the movie so much that I went to see it again. The sequel was made a year later and this time the plot involved a girl who was paralyzed by polio.  When the girl was able to speak, she told the story of her life.  These movies, along with others I have seen, really helped me appreciate the gift of speech.  That's the reason that I love movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. It was one of my favorite movies from the 80's. And it was even made by Paramount. The music was also pretty good. The acting was also quite good. I have never heard anything about this movie but that does not mean it should not be enjoyed. I give this movie a 7 out of 10. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes films about the 80s, such as "Top Gun" or "Rambo".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My review. This movie was so boring it made me want to get up and leave. The plot is a total cop out. I will never understand why they are trying to have the main character in a wheelchair. It would be easier to make her not be handicapped. The movie is about a young woman (the main character) who gets killed. Her brother is left in a coma, so you can imagine how sad the other characters are. When she is found, you can see how hard she struggled to survive. A lot of people are scared for the brother, but he does not have a problem being left alone. I guess you could say that the brother is in love with his mother, but that is not true. I don't even understand the way the main characters are portrayed. The brother is a bit of a sociopath and he has this very cool, cold-hearted smile. The older sister, the "nice" one, is the one who gives him the money for her wheelchair. He is just a cold, greedy bastard. I know this is a very dark movie, but this is not the way to portray a character. I also don't understand how they decided to kill off the main girl. I think that the movie could have used a better ending, because it left a lot to be desired. But other than that I found this movie to be so boring I wanted to leave it right then and there.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a perfect example of why a bad film makes you want to vomit. It's so bad that its worth getting through it to see a woman's face when it happens. A man can never say she looks good in that dress, so she is left looking like a complete whore.      The dialogue is atrocious, and the performances are awful.   It's not funny at all, and it makes me wish the movie hadn't been made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you're going to leave one, go for it. If you really hate a movie, leave a negative one. I have no problem with negative reviews. I just don't care for many of them.   I think some people enjoy writing about bad movies, and I do, but I have a lot of respect for people who write about good ones. It's a different beast. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the reviewer has read the book, his/her negative review probably means they haven't seen the movie.  The book isn't a bad read; it is just not about the movie the movie makes it out to be. In addition, the movie has a long list of problems, which are not mentioned in the book.   The movie has little in the way of suspense and the ending doesn't make any sense.  There is a lot of time spent on the film's special effects and the special effects were terrible in the movie at times, which is why people had to use "shoes."   There was a scene where a man is shot in the face in an alley and the bullet ends up hitting a wall and then comes flying out a window and then hits another man and then another man. There were so many scenes like this that the movie really had too much blood.  There was no reason for this because of how small the characters were and their faces weren't supposed to look so small.  When we first see a face it doesn't look small; it looks as big as an elephant's head, or as if the characters are painted on a giant billboard.  If you watch the movie you realize it isn't supposed have all this blood, but it did.  It's a shame the movie was filmed in black and white and you have to watch it on video tape to see all the colors.  I would have given this movie an A+ but I don't understand the negative rating; it's not bad, but its only bad because of the problems the movie had with the special effect work. The book had no problems, and this movie is better than the book in almost every way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So after the horrible movie we got for the first time, we were excited to see the movie. We were looking forward to the film. We watched the trailer on Youtube. We got excited. We expected good things for this movie. Then we watched the movie and there was something wrong. In the trailer it showed the main character being a cop. So why would he need a dog? That made no sense. How come this movie has nothing to do with the film? I'm confused as to why there's a dog in the movie? When was the last time a movie made this much money and nothing else? So what were we seeing? We saw a dog. There was no dog in this movie whatsoever. That was a big let down. I feel bad for this dog and all the other animals. This dog was given up. There were no other animals in the film to look after him. There's no other animal in the world that I would give up. The animal in this film is not a real animal. The dog was born and raised in a kennel. The film shows this scene in the beginning of the film and it's not like a dog that just came out of a kool-aid drink. He's an animal. I would not want a dog to be an animal that would not live as a member of its kind. He has no human qualities. He is not even a cat. This is an animal with no human characteristics and no human instincts. He lives like a cat in a place that's very different than his home. There is no doubt in my mind that this dog was not raised to live like a real dog should. He should have been a companion animal for his owner and the owner of the animal should have looked after him as a companion. I am very sad about this animal and I'm not sure that this is the animal's fault. I do not know if he is a bad dog or just not a good dog. This film is disgusting. It's like a bad dream. I cannot describe how disgusting this film was. I found myself thinking that this film's director was thinking of himself, thinking about his own needs, and thinking about other people's needs and that's not good at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you do this at a party, and have an audience, and they make fun of you for doing it, and then they go and see the movie, you're a total failure.   You'd better stay in character and pretend like you're not in character when you're sitting at that party.  When you are a writer, the only way to overcome a bad review is to stay on track, and write a new good movie (or book), and go out and promote it. If you can't do that, then don't write anything.  If you don't want people to judge you, don't make the movie.  To get people to hate you: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I was so pleased when I got my copy of the movie. The cinematography was great, the plot was fantastic, the performances were fantastic, and I think the special effects were outstanding. I had to have it and I'm so glad I did. If you like sci-fi, action, action adventure, and don't care about anything else, then you really have no excuses.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am going to write about my first experience with the new film.   I had heard about it through an old acquaintance and had seen the trailer. I remember seeing the movie as a kid. This is the first movie I remember making a point to watch when it first came out, and it still remains my favorite movie I have ever seen. I am going on about it because the movie is so much better than a lot of other horror movies from the 90s and even the early 2000s.  The whole movie is based off of a book, and is a fictionalized account of a young girl that was supposedly stalked by the devil (although the movie never actually makes that claim). The movie does an excellent job of making you question your own reality when it comes to paranormal things. You never feel like the movie makes you believe in it, but rather makes you think that it is possible. Also, the film has one of the best score's ever, and has some of the sickest jump scares. If you like a good thriller, you should definitely see this.  In the beginning, it is not very clear who is the devil.  He goes by many names in this movie.  We get multiple references to a "Dark Father".   Some people also speculate that there is a "Satan" behind everything.  It is a great film and definitely worth checking out.  I also had a very different opinion of the movie before watching it again.  One of the other things I had not liked about it before was the use of flashbacks.  They never felt like they helped the story at all.  But, I finally understood why they were used.  It did help the plot move more quickly in some scenes.  When they did work, the flashbacks helped to help us understand the world we were living in.  Even though I have since seen it a few more times, it was still fun to go back and revisit the movie.   If you would like to read my full review, you can go here: http://cafeinmybritishhome.com/review-of-v-a-t-s-dark-fathers-curse-review/
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just saw it again, because it was a little long ago, and it still is bad. I just did not get that.   I just saw the movie again on Netflix, but it is the same movie that it was on television. I'm not sure why, but I'm thinking that the movie was made in 1997, when most kids watched it on tv. I guess they tried to copy some of the stuff that they saw on tv and made this movie. It is very hard to find a good review for a bad show. The story of this movie is about a little girl named Beth and her friend Maggie. Beth is obsessed with monsters and is always playing "The Game" with Maggie. After some time, Maggie becomes friends with a very evil guy named Mr. Black. It turns out that Mr.Black is actually the bad guy and he wants to take over the world. We all know what happens to bad guys who play the game. The bad guy wins everytime and everybody lives happily ever after. This movie is really stupid. I was expecting a cheesy 80's monster movie, but instead it turned out to be a cheap 90's monster flick.  The acting was pretty good and the director made good use of the cheap effects in the film. However, the acting sucks.  It is obvious that this movie was filmed on location in Florida, because there are scenes in this movie that look like they are filmed on the beach. Some scenes are so bad that you wonder how the actors could have been able to play them. I've seen many crappy 80's movies and this is probably the worst one of them.  This was one of my favorite films growing up, but even I could not stand this one.  This was one very stupid movie that even I cannot believe it. I think that the bad director made a lot of changes to the story, because the movie has so much plot problems that you can hardly imagine it could actually be an 80's movie. I really hope that people who watch this movie get it.  So this review is just my opinion of this ridiculous movie.  I highly recommend to see this movie only if you are really into 80's film. If you think that this is bad, then just wait for it to be made into a remake of this film, I think it will make quite a bit of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "There's no hope for the future"   -"A very disappointing film that makes me very sad"  - "I would never watch that again"  ...   I would never do that... ......  ... I don't even know why I keep watching these terrible movies. When I heard that there was a remake of a good movie that was pretty good to begin with I was really excited about it but I thought that it would be better than the original. This movie is nothing like the movie from the original book and it is really bad.  I guess that I like this movie because it made me laugh a few times but the actors are horrible and this movie doesn't have any meaning at all.   The story has no tension at all and it doesn't make me want to watch the movie more because I already watched the movie a lot of times and I have seen the movie several times in the theaters.  The movie has a lot more than just "a girl dies" and "the kid dies" but it doesn a lot to make me like this movies.   This movie was made to make the viewer laugh and that is a very good thing but it didn't make any sense at all to me.  For example, there is a character who was supposed to be the protagonist of this movie and there are a lot stories from the previous movie where she has been the protagonist.  She also made a speech about "you've got to love yourself" but there was no more sense of self-love and her personality changed so that she was the opposite of the girl who was being abused by her mother and sister.  You would think that you would like a character with a great personality but she isn't a very nice person to have around.     When the movie ends it ends with the same kind of stupid way that the original movie ended so it really makes me think that the movie was supposed not to have an ending.  I didn't have much patience with the movie because I felt that it didn a lot for me and it made my mind tired.        "The Boy Who Fell From The Sky"  is a very bad movie and I hope that there are no more remakes or sequels to this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a good film. It is a movie that I will watch and enjoy, even if I know it will end the way most movies do.   But it doesn't end the same way as I thought it would.  For one thing, the ending is rushed. The first third of the movie is boring and predictable. I know, because I have seen this movie hundreds of times and each time I thought they would slow the pace a little bit and go a little deeper.  This didn't happen and the movie was rushed to an end before the good stuff even began. This movie could have been more interesting with a little more time, which would have allowed more interesting plot developments and different characters.  I was very disappointed with the ending and this movie as a whole.  What really disappoints me is the ending.  We get told that we are getting the end of a trilogy. I didn't like that they had to go with a cliffhanger. If there were a series of movies then why not end each movie on a higher note?   I know some people might argue that this isn't a trilogy because it is one movie, but I feel like it is.  The first half of the film is pretty much exposition, but it wasn't long enough.  There were parts of this movie that could have used more explanation, or a lot more time.    There was a lot of characters and a lot to know about them.  But the last third of this film was rushed, and they didn't show it, and even then they still didn't reveal the ending for me.  It didn't matter because the movie didn't end in a good way and left me a little sad.  This movie was not without its flaws.   The acting was not bad, but they all felt a bit forced. Some actors had great roles, and some actors got to do things that I thought were really cool. The music was ok, and it was interesting that there were no songs for the two main characters. I liked the idea behind the music in this movie, and I think it was done well.  Overall, a fun and well done movie that has a lot left to tell. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was my first real experience with being a reviewer of a movie. It was a bit daunting, to say the least. I'm not a very enthusiastic person. I like to try new things. I do enjoy watching movies and I always try to make my reviews entertaining and interesting, so it takes time to learn and to develop a style. But the reviews were worth it, and it felt so good knowing that I was making a difference by writing them. It's so easy to be in a movie that doesn't interest you, and I think that's a great way to learn to be a critic and learn to love movies. I hope you enjoy it.

"  --Anonymous  "You can't even watch this movie because it's about a woman who hates her life."  ---B.P.  A great film by a great director. I think this movie will be discussed for years to come. It's a great film and I hope they do more movies about it. I'm glad there is still a movie like this that will bring people together. I have only seen a couple of other documentaries on this subject and they were not as interesting as this. The best part about the movie is the music (the best in a long time) by a band called "Rancid". I was so tired of hearing songs like "B.O.B" and "N.W.A" for the longest time but this was much better. The music is so much better than it used to be. It was much more fun to listen to! It was a good film. I really enjoyed it. It wasn't for everyone, but it definitely has something for everyone. I hope this movie is not forgotten. It deserves to be heard. .
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - - -   I hated this movie and that's saying a lot. The acting was horrendous, the special effects were laughable, and the music was boring. It also did not have any sort of plot (but rather, a bunch of different plots that didn't even make sense, and you had no idea who the good guys and bad guys were), and was a huge ripoff of a movie called "I Am Legend". It really was a mess. I mean, what movie is that? I would have been happier if I had just watched "The Goonies".    The only good thing was the music, but I just wished that it wasn't too loud so that I didn't have to listen to it all day!     What about the characters:  What made the movie work was the characters. They were all pretty good, but the characters in "I am Legend" are just not the same. The bad guys in this movie seemed more like characters that the writers were trying to write into the script. They are just...well, bad. Even the villains were more like plot devices than people. For example, the main bad guy was very much like a bad character from "The Lord of the Rings", in that he was a bad guy who tried to do something good, even though his plan wasn't actually good at all (which I thought was pretty well done). The good guys in the movie were more of a mixed bag, and they were a little too much like "good guys" that were really just bad guys who didn't actually care what happened to anyone else. There were also two female characters that were supposed to be good guys, and even though I really liked their personalities, the movies they were in just...just didn't work for me. The worst, however, was the main female character. Not only was she annoying, but she was not even that bad of a character. In the end, her character was nothing but a bitch and was nothing more than a plot device to help the bad guys accomplish something. She was also the most annoying character in the film. I really did not like her at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I really enjoyed this movie! It has a great storyline. It has interesting characters. And it's got great action and great sound. The only thing that makes me angry is the final scene. I just don't understand the logic. Why did they kill all of the bad guys? Why was the bad guy the only one left? Why did the badguy decide to run? Why does he go after the other bad guys that didn't die in the first film and why is he running when there was no time limit for him to get to them? I'm not asking for any of this to be changed, but if you're going to make a movie like this, you should at least give us a reason as to why this happened."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am not a good movie fan. I do not watch a movie and think it is awful. I think it was really bad. It wasn't funny, it was not interesting, and there was nothing exciting or interesting about it. There was a guy who was supposed to be really good but he just wasn't good at all. He is the opposite of the good movie hero and we had a lot of laughs. What did I like:  I liked a lot about it... The way the story was set up was interesting and I think that it was interesting for people who are into this kind of stuff. I thought it was more interesting than you would expect and I liked that. My problem was how it turned out. It was like it was made for kids and not for adults. The only way it would have been interesting to watch if you are a grown man would be if you had to sit through it on a long flight or with kids at home. It isn't for those people. I can't help but think it has made the industry a little bit less safe to watch movies. If you are in a group of people who enjoy the same kind of movies, you are more likely to get a good experience with a movie if you can enjoy it with others who also enjoy those movies. I don't see this movie very often so I think I will try to avoid it next time. Rating:  Not Rated; B-

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a movie with some good parts that are really not that great. A movie that I think many people will like and that has the potential to be a cult classic, but that really isn't that. It has some good ideas that could have been great, but the execution of the ideas are really quite poor.  I have seen this movie three times, and have seen the sequels on cable. I love movies about the American Revolutionary War, and the first two in this franchise are pretty good. The first one is a bit better, but has one of those bad parts that you just know is going to end at some point. And the second one, well, it's the only one I have seen, so I have no opinion about it. The third one is the worst of the three. I am sure some of the things I was expecting to be good were also going to be bad, but they weren't in this one. Maybe the director tried to make it look like a good movie, but I don't think he really knew what he was doing. Maybe it just wasn't his style, and this was just an attempt to make the movie "better" and get it seen. And even if that were the case, I don´t think it would matter. There aren´t a lot of good action movies about revolutionary wars these days. I could go on and on with examples of them, and I´m sure I´ll find a few that you can like, but these are the ones that come to mind when I think of good revolutionary war movies. "I don´T want any part of this war! We are fighting with the British, not the French, or with the Spaniards, or the Dutch, or any other people you want. This war is between the United States of America and England!" -- George Washington  What really annoyed me was the fact that it felt like these characters just went around shooting people. It was a "war", not a movie, and they were just out to get American soldiers. The soldiers were just cannon fodder to be killed by anything that moved. In all the other movies I watched, they were the good guys. The good guys are the people who are trying to stop the bad guys and who get into battle. In this one, they are just killing and killing and murdering the Americans in their sleep and killing all of their own, just because they are Americans. As a movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My brother and I recently watched this, and both liked it. We didn't think it was a very good movie. I have heard all sorts of bad reviews about it, including how it was poorly shot and produced, and the script was completely cheesy.  But we didn't hate it.   We liked it.  This was my first chance to see this movie, so it might be my first and last.  (And if you like my review, I would LOVE for you to go see it.)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This review is about a very good movie. The story starts out well and has a lot of potential, but is left on a cliffhanger to not have a satisfying conclusion. When it comes down to it, the movie was good, but left me wanting more.   I don't think any of the movies I watched were bad, there are just a lot that I wish I could have seen, I don't want to say if I had seen them I would have loved them all, but I think I may have been too young to like them.  So why do I like this movie? Well it is the perfect combination of movies in one, it has all the parts that I love and a lot, if not all of the parts I hate, that makes it perfect.  It is about two men, who start out with different ideas, but eventually find a way to work together in order to get ahead and take care of their family. They find out that they have different styles and motivations for doing things, but that when they start working together that it all works out. They both have good ideas and do what they can to get things done. The thing that I think is so interesting about this movie is that it doesn't feel like a typical movie, you feel like you are in a real relationship, it is so real and you are not in a theater looking at pictures or listening to a DVD. When you are watching this movie you are with them in their lives and I just think this movie does an amazing job in capturing what it is like to be in that kind of relationship. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I loved the movie, but for some reason, I did not think it was as good as I thought it was." I do not have a problem saying this movie was good and I really don't have a lot to complain about either, but I will say that there are very few times where I actually cared about the characters, which I guess is what makes the movie really great, since they are the most relatable character in the movie. I did have a few minor issues though, which were actually funny to me, like when the little kid is watching a movie in the theater and the movie is making a mess and she says, "If I had the money to clean it up, I would." I would have laughed, because it was totally true. Another thing that made me laugh was when the kid was watching the movie in a theater and her mom came up to her and asked, "So do you have a boyfriend?" and she was like, "Yeah!" and her dad and mom go, "WHAT?" and the kid's mom says, she's like, well, my dad and her were boyfriends. It was like the funniest thing ever. The thing I did find annoying was when a kid's character got stuck in an elevator. I really wish there had been some sort of explanation as to how he was still alive, because you'd think after an hour or so, he would have just died. Also, he was supposed to be a little girl, but she looked about 15 and I think it just didn't seem realistic that a little kid would be this big and tall and strong. Overall, this movie is awesome.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched the new "The Interview," and while I enjoyed the whole thing, there's one thing that's very concerning, at least to me. The plot:  I don't want to give away too much, but the plot of "The North Korean Connection" is very much what you think it is.   It starts with a guy named John Michael Hough who, after an argument, decides to send a letter to Kim Jong-un, the father of North Korea's current leader, Kim Jong Un. This is where the movie gets very interesting, because Kim Jong Il was actually the real-life grandfather of Kim Jong Dae, Kim's father.  The letter arrives, and the movie starts to change, very quickly.  While the plot has some nice moments, it's not good or even entertaining.  The acting is very poor, and there's no real humor to the movie.  And the "North Korean Connection," as much as I like to hate it, is a very silly movie. You have North Korean spies who send the letter with a fake North Korean passport. One of the spies is supposed to be in a wheelchair and in a bad way, while another one is not so bad, but just a little slow.  Also, the movie seems to be trying to prove that North Korea is a strong country, while the real North Korea can't even feed its people.  I don't think the North Koreans would have sent a letter like this if it wasn't for the real life connection between Kim Jongun and the real Kim Jong II. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (1 out of 5)   The thing about these reviews, is that they are all the same, just like the movies themselves. This movie will be one of your favorites, if you haven't seen it before. However, if your a "re-watch" type of guy, or you are a horror fan, you should probably avoid this movie. This review is for the people that are looking for a good movie to watch, with lots of gore and sex. However the story is about a cop, who is trying to find out what happened to his wife, who was murdered in the same motel. As he investigates, he finds a murder of a woman who had a thing for a cop. I think this is the movie that was supposed to be about a character called "Cops," that he found out about after he took a wrong turn while chasing some meth heads. I don't know how they managed to get so many other cop movies made, but this one managed to be even better, with the same great film making. I found this movie very interesting. It was about a man, who went to a motel, to do some work. He met a woman there, who he thought was cute, but he soon learns she was an undercover cop. The movie was told from his point of view. After he killed one of the meth dealers that were after him, he got caught, but the guy who ran after him didn't make it far. As his friend drove his truck, he caught up to the meth dealer and had to decide whether he should shoot him or let him go. He decided to shoot him, but as he did, he found he couldn't remember the place he shot him. So he let him off the hook. But a few weeks later he found his wife dead in their motel room, shot in the head. The killer had put her body in a bathtub, put the key in the lock, then left it. When he went to put it in, he didn't realize he'd missed the key. He found it later. This was all so sad. It's kind of a movie that you have to look at as a tragedy, that was just as much a story of love as it was of murder.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the worst movie I have seen in quite some time. It is full of poor acting and plot twists. The plot is extremely stupid and the actors are too dumb to know how dumb they are acting. If the plot is true, then it is the dumbest thing I have ever seen. This movie was made to promote the new movie of the same name, but the main cast members of the first movie are in the new version, and I wish I never saw it. The best part of this movie is the ending. It was ridiculous and unbelievable! I hope this movie doesn't get a sequel or any other movie in the future! I would not go see this movie if I were you! I just got home from a long vacation and I am so disappointed in myself for watching this movie. It ruined all the good feelings I had when I saw that the first film was a huge success! - February 13, 2017BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     A good film is like a good story; you can't take away anything about it that you didn't already know.   This is a film that has a lot going on in it, but not everything makes sense to me at times, and it definitely is not an easy film to get into at times.  In this particular film the story was pretty much the same, but we see a different side of a person and I enjoyed that aspect, because it wasn't just about being evil or being good.  It was all of those things wrapped up in one, and at the end of the day what I felt like watching was that person, and as he went through the movie he started to change, but at the same time it wasn´t about him changing, because as a person, he was the same. I had a lot of fun watching this movie, and that is why I decided to give it a 7. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm very sad about the way the movie ends. I would have liked to see more of the people in the film, but I'll get to that another time.   The film is just about the people and the people's reactions to one another.  It really doesn't matter if a character is good or bad.  They're all people, and it really doesn  The movie didn't disappoint me at all. The only thing I really didn't like was how the movie was edited.  The only one of my friends that actually liked the movie. The rest of us hated it and would have quit watching it if we could have.  I found the film to be rather depressing, and had a bit of a hard time watching it. But it was a good film for an enjoyable watch.  And for those of you out there who are really into dark films, then this film will definitely keep you entertained.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A great movie and it makes me feel sad. Don't watch it if you're not depressed.  I really like this movie. It's a simple movie about a kid who got lost on a train. It was so funny and made me laugh in the train and it was very emotional for the family. The movie made me happy because it shows how life changes when you're out of the life you grew up in.   Also, there is a very important story in this movie, I just can't remember what it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "It is the same old, same old" This movie makes no sense whatsoever. I have never understood why any of the actors who were in these movies are still in them. I mean why in the world would you put a famous actor in a movie that doesn't make any sense? Even in their earlier films, I was able to figure it out because it was so obvious. They didn't even need to put the big name in the film because the plot was bad. It was always the same one or two people who get killed off every time the bad guys get to go on a vacation somewhere. I was even able to identify the villains with my head but for some reason they don't bother showing us who they are, why they are evil or how they got there. It's like they put a villain in every movie so you would buy it! Now let's get to the movie, which I found more disappointing. The actors are either being paid to do the acting or it was some sort of stunt and this is one of the rare occasions where it worked out for me. So here we have these characters who are supposed to be fighting a lot and the other people are just there for background. But then there are several occasions where someone is hit by a car, someone gets run over and they don,t say who was running the cars or who was driving it. That's why I think that they had it shot in a certain way so it would look like the bad guy was doing all the work and he wasn't even in it. You see they only show us a small portion of the movie and the good guys are killed off in the same amount of time that we get to see the bad characters. So when the bad people get away it's a surprise because they were supposed to win. The only thing that is surprising is that they didn't get away with it so many times. What's worse is that this movie is not even a good movie. This movie has everything going against it, especially the script. And when it's good, it's still a bad idea. I've seen movies like this where they tried to make something interesting and interesting is a very difficult thing to do, it takes a lot of hard work and time and effort. This is one movie where the people who created it don't care about the audience and the actors and this one is a complete train wreck. You could call it one of those movies that just
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm still trying to wrap my head around this one. The idea is, "In the future, the world is not what it used to be." One of the protagonists, a guy named D.A.P. (Danny Padilla), takes a trip down memory lane to see his father's murder. While in the past, they have had a very violent and sexual relationship. When they return to the present day, D.E.A (Dennis Franz) shows up at their apartment. This was written in 1990. I don't think we're supposed to believe that this guy is the bad guy. He's just the victim of a horrible misunderstanding. They reconcile, and I'm sure we're meant to believe they're better off now that things are different. But we see a lot of things which are just awful. The woman is killed with a shovel. (Seriously? What is with that?) A teenage girl is raped and tortured. A guy is beaten up for being gay. A woman is murdered over a parking space. We also learn that the murderer is D.S.A., who is a guy who's supposed to be a cop. So he gets the title of "daddy killer." When he leaves a voicemail for D.P., D.D. is killed and the voicemail is a warning to the other characters to stay away from D. P. The guy goes back to the past to stop the murderer, DED (Denny DeVito), but in the present he finds himself in a weird version of his own childhood. I'm pretty sure this is supposed to mean that this kid is supposed be his own son. The movie was written by Dan Curtis, who wrote another movie about this idea, "The Killer Inside Me" (which was the precursor to this one), as well as many other movies in this genre (I don't remember which ones). In the movie, there was a girl named Denna (Nicole Kidman), who also happens to be one of the girls killed in the film. It's not exactly clear why the character of Denna was written into the plot. One thing I know is that Dan Curtis was a fan of John Waters, and he's definitely the guy responsible for the character's name. This movie was a flop, but the concept is really great. I just wonder if there wasn't a better way to do this film. What do you think?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It doesn't matter how good a movie is, if there is bad writing/acting in it, it will lose it's appeal over time. And if you don't mind a movie's bad writing, I highly recommend "The Avengers".   " The Avengers " stars Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans as Iron Man and Captain America, respectively. The movie was released on June 25, 2012 and is directed by Joss Whedon. And it is a great movie! There is some pretty cool action sequences and some amazing action set pieces that are a great mix of big action scenes and some pretty epic moments.   The movie does have some major flaws, but it is still a great action movie, which I would definitely recommend. So as always, if you're looking for a good action movie to watch, then look no further.  " The Avengers" - ComicBookMovie.com
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My mom was always telling me how to write a movie review.  She said that if it was about a good movie she would write a positive one.   So I read all the bad reviews and decided to write one about a movie I have never seen.  This movie is a film about an evil man who wanted to take over the world, but his plan was thwarted.  He was taken in by a young girl, who was the granddaughter of the man he tried to take down, and he wanted to destroy the world.  When the evil man is on his quest he meets an evil woman who was trying to stop him from ruining the world even more.  The movie is set in the year 2020, but the evil woman has made it 2000 years into the future.  So you know the movie isn't for kids.  Also, this movie is really long, but it is worth the wait.  While I enjoyed the movie, there were a few things I wish they had done differently.  In the movie the evil was supposed to be able to come back into the world whenever he wanted, but I just didn't believe that.  We had a whole scene where a group of robots tried to stop the evil by bringing him back to the past but this idea was dropped when they were done with it.  Another thing I wish was added was a few more villains and villains that didn't seem to actually like the hero.  I feel that there were too many characters to like them all, which might have been a good thing if they had just stuck with one and kept them all out of each other's way.  Overall this is a good science fiction movie.  My only complaint is that I feel the movie could have been more interesting.  But if you like science fiction you should watch this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A terrible movie is bad because of the acting, the cinematography, the set design, the sound, and so on.   The characters have no personality or depth.  The plot is a mess, with several problems, and all the scenes are boring and poorly staged.    The dialogue is unoriginal, boring, and often unhelpful.  What really killed this movie was the voice acting, which is poor.  A good movie should have good acting and interesting characters.  What's wrong with it:     The acting in this movie is just dreadful, especially the ones that were in the original movie.  There's very little diversity in the acting cast.  All the good actors in this film are either the villains or the supporting characters, and not the main characters.   The actors that played the supporting roles, namely Robert Forster, were very underused, and were basically used for no purpose other than being a sidekick, and their roles aren't really all that interesting.  As well, the supporting cast are usually underused as well, and the film never develops them at all.  They just sit around, waiting for the action to start, and then act as if they have no role in the plot.  This means that they don't really have any personality other than acting as a side kick, and that's just plain silly.  To top it all off, the story of the movie isn't even that good, and they never really explain what the big plan was. It just kinda goes "Well, it's a sequel to an earlier film, it'll be great, right?" And then everything goes and gets ruined.  So what's the point of the plot?   It has an awful premise and doesn't really follow through with it.  It's a poorly written story, which only works as a simple story, but a simple plot is still bad.  Why did they make the movie?  Was it to pay back for their crappy remake of Aliens, which also has a boring plot and terrible voice acting?  I really don't know.  Maybe they made it as a joke, or just because it was a very cheap movie to make.  Or maybe they just thought it would be funny to make an Alien movie about this crazy alien guy who has some kind of weird power. But I don't even like Aliens, and Alien II isn't much better than it is. What
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "  I'm a terrible critic.   My score was based on how I felt the movie should have been done.  I did not like the movie.  And I didn't think the movie did justice to the original.  " "  The original was not a very good movie. The movie is bad, but in a way, you can see it for what it is.  The story, and characters are a total disaster.  There is nothing in it that was not already done in some movie that came out in the 1950's.  It is very easy to predict what the movie is going to do.  In other words, everything the movie does is predictable.  This is very much true with this movie. It was easy for me to predict the ending, and I think the ending is awful, as it is not what the story of the movie wanted you to feel.  If you are a fan of the original series (or Star Trek: The Motion Picture) then you will not be happy with this.  Personally, I did like this movie because I like Star Trek movies, and the first movie was an excellent movie. But the second movie was just a disaster. This movie was a bad Star Trek movie. And no matter how I was able to see the original movie, I cannot see this movie either.  Now, I am an avid Star Trek fan. I like this series of movies very much, and this movie had everything I was hoping for in a Star Trek film.  But at the same time, it was just not as good as I wanted it to be.  So if you like this kind of movies, if you want to see a good Star Trek, then this is not the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You'll never get away with it. And when you do, the internet will make you look like a moron. Just ask any self-proclaimed "director's assistant" for his or her favorite "bad movie". The answer?   Never. Not even in an improv group.   If there's anything I've learned in my time as a working director, it's this: The reason we are able to give a decent movie a good review, is because we know we can't take one that's "not good" seriously.   It's a waste of time to take any criticism about a movie too seriously. I know you can read the reviews, but they're always wrong.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm sorry, but I just can't see the point. I just saw this movie last night with a group of friends and was disappointed. First of all, I didn't think it was all that good. I think the movie is about half over, so I think we'll see how much of a big deal this is in the near future. I have seen a few reviews where people said the actors were good and they were right. They were just a little too much. At least the movie was good for a few seconds in the beginning. I don't know if the plot's going to be very good or if there's really any real plot. The ending is weird and doesn't make any sense. I know, it's a sequel, but the plot doesn't match. I mean, who actually watches movies for a plot? I didn the first movie, I think this one will be a better movie. I'm also a little disappointed with the music. It's just not good. But the rest of the movie didn't feel like it was that bad. My favorite scenes were the ones with the two guys and the girl. That's the part that always makes me laugh. The other scenes, well...that's where the movie really lost me. It didn't seem like there were enough shots to tell the whole story. Even the shots of the girl and the guy's conversation seemed a little rushed. It seemed like the writer was having a lot of trouble coming up with what to say. This movie was a letdown for me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I will probably never ever want to watch it again. The plot seems like it is supposed to be a thriller but there is too much wrong with it, from start to finish. The main female character is a whiny bitch, the men are terrible in every way and they always seem to have a plan to screw everything up for everyone. The movie also seems to be based on a real life incident but is so unrealistic that no one should believe it happened. The music and sound effects are terrible and so are the acting. The story takes about 30 minutes to get to the end but there were plenty of unanswered questions to ask throughout the whole movie. It feels like the plot was written just to make the money so the writers could get rich and leave the writer some extra money. I never once liked or cared for this movie and I didn't want to see it again ever. It's a good thing I didn andt pay a lot of money for it or it would probably have a 99 rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I liked "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.," but it didn't really deliver on the promise it made at the very end, and I'm not sure there's any point in getting worked up over that. I really do like its characters and I think the film has a solid premise. However, I didn't think the story was as good as I thought it would be, or I might have given it a higher rating. If you are looking for a fun action-packed spy thriller, this is a good film to check out. However I'm still hoping the third film, which is not scheduled to be released until June, will be much better. (November 21, 2012)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In a nutshell: A great movie.    A great movie to watch with a good movie friend.  What did I love?   The story: The story is a great one, and this was a great way to follow up on the last installment.  The cast and crew did an amazing job.  The movie is dark, brutal, and gritty.  There is a lot of violence in this film, and it was well done, but if that bothers you then this is not the movie for you.  I loved the tone of this film.       Final Thoughts:    For those of you looking for a great revenge-action-thriller, this is a perfect movie to see.  You are sure to get your money's worth out of it, and will love every minute of it.  For those of those of us that are looking for something a little more subtle, there is a movie for that too.   Thank you for reading!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like a film review.      Do not write about films in the first 10 seconds that you have seen.   This book is the result of the collaboration between two of my favorite people in life: the great John August and the fabulous Chris Marker. I think we have always been on the same page, and we still are. This book is a complete celebration of the art of cinema in every way. You will not find another book quite like it. The pictures and text are beautiful; the authors are brilliant and witty, and their wisdom is profound. John is my favorite writer, and I would not hesitate to name him the world's foremost film critic. Chris is the true spirit of cinema, a true master, a great writer, a terrific editor, and a great artist, with his own unique vision.  We worked for years to get this book to you. It took a year to prepare it, more time than we had, but it was worth the effort. I promise you that it will make your journey into the realm of cinema easier, and more enjoyable. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I enjoyed writing it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would've gone and seen it a couple of times had I known it was bad. And I was not excited when I heard that it was coming out on DVD, and I was looking forward to seeing it. I mean, I loved it as a kid, but I'm not into that kind of thing. What I don't like about it is the voice-over stuff with the kid's voice. The kids voice was irritating to me at the time. I thought it was kind of weird. I was also not a big fan of the music. It was just kind of generic. It's just not a lot of fun listening to it. And the whole thing just kind offends me. I just don't see it as good.   For a start, I'm just not interested in kids' movies or music. I'm a teenager, and music is something that I like very much, but this sounds like it was put together by some 15-year-old with a tape recorder and a pen. Also, I didn't like the voice over thing. I've never done anything like that before, so I never got a kick out of it.  In any case, this is a decent movie. It did get an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song. The music is a big part of it, and it has the perfect score. The movie is entertaining, and the characters are likable enough. Unfortunately, it just doesn't have much to do with the book. There isn't really much to it other than the movie, and that's a pity because it does have some very interesting things going for it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   .   I was at a friend's wedding and I found a cheap ticket online and went to go see "I Am Legend" thinking it would be a cheap fun time but what I got instead was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.   The acting is awful.  The script was lame.  They all talk like idiots.  This movie has the worst acting in my life.  "My mother said I could never act!"   My wife is Italian and this movie was a huge blow to me.  I got so upset I threw up the whole day.  All these years I was trying to learn to act like an Italian lady like my mother said but this movie destroyed that idea in my head.  After this movie I was a sad old man.  If you see " I Am Legend " don't bother to see "Eegah".

If you enjoy the classic sci-fi movie "I, Robot" then you will enjoy this movie. The movie also gives an awesome, suspenseful and exciting movie. I thought it was great at the end, with a lot of twists and turns, but that is not my favorite part of the film. I loved the ending scene, so much that I want to watch it again right now, but I don't think it's possible to watch the movie all at once. It just makes this movie more epic and I was confused.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   ... a film is always a bit of a pain. The only things that can make a film enjoyable are the acting and the soundtrack.   I think this one has a lot of those qualities.  I really think you will enjoy it, though.    I recommend it to any fans of horror.  The movie is great to watch because it does not have a typical horror movie plot. Instead, the plot is about a boy who was raised by his grandmother (played by Annabelle Wallis) in an abusive environment.   This movie is about the boy trying to escape from the environment he grew up in and become a man.  This story is told with such good acting and style. The movie makes me feel the pain of an abused child and his desperate attempts to escape.  When I watched this movie I saw a man trying to get out of a trap he got himself into and the people he had to deal with.  I loved this movie: The story is great, the performances are great, and the atmosphere is great.  You can't go wrong with this movie.  Even if you don't know about the movie, it will be a fun ride and the acting is really good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a good movie, but if you have never seen any of the film's other incarnations it may not be easy to understand the original movie.   It does have its faults, but at the same time it is a great movie. This one is a better version of the original, which is a very good thing.  This film had a bad cast, but when I first saw it I was blown away.  In the end, this film had some problems, but I guess that was to be expected for a film that was based on a true story. The film is pretty slow paced, but it works.  It may not have the same heart as the first film (it is just a sequel), but the film works.    The film is set in Mexico during the 1930's.  The film stars the original actress, Maria Falconetti and there is a little cameo appearance from the original director, Luis Buñuel.  They both appear in the film, and are played by Maria Falconella's twin sister, Rosa.  While the film has a great cast and was made in 1932, this is one of the few films that doesn't feature actors of today's Hollywood.  Some of the actresses that played the role of the "bad guy" in the movie have since passed away.   This is one great movie, and if you like a good ghost story, you need to see this one.  5 out of 5  (4.5 out from 5 out of 10)   It seems like you can't go on Google without running across at least one review about this movie. I'm not really sure why I haven't seen this one sooner, but as I write this, I am still watching it.  There are two versions of this movie, one has a bit of a different plot.  What you get from this movie is the ghostly appearance of the young boy who is the central figure of the movie. In the first version, the young man is played by George Murphy, who is a well known character actor of the day. In this version of this film, we get to see George Murphy as a ghost, although the ghost has some dialogue as well.  At first, I didn't know what to think about the film. I mean, it was supposed to be a bad film, but the cast and director were just as bad.  A lot of the bad reviews came from the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Why are the bad movie reviews about a movie in a bad part of town?   The people in the movie who say they hate this movie were on the phone with me before I saw the movie for this review. If you're looking for bad movie review that will make you laugh then this is the one to watch. I'll try to keep it short and sweet.   This movie is really good. The actors are really good, the story is good, and the ending really makes the movie. What really made me laugh was when I saw that the woman in the bathroom with the huge butt was actually a woman. It's just so funny when you watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - it's a movie like that a kid will watch.   This is a story about a man who had been looking for the man who killed his brother and has been hunted by the FBI. But then his brother's murderer escapes from jail.  But then a new witness arrives, and it gets worse.  When you see this movie, remember that it was made in the '60s, when the Mafia controlled many of the news media outlets, and these mobsters were considered heroes. The fact that a family member is involved in a crime is hardly an excuse to murder another human being, but it's interesting how these guys try to make it look like a "family issue". It does have a certain "hokey" feel about it.   This was a movie that was made as a big time thriller with a lot of production values. It was not the kind of movie that would have been distributed or sold to the general public for several more years.  It was a blockbuster, and one of the biggest movies of the '50s.  Curtiss :   It is a hard man to be with. But that's all part of it. You'll make the best of it and he'll make a better of it.... I have found in my life, nothing is all there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a good movie, but the whole thing was a total waste of my time. It's just a bad film. It has all the makings of a bad experience, from being overlong (two hours and twenty minutes), to having a bad script (one of the worst of the year, even more so than the movie it's based on), and a crappy acting crew. There are two characters in it, one of them is a bit of a cartoon and the other is a little kid. In order to make this movie a little more interesting, they have made the little guy a zombie and have his name spelled wrong. The zombies have the look of a mannequin (the mannequins in the movie have very good makeup) and are very stiff and lifeless. One of the men in the group has very little character in the whole movie and he is one of the weakest characters in any movie I've seen this year. The rest of the people in the film are the stereotypical stereotypes: they're all short and have thin faces, and most of them are either old or have thick accents. The women are ugly, the guys are stupid and the zombies are very little more than mindless zombies. I guess they thought it would be more interesting to give them a zombie character who looks like a man. The ending of the movie made me feel sick to my stomach. It is a complete waste of time and a great disappointment. If it had been a real movie with a story, it would have been okay. There were plenty of good zombie movies out this year, and you will be missing out if you just waste your time on this one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "The movie looks great, but I felt it was a bit slow at times"   The movie looks amazing, but the story has a few plot holes. It would have been better if the plot was explained more clearly. The movie is not good, but is definitely entertaining. The story would have benefited from a few scenes cut, because it gets a bit predictable at times. The special effects are excellent. If you like to watch a good horror movie, this movie is a must-see.  My rating:  The score is an 8 because of the excellent special effects and the movie's good plot.   I thought the movie was a great example of a psychological thriller. It has a very unique style of suspense and scares. The effects are top-notch. This movie is worth watching.  The score is 9 because the film has a good plot, but unfortunately it lacks a lot of plot elements. It does not go the way it should and that's why it loses some points.  I think this movie would be much better if there were more scenes cut. I think a few extra scenes could help make the film a bit better.   The score would be a 6.5.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason I'll even give a 4.5 is for the ending. I know a great ending would have been the best, but it was still a good movie, for a change.  What can I say?   It's a very fun movie to watch. It does an excellent job of giving us an action packed and exciting plot. But what really got my heart rate up is when our protagonist is faced with a terrible death. His love for his little sister, whose name is Mary, was stronger than his desire to protect his comrades. The movie is very well paced and I never felt like it was rushed. The ending was a real tear-jerker and one of the most emotional I have ever seen in a movie.    When you love somebody and then they die you don't think that you ever love anybody else again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If a movie fails to meet my expectations then it's just not for me.   I really don't care that it's bad, it is just not a film I enjoy.  But I'll never say "no" to good movies, I want to be entertained!   Posted by John at 1:06 PM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you love a movie and you find the movie to be bad, let me know. You will find people on my email list who will love your review. I hope this is helpful to you. If you are a movie theater owner, please contact me by email. I am a film reviewer for a living and I will always review a movie that was poorly filmed and acted and was a complete failure. I like to think of a good movie as an art form.   I was impressed by the film in terms of the story and acting but the movie was poorly directed and shot. The movie had all the hallmarks of bad filmmaking. The pacing was so slow, the story didn't flow.  The plot was rushed.  There was no emotion.  All the actors seemed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  This movie is a complete flop.  What was supposed to be a fun comedy turned out to be something else.  If the movie had been well shot, directed and acted, it would have been a fun watch. But for some reason it wasn't, the movie is not worth watching.  The movie was in black and white. It was a nice black and black movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie had a lot of cool moments, but a lot less cool moments and the acting wasn't very good, even by a lower standard, so it might've been better if it had been edited to have more awesome action.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     How bad was it?   It was awful.   You are wasting your time with a movie this bad.  How can they make a movie like this and make the same money that they made this movie?!? If they're really THAT cheap, how the heck can they be so lazy?  Why didn't the producers hire an actual actor to portray the title character?  This movie doesn't make sense! How does the guy who is supposed to be a big time movie star suddenly appear out of nowhere and start giving his character lines that are completely ridiculous? This has got to be some sort of joke, because what's the point of hiring actors to play their role if they have no clue how to act in the movies they are starring in? I also think that there should have been a little more music in this movie, because when it's not being played on the piano it's kind of annoying to listen to. I know that this is going to sound like an insult to some of you, but there's nothing worse than when a movie has absolutely no music whatsoever, so just be prepared to wait a few minutes for that to be fixed.  I would really love to know who the producers of this movie are.  When is their next movie going to be released?  I'm waiting for the day that they decide to make another movie about a character named "Ralph", and then I'm going to sit through that movie.  I know this is a "bad" movie, but the fact that they would make a crappy movie about Ralph is just mind boggling to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's like we don't have any friends who are movie watchers (who watch anything at all!) and don't know how to evaluate movies.   One friend of mine was in the movie, and I could not tell if he was a professional or not because he looked like an actor and the movie was a movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Please keep a positive review of a good movie - it will make the internet even better. And, when it is not a bad one, write a positive one that tells why you like a good or bad movie.   There are only a few things to remember in a movie review: - Don't read the movie description - The name of the movie is usually good enough - Don' t write anything about a movie if it is a bad or a good one - Never start a movie off with the name of a movie. There is nothing to say about that.  I don't think I have seen any movie that is better than the last. This movie has a great script, it has great acting, and it's really interesting. I didn't really watch any trailers so I don't know what's good or what's bad about it. My biggest problem with it is the acting. They all did a great job in the movie and I can't imagine them doing any other way. I just thought it was really good and I hope they do it again. I have a bad feeling about this one. I've heard a lot of good things about it, but it really sucked for me. The writing was pretty good but there wasn't a great acting in it. Also, some of the characters in it were pretty annoying. I'm not saying it was the best movie but there were some really interesting and interesting character roles. It was a good start to the year.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      "If you go to a movie theater and you're not entertained, the fault is not with you. There is a lot of good stuff on the screen, and it makes you feel good. And you want to sit there and watch it. And, you don't have to worry about the actors. They're all amazing. But when you get to the middle of the movie and they say: "Hold on a minute, people! Somebody's leaving!" you feel bad for all of them. Because somebody's having an off night, you're really excited for them. And then they're gone, and you don the bad mood of a lifetime. There was a very nice woman who walked into the theater, and she came out in tears."  -Richard Dreyfuss   This is an unfortunate movie that is full of so many errors, so many holes in its story, that the end result is disappointing.  And I really can't recommend this movie to anybody, not even a movie buff. It is poorly written, the actors are so far from being believable, and the action scenes are completely senseless.  a   I will post some more movies that I liked in the next review. I think I'll wait until I'm done with this movie. I'll have my final judgement soon!  I was really looking forward to this movie, because I've never heard of it, and I'm so excited to see what director Brian De Palma does with it. I can't wait to see this movie and compare it to other movies that he has done!  it is really too bad that it is so hard to find this movie on DVD, or on iTunes. I've seen it twice now, and they only have one out. So maybe if I can find it somewhere else it can be watched, because the acting in this movie is so terrible!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You will be mocked. If you have the courage, you will be ignored. If it's really not a good movie, no one will even think to give it a good review. You will probably be dismissed as a "hater" just for saying that the movie was bad. If a movie was really bad, you would be the one that wrote the review of it. But what kind of a person writes a bad review about bad movie? They don't want to be the person that says that it's not a great movie, so they try to keep it as neutral as possible.   That's not really being neutral. It's just trying to cover up the fact that they like the movie and would never admit that they hated it.  What are you doing? You are denying that you think that the people that wrote those terrible review are idiots. You are trying to hide your own biases. You know that you don't really like that movie. You don't like the director of the movie, or the actors who are in that movie, and the director's dialogue. You just don't.  Do you know why? You know they are just making a movie, that is all. But you don''t like the idea that that movie could be so bad. You hate bad movies. But don't you hate that movie? You just saw it the other night, and it was just horrible. And you have no doubt that there were probably a lot of people who loved that movie that hated it, because they thought it was so bad, they didn't care what the movie actually was.  But you know, that's not fair! You think that they think it's bad because they are trying not to hate it! If you thought that this movie would make you laugh, you wouldn't write a negative movie review!  You know what would have made you laugh? The movie. The movie has a bad ending.  You'd be more likely to think that this ending was really horrible and the movie is only bad because it's ending was awful and horrible. So it's the bad ending that made it bad? No way. You would have written a bad film review if the movie had an ending that you loved. You like films with happy endings. But a movie that has an awful ending doesn't make a film that's bad.  Why do you hate the ending so much? Because it's an awful end, and you can't accept that
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     "If you are not entertained then you're probably not a human being"   It's okay to be entertained, but you're not a living being if you can't enjoy the experience of watching a film.  The movie was boring, and the acting was awful, but it wasn't a horrible film to watch, so the only thing I can say is that I am disappointed.  "The fact that we were even in space, let alone on the far side of the moon, must have looked like a dream to some of our people"  The dream that we humans have, we all want to go to space.  To the moon and beyond.  In fact, the film even has a few people asking, "Would it be possible to go back up and get back on Earth?"   I guess the space program was a great idea, and everyone in the film wants to go.   And of course, they go, and they die trying.  But they still want to be in space. They just want to get off the planet and get the hell out of there.  Why do we still want that?  What is it that we want?  Why would we want to leave all of this behind?  Do we have to get rid of every single human being on the planet to get our dream of space?  I understand that we have a very big world, but what about all the other countries that aren't so lucky to have the resources to make space travel a reality?  Maybe we can just be the selfish ones and just give space away to other countries, but I don't think so.  Let's look at the people who have the power to do this, the billionaires.  I know a few billionaires are working on a project to get humans to the moon. But we already have enough trouble getting people to go on a vacation.  What about those who don't have the money for a trip to space? Who gets to go first?   If the people want to see other people's dreams come true, then they should make it possible.  Maybe some people will die while going, but they should at least go and see what they would see on the other side.  It should be up to the people, and it should be the government to make it a reality.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I will never watch this movie again. I don't want to admit that I thought that a movie about an old man who is in a coma when he gets out of the coma was a bad idea.   The actors are terrible and they don't have a good storyline for the movie.  To sum it up, The Boy's Town movie is terrible and I'm glad that it's not on TV.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie of all time. The entire movie is a big pile of fucking shit. Everything from the bad acting, the bad direction, the terrible writing, the awful acting, bad editing, terrible soundtrack, and of course the fact that there is no good reason why the fuck anyone would ever want to watch this crap. The reason is simple, it's just a terrible movie. The acting is bad, the directing is bad. The writing is bad and every one of the characters is a boring, stupid, and stupid human being. This movie is just a joke. Why should you watch it? It's a terrible piece of trash.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is the best part about this movie. It's not a very good plot. The most obvious flaw of the movie is the actors who don't match their characters well. They don't seem to understand what they are doing. They seem so bad at this point that it's hard to believe they ever got the part in the first place. This is not a mistake that can be corrected in future sequels. The actors are so bad that there's little to no enjoyment.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is another of those rare reviews that just doesn't need to be written. The movie is bad! The story is bad, the acting is bad and the cinematography and effects are all over the place. It's a shame since most of the characters are so likable and the direction is so well done. I mean there is so much going on that it's a wonder it doesn't look like the director just took a bunch of action shots from other movies and tried to mix them into this mess. The story itself is very simple and the film has some nice moments and some great action. The biggest problem is the plot. It doesn't make sense. It isn't even clear what the conflict is. Sure, there are bad guys, but why did they go after the bad guys? Also, why did all the bad guy's guns go off at once? The main antagonist (the movie even says the name out loud) is an innocent old man with a cane. What is with the bad gunning? Why does he never fight back? Why is he called the "Evil Old Man?" And most importantly, why is there no sense of urgency at all to the plot? There was no threat, and the villain never even seems to do anything. All we see is the old man's cane and a scene of the bad people coming after him. We don't even see a fight. This movie should have been more exciting. It is also just a huge waste of time. It seems to be a "one and done" film, meaning that no one will ever see it. The action was mediocre at best. I could care less about the bad acting, which really isn't that bad. The cinematography is good, but the editing and effects just make the movie unwatchable.   This is an example of a movie that doesn't deserve to be rated with a bad review, but it's too good to be given a bad score. The film will likely be better in the years to come.  Rating: 1.5/5
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is terrible.  The plot is predictable and cliché and stupid.  It is so bad that it makes me wonder why someone would even waste time watching it.  And it is so dumb that I was confused when the movie told me to "wait for the end."   Why do we have to wait for something to be over before we can move on to something new?   It seems as though the movie is a parody of itself: it's all the same stuff that's already been done.   I feel so bad for everyone who watches this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are also movies that are a bit better than the movies above but they don't appear on the list.   So, I've tried to find more movies with less bad ones.   It might be just me, but I really don't like this movie.   There are some scenes where the actors are in a bad mood and I think the director should have stopped filming this movie at this point.   It's a short film and there were a couple of bad scenes but it could have been done better.    The only positive about this movie is the actors.      If you love horror movies and if you are looking for a horror film with a bit of a twist, this one is for you.   If you're looking for an action-packed thriller with a twist and a little bit of comedy, this movie will give you something different.  Here are some reviews about this flick: " The last of the great gore fests!" - Horror Movie Legends " It really is a great horror film and very well directed, and the acting is great...it's a shame they didn't make it more like the movies they did before with the slasher films because this one would've been just as good." - The Guardian " I just finished it and it's a very good thriller with good gore... I highly recommend it." - Thrillist " This is a very entertaining short horror film. It is more of a horror suspense film than a horror comedy, which is appropriate for a film of this length.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If it's terrible, it's a bad film. But you can't be perfect. You can't have that perfect movie where people look at you like you're the bad guy. If you're a negative reviewer, you're making a choice that, no matter how bad the movie is, you still think it's good. And if you're doing that, it might be the worst film you've ever seen. You might be giving yourself an ego boost. And you might be making yourself feel good about being a critic. But ultimately, you'll still be making that bad movie you hate. And no one will care. So just keep that in mind. And don't give people reasons to be mad at you.  What's worse than a bad review? When you're an angry reviewer:  So you've seen it. You've written it. And then you see it with a different, and a much more scathing opinion. That means you've failed. You said it was bad! It really wasn't. You wrote a bad one. It's your fault!   I know this might be hard to hear, but, again, I want to be totally clear: I am not trying to say that the movie I'm writing about is bad. That's not how it works. It has flaws. But it has flaws that are not immediately obvious to me, and certainly not immediately apparent to you. And I want you to appreciate them, for what they are: flaws.   So when I look back at the movie, and I'm a bit of a critic, I'm looking at it, I think, with this, sort of, ironic, "What's the big deal? This movie doesn't have any flaws! It's a perfect movie! That means that I don't have to worry about this movie at all!"   But you know what? Sometimes the movie doesn in fact have flaws, and sometimes it doesn't. And that's okay. You know? Sometimes movies are just bad, and it's okay that they're bad, or that they aren't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    1.   When in Rome, do as the Romans do   I never have a problem with a movie or a character that is simply over acted or poorly portrayed.  However when an actor (or a woman in this case) is over acted then you have a serious problem.  The film starts out good enough.  As the main character gets a job in a big hotel I knew he would make some mistakes.  But the first half hour or so was pretty good and the movie kept the momentum going.   However when he started being put on trial for murder the movie started to take a turn for the worse.  The movie goes from great to ridiculous to bad in an hour or two.  I didn't even think he was guilty and then the film turned to a fake documentary which was more confusing than anything.  This movie did not live up to the hype from the trailers.   This movie should have been called  The Wrong Way to Murder a Guy.   The reason this movie didn't get a 5 is because of the film's plot twist and the way it turns the viewer's stomach.  2.  One Bad Apple   If you don't like the ending then you can probably give the movie a good review.  Although, if you're a fan of the book and/or are an avid reader then you should be disappointed.  For me the ending left me feeling extremely disappointed. I wasn't sure what happened after the second murder and I had no clue if the killer was caught.  How did they find out about the second victim? I didn' t like the fact that they couldn't get back to the hotel fast enough.   At one point we see a scene where the detective's partner walks in and asks him if he knows anything about the murder.  Then when they get back into the car to drive away the detective asks if they can give the murderer a ride.  After they get in the car the detective goes to pull out his gun, then it is pointed down and the detective pulls out the gun from the backseat and points the gun at the other driver.  What happened?   The other driver drove away, then the detective pointed the gun in his face.  Now if the suspect in the second car was in the back seat of the first car how did the suspect get out of the second?  3.  Murder in the Mansion   There are so many people
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When you watch something bad it is really tough to leave it without leaving a negative comment.   It makes it harder for you to see things that are wrong, but you still have to admit that the film is a little bit crap.  If you are interested in seeing how a good movie is made check out this article.  When the filmmakers made this movie they didn't want to make something that was bad.  They wanted to make a movie that they believed to be good.  It is their opinion, so I don't think that they are going to lie to you here.  The thing is though that in the end the movie doesn't really stand up to what they intended to make.  I can't think of many movies that have the guts to put a big star in a role and just have him not work at all.  Some people like Michael Sheen and others don't.  In the end you are just left with a "Meh".  The biggest problem with this film is that the writers didn't write anything.  There are very few scenes that you can say are actually written by any of the writers.  Instead you get a movie with a bad script.  That doesn't sound like the directors fault but it is their fault.  This movie was only made because they couldn't find a good actor to play the role.  With a cast this bad they should not be directing a movie.  One thing that I loved about this movie was that it actually showed you the "differences" that exist between the two characters.  These were the differences that was written by the actors in their scripts.  From that I get the feeling that there are a lot of people that wanted the actors to be better and they didn' t get what they wanted.  A bad script is not always a bad story, in this case it was really bad. I would definitely recommend that you not watch this movie. It is not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched the movie twice, so it should have a slightly different rating. The film is an awful mess of a movie. The script was terrible. They made a good idea a bad one. The actors are not good at all. They did not try to be funny. The plot was bad. The acting was bad in a bad way. The movie did not take itself seriously. It is about the same movie, but it has a different cast and a different plot. The music was terrible and the characters looked like they had been shot with a cheap camera. It was a complete waste of $5.99 I have just wasted on this. You would have to have no sense of humor to like this.   A "bad movie" has to be a horrible movie. A "poorly made" movie does not mean it is bad. You can find a lot of films that have the same issues. "I'm not a big fan of comedies" I would say. This movie should have been called "Citizen Kane of B movies". You would never even be able to hear the dialog of a normal person. It would be a hard film to sit through. And it could be really good.  I saw this film on DVD when it came out and I am in the process of buying it. It looks good on DVD. The first time you watch this movie, you are in a theater and you know that this is the film for you. It's not a horrible film, but like I said, this movie was just too good not to watch it over and over. I saw the film twice, and there was so much story to tell. But I don't think I'll ever watch it the same way. It can be good. But you have to be willing to spend your money.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       It is not a good movie. It has some very interesting ideas, and interesting characters, but in the end, its a bad film with a bad story. I found the ending to be just plain sad. It just didn't seem to have any meaning to it. And it was like it just had to end, but the ending was just really rushed, and it was too quick. It didn't explain much to me why she was doing that to that guy and it didn't have any heart behind it, and the ending made no sense. I really liked the premise behind the film and it had some interesting ideas. The characters in the film were interesting, and while I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again, I would still enjoy watching it again.  But I don't know if that makes me a bad person:    I really loved that film and I am glad that it made its way to the theatres.

One of the main characters (played as a character by Sylvester Stallion) gets out of the theatre and runs into the street, shouting: "I'm running! Run!" He is chased by several of the other characters and is able to escape and seek help.  Now, how do I feel about this film?  This film was definitely NOT meant for younger children, so I won't even attempt to discuss the plot. I'll however give my opinion about this production, and if you have any questions about this flick, feel free to ask in the comments section.  in other words, I have some concerns about this particular production. My first concern is the size of this film's budget, and the lack of a budget report. It really does seem to be an amateur production, which has many of the same problems of many amateur productions; it seems the director/producer had no money and were too lazy to plan anything out. So while the actors were able to improvise many of their lines, and although they all seemed to have decent chemistry together, I didn't think that it came

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My daughter has never been to a Disney movie theater, so it was really exciting to see the park come to life for her.   I loved the special lighting effects, the fireworks, the ride cars, and all the amazing Disney characters.  The characters were the most fun to interact with in the whole movie, especially Snow White's mother and a character from Aladdin.  My only issue with the movie was the sound quality. The movie is in 3D so you might notice the blurry picture if you sit too close.  I still liked it, though.  A Disney fan must have a "good movie". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   We watched this movie about an older couple who lived with a little boy who was sick and weak. I found it funny. The movie is made fun of, but I was laughing and laughing, but it wasn't really fun. The older man doesn't care about the sick kid or what happens to him. He just wants to make sure that his son doesn't get into trouble. The mother in the movie is supposed to be the same type of character. The woman is very naive and can't see that the boy is sick and that she has an obligation to take care of him. The boy in the film is sick, but he is an intelligent boy who loves science and his father loves him. This couple gets married in a movie theater and then a very ugly woman shows up in a very nice car and wants to marry the couple.   The movie was supposed to come from a story written by a man, but some of the humor didn't come from him.  When a man is the director, and he gets a guy from the neighborhood to direct it, what are the odds that the guy is as smart as that guy.  It didn't work, and it wasn�t funny.  A lot of the story was repetitive, but the movie didn�t work.  I will give this one a 1 star and call it a bad experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    ( ) This movie is bad. The acting, the acting, and the acting is a complete disaster. You'll watch the first 30 seconds and immediately cringe because there's no reason for anyone to be that silly. The plot is a bunch of "drama" and "suspense" and has no meaning. The characters are pathetic. The music, especially when it isn't the musical numbers, are awful. This movie isn't good, it's so bad that it was released for the sole purpose of insulting all movie fans out there. If you like bad movies, watch a good movie instead. Don't waste your money on this awful thing, just ignore it and don't look at the DVD's, just leave it on the shelf until somebody else wants to rent it. If anyone does want to rent this, don't watch it. It's embarrassing. I've had to leave the room because my hands are shaking from all the cringe I felt watching this. The sound was awful. They recorded the sound of the characters talking, they added more sound effects for the scenes when the characters are having a conversation, and they mixed it up. It was so badly mixed, it was disgusting. You will cringe, and I guarantee you won't get used to the sounds in the movie. Do NOT rent this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (I'm sure there is one).   I love horror.   Horror doesn't need to be scary to be good, it needs to be terrifying.  But   The movie's main thing, which it does not have at all, is fear.  This movie, while fun, is not really scary and doesn't take its own inspirations from any real horror movies, it feels like it is just playing with scary tropes and ideas, and making them come back at you. It has a lot of action too, but that is very, very unneeded.  I like my horror to be suspenseful.  The action scenes are not bad either, but they are just not scary enough.  I mean, the characters are trying to escape from the room, but there is a lot going on.  Not only that, but the room is really dark, and it is not even scary.  And finally, there is not enough gore.  (You can say, "But there is blood!".  Yes.  There is blood.  No one is "dying" in this movie.  It is just that the characters get really scared, but it is more of a "oh my god!" sort of scene.)   There are some really great moments, like the guy who says "we have to get out of here" and the girl who runs out into the night.  The girl, in the darkness... But there are some other moments I would have liked to see, like when the girl opens the closet door and sees the monster and runs out.  Or when the guy tells the girl "I'm going to kill this creature".  But the film just isn't scary enough to scare me.  What I did like is that there is some sort of message in the movie, but I don't think it is enough to make me feel like something is actually happening.   I mean, there are scenes of "how did the monster escape from here?" and "how is this person dead?".   That's what makes this movie so enjoyable.  As a fan of "found footage" films, the movie seems to be telling me something.  My husband and I watched it on Halloween night. I think this is why it works so well, the "found" footage aspect of it.  If I didn't know better, I would say that it is trying to tell me that these people (
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I will not write about a movie in this review because it is not my genre. However, I will explain to everyone my opinion of this movie. It was just too cheap. It had an awful plot, boring characters, and the music was just annoying. The acting was a bit bad too. This is definitely not a good movie. If you love popcorn action movies, don't watch this one. I would recommend it only to people that are looking for a cheap comedy that has a good plot. I think this movie is the worst of the bunch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are bad movies that are really bad. These are the kind of movies that make you wish you'd never seen them. Bad movies that you want to get through as quickly as possible. These kind of films are very much like junk mail. They are either too hard to watch or they make you angry. There are some movies that have a great story, a compelling screenplay, a beautiful soundtrack and a good cast. And then there are the movies that, despite being a good movie, are so damn awful that they are painful to watch. Those movies are the ones that make me wish I never saw them. I don't blame the writer of this film. The movie looks awful and it's hard to get a good look at the actors because they're all looking over their shoulders and staring at their phones. The voice acting in this film was terrible. The actors seemed to be trying to mimic the lines of other actors. I didn't enjoy watching this movie at all. This was a total waste of time. 1/10  Sean Paul - Slap Trap  by iPromote4Free  Reggae
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a pretty bad movie. The acting is horrible. The plot is retarded and stupid. The cinematography is a huge ripoff from some old 80s horror flicks. It makes my head hurt thinking about this movie. It really is the same story told from many different points of view, with the same actors. I have watched movies like this before and they don't hold up. This movie does not deserve a sequel or remake.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       I love the movies and I know the filmmakers have put a lot of love and heart into each one of them.   Some are great, but a few are terrible.  I found the "Lone Survivor" movie to be just as terrible as the first film and the next film.  The story line, the acting, the directing, and the cinematography are all bad.  I just couldn't find a good movie with a good story line and a good cast that isn't a movie where they got paid to have sex with a dog.  "Rambo: First Blood Part II" is a good film but it isn't worth watching more than once.  This movie was really bad. "Lone Wolf" Movie review by: Anonymous The "Lonesome Dove" movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  In the end I wish I hadn't watched it at all.  To watch this movie you have to admit you're not the type of person that will be impressed with any Hollywood movie.  However, when a movie like this comes out it's the first movie you'll see from a new director/actor.  You don't know if this person will be any good, but you're excited to see a new movie, so you go in.  That's what this movie is.  It is a terrible, terrible movie and is just a waste of time and money.  How did the actors and filmmakers do so badly?  The actors, like Tom Hanks, aren't any good at all in this movie. Hanks plays a Vietnam vet with PTSD, but his performance is awful.  They even had to get his voice actor to sound like Hanks and it was so bad they didn't even sound like themselves.  Hanks is a pretty good actor but there is nothing about his voice that makes him sound like Tom Selleck.  Another guy in the movie, Don Johnson, is just horrible. He was bad in "The Rock" and "Red Dragon," but in this film he was worse than he was in "Rock" and Red Dragon.  Johnson had to be the worst leading actor in Hollywood.  Even his voice, the way he speaks, is not very good.  Most of the roles he gets are so ridiculous that you don't even want to watch them. Why don't they get better acting talent to do that?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very different movie that's good for the soul:  Good and bad, but good enough:  The film itself is a horror/drama, where it uses a number of different aspects of the genre in its own way.  You have the character who is in the hospital and the girl who's a prostitute that's in the same room.  The film then moves to a nightclub where you have the characters doing the exact same thing.  Then, you have a hospital where one of the characters and the prostitute are going after some "money" that someone wants them to do.  So, there's this interplay between the characters, and then the girl ends up being found dead and that's the end of it.  This was a very different type of story that I found interesting, in that it uses some different elements to tell a very interesting story.  The "money", by the way, is the price of her death.  Very graphic and disturbing.  Also, the sex was just terrible.   And that was the only reason I actually watched the film.  I really don't feel like anyone else would watch it, in terms of it's impact.   If you want more, there is another movie called "Eyes Wide Shut" which is also about a prostitute and a killer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "The Dark Knight Rises," written and directed by Christopher Nolan (read our review of it here ). In this film, we're shown how Bane (Michael Caine) became a billionaire by killing and stealing. He has a mansion full of expensive art, as well as a bunch of henchmen who are more like pets. The story starts off as a simple investigation into how Bane and his crew were able to rob and kill all of the city's millionaires with only a few dollars. While the story is pretty good, the movie loses some of its tension after the first 20 minutes, as the villains are introduced and you can see why they're so evil. Nolan has set this up as a psychological thriller, but it loses some focus once the villains begin to take over. This is especially evident when the villains start causing mayhem in the city while we're watching them. Then, we go back in time and see that they're not really evil at all, but simply trying to get revenge for all the people they killed with their super-villain skills. This does a disservice to the characters, and it's all done in the name of shock value.  Nolan takes this one step further in the climax, by having Bane actually try to kill Batman. As Batman and Bane fight, it becomes quite clear that Bane was trying to kill him in the previous movie. You begin to wonder if Bane wants Batman to fail, as it would mean he'll get what he deserves (which we know he'll end up getting). Then, after they fight the rest of the movie, we see that the fight was all part of a master plan, with Bruce trying to stop the villain's plan to kill his parents and become a billionaire.  "The Dark Night Rises" is one of those movies that has a lot going for it, but has a few flaws. The movie is very fun, and while the villains and the story may get a little tired, the action scenes are very good, and the movie looks beautiful. While some people may enjoy this movie, it's not for me. If you're a Batman fan, you should really check this out. If not, don't worry, it still has a great action scene (see it below), so if you're not a Batman movie fan, there's still plenty of good stuff to enjoy.  :  Advertisements
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you liked the movie then why do you care? If you disliked the movie it is because you have a different opinion of what a good movie is. The best movies are made for a reason and it is not for the "cool" people. Don't go thinking everyone has to like everything you do.   " The only thing better than getting a girl drunk, is getting drunk with her.  "   Why do you hate movies:  Why do you think this is a movie? It is not. It is a film. There are no actors, there is no story, there are no laughs. All you have is a bunch of people dancing to a song in an empty theatre. Why do people want to make a movie in the first place? Why don't they make something like "Citizen Kane" in the 90s? Why are people still making movies in the 80s? I was just about to write the same thing. I wish I was going out to a concert. I don't care what the music is.  There is no music, just people.  It is almost like a horror movie, where you are just sitting in your car, just watching a horror film.  If they could cut out all of the gore and blood, it would make a better movie. This movie is just an empty, empty shell of a movie.  There is not one good thing to be said about this film. It has not a single moment of fun. You just sit there and hope that the people don't run out and get themselves killed.  My recommendation? Stay away from the theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you want to write a bad review about "Ghostbusters," here is the script.   The movie is bad and it's bad from start to finish.  This is a terrible script, as expected from a movie directed by "Fame" director Ivan Reitman.  The plot of "Ghostbusters" is very typical of a Reitmayer movie.  They are trying to reboot the Ghostbusters franchise with some new characters, and are trying it with a lot of clichés.  We are already familiar with Slimer and the others.  Our only interest is in the "Gangsta", a guy who is in every movie, who can destroy a building in a few seconds with his bare hands.  He never does it, of course.  His main purpose in "Ghostbuster" is to have an argument with Slimera.  What's that old movie cliche?  That's how "Ghost busters" starts.  I guess the real story is that our hero, Bill, has to go to New York to save his friends from an army of ghostbusters.  It's hard to understand this movie, since the actors are not very good.  After all, they have already been in "The Goonies".  I really can't remember anyone from the first movie playing the part of Slimera, and his whole role seems to be just a silly "cliché."  One of the most annoying things about this movie is that it has some good scenes.  First of all, the scene where Slimera and Bill are trying on their old clothes and then the scene when Slimera asks Bill if he was "the ghost" from "The Monster Squad" is a good scene.  If not for the fact that Slimera is a ghost who's only purpose is to make jokes, the Ghostbusters could have been a lot funnier.  Even though we are not told what the plot is, I'm sure it's going to be very similar to the first "Ghosts" movie.   I think this movie could have benefited from the fact they took the "The Fly" script from Ivan Reitsman and changed a couple of things.  But what they did instead is to give the same script to a young director (Reitman) who never worked in a movie before and who probably had to copy the script that was written by a guy named Peter Meisner.  In fact, the film looks
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A "bad movie" is not something you just want to get drunk and watch.   "Bad movies" have to be something that you find "bad" and find difficult to watch. This movie is one of those "bad movies". The movie starts off well enough. It starts off with the main characters in some sort of party, and then they just start to get involved in a whole bunch of "bad stuff" like a woman getting beaten up, a boy being murdered, and the main character getting hit by a car.  Then you have a bit where the main bad guys go into a club that is supposed to be a hot-spot for people looking to hook up.  The problem is that as the movie goes on, things start to fall apart.   The main characters are very young. It is clear that the producers of the movie wanted a younger audience to watch it.  One would think that a film like this would have a more mature or a "real" audience, but no, it is just a bunch of teenagers.  I think the worst thing about the movie is that even with the teenagers in the film, the film still falls into a lot of the mistakes that a lot a "bad' movie has. The thing that I really hated about this movie is the way it tries to make a point. The characters in this movie all want to be part of the "club".  They want to help people find love.  This idea of people being selfish and just "looking out for themselves" is just not interesting to me.  Some people are just naturally bad.  It seems like there was a really good attempt to make this movie about a group of people looking out for each other, but that was very very obvious.  These characters just have no character.  They have no chemistry, and just nothing going on in their heads.  So I'm glad that the movie tries to tell a story, but it falls apart from the very start.  Not only that, but at times I found myself wondering why these teenagers were even there.  What was the point of them being there?   I found that very much uninteresting.  A lot of people think that these "bad kids" are just "bad people" and I feel like that is not true.  There are some good things about this film, but as a whole, I just don't think it was all that good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this film to be very lackluster. It's a long movie and the plot didn't seem to go anywhere. The story is rather boring and I'm afraid that the film will end up with only me as a big fan. If you have the money to spare, I would recommend this movie for you. The only thing that I have to add is that the girl who's in this movie is a real bitch. I'm sure it is just her style of acting.  Rating: 6.5/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    1. "Racing the Night", a poor adaptation of the classic novel by Dashiell Hammett (1920)  Racing The Night is a film which tries to take the best of Dashiella Hammett's The Maltese Falcon and turn it into a melodrama, but they don't succeed.   In the book and the film, the main character, Joe, is an ex-marine who is in need of a job after retiring. His best friend, Jimmy, is a street-wise hustler who always comes up with schemes and plans to outwit the cops. Jimmy knows that the police are after Joe and, after much trial and error, convinces the police that he is a hitman in need and gives them Joe's fingerprints, but not before Jimmy has killed the man responsible for the hit.   Jimmy is on his way to Florida to kill Joe when Joe's family calls and convinces him to stay with them for a while.  Joe is angry at Jimmy for leaving him and he soon finds himself in an old movie theater playing the movie and thinking about how he is going to find Jimmy when he sees the man come out of a closet.    This is when it hits him. The man is actually Dashieller Hammett, the original "M" from Dashielli Hammett.  He kills Jimmy and Joe is about to kill him when Jimmy makes the mistake of opening the closet door to reveal the killer: As the man came out from the closet with a revolver in his hand he said, "Don't make any noise. You are in a room and I can hear you and my son, but you will be quiet or I will kill you in your sleep."  The man, dressed in white, shot at Joe. Joe was shot through the heart.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     "The Devil's Advocate" is the title of a book that tries to explain to a judge what constitutes evidence of a crime and how evidence can be used. The movie "The Devil Was A Lie" is based on the book. The title is taken from a song by the band "Vampire Weekend". The first act consists of a judge, who was on the bench during the trial, explaining a case to a jury. The jury is made up of three men and three women, who sit in a room, with a curtain separating the jury room from the jury and the judge. The judge and the lawyers explain the basic laws of evidence and the difference between a "he said" and a "she said" case. Each party tries to prove their case by presenting evidence to the court.  The first act begins with the judge in his robes and his wig and a thick black beard. After the judge has explained the laws of the evidence, the lawyers begin to cross-examine the witnesses.   The first witness is a young girl who was a victim of rape. The first of the men, who is called by the prosecutor, begins his questioning by saying "this is what I have." The prosecutor tells the young girl that she should remember the feeling of being penetrated. The young girl says "It was like being inside of a vacuum tube."   After the young man has given a description of how he had sex with the young woman, he turns to the woman and says "She was wearing only a bra and panties, and there was no condom."  The young man says "I thought she was a virgin, and I was so worried that if I had had sex before, I'd get pregnant." The girl says that she was raped by "a tall dark man with a beard and a mustache". She says "There were marks all over me. I was bleeding." She says that the first man told her that she had been promiscuous and that he wanted to have sex with her.  The second witness is the mother of the young boy. She states that the boy said that the girl "knew how he liked to be touched and touched him". The mother continues that the "boy" had touched the boy "and kissed him". He continues to tell the mother that the young boys father wanted to be a "good father".  The mother says that he had told her how the boy had masturbated him and had "made
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For many years, we have been told that there is an overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccines are safe and effective. In fact, I have seen that this belief has been widely publicized. It is believed that there are no health problems associated with the administration of vaccinations and that the diseases for which vaccines have been recommended have been eradicated. This belief is based on studies that have been carried out, and in some cases, the results have been published in a manner that is believed to have been "blinded." The reason that this "science" is believed by so many people is because of the huge publicity surrounding the results of studies that are often described in a highly biased manner. Most people believe that if a study does not support the claims of the vaccine manufacturers, they are simply not "real" scientific studies. This may be true in the sense that they did not actually test a real product and test a placebo. However, this does not necessarily mean that their results are invalid. The results of a study may be "real", but it does not mean that they were performed correctly. When researchers conduct a study and have no control group, they do not know what is being tested. However the results can provide information about the reliability of the results. When scientists perform a study that is statistically significant, they have some idea about the results, but they do have to have a control group and control for the possibility that the results are due to the influence of other factors that could have affected the results or may have influenced them. They also have to make a certain level of adjustments to the results for other factors, such as sample size, the types of studies performed, the conditions under which the study was performed, etc. In the case of the measles vaccination studies, the "control" group was people who were vaccinated against measles, but did not get measles and were not aware of the risks associated with measles and the measles vaccine.    The studies in question are the Pediatric Immune Globulin II Study (PIGS) and the MMR II Study. The PIGS were carried out in children with leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and lymphocytic leukemia. The children were given either MMR II or placebo and had their blood monitored before and after vaccination.  The MMR II study was carried out for children with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). It involved children born in the early 1950's and all of whom were born after the rub

You'll see a different side of the movie when it was all said and done. I was looking forward to this movie because it was the first time I had heard of this director and his new film. I am a huge fan of Sam Raimi and the Spider-Man films. So I was really excited to hear more about this new movie. I wanted this movie to be a remake or something. But this movie turned out to be much different. If you have seen Sam Rami's other movies, you will notice that they are much more mature than his other movies. They are more adult oriented. This movie is not adult oriented and there is not much in the way of sex, gore, nudity, or vulgarity. The movie is rather lighthearted and silly, but it has its moments and it doesn't overstay it's welcome. I also love that the film takes a humorous approach to the subject matter. So many adult oriented movies focus on what's in it's mind rather than what is in it. This film takes the opposite approach and focuses on the details and not the sexual content. So this movie is a great movie for people that prefer light-hearted movies. There are other movies out there that are great for this category as well, like The Wolfman. This is a movie I highly recommend to people who are in between the Spiderman and Wolfman movies. But even if you are a fan of the Wolfman, this is definitely a worthy addition to the Spidermans universe. So let's get started. You can click the link below for a spoiler free review of this movie: (SPOILERS) I won't give away too much. But I can say this. When I watched this movie I was a little confused. I felt like it needed a bit more time for it's story to develop. But then I watched it and I felt relieved. And I feel I didn't get

If you want to see a story that will stay with you for a long time, I suggest you stay away from this film." So, how did it go down? We start off with our two heros, T.J. and Davey, being given a ride to New York by a shady driver named Mr. Miller. (Hear the sirens in the beginning!) He takes them to a nice apartment building, where the door is held open for them. There they meet Ms. McPherson, who offers T.A. and D.C. a chance to be a part of a secret government experiment that she and her partner have been tasked with. They have only a short time to decide whether or not they will participate. She takes them into her apartment, and shows them some pictures of the experiments, the results of which are very horrifying and could possibly ruin the rest of their lives. What do you think?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Don't make this about me.  It's not my fault that I had seen some good movies the night before that didn't show up in my queue.   This movie is like that too.  I had a bunch of friends over.  It is probably a good thing that I did.  The house is a nice one, a nice and quiet one.  Some of my friends had no idea what they were going to see on their first weekend of college.  When I saw this movie in a theater, I had no sense that it was a bad one. It was a pretty good movie, maybe even better than I thought it was going to be.  It was about some students at a private college.   The movie had no plot.  No characters.  None of the characters really matter.  But the movie was about a girl who loves this group of guys, and she has to be careful.  This movie is not like that.  If you have ever seen a movie about two people, it might be a good movie. If you don't like two people and you haven't seen movies about two girls in movies, then I don't think you should go see this movie.  Also, this movie is only about two or three guys and the two girls, but that is about it.    There are no characters. It's just the three guys.   This movie isn't about two guys in a college. It isn't like that at all.   In this movie, there are three guys, two girls.  What does that mean?  I think I need a diagram to understand what the film is about. Let me give you a hint.  This movie was made for little kids.  All of the main characters, the lead guys, are little kids in the movie.  That is the whole thing.  Every character in this movie has a little kid named Bob. Bob's mother is named Sarah. Bob is about 7 years old. Bob has a sister named Amy.   Amy is about 4. Amy is pretty little. She is a pretty cute little girl.  Amy has a very cute little face.   And so do all of the girls in this.  And all of them are cute.  No girls are ever like that in real life.  Like maybe, there is some girl who has a pretty nice body.  She probably has to dress up like a little princess
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Rating: R  The movie's overall quality:    What worked:     Overall:      I'd love to give this a 5-star rating, but there are a few areas where I wish I could give it a 1-star.   First, there's an abundance of swearing.  In the movie, we see the aftermath of a nuclear war that killed over a quarter million people.  Most of the cursing is not directed at the protagonist, but at the world's governments, military leaders, and news media.  The movie is about the aftermath, and there's nothing wrong with the gore and the language, but the language and gore should be used to emphasize the story.  Then there's the scene where the main character takes a shower.  During the shower, she's covered in a layer of gore.  While it does add to the horror aspect of the movie and the feeling of dread, it doesn't help much when she's trying to make a phone call.  There are two other scenes in the film that are pretty bad.  One of the characters is on his way to work and his truck's brake lights are out.  After the characters go through a tunnel filled with water, the light goes out and then it just shows an empty tunnel.  It's so over-the-top that it would be hard to find a scene in a worse movie.  This is not an isolated incident, though.  I'm sure other people can't say they've seen a scene like this.  Second, I found it hard to connect with the protagonist.  She's a woman that works for the US government.  Despite the fact that we're seeing her through the eyes of a character that's supposed to represent her, the character does not seem human.  They're both physically imposing, and even their voices are different.  Even when the woman talks about her past, it seems like it's coming from her mind.  If this woman were to be in a movie like Alien, she'd probably be the best thing.  Finally, I have a minor gripe with the ending.  At the end of the film, we get a glimpse of a man on the roof.  When he's finally able to come down, we're told that he died, but we can't be sure.  My biggest complaint about the movie is that the pacing is terrible

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen this movie over and over and am still confused as to why it is getting so many good reviews.   It's a movie about a girl with a very bad past who wants to get revenge against those who have wronged her.  As the story goes on, she finds that revenge may not be as easy as it seems. It's not the easiest thing to watch, but if you're looking for a dark comedy, or horror that doesn't hold your hand, you won't be disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of those movies that you can only describe as a train wreck. It's like when you watch a horror movie, and then later you realize the scary thing wasn't scary at all. And when I say "horror movie" I'm talking about the ones where people get killed off in gruesome ways. It looks like an ordinary horror movie...that's actually a bad horror movie. The bad part was the lack of any real suspense. No one was actually in real danger at all (at least in the beginning) and that made the whole film feel very repetitive and forced.        Sound: The film had a great soundtrack with a great selection of music to go with the creepy ambience. The audio quality was a bit lacking though. I don't really recall any sound effects that were in the film (although I may have missed some because of how quiet and subdued the movie was.) There was a lot of static and static in the background while other times the audio was very crisp.    "The Haunting" was one of the few horror films I've ever seen where the soundtrack was actually better than the film itself.  "The Hitching Post" is an excellent movie and I'd highly recommend it.  "The Haunted House" isn't bad...it's just...you know...not great.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For most of its running time, American Horror Story: Hotel feels like a dream. It's an absurd nightmare in which we get to see a host of bizarre characters—from a mysterious and evil psychic to a group of sluts and thugs that take advantage of a helpless young woman, played by Lady Gaga. It goes as smoothly as a nightmare does, only to reveal itself as a very real nightmare.   There is a very brief moment in the final episodes when the show takes on an almost religious feel, and while it's not a bad thing, it does not take away from the rest of the show. The most remarkable part of American Horror, then, is that it has always been so unafraid to get real.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I just wanted to share this with you and let you know that it's not going to end up that way. I hope this is true. I have a lot of respect for you and I hope the whole thing turns out all right. It could be a really bad movie but that's not what this review is about. This movie isn't about that...and it shouldn't have been, either. I don't want to be a negative critic, though, because my movie is actually better than that. The movie itself is about how terrible movies are, and you just don't have to see it. There is a really good book called Scary Movie 5 that was written by a guy named Robert Rodriguez. It's really good, actually. It was my first ever scariest movie...I bought it to be scary but it turned out to be just a really fun movie. It doesn't contain any of that stupid scary stuff from the previous movies. The book contains some of the most amazing descriptions of the movies and it's just so scary and dark and just the funniest thing ever. The whole movie is really great. It also has the same kind of funny dialogue that the movie had. The last thing I will say about it is that the ending...it's really fucking cool. It even has the most unbelievable twist ending I've ever seen. I was expecting a movie about bad things happening and nothing happens...so there's no reason why I expected a movie with a really scary ending. But I got this...this really fucking scary movie that has that book ending. It makes me wonder what the author was thinking writing this. It really is a good movie. But you don't need to see Scary movies 4 and 5. This one is really really good. It might scare you but it'll make you laugh as well. It won't scare you for too long but it's still a pretty good movie, and the book really is fantastic. Good luck with this. Don't give up. This can actually work out for you, and it will.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The badness of a movie is not how it made me feel about a movie - I am not judging whether the movie is great or not, I am judging whether or not the movie was enjoyable. That being said, "The Room" has made me more interested in movies like "Babe" and "Mulholland Drive" than anything else. If "The Disaster Artist" was a mediocre film, I would be like "What's so bad about that movie?"  It's the fact that I can't stop watching this movie that makes it "bad". In my opinion, the movie never stops being a bad film. That is, until the final act. That's when I can no longer watch the movie and just sit there thinking "What the fuck was that?!" "TheRoom" is not about the movie - it's about the experience. It's about watching a movie that you've been looking forward to, and it never comes. I mean, when the first scene in the movie begins, I knew this was going to be a train wreck. It starts off strong. I was laughing, I was entranced. I would've even kept going, had I not heard that the film was being edited to make it look like they were cutting to a different scene in a different part of the theater.  But as I kept watching, things kept changing and moving back and forth in time and in the story. It was becoming a movie, but I could still see the first part that was set. That was when I began to get sick of the movie.   And when it became apparent that they were changing the movie into a different film and would be cutting away and showing different parts of the "movie" for what was supposed to be the second half, I had to leave.  That's not what makes the movie a trainwreck. It should be that the editing didn't fit the movie, the editing was out of sync with the story or plot, the film itself had problems, the acting was terrible, and the actors were just awful. The only way you could get more "The Hotel" than that is to cut it into a television show or something.  In my mind, if "The hotel" was made into a TV show, I think that it would be a horrible TV show.  Now that I'm writing this review, I'm sure that I'll be saying things that I know I'll regret some day. I
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I didn't see it.   The entire film made me look like a fool!   I was looking at all the reviews and all I could see was how awful it was.  It was a real let down, I didn?t think it was worth the time and effort.  I guess the reviews for the movie were a lot better than the film itself.  The worst part is this was the third film that was a "movie".  It is just another "movie" of "what happens when one guy has sex with the love of his life and then she gets mad at him for a whole year and he moves out".  The problem with the film, was that it was very rushed and it was just too many "fanservice" scenes to make a good film.  Overall, the movie was bad, but I guess it can?t be that bad because the actors were so horrible!  I felt like I was watching the worst movie ever.  1 2 3

The only other animation they've done was for an episode of the show, "The Wild Thornberrys". I knew it had to be a cartoon, but I still thought it was a silly movie. But that wasn't the problem. It's not a good movie. The best part of the movie is the first half, it just goes from bad to worse. Even if you like bad movies you might want to steer clear of this."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Do not give the film a score of 4/10 and a rating of "Gross". You'll only confuse the audience. The only way to get a really good review is to give a really bad film a rating between 2/10 - 4/50. Then the audience will understand why you can't rate it a 10. I gave the film 4 out of 5 stars because it was my personal favorite that I saw last week. It was a decent and decent-sized film with some entertaining sequences and interesting aspects. I really liked it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (See the bottom of the post for details about the video)   The video begins with the man walking up to a woman who he is about to beat and kicks her in the stomach, then his other man shoots the woman in the back and he puts her down.   After this the camera slowly pans towards a truck on the side of the road.  After it pans out the man jumps in, then jumps out again and jumps out a third time.  The last scene he is sitting in the truck with his arms and legs spread wide.   I think this is how a zombie apocalypse would be.  This guy, maybe his family, are going through the motions, but they are not going to last.    We see the truck move slowly towards the shore, then the camera pans down to the shore.  When it stops the video cuts to the next scene.  Once we get to the beach the man is standing in the water with his gun pointed towards a group of kids.  Now that the kids start swimming into the water we see that the man had gone swimming in the direction of the beach.  Then he starts to climb a tree and gets off the ground as the camera fades away.  I think the film is about what the zombie apocalypse could have been like.  It also has a good ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie is not as terrible as it's reputation would lead you to believe. If you watch some good movies, they are not all bad. The movies listed above have some very bad parts. The other bad movies listed here are not bad, but they do not show as many good parts as the ones on this list.   I'm gonna go ahead and admit it... The Matrix is one of my favorite movies of all time. So, why am I gonna write a review about it? Well, because I found it to be a very flawed movie and I wanted to take a look at some of the mistakes I think are in it. And, while I have seen the whole movie (a lot of it), I won't be reviewing it with the whole thing. There's a lot of things that could be said about this movie, but I want to focus on one in particular: the ending. A LOT of people (including myself) have a "the ending" as part of their favorite movie. They're talking about the moment where Neo has a conversation with Morpheus about his relationship with his father. But, it was never actually shown in the movie. This ending never happened. The movie was never told how it was supposed to end. So here is the problem... Why didn't they show this? Why didn.t they show Neo saying, "I'm the only one who can save everyone, and if I don't save anyone then I will have failed?" This movie has this great idea of a great story... And when you have no idea what's going to happen, you're never really sure if it's good or bad. This could have easily been a great movie, and they should have shown it. They probably could have made it good, but for some reason they didn't, and this is why I am writing this review. Because they should be proud of this movie. It's a great example of how not to make a movie. Why they even made this movie in the first place is beyond me. This movie could have been great. I have a feeling it could have also been terrible. This is the biggest problem I have with this movie: The ending. This should have been the biggest question for this movie as it should have killed it right from the start. It is very important to know why Neo is the one who cannot save the world, why he doesn't understand how he is supposed to save people, and why he
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's okay to admit to some flaws.   Even a good movie has them.  This isn't a movie with many, if any.  One of the problems with the film is how poorly directed it is.  For a film that is going to be so highly touted by the critics, the filmmakers have absolutely no idea how to shoot a film.  The camera keeps moving, the actors are constantly changing, and sometimes there are almost no shots at all.  We get to watch an older couple having sex and the guy's arm gets out of his jeans and we hear him grunt in pain.  It almost seems like the director forgot what was going on.  There's an amazing close up of the woman's face as she screams in pain and screams for help.  They can't even get a good close up on the husband's face.  All the shots seem like they were taken from behind.  This is not a movie where you are going to get a lot of action scenes.  Not even close.  I thought they should have hired a real stunt man and the actor playing the husband should have just had a leg.  Instead, the camera keeps running and running.  Even though it's supposed to be in the movie, it seems like they are just running through the house and through the streets.  If a camera is supposed to stay in one place, it should be a long lens.  To make it even more frustrating, the director keeps yelling at the actors, asking them to do things they really can't do.  He seems to be yelling at both the actress and the stunt person.  His yelling is distracting and it does make it hard to focus.  Sometimes I felt that the director was being too demanding, yelling at them constantly to stop something that they should already know how to do. I think one of the best things about this film is that it's not a comedy.  What I found so funny was the way the film tries to be something it's really not.  As I mentioned earlier, the film never tries to look like a movie.  And the actors in this movie don't seem to be very talented.  Like I said earlier, they had to have some pretty good actors to do this movie. They didn't have much of a budget and they hired a bunch of actors who are just terrible.  When a director doesn't know how much a movie should cost, you have to rely

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a decent movie, in that it does its job and gives a good sense of the game and the mechanics.   The problems I had with it were the following:  (a)  The characters are stupid.  The movie begins with the player character, named "Biff", having a difficult time.  The game is running in slow motion, and he's being asked to make the choice of either being nice to someone or getting drunk.  Then he sees a woman talking to someone, and she is getting a bit frisky.  Now what?  The player character doesn't want to be nice to her, but he doesn't know what to do because they've got a bunch of guys trying to kill each other, and that's how the game is being played.  It isn't until he gets to the part where he has to make a choice between being nice and being friendly that it becomes clear that they've already decided who should win, and this is not a game of chess.  He doesn't get an option where he could play a little game to decide who the loser should be, but it makes no difference, because the person gets a bit of a beating and is left unconscious.  (b)   It doesn't explain why he was chosen to be the host, because he just joined the crew, and all the other hosts are random people.  You're not actually playing any of them.  In fact, he does not know the rules of the show and the only reason that he was selected to be host is because he's just so friendly and funny.  If you had never heard of a board game show before, you would assume it was some sort of weird, kooky thing that would make your friends laugh until their sides are bloody.  They are not, however, random people, so the "host" part is pretty pointless.  What is more ridiculous, though, is the way the game works.  To make it more understandable, imagine you're a host and there are five people playing.  Someone is being nasty to you and calling you names, so you decide to take them to the bar and beat them to a pulp, but you notice that if you kill them before they have a chance to fight back, they're going to get hurt.  However, if you wait until you're in their guard, they'll run away and you'll lose points.  So, if

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie did not need the negative review it received at the time.   It's not a bad film, but it doesn't really do much that's different from the other "good" sci fi movies of the time (and there weren't too many, even compared to today), which is not to say that this one isn't interesting or well crafted.  This story is not what's good about this movie: instead, this movie is what's bad.  If there was a silver lining, it's that it's set a trend for future science fiction films.  As a movie, the story has great pacing and the cast and the settings are a bit well thought out.  Unfortunately, there are flaws.  First, this film has a slow start.  That's not to imply that there aren't a few scenes in this movie that are really well done.  However, this is a slow and dull movie from the get-go.  There's a reason this film is set on a spaceship, and it isn't to be found in the script.  Second, there's a big jump in the plot, which is a little bit disappointing.  In the movie, people are running around and fighting, which we already know from earlier movies.  It was the jump in time, and the time jump is done well, but there's also some weird stuff going on, especially with the main characters.  The only other thing I'll say about this plot is that it was good, but not in a "what the hell happened" type of way.  I enjoyed the character relationships.  And I had a lot of fun with the action.  Overall, this was a pretty good movie.  But I do feel that there's room for improvement.  Maybe this is just a one off movie. Overall Rating:  B+ P.S. - The first film is a lot better and a lot more exciting.

I would highly recommend it.   If you are looking for a more gritty take on the Chinese Legend, you will not find anything better.  The story revolves around a warrior named Liu who is caught in the middle between two feuding families.  Liu and a young man named Lu, together with their mother, are going through the dangerous and violent world of the warring tribes.  After a mysterious encounter that involves Lu and a powerful mystical artifact that is called the "Lantern", a mysterious woman named Lu offers to take Liu under her wing and help him get out of the dangerous place he is stuck in. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you don't like it, don't watch it. That's the simple rule. But you know what? You have more freedom. You can make a statement, and say, "Hey, people aren't just making this stuff up. It's real." I think that's important.   I don't know what happened to that kid...   It has been a while since I watched this movie. I thought it was hilarious, and the fact that I have some sort of connection with this movie makes me want to watch it again and again. I think this was a really good idea. The fact that there are people on the internet who think it's "great" means a lot to me. It makes me really happy to know that this stuff isn't just made up.  Well, there was a little girl, who was not good at playing games (because she sucked, no offense to her) and she was also really good at doing the odd dance to a particular song...  In my opinion, this movie is hilarious and a little silly, but I don't think it is as bad as the rest of the internet seems to think it would be. If you really want to see this movie, do yourself a favor and watch it without the internet and with some friends. It won't make you want to kill your girlfriend, but it would definitely make you laugh harder than you thought was possible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen all of them.   This is a movie that had potential, but there was a lot of unnecessary stuff and I was a little bit annoyed by it.  When I saw this movie for the first time, I felt that it would be like "Superbad." but the fact that it wasn't was kind of disappointing to me.  This movie is about a young man named Danny who is dating a girl who is really bad. Danny gets a job at the local pizza parlor, which I'm not sure about. The girls there seem to be really bad, and it seems that he just wants her to be gone.  I think this movie has a great premise and the actors are really good in it. The music is really good and the movie has some pretty good actors. The movie did suck a little, and there are a lot more unnecessary scenes and stuff that I don't understand why the people made it so long. If I had watched this movie on a weekend, I would have enjoyed it a lot.  The film has the potential to be awesome, but it just had the wrong script. This is a short review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     "It's the wrong movie, and I don't want to see it anymore. That's all there is to it. That isn't why I don,t like this movie. That and I really like " The Crow." I also like " A Knight's Tale " (which is about a sword and sorcery movie made by a Christian ministry).   I really can't see why this film is so popular, if it's so bad. And for some reason, my review of " The Spirit " was so negative, that I've actually come out with this review on this. It's not so bad, and it's not even bad for a Christian film. I can actually see why it's called a Christian movie, because of its strong Christian themes. However, it is not a very good Christian film either. The story is about what really happens after the end of the world. And there is no redeeming grace in it. There isn't even a hint of any atonement being attempted. And as for the acting, I didn't like the acting much either. I didn t like any of the characters. None of them were especially likeable. And they didn't come across as human. Even the girl (Christine) in the movie, who is supposed to be a Christian, looked like a girl trying to act like a boy. And it was a very cheesy acting that I don t think was really done well. She came across as a sort of stalker.   " It's the right movie for the wrong reason, and i don't like it anymore." " The Spirit." is a very poor film that I have to say that I did not like very much.  This is not the first time that I hated a Christian-themed movie, but it is the first film that the movie had a Christian theme. I just can t see why people like it. I mean, how can a movie about a demon that wants to take over the earth be good?  I found the story to be rather bizarre, in some ways, even though it was supposed to take place during the end times. And the way that it was presented seemed to me to have a rather strange, almost comedic, tone to it as well. So I found it to be odd that people were attracted to this film. And how can it be good for me to watch something that I do not like? It is a bad film.  I think
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a poor movie. No one was trying to make anything interesting. A bad story is all it had to work on. It would have been better if they had not made the movie for the home video market, since it is a total piece of crap.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I really enjoyed the first part of the movie.   There were several nice things that I liked. The acting of the lead characters were the best I've ever seen. The setting is beautiful. There is an amazing sense of magic and the characters are very believable. I think this movie could have been a good movie if it had a more good director. I am sure it could have had a better plot than it did.  I thought the ending was rushed.  I have seen a few movies and this one was my favorite but I felt the ending rushed the film.  There is a lot of stuff to explain but some things are just left unexplained.  The film ends pretty much on a bad note. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     You can always come back and check out the next episode here.   I did this review in April of 2012 and it's been about 2 years since then. If I were a more cynical person I'd say it's pretty damn good, if you can stand a few of the cheesier, gory scenes from the earlier movies. I'd argue that the story is pretty weak and that the original story was a bit more interesting. I don't think it was very good, but it's a good enough excuse to see the other films.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a complete and total failure.   If you watch the trailer and watch the film you will understand.  The main character is a "snowboarder".  There are more than enough shots of him skating and he does a lot of tricks, but he can't really do any tricks, not even the kind you see in your old, crappy videos.  When a "Snowboarder" tries to do a trick he is always on his toes, so he won't be able to pull it off.  In the end he can do a few things, but it looks like he did them for effect.  He is very much in love with a girl, but they are married and he doesn't get to see her.  After they have a kid you'll notice they don't show much of him.  Then we have the girlfriend.  She has a kid and she does a few scenes, but she has a great personality and is very cool.  At the end she and her kid are going to go skiing and we are promised he'll be with her. So what happens?   She has a stroke and is brain dead.  We get told she is going to be with "her" (the father of the kid).  This kid is the one who was supposed to make his own family.  It was a very sad ending, but we weren't given much more to it.  I found it very annoying that they couldn't tell us the details about the character's past.  There is a big deal about his father being dead and how he feels about his mother, and the father doesn't seem to understand the situation at all.  His dad died at home and he never saw him, and his mother left after he had already been with her for a while.  A lot of times you would think they would just tell us he's gay, but why don't they tell us that when the girlfriend is going away on a vacation or something?  It's very sad that they had a girl who wanted to go to vacation with them, but their father isn't going to let her, so she goes out to find the best place on the planet to spend her vacation.  Why couldn't they show us that it was the boyfriend that died, not the girlfriend?  At one point I thought they were going to show more of her and her dad, but then the mother dies and that was it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Dumb and Dumber To" is a movie about stupid people and the stupidity of their behavior. The movie is about the stupidity behind stupid people, and I have to admit that this film is the worst film I have seen in my life. Dumb and Dummy, or Dumb and Dumber is just a bad idea with terrible acting, and with the bad acting there are also some weird things about the movie that will make no sense to a non-expert. There are some very bad jokes in the movie, as the jokes are all very obvious and obvious. The funny part for me is that this movie is just boring and there is nothing interesting or funny. The acting is terrible, but the people in the film are just weird and stupid as well. I mean there are many people in this movie, but you don't think that they are dumb and stupid because they talk in a way or way that you would expect to see a child in a very stupid movie, right? I think that what is really surprising to me is how the film just seems to have no intelligence, so many things are just not even explained at all. Some characters in this film have a great amount of lines, but when you ask the person if what they just said is true or not, they say that it is. So for me the best part about this movie are the parts when the characters have a lot of lines and when you hear them speaking, you just don't want to know what they are saying because you know that they were just talking like a kid. But to me that is the funniest part because you feel that you are in their position, so when they are talking they have something to say and they don't even know how to say it.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        A movie is a kind of artifact, something to be enjoyed and enjoyed.   For all that we are told in school that a movie should be "honest", this movie really is not.  At best, it is a  bad movie  (as in it is not entertaining at all, but also not truthful at all).   It tells a  dishonest story about an affair, with the truth having nothing to do with the affair, and the affair itself being entirely unimportant to the real story.  This  story  is a lie, a deception, and  deceitful   it is the film itself which is the deceptive part.  Here are a few examples of how this film can be shown: 1.  In the introduction, an old woman says:   "I think people get confused about that. They think of the film as something to entertain and then think of it as truth, which is not the case." (The scene starts here:   2:11.)    There is nothing in this introduction to indicate anything else other than this old woman, who has lived for decades in a house of  lies, is not being truthful to herself or to anyone else.  2.  After watching the film, an actress says: "To me it's very much a story of deceitful people, but at the same time I was very moved by the real life that it describes." (Here the film starts:  3:11)   This sentence is a lie.    The film is not about deceitful, deceitful men, it was about a male who is manipulative, deceit, deceitive, and deceptive to his wife, which makes it completely untrue.  3.  The scene where the woman (played by the young actress) is with a married man and two friends.  These men are a married couple with a son.   In this scene, she says:  "They were all very nice, very nice to her."    In fact, the entire scene is a fabrication.  She was not with them.   It is a film about a young woman who falls in love with a man and decides to spend a lot of money on him, because he tells her he's rich.  This is a bad lie, it's a lie about deception, which means it is entirely untrue. 4.    Another scene where she says,  "I would have loved

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie has no plot. Nothing of value happens, and we don't really care that it doesn't.     The writing is really bad. The film is a comedy. You know what comedy is, right?   It is basically people who are really stupid trying to tell you how smart they are and the movie is exactly the same. It isn't funny.   This movie has an idea that isn't worth following. It is supposed to be the greatest action movie ever, and it turns out to be a bunch of people in spandex who aren't even able to fight like people in the 80s should have been able to.  It has a bunch characters, but they aren't the ones we are supposed to care about.     So there you have it. If you have any love for action movies, this movie is for you. If not, you probably should skip it and watch something that actually is good, like Manhunter or The Raid.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You have a problem:  If you had a problem with this movie, you are not the only one. A majority of you did have a negative view of this movie. But what are you to do? I would also tell you that this movie had a lot of problems but to me, it still wasn't that bad. If you want to be a critical critic, just don't give a shit about it. This movie has a few great moments in it. I was impressed with what they were trying to achieve and the way they were doing it. If I had a chance to see a movie as a teenager, I would've enjoyed this film. It is fun and if you have seen it, there are moments that stick out in your mind. I know that this is an example of what can be accomplished if you work at it and give a crap about it but if you don't, there is nothing to be said about this movie in my eyes. Don't expect this movie to have any heart. It doesn't. I would rather watch a heartless movie and feel happy at the end than watching a movie that was trying to have an emotional impact. For all those who thought this movie could be the next Die Hard: You are crazy. I don't know why I am even typing this.   I love movies like Die Hard but you guys don't even have to get me started. The only problem that the movie had is the fact that there was a huge budget that was used and they didn't manage to accomplish what they set out to do. They didn't even make a sequel. This one movie is not even worth getting if you want a good action movie. There's a couple of scenes that are entertaining but you don�t need to see it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     "A terrible film.   Would not recommend"  – "Seth Rogen and James Franco are bad at comedy, and I'm not a big fan.  -The film takes place in a future where the U.S. is a wasteland where most people are vegetarians. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You can always come back later and give it a second chance.   If you liked the movie and it makes you angry (no matter how it's presented), please let them know.  I'll be happy to provide a review on it.  There is a special place for the reviews that show us who's in control of the movie.  When it's been seen on a special channel or in a private viewing, I won't bother wasting words and go straight to the "bad" part and leave the rest as a "bad".   There are also those of you that will try to write a review that sounds like it's for your fellow fanboys.  No thanks.  You don't need to look to me for advice.  It's up to you.  If there is someone you respect that can give you some feedback, please share it. I am not in a position to help you. It's not for me.  In short:  You should ask questions of the reviewer and they should answer those questions.  As for a review:  It would be an insult to this movie if I didn't say something positive about it. The movie does not need a "progressive" message. It just needs to be a fun, quirky and entertaining movie with some interesting story.  The "badness" can be either a good or bad movie, but it's not the "critic's" job to judge it. We simply look at it to judge the people involved.  At least the review is honest and fair to the person involved. You'll also notice in most reviews that there are a lot of references to the book. You can read the book for yourself and find out if it's your cup of tea. If it isn't, then it isn  I've been reading some of the reviews on this movie and there are some that say the movie is better than the book because there was no story that the people from the book didn't already do. That's like saying that the movie "improves" on the book! This movie is a great movie, the book is fine and so is the movie! They both exist within the same universe.  This isn't a review of the book, just of the film. I want to do a little research about the book before I start, since I've heard people say it was awful, but the movie does pretty much nothing to ruin the book's good parts
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was not a good movie.   I really wanted to like this movie and be proud of it.  But it just wasn't a good one.  I don't understand why it was such a hit.  They have such a great idea of how to play it and how to make it a hit movie, but for whatever reason this movie just wasn´t a success.  It is a real shame because I liked the director a lot and the actors they picked. I was really looking forward to seeing it again after seeing it once in the theater.  There was so much potential in the plot, but it just just wasn`t there.  A lot of the time the film just just seemed like it was going to end with the same old thing.  And that was a shame because it had a great ending. But it is one of those movies that had promise. I would have liked to see more of it, but I guess that is just life.  There were a lot of cool ideas in the movie, especially the way they were going to show the life of a normal guy who just gets his life turned upside down by a whole bunch of crazy things. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What's so bad about The Shining?   There are some problems that seem like nit-picks, but that's not what I mean. I'm not talking about the fact that I think it's badly made. It's poorly shot, and has some really silly effects, but it does its job at horror and doesn't seem to go overboard. I've never seen a remake of a horror movie that was better than the original, and that's saying a lot because I don't usually like horror remakes (but I love all the originals). It's also worth pointing out that they've replaced Jack Nicholson with Jack Nicholson. The Shining also had one of the best performances of his career, but I'm still not sure if he was ever more in character than he was in the first film. I haven't seen any other movies with an evil clown. This version has Stephen Graham playing the killer clown.   The story is really not that bad. The movie follows Jack Torrance (played by Jack Nicholson) as he goes into the Overlook Hotel to figure out what's happened to his sister, Edith. He tries to get in, but he can't stay long because of the haunted rooms in the hotel. There are a few other things that don't work in this version of the story, but they don't feel like major issues.  I have nothing to complain about about the movie and all it needs to be done is for it to be a theatrical release.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is a masterpiece, not to mention a classic. It is one of the best science fiction films ever made.   One thing that really stood out for me was the amazing special effects. Every scene looked stunning and the special effects were just beautiful. If you can get past the fact that the movie is rated PG, you'll see why this is one amazing film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie again a year or so ago. I liked it a lot better then I did then. I think that the director and the actors are really good, but it is not a good movie.   (The title of the movie is  ) a way to say "a bad movie" in an ironic way.  When I see , it makes me laugh. The movie is bad. But it is a comedy. It is not like ) I can do it again.  I would rather make a movie that is very funny and not just an action-horror movie. I would like to see a comedy with a good storyline. A good script and good actors. The main problem of the story is that you have to see it to understand the movie. It has lots of action scenes, and a lot of gore, but nothing happens.  After watching this movie, I went to a horror movie with no gore and you could see how much better the movie was. But I could tell it was a better movie with a great story. I thought this is a very bad movie with bad characters and bad directing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My daughter liked "Maggie's Plan"   She told me she was excited about going and was looking forward to it   I liked it but I found it annoying   The girls didn't talk like real life people.   They just talked with the same inflections in their voices.  There were other reviewers who seemed like they had never seen the movie, but they enjoyed their experience.  What's wrong with this picture?   It was funny.  It wasn't.  The story was so silly.  I guess if you want to see a funny movie about teenagers going to high school, that is what you are going to get.  There is also a scene in this film where they are watching a movie.  If I saw this movie when I was 14-15 and were thinking to myself "Oh, I'm too old to do this!" I think I would have quit right there.  You see a kid talking in this movie and I think to myself... I would think they were talking about a teenager or some other type of human being.  Maybe a cat.  No way am I going to watch this movie again.  - Rating: F
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I saw a movie the other day that got my hopes up. The movie was about a man who has a strange vision, and it was a great one. But I wasn't very happy with it. It took me a minute, and I'll tell you why. It was a poor attempt at a satire. If you were a comedy buff, you would find it interesting. But, if you were looking for a serious look at the human condition, then you'll hate it. For one thing, I can't stand most of the actors. Their voices sound like they have to drink gallons of milk to get them to sound normal. The writing and acting was awful. It also took me by surprise that the director made an attempt to be satirical, but only in the most superficial way. What this means is that, like most films in this genre, I would never go and see this movie again. I will have to try my luck with the other three, to see if they are better."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In my mind, the best movies are ones you are excited to see even though the final product doesn't live up to your hopes.   The worst movie I've ever seen was one of those.  In the late 1980s, a cult classic film, "The Dead Zone," was made that was made with a completely different set of resources than the original film.  When it was first released, it flopped, but by 1986, the movie had made a significant jump in popularity thanks to re-edits and a complete new script.  The director, Tom Savini, had been involved with many horror films, but the film that really stands out is the remake by filmmaker/writer John Carpenter ( "Halloween," "Resident Evil.")  The film follows a scientist and a paranormal investigator who work together to investigate mysterious occurrences.  After they leave the town, the investigator takes an ill-fated road trip that leads him to the abandoned, mysterious and abandoned town of Amityville, where he finds an abandoned house full of creepy things that have begun to grow.  Carpenter was at the height of his career at this point in his career, having just made "Dark Star" and just made the remake of "The Thing."   While the new film is not a remake, it is still a horror film. "The Devil Inside," which was made in 1982, was directed by and features two stars of the original.  In the movie, a priest (Michael Myers) and a psychiatrist (Freddie Prinze Jr.) are called to a psychiatric facility when a teenager (Melissa Joan Hart) goes insane.  "The Devils" also features many of the other original cast members, including Angela Bassett and John Saxon.  Despite some of the horror elements that are brought into the movie by "The Damned," which has to be one of the scariest horror movies ever made, the new version is still pretty scary.  One of the most memorable scenes comes at the end of the movie when the psychiatrist leaves the facility and heads off into the woods.  Before he can go any further, he is confronted by a demon that is holding the psychiatrist hostage.  As he fights off this monster, it grabs a hold of his head.  This scene is truly terrifying.  You have this demon that has an almost demonic quality to it.  It grabs the head and yanks it back and forth, screaming and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie is a movie that's bad.   This is an   bad movie.  It's the worst   movie i have ever seen.  It's a   crappy movie. I would   not   recommend   watching   it   if   you    do not    like   violent   movies  .   My name is     Jules and I'm a    new   redditor   who   loves   anime   and  loves  dramatic films  , so when I saw a movie named   "      Kaze no Stigma"   that has a female lead who is  totally useless in a fight scene, I had to find out more about it. So I started searching for more information about the movie and eventually came across a review by an anime  fan that has already seen the movie. It is written by a Japanese blogger on his blog and I highly recommend everyone to read his review and see for themselves how bad this movie really is. I found out the following details about the   film: The story is about a guy who becomes a monk and finds he can see ghosts and the people that he killed.  He kills these people to survive so he has to go into hiding. The movie starts off   with him being arrested by the police.  However   this was a setup for a later plot point.  The movie is about   a guy with a knife who becomes an assassin and kills people because he wants to live and get revenge on those who killed him.  This guy is played by   Kazunori Kikuchi.  He is not the worst actor   but he was not great either.  Like the movies  voice actors were very bad.  The movie was not bad in terms of story or directing but  it's a very bad movie that has absolutely no redeeming factors and if you are not a fan of   violence   then   DON'T WATCH IT!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   1. " The Last Dragon " This movie was crap.   -   I was surprised that this movie was as bad as it was because they had made a lot of money with the original, but this was a much more poorly written, much less enjoyable movie.  The film opens up with the narrator saying something like, "I was born in a forest. When I was four I lost my mother, my father, and my siblings in a tragic car accident. I was adopted by the first woman who would ever hold my hand.  Her name is Dara (Jennifer Coolidge)  The last dragon." The story starts in the future where the earth has been conquered by the aliens.  When the last dragon is born the whole population of earth begins to get killed off one by one, all the while, the dragon is growing more and more powerful.  He and his girlfriend go to a small town where there's a school for dragons. The dragon is so powerful that he has an unlimited appetite for human flesh. He makes a deal with the school to use the school as a base to breed more dragons.  (I think the "garden of the gods" thing was a reference to the Chinese emperor.)  (This is the only time the dragon actually speaks in the film. Other than that, we never see him or Dara's mother again. It sounds like there were two dragons in this movie, but there is one dragon and two dragons. You'd think they would have included them in the sequel.  A lot of people have called this a movie that is very well made and has a lot to offer, but I believe that it does not deliver on the promise.  - - - 2. " A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors " This movie is very similar to " The Dragon King ". Both movies open with a narrator telling us that the evil monster, The Dragon Lord, is coming and he wants to take over the earth.  In this movie we meet three other kids who are scared by the dragon.  One of them is the same child who is killed by the monster in the original movie. He has his mother's scar and a mysterious scar over his face.  All three of them have their faces scarred by the same monster. He is after the children to get their blood.  They all join forces to fight the dragon, but all three of their weapons are made of metal.   In
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What we have here is a film that has some of the best special effects ever, but is really a big disappointment. The script was very original. It starts out as a thriller, but soon becomes very predictable. I don't know how the producers were supposed to get through the middle part of the film, when the story becomes so uninteresting. The plot of the movie was quite intriguing and it took me awhile to see the obvious twists and turns. Some of the special effects were very effective. I especially liked the scene when the little girl is looking through her microscope and sees a spider. The movie starts off as a mystery and then becomes a thriller. It had a great cast and there were some great moments. I do wish they had left out the scene with the spider and the little boy, but the movie wasn't as bad as I thought. The picture and sound were very good. The story was good and there was a lot of suspense.   The movie was not a very good one, and I can't give it a good rating.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        The only good thing about this movie is that it wasn't really bad.   It did the same things over and over again with little variation in the plot.  But it is a boring movie,  so not exactly the best movie to watch at 3:00 am on a Sunday.  I did enjoy that the movie was on Netflix,  I would be able to watch it again in ten years to see if it was any better.  The movie is mostly about an over-excited kid in high school who has a problem with girls,  he's a little over the top, and pretty much every girl he kisses (except for a girl named Heather) hates him.  He starts making a movie, called "The Loner", which is a movie about how great a guy he is.  For some reason, all his classmates get together and watch this movie with him.   Then a few days after filming, he goes to a Halloween party, and he and a couple of his friends sneak into a girl's locker room.  This is kind of messed up, and it ends up with some bad things happening.  And then at the end of the movie, after he sees a movie starring Heather (a girl he doesn't want to get to know),  he finally comes out of the closet.  So yeah, it's like he finally admits he is gay to everyone.  It's a pretty lame ending.   I saw this in an old school movie theater, and for some reason there are a bunch of old-school movies playing.  One of them was this movie.  We didn't do anything special with the movie. I mean it wasn of low quality.  That doesn't mean it was bad. The only reason we made it a point to watch this is because the movie doesn't end.  They just play it over and you can see the ending.  Then after watching this movie you will have a new found respect for a movie called "Tower of Terror". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was not at all my idea of a fun movie. The plot had me on the edge of my seat and the cinematography was pretty great. All in all, a great movie but not one I'd recommend to anyone. Rating:  A So this is how your parents' Christmas gets spoiled: by letting you watch a movie at Thanksgiving!   The only "good" thing about this movie is the kids (who are all a little over 12) have some fun with it. They were acting the way I imagine a bunch of 12 year olds would act at their parents' expense. So a win-win for everybody!  It is a shame that they had to be so cruel to a little girl in this movie, as she was very sweet and had a wonderful attitude.   She was my favorite character of the film.  I would not let my kids watch this movie again!   Final Score:    1 1/2 Stars
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't see this movie to be an overall negative review, as it does have some moments of excellence and some of the characters have great development.   But for all intents and purposes, it is a complete and utter failure.  You have this incredibly well-produced movie with great visuals and actors and even though there are moments of greatness, it ultimately falls short of greatness.  I will give it credit for one thing, however.  The story and characters are not exactly complex, but the story is not as bad as people make it out to be.  It takes the concept of the supernatural very seriously and this is how you make a movie this good, and it also helps that this movie has a good plot.  If it weren't for the fact that this is only one of two movies that were produced in the 90's with the same director as 'Rango' and 'The Blair Witch Project' (The first film being a more grounded and realistic horror than the latter, and the second being a much more comedic horror), I might be giving it more points.  So in that sense, it did pretty well on a small budget.  That being said, the cast does not make up for what is lacking in the story and acting and the acting is actually much worse than the story.  Some of the actors in this movie are actually bad at their roles, and they do not have much of an understanding of how to actually play the parts.  One of the biggest problem with the movie is that it does not work well for the budget.   This movie was supposed to be produced for less money and had no budget for anything else other than the actors and the camera crew.  Sure, some of this could be put on the director for directing, but in a film this poor it is difficult to make up the difference.   Plot:  There are some good scenes and some bad scenes, but none of them are really good.  This is a movie that has no plot and it doesn't really have a good script either.  In a movie with this much production value, you would think they would do something to build up tension.  And yet, they don't.  There is a certain amount of tension that is introduced throughout the movie, but it is completely lost on the viewers.  But that is a matter of opinion.  Many people would think this movie is a good story, because it has some great actors
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like this movie? Watch the trailer for "Bad Ass". It is also one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. This movie is not about a guy trying to pick up some girl. This is not a film about a couple of guys who don't know how to be together. This film is about a man who is in a bad situation. The guys aren't the guys you want to see. He just wants to be happy so he comes to an old guy for help. The old man thinks the guy is going to die but then he meets the love of his life. The film is written by an independent filmmaker and stars a guy who is very funny. The movie has a little romance with a very good story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      "   We were expecting a good night of fun, but we ended up having more of a bad night, and then some, I feel for the people at my house who couldn't get a good seat, but at least it was worth it. This movie was so cheesy that it's hard to believe it was made by a real production company. It's just too bad that they can't see that it was never meant for a wide audience, but I guess that's the world that we live in these days. "  "  It's a terrible movie and it doesn't hold a candle to the other 90s-tastic crap that came out on a weekly basis, but this time, there's no chance for the movie to be so bad, but a big movie director like this is supposed to take chances. I'm so glad I was in my teens when the first Star Trek movies came out, and I never even got to see one of them. And, I didn't see The Last Starfighter either. But, it's not a bad thing, the movie was a big mistake. "
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So, I love movie reviews. I love how you get to know the movie better, get the details. But this movie was very disappointing. I have had some bad movie experiences before, but this was so... I had been looking forward to seeing it, and now I will be seeing it at my home. The cast of characters are so... lame, and they are not funny. All I want to do is see the cast of people from the show who would be the cast in this movie. I want them to bring their character's back and it is really sad. I think this movie could have been great if it was made by people who could get the humor and the story. The story was so boring. The movie had no romance, there was not even a main love interest. It was just so boring, I didn't have the heart to sit through it. The actors really needed to stop working. The people in this film were so uninteresting. The music was just horrible, the dialog was so lame and it didn't feel like anything was happening. So I'm going to be giving this movie a 0. I don't think that it is worth seeing at all. Do not waste your money on this movie, if you like the show then you will love this movie!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is awful.  The story is extremely unoriginal and does not have anything to offer.  I watched it in theaters with my son. He was 13 and had never seen a bad film, and I think he would have enjoyed it even more if he had.  What a shame, because I truly did enjoy this film.  This is an awful movie for all ages and should be avoided.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film was just okay. There wasn't much going on, but if you're looking for an action film, you can watch it, even if you don't really know how it should be done. I wasn't looking for a serious action film and thought it was a good start for a great villain, but it really doesn't go anywhere.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first two or three minutes of this movie are a masterpiece. After that, it goes downhill. The acting in this movie was so-so, but the story was so poorly written, that the only thing you could really relate to were the crazy people and that made it all the more annoying. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I do not recommend this movie to anyone. I will say that I would not have minded watching this movie again but I didn't want to. I feel like there are some people out there that like a good horror movie, but I personally did not enjoy it.  "I'm coming for your car"  What the hell's wrong with you? I mean, you just wanted to have a nice little relaxing night out with your girls and your new pet. But, the world's a cruel place and that's exactly what the person in this car was. You had no idea this person was a psychopath until she said, "I'm going to get your car. I'm coming here for your money." Your response? A few seconds later "Uh, okay." But then you hear her screaming, "Don't come anywhere near my car!" and the world goes to shit. This was the worst experience of my life. I would never want to put my daughter in this situation, and it sucks that I just had to spend another night of my weekend being a single dad. Posted by: Chris at October 7, 2005 01:46 PM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You are welcome to be a negative reviewer about a movie, but please try not to be so negative about it.   A negative review is just as much a negative description of a movie as a positive review.  Please understand that every movie has a few things wrong with it. You can only review a movie once.  You can't judge the whole movie from one review. It would be like you judging the whole country from just one review of some random place.  Don't get so caught up in how the negative reviewers were just "stupid" and "wrong" and should have known better.  The world is full of people like that. It happens. I'm sorry you feel that way. You are probably just as angry about something as I am. Maybe your angry about me, but I am angry about someone.  Try to take a step back and look at it like an adult and realize that this movie isn't perfect, just like every other movie.  If you just keep saying "I hate the movie, I hate the actor, I want to give the movie a zero", then I might have a little more sympathy for you.  No one likes a douche.  It is also true that there are bad movies. There are also good movies. It is just a different problem with how people view movies that makes a bad and good movie a bad or a good movie, respectively.  So let's take a look at some movies.  I just took a look for a movie called  The Thing  and I just found these reviews that aren't about how bad the movie is.  One person says " It is a horrible piece of film. It has some things that are terrible. I didn't care for any of the characters, but the movie just got more and more awful with every minute of its running time.  But it's the direction and writing of this movie that sucks. The movie is just awful. The characters feel like they were just plucked out of the pages of a Stephen King novel.  " Another person says: "   The Thing is an odd beast. It's a horror movie at heart but it also has a great blend of the psychological horror genres. The Thing works great because it is a very believable story. It gets under the skin of its audience as we follow a group of people who are trying to survive a nightmare.  In this film there is some terrific writing. There is plenty of
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "Farewell" of Memento and the "End" of The Prestige (1997) One can say that the two Mementos are like two pieces of a puzzle: one piece is a story by Christopher Nolan which he based on his experiences as a film director and the other is a novel written by Tom Wells which tells a story about a boy who was the victim of a crime and who was able to see the whole picture of the events that were taking place around him.  The two are so much interwoven that they are almost impossible to see as separate pieces of narrative. The book MementoS by Tom  Wells  is a  story about young boy, Mementoin who was  kidnapped  from London in the late 1800s.  Memento starts by telling how he saw his dead  mother  being  tortured  by his grandfather. MementOin then follows the life of Mimento, who had  met his mother   and she had met his grandfather, who are the main two characters of the story.   The movie Mementoss  tells the story of the same boy, who is now  in jail  for a crime he committed in the 1800s and whose parents are now dead.   The main difference between the two is that the book tells a  much longer  story with a lot more development and drama in the story, while The Prestiges movie is much more lighthearted and light-hearted but not much more serious than the original novel. MmentOin also ends with a happy ending with the death of Mmento, but unlike the movie, which ends with some sort of moral question, the movie Mmentoe ends with Mementot and his parents dying  in a car crash (and his mother and grandfathers die in a car crash  as well).  But  Mementon in The Prestiggse is not a happy end.  He is in prison  because he killed a guy in a duel, which is actually a very dark idea for a movie: the twin brother who is trying to defend his brother is a killer. The movie is more like an apocalyptic story, which we can't say much more about but which was actually  well executed in a dystopian setting.  One could say that MementOs is
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best movies are ones that just go out and don't tell a story and just give you a great story.  The worst movies are those movies that tell a really good story and make you think. The worst of them is a shitty story and a shitty movie. There are only two movies I really love, the ones with Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. I love the other two ones that I watched. The others were not as good. The movie does not hold up to reality. This is a movie about a group of people. They are just trying to keep their kids alive.  I do not care about any of this.  This movie tries to tell us something about these people who we don't really care about. What would it take to keep a kid alive? They try to keep them alive and end up helping them.  It is only the parents who are doing this. I do believe there is more to the story than what this movie tells us.  This movie really feels like it is trying to make a film about how horrible a life parents have.   I would rather have a story about how the person that wants to do something great for their kid does it, than one about a bunch of parents fighting to keep the kid alive.  I do have to give some credit to the director of this movie. This movie is probably the most authentic of the ones I have seen. This film was very real. There were no actors pretending to be the parents. This was real.  Even though it feels real in every way.  In fact, when the kid starts dying and you realize that it was all just a movie.  You just feel so bad for the kids.  They were just trying something for their kids. It is just so sad to see the kid just die right before your eyes.  Then when the mom is getting ready to leave and you see her crying like you are.  But the best part about this movie is the ending. And it is the best ending of all of the movie. So sad.  This movie is so bad.  So bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie had a bad plot (in terms of plot twists and characters' motives) and horrible acting. The movie starts off really interesting, but everything about it falls apart in about 45 minutes. In terms of acting, the movie has nothing going for it:  This was probably the first movie where I didn't feel any of the actors were doing their jobs as actors. In fact, the only ones who played themselves were great:  But when it comes to directing, the film is like an episode of The Walking Dead:  There is very little action to the movie. That's why I can give the movie a 5 star review. But it has nothing for the fans of the series or fans of zombies to watch, so those should give it a 2 star rating: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is a horror film which has been re-edited in the movie for the remake. The film is based on a novel by Stephen King. The movie has no plot, and the main character's voice is completely unheard.  The movie also has many different characters with all manner of strange attributes: A young man who wants to be a doctor; a young man in an evil man's costume; a teacher who wants a cure to a deadly disease; an evil clown; a girl who wants the man's power; and a scientist who wants answers to questions about the nature of life and death. The plot revolves around the characters and their quest for answers. There is also a "monster" who wants people to die. The monster in the first movie is not quite so big in size; in this one, he is. The cast includes: Patrick Wilson, James Remar, Michelle Williams, and Mary Steenburgen. The remake is by the people behind The Blair Witch Project and The Omen. In the remake, the original character is an orphaned girl who was taken from the hospital. She is an avid reader and can talk to people. She has an older sister and a mother. The character has two brothers who want to find her. She can't remember who she is, where she is from, or where she was taken. She says that she is a nurse and is taking care of the boys. . The second movie also features a young girl, but this time her father is not her father. The girl's name is Claire Dearing and she is only a year younger than Patrick Wilson's character in the original. This new version of the movie focuses on the search for Claire Daring and her father, Mr. Dearing. After her mother's disappearance, Claire's father went on to work as a mechanic on the railroad. There he meets a young boy named Brian, who is played by James Remarat. A man has kidnapped the young girl and the two begin their quest to find the girl and her dad. In this movie, there is also the young boy with two female companions who are not related to the boy in the second movie. The first movie features a man in a white suit, and this version also includes a girl. The man is not an evil person, but he does have a plan to destroy a town where children are playing a game of "pinkie pie". The movie also is told in two parts, one involving
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One good thing: The book is written in a clear, easy-to-understand style. I recommend that you read it in its entirety and don't skip any of the sections that you find important. Two good things: This is a good review of The Dark Tower series, and it does an excellent job of introducing you to some of the key characters and providing context. Three good things. The writing and structure are excellent, and the author manages to cover a lot of ground while leaving nothing unsaid. The ending is interesting and leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. Four good things, but none of them is really earth-shattering. Five good things would have made a good book, but this is not one of them.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     There are times when I think the show is just an awful, horrible, terrible movie.   I'm not saying that the movie is the worst film ever, but it's pretty damn good at what it does.  You'll watch it once and never want to look at the TV.  There are some things about the movie that are truly horrible.  What I mean is, the movie starts off okay but then it loses its way pretty quickly.  There is this great scene in the movie when a woman, who is the lead in a movie called "A Love Story" tries to kill herself but she's so hopeless that she tells herself that it'll never happen.  You can't help but feel for her at one point when she's in the hospital.  But then, when the film ends, she gets back into the limo and she takes a shot at the same guy she tried to kill in the beginning of the movie. She fails and goes back to him and he kills her.  It's just so awful and it's so unnecessary, but that's what happens in movies.  The movie starts out okay and then it doesn't really work.  This was also the second movie in a row that had a guy that was supposed to be the "bad guy" try to kill his wife at some point.  He wasn't a bad guy.  We know that at the beginning.    He tried to marry her but she couldn't bear the pressure and she decided to marry a "different man" for a while.  These kinds of movies can be really cheesy and just awful.  They're a waste of time and money.  I have a feeling that the next movie will be just as horrible.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have to admit that the film did not live up to my expectations.  The script was a bit cliche, the story was predictable and the characters were underused. I will admit I was expecting a more intense, suspenseful movie, but there wasn't a lot of suspense and the scenes that were actually suspenseful were few and far between.  My favorite part about this movie was the ending because it was the perfect mix of predictable and exciting.   The main problem with this film was the acting.  One of the film's best aspects was the strong chemistry between the two main characters, but the supporting cast really lacked.   The actors really showed how they could pull off a good performance, but it wasn't like they were great and the others were average.  Overall:  The film wasn't as exciting as I expected it to be.  I will give this movie a 3.5/5 because of the plot, and because it made me laugh a lot.  It has a lot to live up and an awful lot to learn about the human condition.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is a mediocre thriller with no redeeming quality. If I had seen it before I would have had a lot more fun with it, but that would have only made me hate it more. This is my 1st time seeing this one. The film starts out very interesting and it gives me that "what's your deal?" vibe that makes me want to know more about the characters. However, as the film progresses, the character development gets very shallow and the storyline gets extremely boring. The plot, with a premise that would be great in a novel or short story, becomes a series of extremely generic plot devices that have been used time and time again, and with a much higher amount of violence and gore that I've never seen in a film. While I'm not a horror fan, I enjoyed the film more than I should have. There was some very tense and scary moments and the film did have a few really interesting ideas. However the film loses a lot of it's luster towards the end and becomes very predictable. The best moments were at the end, when everything turns to chaos.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was too boring. There were too many plot holes to keep me entertained. It was overkill to have a group of criminals as antagonists. And the main villain was a guy I thought I already knew from a movie (I'm thinking it was the character from "Tales of Suspense") and the only interesting character was the bad guy himself, but not only that, he was in this movie for the most part. He was too much like the guy from that movie. And in the end, there were a couple of moments in this film where I didn't know whether or not it was a parody or if the director actually made it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    * If you didn't love the movie, please, leave a bad review about it, because there is nothing I want more than someone who hates me telling me how bad I am.   I had a dream I was in a movie. And there I was, a woman who is in love with a man, and she is a bad person.  A really good movie.  I loved it.  And I can't believe someone can't like it.   The plot of this movie is stupid. You know, it's not like the movie was good. There is nothing bad about the plot, and it wasn't really worth watching for the plot.  The characters are so bad and so one-dimensional.  It's so hard to find characters in a bad movies that really make you hate them.  So you watch this movie hoping for a good movie, and that doesn't happen.  This is a movie where the plot is bad, but everything else is great.  If you don't like the characters, the story, or the actors, leave the movie. I am telling you, you can't please everyone.  Please tell me what the characters are like, what the story is about, and then tell me if it's a good or bad movie.  I love good movies, but not always.  Also, how is a plot bad?  I don't see how there is a whole movie about it. Why make a whole plot about it?  How come they didn't just take all the scenes of people talking, and insert them into a movie?   What are they trying to accomplish with a plot?  The story is just one long joke, but it does make sense.  Because the plot of the movie is not that good, it doesn't matter.  They use the plot to make us laugh, but there is no plot, it just makes the audience think.    The plot in this movie was so bad, that it just ruined everything about this movie. In fact, it is a joke, and if you think it's funny, it made me laugh.  This movie was just so bad.  It made me want to stop watching it. But I couldn't stop watching the movie for the reason of the plot and characters.  This movie was horrible.  Why do bad movies make me want them to stop?  It makes me want it to end.  But what do you
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the book, the story has a similar story. It was supposed to be about a boy and his dog who went to school. A monster came out of the sky, and destroyed a town and its people. There were only two survivors in the world who escaped with their lives.   The boy and dog tried to escape from the city, but there were not enough trains left in the city to get to the top of the mountain.  A truck came and took the boy and the dog. After they got out of school, the boy went to work, and the guy who had taken the boy said that they should keep a watch on him. So they made up a story to protect him.  This boy's name is Ben, and he is the only survivor of a world destroyed by a supernatural monster, and his life is saved by a man who looks like a monster.  Ben's dog was named Pupa, and she was found by a young boy named Luke, who also escaped the destruction of a city, and after a long time, they found themselves in the mountain with the boy's dog Pupae.  They lived there as a couple for a long period of time, but in this world, Pupea was a wolf.  Luke tried to kill Pupaea several times, but each time, he failed to do it.  In this movie, Luke and Ben are the same age, so they are going to school, but Ben has no education. Ben wants to go to college, but the school is closed. Luke wants to get a job, but he has no money.  They are looking for some work.  The movie was called "The Monster", but they decided to call it "The Beast" because the movie was done by a director who is known for horror movies.  There is also a character named Rolf, and a character who looks very similar to a monster called a "Demon", and there are two scenes in which a monster is seen.  "The Creature" came out in 1973.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a little silly. There's a whole bunch of characters that can be played off as completely insane and it's hard not to take them that way. And there's some very good comedy in the film. I enjoyed it, but it was a little too silly for me.  The movie is not the worst bad movie ever made, but if you're expecting a good one then I recommend that you take your time. The score was just okay:  When I saw the movie I didn't know what the score was going to be. I thought it was going be really fast-paced with some really good action. But it's really slow and uneventful. I guess I was expecting something more like a action film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So it was good.    I mean it's the only movie I've ever seen that I loved so much.  The story is very entertaining.  I'm really happy the movie stayed with the premise.  It's very simple, but it's also very fun and the movie is a lot of fun to watch.  There is a strong theme running throughout the movie: it's what happens when you meet people from a totally different world, when you have to deal with an unfamiliar language, when it comes to having an identity.  And it's interesting how it manages to keep it's story entertaining despite that.        The music is really well done too.  If the movie was done as a film, I think it would have been even better.  A must see for any Star Wars fan  For my first time watching it:  Amazing, fun and cool to watch, very much worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    We've reviewed a lot of movies in the past and we can honestly say, most of the ones we saw were just not that special to be honest. Sure, a few were pretty good, but the majority of the time, we just were watching something that wasn't that special. There's a lot to look forward to when it comes to anime, and it's not like it gets a lot worse than most of what we have in the West. As I was getting into the end of the year anime, I saw a couple of movies that were decent, but not really worth mentioning at all. The only reason I was even considering the movie was because of the premise, and I guess a movie is not meant to be an anime. If you're going to watch a movie that has a concept that is supposed to be scary and creepy, make sure that movie delivers on its expectations. This movie does just the opposite. This movie is a remake of a short film called "Sekaiichi Hatsukoi" (High school girls at school) and it was originally released in 2000. It's just a really old film that was never released here, and was only shown in Japan. There are some decent aspects to it, and the story does at least make sense. The main story is just about a group of students going to an ancient city to perform their "idol" dance for a show. The premise is rather boring, the characters are pretty generic, and nothing really gets explained, but it does get interesting towards the end, which makes this movie worth watching. One thing that I like about this movie is that the film doesn't try to go into some really dark or depressing plot, and actually doesn't give too much information about the situation. There were some points when I thought the plot was getting a little too deep, but nothing was really happening that I felt was out of the ordinary. The film ends up having it's share of scenes that are just kinda creepy. For example, there was one scene where a girl gets stabbed in the stomach, and when she goes to the hospital, she's revealed to be the "idols" main dancer. It was a really disturbing moment that made the movie quite unpleasant to watch. There were some parts of this movie where I felt like I couldn't believe that such a thing was real, and that was the case when the "ghost" was shown to be this old woman. She
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was called 'I'm Not Here' by Steven M. Goldblatt, a man I have never heard of but his name does sound familiar.   The movie was the directorial debut of one Steven M Goldblatts. The movie took place in a small town that is completely deserted and has been since the 1950's.  The main character, Michael, lives in a trailer park with his mother, father, sister and a dog.  Michael loves his mother and wants to have a normal life with her, but she thinks he is sick and gets very paranoid about him, especially after his friend, Chris, turns out to be a boy that Michael knew in the past.  In order to help her son, Michael tries to go back to school so he can attend the same high school as her.  But this is a trick as Michael is a terrible student who doesn't know anything about any of his high school subjects.  His mother's fears are finally confirmed when he is forced to confront a local man called Jack, who turns out not to be what he seems.  At the end of the movie, Michael gets the courage to confess that he has feelings for the boy and breaks up with Chris.  This is a movie that does nothing but make Michael look like a complete idiot who's afraid to be himself, but I can't think of a better movie title for a movie with that title.  A little more research on Steven M, I think this is the first film he made, and this is also the first one he has directed.  My only regret is that I don't know enough about Steven M to make my own decision about his future.  The acting in this movie was horrible but that's a given.  I'm not an actor, so I can only comment on what I know about actors.  It was a terrible movie for me to see.  A small girl looks like a doll in the movie: (from the book'The Diary of a Woman Who Lived in a Nightmare ') This is one of those movies that makes you want to get up and walk out of the theatre, but it is also one of the only movies I have seen with actual disturbing content.  There is blood and violence in this film, and even though I never read it, this movie does seem to take the idea of 'fantasy' and uses it for shock value.  If you like movies where
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a bad but entertaining watch with some good points. However, like most movie goers, I started to get bored with the movie. It was very boring and predictable, it has nothing to do with the actual world. It is more like an action movie. The plot was weak because there was no plot development. This is a good movie to see if you want to see action movies for fun. I can not wait to see more.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A review by a person who thinks they know the movies they are reviewing (or a bad review by an author who is so bad it's funny):   "I loved this movie!" "I laughed my ass off!"  "If I had to make a list of the worst movies, I would put this on top of my list!"   It should be noted that many people who give "stars" to a movie do not know anything about it. In fact, people who rate a movie "stars", don't even know that this movie exists.   How the film is rated depends on which section of the movie is being reviewed.  1st - Movie "stars". The rating is usually something like a 7/10. The worst possible rating, as far as the rating system is concerned. For example, "I liked the way this movie was made, and I felt it had a good story, and the acting was good, but I just don't like this movie." 2nd - Review "stars"! If this is the only rating given to the film, a 5/10 is given. The best rating a movie can receive. For this reason, the worst movie that can receive "stars," is a "4." For this, a "3" will be given. 3rd - Movie's "Review". These are the people who watched the movie and gave it a bad score. The rating given depends on what the reviewer's opinion was of the film. For instance, a person might give a movie a "5" in their review, but in the movie's section, they might give it a "1" or a "0". If the movie was bad, the reviewer would give a "2". If it was good or not very good, the rating would be a "6" or "7". 4th - Director. These are people who make the movies. They are the ones who have an opinion of the movies that they made. Usually they have opinions of movies based on their own opinions of the filmmakers. They give the ratings in their opinion of what they thought the director did to make the film or to make their films what they made them. 5th - Movie. What the movie actually is. Usually what the film actually is is a comedy. Comedy is very subjective.  Sometimes comedy is good and sometimes comedy is bad.  Movie Review: "This is one of the funniest movies I've
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I first saw this movie, my first impression was that it was a great action movie about two assassins. I thought the acting was great and the action was awesome. My second impression was "Whoa, this movie is going to be good!" I have to admit, I thought so.   This movie has awesome action, excellent story telling, and some great characters.  This is a movie where you can feel the tension of the characters, and the fight scenes are intense and fun.  The movie does get a little stale after a while. I think the movie is supposed to be a thriller with the action, but there are not many exciting fights, and there are also not many big scenes.  At times it feels like the movie tries to have two very different types of action, one which is more like the type of action in a big Hollywood movie, and a much more realistic action, like a samurai movie.  I think a better action movie would be a movie with both of these types of actions, and that is what I think this movie has. What I also liked about this movie were the characters. I felt very connected to most of them, and their emotions and thoughts, even though they were all bad guys, had a very real and human feel.    It was very refreshing to see a movie like this.  As far as action, the movie does have some amazing fights, from huge battles to small street fights.  One fight in particular, in which the two assassins fight for their lives in the streets, is amazing to watch.  There are other fights, but they all are more like street fights with guns.  Overall, this is a very entertaining movie and a great fight movie. So, this was my review of the movie Ninja. I can say that it is a good movie. But, I think it needs to be re-thought.  It is like a movie made by two people, and this movie needs to have more of an overall plot.  I think the story needs to make more sense.   Ninja is a lot of fun, and is a well done action movie, but its story and characters have a little bit of trouble. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have to say, I enjoyed watching this one, as well as the other two films in the series, but they felt very "samey". I also felt that there was too much repetition, to the point of boredom. I just didn't find the time to really enjoy them, especially when there was so much potential for so much more.

Here are just a few of the many positive reviews we have:  And yet, I have only ever found a few negative reviews in this entire thread... (You guys know what's up.)   For me personally, I've watched this movie more times than I can remember, and I've been playing the music over and over again at night.  It's definitely one of my favorites.   It is one of those films that really does make you reflect on what makes the human experience worth having.      And yet, even though the movie made me reflect on my own life and how I choose to spend my time, I still found myself coming up with new ways I could use that time.  There are very few movies that can make you appreciate your own life, and this is one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The trailer and some scenes look like a different movie. The movie looks horrible. The actors look really bad. The plot seems really retarded.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was a total failure. I was excited to see it, it was a new horror movie starring Jessica Alba. The movie is a lot like "The Silence of the Lambs" and "The Haunting" but better. There was a scene when Jessica Albasa has to kill a group of demons that was very impressive. However, there was a big problem. It was filmed in the dark.   It's not the best lighting at all. The shadows are all black and the movie looks like a black screen.  When they did have bright lights it wasn't all that bright.  And the actors were horrible. They were good on paper but their performances didn't hold up. Jessica Albanas was not even in this movie at all and had no chemistry with the other actors.  I have seen some movies that didn't have actors in them who I didn't like and it didn't ruin the movie.  The most embarrassing thing about this movie was watching it with my brother. He thought the movie was very funny and I didn.t think so.  The music wasn't that great either. The song is the best part of the movie but it sounds like a bunch of old ladies singing and playing instruments.  It was really awkward watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What makes the worst movie ever   bad?   The plot? The acting? The characters?  A lot of that.  There are not a lot of great movies that are only bad.  But a bad bad movie  is not really bad. So what makes it so bad? The director tried to make a movie with very bad special effects (see the special effects that are in the movie).  He made the movie so that the audience would think that everything in the film is a special effects movie.  He wanted people to think that the main character is insane (see more about that in the next paragraph).  But all that made this movie so boring and so unenjoyable.     I think that he is so far behind his game that he couldn't even find the way to use all those special effects to make it seem like his movie is really bad and that no one could ever enjoy it.   And now here we are:  I've read reviews that say that this movie is a rip off of "The Room".  They say that the movie has the same style of "Room".  But the only similarity is that the actors are both terrible and the main characters are the same (I'm not sure of the plot though).  And I've seen the movie before, I've done the research.  And "The Hotel New Hampshire" is so much better than this movie. What was it about this movie?    I have no idea.  In a way, the movie is bad because its director was so far from his game.  The movie has everything but none of the ideas.  What made this bad movie great?  First of all, the acting.  It's so bad it's funny.   It's not only bad, it's so terrible, that you feel sorry for the actors.  That's all there is to it.   I've always felt bad for the characters in "The Life Aquatic".  It seems like they're making some kind of mistake in the screenplay and they are going to be punished for it. What they really should do is write a script about what the "Life Aquatic" could have been.  Then when the director made his movie, he could have changed the screenplay. But he didn't.  Maybe he was just playing dumb. So I thought that I'd write my own screenplay.     And that's what this is.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was expecting a better movie than this.   It's a terrible film.  In a movie called THE WITCH THE WEB and starring two Oscar winners, I thought they would be given the chance to give the movie a try.  I went to see the movie in a multiplex with the assumption that it would be good.  The movie starts out very nicely with a nice mix of music, light effects and a nice score.  It seems as if the movie is really trying to catch the public's attention and not letting them down at all.  But as the movie progresses, I can see that it was a movie that was made to make money rather than a film that should have been given a chance.  At times, there are even some scenes that just come out of nowhere and just completely destroy the mood.  While the story is intriguing enough, the characters really are not interesting.  Even the main character, the "witch" is not really developed.  And when you think about it, I think it would have been better if they had not spent money to make a movie based on a comic book series from almost 40 years ago.  You know, this is not an original story.  They could have done a movie where it was the other way around.   However, this movie will not be remembered as the worst horror movie I have ever seen.  That title goes to the 1978 film The Vile Village by Richard Shepard.  A great Halloween film:  The Ville is a great Halloween movie.  Although it has some scenes and the movie does get a bit repetitive after a while, it's still a great movie to watch in the fall.  If you've seen the film, then you should really give it a try as it may just be your thing.  To end, I must say that the movie was good and I'm not saying that to brag but more because the film wasn't terrible and was still good. But, I would give it two and half stars for the movie and a one star for the story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I am sure there are some terrific movies that I have never seen and that I will never see. But I can say without a doubt that this movie is one of the worst that I've ever seen."   "I had this movie on video once and I thought it was crap, so now I'm giving it a second chance. It's not the worst movie in the world, but it sure is a low point in the career of the director."  This was based on a book of the same name.   The film's title is from "The Adventures of Robin Hood" (1623) by Sir Walter Scott.  The title is a mishearing of "Robin Hood's Mask" (also known as "Robin's Hood" in the film) by Arthur Conan Doyle.  A book of these stories by Doyle was published by Gollancz in 1892. The film was directed by William Dieterle (a.k.a. "Mr. X" - the man in the orange glasses) and written by Charles Laughton (who also wrote "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.", "A View to a Kill" and "A Few Good Men").     On February 17, 1937, the American film critic Walter Lippmann wrote a positive review of "Rob Roy".    The movie was not released to the public until May 10, 1938.    A poster from the movie.  An actor in the movie playing the part of Robin:  This actor was not played by any actor of the day - it was actually an unknown, who played a fictional character.   One of the many songs of the movie: The music was composed by Percy Stobie.   He was a famous jazz singer in England during the 1930's.  "You'll never get a movie made like this again!"  It is a popular saying in Hollywood.  William Dietrich, the film's director (who in real life was a talented photographer), once said: "I hope it is not the last movie I ever make."  There have been several films of this type, but "Robin and Marian" was probably the worst.   In a 1997 interview, Dietrich said:  "The problem with the studio executives was not that I made the movie, but that they couldn't make it."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "A movie with some excellent performances and great cinematography, but no one in the movie really makes a compelling or memorable point. " ( John T. O'Neill, Los Angeles Times )    - - - "It is hard to imagine any other movie in this week's top 10 list that could rival "Saving Private Ryan" as the greatest movie ever made. " - -  -       - - Saving a Private Ryan was one of the top selling war movies of all time, and that's because of the character of William Wallace.   After the Battle of the Bulge, he is the only German soldier remaining at the front, and he leads his troops through the rubble and chaos.   He carries his rifle and gives the orders to fight, and eventually takes over the command of a company.   The movie's plot is based on Wallace's heroic stand against the Germans, and its most memorable scene is the battle of the Bastogne.   Wallace is the man most deserving of the title "Hero of the Army", but in a movie filled with "War heroes", it's hard to beat Wallace's selfless bravery.   There's also the great German soldiers and their beautiful uniforms. A lot of people have mentioned this movie's "perfect score" on Rotten Tomatoes.   I haven't seen it (yet), but I read a lot of reviews that give it a 92 percent rating.   But it's not perfect, because the movie was also praised for its special effects.   It had special effects that made soldiers seem real, for example, and some of the action scenes were also spectacular.   Some people even wrote that it was even more enjoyable than the book, but that's not a good thing. - - - If you read the book version, you know it is based in part on a book by Major Robert Brooks, which was first published in 1944.   In the movie version, Wallace has a character based on a character by Richard Wagner, called "Siegfried".   This was because Brooks had a very special friendship with the famous German opera singer, and this gave him the right to play a character that was based on Wagner's Siegfried. In the movie, he doesn't look like Siegfried, but he does.   This is a film adaptation, and if you like to watch a movie, you should watch the book.   Also, Brooks' Siegfried character
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw the first part, and I was not impressed. The plot seemed like something that was made for a cheap thrill, and even the characters who were supposed to be relatable, like "The Boss", seemed to be just there to get in the way of the main plot. I had no idea what the movie was even about, and at first I found it frustrating that I didn't know what was going on. I was also not very impressed with the effects, with most of the time just not being impressive enough. The acting was decent at times, but mostly for some of the "normal" characters (ie. "The boss" and the "regular people", who are not really meant to be a "hero" or "heroine" in the story), the acting seemed pretty uninspired.  I thought the story was the most disappointing thing about the movie: I guess the movie tries to have a plot that is interesting, with a lot of twists and turns that it would never have made if they hadn't used a cheap jump scare that was pretty much a cheap way to give the audience a bad time. The main plot line had the typical "normal person is put in an abnormal situation" plot, except that the abnormal situation was that the "normals" were not allowed to die. The movie seemed to have been made because it wasn't made by a horror fan, so the movie didn't seem that interesting, but for the fact that it was a cheap cheap movie, I guess it was better than nothing.   A very low budget movie: This was the first movie where the movie director was paid by a studio (who had some money, but not enough to really get anything made with them), the rest of the people in the movie were all just actors or extra people who were there because they were good looking, and had nothing to do with the plot (I really don't think the directors thought about the audience when they were making the movie). The only character who had any "character" to him was "The character "Mr. M". I think Mr. M has a lot more of character than the other people in that movie, because he wasn't just there for cheap shock value, he had a good plot to himself. But I guess I was expecting a horror movie that I could really enjoy, and when it was like this, it was just very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like movies, but I am an artist who works with celluloid film, so you can bet my work would suffer if you used it for any of the other things (which is why it's so important to understand it when it is not used for other things).   If I'm really feeling it, I'll try to make a movie out of it; but you cannot do that with a good film because the movie does not allow you to see how a good story can be done in the most effective way.    The only thing I can recommend is that if you enjoy a bad film and you would like to watch it, then don't watch it on your computer, because you will see more of it if you do so. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If a movie is bad it is probably bad for more reasons than one.   When a movie does poorly I think we can all agree that it is bad for all of those reasons.  One of the most common reasons for a movie's failure to make a profit is simply a bad script.  Many of the big budget movie movies these days are being written by the big screen writers or "super-screenwriters."  We've even had a few movies released by some of the biggest studios that were written by these guys.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  The problem comes when the script fails to follow any one of these guidelines.  I've been watching a lot of movies lately and they are all being released by major studios and the scripts are not doing so hot.  Most of the scripts I am watching seem to be the same basic template:  1. A female character, usually a lead, falls in love with a bad guy and she falls in to his bad behavior.  2. The bad guy gets killed or loses his cool.  3. A hero comes in to rescue the woman who fell in love.  4. A lot of violence happens.  5. An amazing, epic-sounding movie (i.e. Star Wars) is made.   The worst of these "super screenwriters" are usually the "cinematic screenwriters."   If you are going to hire one to write a script for you then the first step to making it a good one is to get rid of all the violence.  If violence is going to be your hook then you will probably be writing a bad action movie.  It is much better to get out of the female character's life entirely (get rid of her relationship) and then to bring in a man to save the day.    This will give you two different things to focus on when writing the script. You will get a strong male lead who gets a lot done.  You will also get to have a female character who doesn't get much done but does have her moment in the spotlight.  Remember:  The audience doesn't care about your heroine.  They just want to see action.  A lot.  And they are going see your action.   One of my favorite screenplays of all time was written by one of the great "cognitive movie screenwriters," George Miller.  He wrote a great movie about a guy who learns he has a fatal
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You're in the wrong business and there is no reason to complain about a movie that does not suck.   If you want to complain, complain about another film or TV show because it is not your thing, because you've seen it before, because it didn't really make sense or was so bad that it was hard to enjoy it.   The movies and TV shows you don't like or that are bad do not belong on this list, and you might as well be writing in your journal in a cave.  If you are going to complain then why bother writing?   I will admit that there is one movie on this "worst movies ever" list that is genuinely bad, a film called "Pulp Fiction" directed by Quentin Tarantino and starring Samuel L. Jackson and Jamie Foxx.  However I won't list it because I've already written about it in my review of "Django Unchained".   It is not worth complaining about because it really is that bad and it makes the list for no other reason than because it was released by Universal Pictures and it was a box office success.  My review of the film can be found here. Why do people enjoy bad movies:  It is fun and we can feel like we are accomplishing something with our bad movie watching.  The bad movie genre is not for everyone.  It's a bit like trying to go to a sporting event with a bad mood.  Maybe the people who don't enjoy bad movie are just not used to the genre because they grew up with it. The movies aren't "for us", they are for the audience.  These are the people that are used to watching movies in which everything is just right.  They have had it in their heads for many years that a movie should be good and they know exactly what a bad one looks like and why the movie isn't.  People who like bad movies are also the same people that watch "Punk'd" and "Teen Wolf" because those are the kinds of movies they grew with and that have been passed down to them from their parents.  So don't try to go "bad movies".  Just watch the good movies, don't go into the bad ones.  To find the good ones, start with the very first movies you ever saw, especially if you were a kid and you loved to watch movies.  This way you will know what is good and what isn't
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first half of the movie was fine. The first half was so much better than the second half. The story is still bad, but it's a little better. And the characters are not as terrible as before. But as for the second and third act, they're so bad, that they should really be called "The Worst Actors in a Great Movie" The writing is awful, and it's made even worse by a stupid "action" sequence (like when the character has to put on his shoes) where he walks into the middle of a busy street with no street lights and it just looks bad. The film just looks so amateurish and unprofessional. I hope they're going to remake this with new actors, and make it much better. Otherwise, it is just a bad film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie on tv, it was on AMC and it was called "the other man" and it had a man who was a cannibal in it and a cannibal that was also a man. So the movie was about a man and a woman who had a baby and then the baby gets sick and dies.   I've seen that movie a thousand times before, so I didn't really remember the plot but the movie sucked.  I can remember seeing this movie in theaters and I loved it. So what happened was that this cannibal woman had a pregnancy and she went on vacation and she couldn't do it, so she wanted a doctor to give the baby to her to keep it alive and have the baby with her, because she wanted to continue having a baby. I saw this woman on vacation a few weeks and after she had the baby, the baby died. So she goes on vacation again to try and find a doctor and it doesn't work. So now she's on her deathbed and she's dying of cancer.  So this woman goes into a funeral home to get her body but they know her and she takes her son to go on a fishing trip and she brings him out with her to take care of the kid and she goes to the funeral home and she asks the doctor to save the baby but the doctor doesn't believe she's really pregnant and he tries to save her but she dies. And that's how the movie ends.  So the only thing that I can say is the movie didn't deserve to be seen by anybody because it was just horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "Dumb and Dumber To" trilogy made a comeback last year with "The Dictator," in which they played the same role as in the 1990 original, with Tom Hanks playing the buffoonish President, John C. Reilly playing the arrogant and pompous British Prime Minister, and John Cusack as a nameless, faceless bureaucrat trying to bring peace between the two nations. "The World According to Garp," which was made in 1990 by the same group and stars Kevin Costner, is the second in the trilogy and sees Garp, a brilliant general in World War II, take on the role of the President of the United States after the death of the country's leader, and he does what any self-respecting general would do: he uses his military to conquer the world. This movie, which also made headlines in 1997 when it was released in Japan, was shot in the same style as "Dictator" and has the same theme as "The Godfather" - that of a dictator using his position to rule and oppress his people. I was really looking forward to this film and I had to see if it was as good as "Godfather" or if it really would be more of a remake of "God of War." Let's just say, as I said, it was not as good. The story follows General Garp as he tries to take over Europe and conquer the country of North America, only to get beaten by Captain America, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Garp gets beaten to death while trying to run a prison that's being guarded by a team of the Avengers. He's then revived by the alien alien Gremlin and his two friends, the Hulk and the Thing, from another universe, who were sent by the Fantastic Four to help him conquer the Earth. However, Garp soon realizes that the Avengers have been brainwashed and the Fantastic 4 have been taken to his home world of Latveria and imprisoned. There he meets the "superior" people, the "Avengers of Latoria" as well as a few other villains that he meets on his journey. All the while, the film is a combination of an action movie and a Western. It's a little on the violent side, with some gore but not enough for it to be considered gratuitous. Also, the story, although not as great as the first two, does have the good characters that the first movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are going to write a negative movie review you must be the one who said that it is a bad film, and not just a bad review, if you just tell the person it is not a good film then you do not give them a chance to change their mind.   Do not just list a lot of faults about this movie then leave it on your review.  This movie just does not deserve a single negative comment.  There are many reasons for this film not to work but you are not going to tell anyone about these reasons just to "score" a negative.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "it's bad"   -   "that's a bad idea"  The film had no idea what it was trying to be and is a completely inept attempt at comedy, with a story that would have made even a toddler in the 80's and 90's laugh hysterically. The actors are also very, very forgettable and uninteresting, with the main lead (James Spader) seeming to be the least convincing of the bunch. The writing is not as bad as some of the other recent Hollywood offerings in this genre, though.   "we are going to be really happy"    -  If you are really desperate for a laugh, watch The Office, or any sitcom.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Don't.   And don't feel bad about that.  So why are you here?   Because I think there's a lot of great films that people aren't willing to give a chance.  I think the biggest one is The Matrix, which was the first film that everyone was just like "Oh, this looks like a crappy movie!"  But once they saw it again and it wasn't a crappy film anymore, then it started becoming a good film.  Then The Room came along and it was kind of like "Yeah, that was a good movie!"   And now they're going back to it, again.  And that's one of my favorite films, I think, is Midnight in Paris.  It is just one of the greatest movies of all time.  Not because it's good, not because it has great acting, but because it was a great film and it got a lot out of people.  There are plenty of movies that get a lot from people, but they aren't good films.  Maybe they were good films before, but once you start watching them again they just don't have the same effect. What's your favorite movie? What's your least favorite movie ever?  So, which is your favorite film?  I've just recently seen this documentary, by Steven Spielberg called Behind the Candelabra.  This is one of those movies that you go see, because it seems really, really good.  The movie isn't very good.   But it's one that you see, just for fun, like a Saturday morning cartoon.  At some point you might like it and then it's gone, and you look back on it and you're like "Hey, that's when I saw that thing for the first time."  And it makes me laugh.  And then you go into the theater with your friends and you just laugh, and everybody's laughing, and it's fun.  In the end, however, it does not have any great qualities in it.  But then when you've seen it a few times, then you remember how good the film is and how funny it was. And I think you've just started to watch it a second time, and then you realize how great it really is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to write a good review, but also want to express your opinion on a movie, try this!  This is a list of every Movie that I have watched, in chronological order. You can view them in a new tab or by clicking on the images.  The movie title in bold text is the one that I personally love to hate the most.  a lot. , and even though I am no fan of horror, I can appreciate the power and the suspense in some films. The movie that started it all was, and also despite the lack of blood, the ending was still bloody! In this movie the character is playing a piano, when he suddenly finds himself in a dark basement. He meets a little girl playing the piano, who tells him that a horrible ghost haunts the basement. A long time later, the little girl, while playing, finds out that her piano is the reason for the haunting. The girl's sister, who played the piano and now is dead, is a girl from the past! So the ghost that haunts is the daughter of the little sister of the guy that played the guitar in the basement? In the end, the piano is destroyed, but the ghost does not go away. The film, even though is about piano, is also about life and death, the power of music and how it can change our world. I also like the fact that it is a horror, but not a horror movie. I believe there is a difference. There is also a supernatural aspect, as the movie deals with the ghost haunting. There are ghosts in horror movies that haunt, but in this movie, the ghosts are not from the world of the living, but from the soul and can only be seen with a piano. I am not a big fan of musicals and this movie has some good musical performances. In the story, the film is a metaphor for how music has the power to give life, but how we use it to create illusions or to change the world. It's interesting how the piano plays a big role in the movie.The movie that has a lot of controversy in Japan, but its a little boring to me. There isn't much action, or suspense in this film, and the story is a little predictable. The ending of the movie is also really slow. The director, who had a little of a cult following in the mid nineties, made a good movie, but he has done a lot
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A group of high school students get sucked into a world of drugs and violence in "The Wild Bunch."   While most of the movie doesn't work on its own merit (and it doesn't help that the acting and special effects are pretty poor), the first half of the film is actually pretty good.   The film follows a group of teenagers and their gang of outcasts.  One boy gets into a bar fight with a gangster and gets shot in the leg.  Another is chased by the police, but gets away by pretending to be a car.  In a desperate attempt to get revenge for being injured, a member of the gang kills his friend.  The scene is pretty intense, and you can tell that the filmmakers were trying their best to depict the violence that occurred in the film.  The second half of "The wild bunch" doesn't have much going for it.  While some of the violence in this film is pretty horrific, and the acting is pretty good, the story doesn't seem to fit well into the rest of the pictures on the show.  I would have been much more interested in "Wild Bunch" if it had some other themes going for its story.  Maybe a little bit of a romance subplot?   For the most part, "The mad bunch" is a fun, if somewhat convoluted, movie.  However, if you want something more serious, or if you just want to see something different, then this is probably not for you.  "The mad bunch" - I think we can all agree that a bad day for a group like this is not pretty.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I got into the business, I never thought I'd do a movie where I was the villain.   There were a couple movies that I did do, but not like this.  The first thing you're seeing in the movie is that I'm a big fan of Jaws and I was really looking forward to doing a movie about it, because it's a classic.  The other thing was that I'd been a huge fan of the original book, so I was very keen to adapt it for film.  I've always been a little bit of a fan of John Williams and I'd always wanted to do a song for my character in the original film, and so I called up my friend and collaborator, and said "I'm doing this movie, I don't know if I'm going to use your music, do you want to make some music for it?" He was like "Oh hell yeah!"  So I called him up and asked him to come in and be a composer for the film and he brought his friend in, and I think they were the only two people who came in and used my music.  It was really fun, and we just did all the songs for it, which is crazy because a lot of people have their music used.  The original song they used was called "I Can't Stay", which is probably the one that was used the most.  After I did that, I called them and was like, "If I don'se to use this again, it's going to be called 'We Didn't Learn a Thing' or something." I think it was the first time they had ever used a song in a film, so it was really a big deal for them, so they were really happy with it.  This movie was a real labor of love for a lot people, so in a way, I'm really glad it ended up working out.  My favorite line was the line "I thought this was a movie!"  What happened was, I met with Jaws director Steven Spielberg and I showed him a rough cut of the script, and he loved it. So he wrote the treatment and started working on the screenplay.  He had to rewrite it a few times, because when I read it, it was a little rough and he had to make a few changes, but at the end of it, I loved it and he was really happy that I liked it. I
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I really want to hate this film but the way it's presented makes me feel like I'm just sitting in a darkened theater watching something horrible. I'm going to do my best to give the filmmakers credit where it's due, but the end result isn't worth it. I've only seen this one movie so far and it's already made me sick. I really don't know how I could have missed this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't think so.   It was good.  The movie is set in California during the mid-fifties and was filmed and filmed and then edited down into a movie.  And it was a very funny movie. So I'm sure some people thought it was funny, because that is what we're all doing in that time. I know that people loved it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Do you have a good excuse why a movie is bad?   1:33 PM   The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly   -   What are you looking for?  Is it just what you expected from the movie, or is it something you can't get out of your mind?  The Good and the Bad   is definitely the latter.  I thought that it would be interesting that we see the same characters from the previous films.   Also, I thought it was interesting that it had a couple of new actors on board.  But it was the last third where I really felt like I was watching an older movie, the violence was very gratuitous, and there were some really bizarre scenes.  As for the Ulysses segment, I found that the movie didn't quite have that same Ulysse vibe.  The music was actually very good but the rest of the movie just didn't have that Ulyssian vibe. It was still a fun and enjoyable movie. I did like the first half, but I really wish the U.S. had gotten out of Mexico sooner.  2:05 PM   Dancer in the Dark   -   The movie had a very weird vibe to it, like I just watched some weird 80s teen romance movie.  In other words, it didn't feel like a Ulyssess movie. And it's kind of the same vibe I got from the new film.  This was also one of the most expensive movies I've seen in the last few years.  Like I said, I could see why a lot of people would want this movie.   I actually really liked the story and the performances were great.  There were some parts that were kind of hard to watch but I think that people who like the 80s/90s style of films will enjoy this one.  What was really strange to me was the film's marketing.  It was in an old school 70s style with a film school style soundtrack.   It was kind of odd to see the movie on one of these DVDs when I'm looking for something more 80s and the movie is in such a 1980s style.  You would have expected something with a more 1980s feel.  On top of that, it was also a lot less PG-13 than I expected.     The film does have a little bit of violence, but not that much.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There is one movie that should not be made, and that movie is the horror movie, The Devil Inside.   The Devil In Her Eyes should have never been made.  In the movie the actor plays a young girl who runs away from a haunted house to find her father.  She ends up in a world of demons and creatures and the whole thing is a nightmare.  This movie should never have been made and it is a shame that it was.  When I saw this movie I was told that it is based on a true story, and I believe it is, but it is not.  The movie was originally called The Devil's House, and it was about a family who ran away from the house.  One of the children had an affair with a man who was a demon, and the girl turned on her father and burned the house down with him in it.  It is not the best movie I have seen but it was good enough for me to look forward to the second half of the movie.  There are some parts of the film that are really messed up, and in one scene we see a woman with the face of a man and a man with the head of a woman.  My son and I had a great time watching it and were very amused.  But the movie does not deserve to be in the horror genre, and this movie should not have been released.  Recommended for you if you are looking for a good horror movie and if you want to see what a horror movie looks like in the 80s.

Posted: September 16, 2015 at 10:08 AM  Funny movie about a small town that is suddenly in danger of being wiped out due to a series of deadly storms.  Very strange movie with an eerie, ominous ending. Very well done script, and a few nice visuals. The soundtrack is also good.  I didn't like this movie, not because I didn' t like it, but because it made me want to see another movie about that small town.  But, it has its moments and is an ok movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    * Click here to leave a review about this movie  * "It seems like an interesting concept, but the execution seems a bit amateurish." - Movieguide.com   - - -   The movie is based on a short story by Joseph Campbell. A woman named Marlene (played by Jessica Lange) is visiting a friend named Edna (played on screen by Janet Leigh) in a hotel when she encounters a bizarre visitor, a mysterious blonde woman, known only as "The Stranger." Marlene has been having strange visions of an unidentified entity, who comes to her bedside, offers her the ability to transform into any of her deceased husband's corpses, and asks her to find them so that they can be buried. She does so, and finds that the Stranger has gone. But soon, the woman begins to have the most horrific nightmares. As she begins to suffer from the strange phenomena, she realizes that The Stranger is the real deal and that the dead husband's bodies are haunting her as well.   This film has been hailed as one of the best films made of the 70s, and is considered to be a modern classic.  A very creepy and disturbing film.  The story is that of an eccentric woman, Marlene, who gets visited by The Stranger, who seems to know her. She also has a series of dreams in which she becomes possessed by him. She eventually finds out who she is. She has been trying to get a divorce from her husband, and has been hearing voices for a long time. In one of these dreams she is confronted by The Strange Woman. This woman is the one who gives her visions of The Stranger. As you can see in this clip from a film called "The Shunned House", she is the same woman the characters encounter.  This is one of those horror movies I like to quote and share because of how well it fits with my own personal horror history.  I remember watching this with my parents when I was a kid. The film was in black and white and there were some splotches of color in the pictures, but I'm too young to remember.  A must watch if you love 80s horror and are looking for some new horror movie to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot sucks. It doesn't take itself seriously at all. I have heard this movie referred to as a cult classic and even though I did not see it when it was released, I would still say that this is a bad film. The acting was pretty good, and the girls are pretty cute, but I couldn't buy that this movie was anything but a waste of time.    Rated: PG-13, for some language and violence 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My favorite movie by director David Cronenberg has to be Videodrome. The movie was a hit for many reasons. Cronenberg made it the story of a man whose daughter has just died and his relationship with a friend who has a similar child, this time with a mind of a child. The director makes the story realistic as possible and with the right cinematography and the wrong pacing Cronenberg makes a movie that is worth watching. I don't want to spoil any other movie but I found this film to be a piece of art in itself. Cronenwatz does a very good job and I personally liked this movie better than The Fly. So, who is David Cronberg for? Cronenberg is a director that loves to try new things and not follow the same formula over and over again. I like his work and I think that he makes the movie interesting and makes it different each time, and I like that the movies are made in an interesting style, but not exactly a masterpiece like some of his works. What do you think? Are you a fan of David Cronenburg's work?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    We have a new album out and I've been listening to it for over a year now. It's a great addition to the band's discography. It doesn't compare to the album we released in 2007, but it has its own merits and has a nice sound to it. It is a very heavy metal album, but not without the melodic elements you'll find in other metal albums of the last few years. It has a heavier side to it as well, which makes it fun for fans of that style of music. There are times when I like it a little too much, but the energy from the band is there every time you listen to it (the music) so it works for me. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good metal album. The only thing I don't really like about this album is the title track. I found it to be a bit too repetitive and not much to say about it.   If you haven't listened to the CD, and are interested, go out and pick it up. If you like the album (or even if you're just a fan of heavy metal music in general), you will most definitely enjoy the album.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    * A.K.A. "I was expecting to love it."   The worst part of the movie. I don't like to think that I could have done better for my money. I'm sure that I didn't get my money's worth.   In addition to having terrible dialogue, the movie is riddled with technical flaws and terrible special effects.  (I thought the movie was so bad that I might as well go see it and see if it worked. Well, it did not. It was very bad.)   A movie about "The Lost Ones"...   I really hope that this doesn't turn into a "This is how you live life with your family"... "The only real way to live a good life is to stop living."  This movie is about a bunch of crazy people who take over a cave and start playing games and fighting each other. It has the usual "evil people" plot line you are used to. Well... they all end up dying (which I didn?t expect) and the one survivor, a boy named Mike, gets the girl and goes away.  Now, when I saw the trailer I thought that there might be a sub plot where Mike was getting rescued by some woman who found him, but there were no details on that. I think that the movie started with an adventure movie and then quickly veered into horror/action.  I can't say that I'm a big action movie fan (not by any means), but I really like the action in movies like this. It?s always great to see some old school movie like this, where the action scenes really make it so much more fun to watch.  The characters in this movie are pretty uninteresting. Mike, the main character, was kind of boring. I?m not sure why they used a child for the lead character. I thought I?d seen a few grown-up versions of the main characters, but never in a movie as short.  There were a few good parts of the film. The music was good and the scene where Mike and the girl were kissing and she asked him if he liked her (that was the best part of that scene) was great. I like the fact that the filmmakers made their own effects. The only thing that I really didn?T like about the movie, was the ending. I couldn?t stand it and thought that the producers would have better ideas in place if
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you've seen this movie you've already seen the best part of it:    The movie's ending.   It ends on a cliffhanger, but it's well written.  It is only 6:30pm on a Friday and a few people had already walked off the island.  So, everyone is all huddled in the cabins.  I had a lot of time to read the book and I had seen "Garden of Words" a few weeks before in San Francisco.  Now, I knew the ending because I've read it several times.  There are many good movies about writing.  "The Glass Castle," "Love Story," "Passion" and "The Devil and Daniel Johnston" are all about writing in one way or another.   When I saw "Mama's Boy," I knew it was one of the better books about writing I'd ever read.  And this is the first time I read it in a while.  But this movie is very good.  One of the reasons it's good is that it's about the same author as the book, although it's a different writer (see, here's a guy who is a great author, but not a very good filmmaker).  And there are many similarities.  This movie has a lot in common with "Brief Encounter" which is another great novel about writing and filmmaking, although both of those movies are in different genres, not just the writing genre.  Both "Bilderberg" and  "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" are about writing, but they're about the writing by a couple of very different people.   The similarities to "Barefoot in the Park" extend to the writing, including the characters, though they're not as close.  If you saw this movie, you'd have seen "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers," but with more humor, not as bad as "Power Rangers," which I liked better.  The characters in "Monsieur Verdoux" aren't all like the ones in "Power Ranger."  "Moms" is a lot less funny.   But there are still many similarities between "Mamas" and the book:   Both are books about two men who spend a lot time working and traveling, about how hard they work and how long they live and their relationship with their families. Both of them are written by very different authors.   They are both written by
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I like the idea of the new movie, and that it is a sequel to this film. I have no problem with the film's subject matter, and would have no issues seeing the movie. However, I think this would have been better as a horror movie and not an action film. The script is fine but it is lacking in characters, atmosphere, and plot.   The script has a lot of action, but the characters are not developed enough for that to be good for the story.  The only thing that was good was the action and the gore, and the film is quite brutal.    I'm just disappointed the director did not include the original ending to the film because it would have added more to the story and made the film more compelling. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    3.5 out of 4 stars.    A movie with the word "vomit" in it.  It's just a very, very, extremely terrible movie.  There are no redeeming qualities that I can see that people would look for.  I can't stand people who say "I loved that movie, just like everyone else.  Just because I can only watch one movie in a movie theater every year doesn't mean that I want to watch the same movie over and over again!"  People who don't like something and don't want to see it more than once are always an annoying bunch.  If you hate this movie, I can understand, but it was also made for a very specific demographic.  This movie is marketed towards men, and since men can't do much else at a movie, they'll have to watch this movie with other men.  They are going to get very angry with any female who's not into this movie.   That's why the female characters are all wearing a skirt or a tank top.  A man won't be able to take much notice of any of this.  The plot itself is awful.  We meet a few men who are in love with this girl who is a prostitute.  You'd think they would be a little more open-minded than that, but nope, they all get into a fight with the other men because of this "virgin".  There is a great bit where the other guys beat up one of the prostitutes.  Some people will claim that it is justified because she was raped (which she was), but there is no justification for that.  In another part, a guy is raped.  Yes, he was raped.   In this scene, we see him peeing on the ground.  Now, I don't really care much about a movie that has an alien rape this guy because it just ruins the movie. The other guys are all completely mean to this guy.  None of them try to help him.   The guy just screams and is totally devastated by the whole thing.  What's weird about this movie is that none of these things are done in a bad way.  No one is trying to get in his pants.  Everyone is just trying to keep this guy alive.  These guys don't mean to hurt this guy, but they are trying to force him to do this thing.  That's one of my favorite
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - 5 stars.   I have a new addiction, and its a movie I will never watch, but its the best thing I've ever seen in a while. I love the characters, and the script is so good. I will watch it again, but this time with my wife, and we will let her help her to enjoy it as much as I did. I wish I could have spent more time with him, and more time on her. I hope they make more movies like this in the future, and that we will soon have a movie like this for a child, or an adult who wants a more positive approach.   I would like to express my deepest apologies for the rude and hurtful comments I have read on other's reviews about this movie. First and foremost I want to say that I've seen a lot of bad movies, and they're all crap. But as a human being I should be able to have an opinion and not just blindly hate on everything. This is NOT one of those movies. It's a good movie. I have a very low tolerance for horror, but I was thoroughly enjoying it, and found a lot to be humorous in the fact that it was a horror film. I guess if there are no ghosts or goblins, and if the monsters are not scary, then there isn't really a movie on. This movie was funny and a great way to spend the afternoon. It was not scary but it was still funny. I enjoyed this movie because I actually like scary movies. I had not seen a "Ghostbusters" movie before, but my husband has seen one. The other night we watched "Home Alone" and I asked him "Did you really think those guys would get away with this?" I had never been so happy that a movie was scary to me. So yes I do believe this movie is scary, but that's because there is a good idea in it that makes it a good film. So in fact I do think this movie will stay with me. I know I won't watch the movie again as it's far too awful to be anything but a comedy. However I hope to go back and watch it later on with my family and see what kind of reactions I get. For some reason it doesn't really bother me that much, but as someone who has never actually seen a movie before it is hard for me to describe what is funny in a movie. This was my first movie and it really
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What about       - A bad script; bad voice, bad acting; bad music; bad pacing, etc.; a bad concept; a bad direction; a very bad production value; a plot that is incoherent; a story that is not believable; or a bad ending? This is something that I am constantly looking at.   There are very few movies that I have seen that I actually think are bad.  One example of such a movie is a movie called  Mulholland Dr.   (1992) by  Ken Russell. The plot is that of a young man who visits a doctor and the doctor performs surgery on him. The surgeon makes mistakes and a lot of blood is spilled. The movie is not bad by any means but I think it was an overly expensive production that took a lot away from what was really happening.  A similar movie is " The Lost World: Jurassic Park" (1993). The plot of that movie is that a park in a remote area of Africa is attacked by dinosaurs. The dinosaurs come in, the dinosaurs attack the tourists, and the people survive. This movie had a lot going for it and was a real hit but the story, voice, direction, and acting are the same thing as the first movie.  Another movie that I know of is "The Last House on the Left" (1972)  by David Lynch. This is the movie that inspired the name of this blog. It is about a group of people that go back to the house that was attacked by the aliens. They are being held prisoner in this house.  The movie was not great but there is a lot more going for this movie that is what is going to make it a "cult classic."  It is a great movie about people who are victims of a war.  If you ever have the chance to watch this movie, be sure to watch it in the theater.    - A bad story; a poor direction; bad editing; bad acting or a poor soundtrack; a horrible script; a poorly-made scene; a "bad" soundtrack.  A film or story should be entertaining.  These are the things I look for.  If you want to see my favorite movie of the week please click on the link below. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the beginning of my life, I saw a movie that I've loved ever since. I was so happy, I couldn't speak.     When I saw it, I was very confused. I didn't understand what the movie was about at first, but then I found out. The movie was called "Ridicule." This movie was a satire of the world and how the world sees things. The people in this movie were so ridiculous, yet funny.  The movie was based on a very true story. This movie has had millions of views around the world on YouTube.  The movie has a little bit of comedy and some sad parts, but I find it very entertaining.  I just want to say, if you haven't seen it, watch it, if not, I'm going to let you know that it is not for the weak hearted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There's a long-standing joke in Hollywood:  "A movie about a movie about the movie The Good, The Bad and The Ugly."  If there's a story in the movie that can be improved by the addition of a few characters who aren't just glorified props, a director can go in and inject some excitement into the story.  It's the opposite of a "movie about" a movie, but it's a joke that gets old quick.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are a lot of things wrong with "A Christmas Story" (the original title of the film was "A Merry Christmas Story"), but what I'm really mad about is that it's a very bad movie. The bad part is the soundtrack, which makes me feel like I'm watching the same old movie that everyone else has seen a million times. The best part about the movie was that it took a classic holiday tale and rewrote the ending into a silly and cheap melodrama (there is a scene that doesn't make any sense, a line of dialogue is repeated at the wrong time, etc.).   It has some great characters, but they're forced to do a lot to get the ending to make sense, because most of the movie isn't good.   I just couldn't get over this scene at the end of the original.  I don't think this movie has a happy ending either.  It's a terrible movie with a terrible soundtrack, and a terrible ending.  This movie is the exact opposite of how I remember it to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can't remember a time when I did not think the movie "Hitchcock" was a bad one. My wife and I sat through it last night at our annual family dinner. Her first comment was that she thought the movie was "filthy" and that she could never like it. And I could never, ever agree.   A typical Hitchcock movie.  There was no suspense, no tension, and no mystery. The plot, as I have mentioned, is quite simple, and has nothing to do with the mystery, which makes it all the worse. It's a simple story, really.  A man, named James, stumbles into the possession of a "curse". The curse is that he can never lose his virginity. The solution is to steal a young girl.  And I don't know what more the woman can do to help him, but it's not like the girl's parents are going to call the police if they catch her, so this isn't a great plot.  I would never say I had a particularly bad time watching this film (my wife did), but it certainly wasn't very entertaining.  The best part of this movie for me was the music, which was played during every scene. The music played during the suspenseful scenes was simply beautiful.  One of the best songs I heard in a movie was when they first meet James, and we hear him sing "I am always searching for my name." I think "I Am Always" by The Beatles is one of the most beautiful songs ever written. I've never heard "I will always love you" by the Rolling Stones, but they are good.  Anyway, I loved it when they are alone together, with the music playing.  My wife also said she liked the "shower scene" (I think it was a shower scene? It's not exactly clear in the movie) when the man first falls in love with the woman.  It's sad, but very romantic.     It was also very scary, because there was no actual death in this movie.  When I saw the movie for the first time I had no idea what was going on, so I'm not sure how it was supposed to scare me.  But I still loved the music and the actors.  We had dinner last night with my brother and his wife. She just said that she really liked the music in this picture, and she really wanted to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved the movie, but it's a very, very bad movie.   The first part of the movie is good, but then the story is just bad, but not to much of a problem, it just gets bad, there is no reason for the character's to be so dumb.  There are very, VERY few laughs in the movie. If you are a big fan of this movie, you will have a good time.  But i really don't know what else to say, this movie is really bad.  I'm so disappointed in myself because I thought that this movie would be amazing!   My boyfriend and I were at the movies when this movie came out and I had to watch it with him. We have been a couple for about two and a half years, so we know each other really well and this movie was great because we knew each other. I watched it with my boyfriend and the movie wasn't too bad, nothing too bad about it. Then we watched it again later and I said to my boyfriend, "I don't get why they would make this movie" and he was just like "Oh, ok". After we watched this movie the first time again, we watched the film three times, and I think it's just really really bad and I hate myself for not giving this movie more attention. If I was my girlfriend's friend and we saw this movie with each other, I really don.t know how I would have been able to look at her when she is laughing.  It's like every character in the film is like one of those kids in a bad horror movie, and they just all look so stupid.  This movie is so bad, I don't even like to mention it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's easy.   If you are going to tell others that a movie sucks, why not go into it with a critical stance?   I was disappointed that most people I saw in a cinema at night, in a crowded movie house, were of the opinion that The Wolf of Wall Street is a bad film.  And yes, its flaws are quite obvious, but in a world where people are quick to point out everything that's wrong with a film, is it that bad?  Is it even a bad picture?  Some might say it is a classic.  In my humble opinion, I believe that it isn't.  It is, however, a film that I would not want to watch again.  So I decided to watch the movie on a rainy night at the cinema, in the dark, with the only light available being from a single small TV screen that was showing The Avengers.  If this movie were a TV show that I actually loved and was really looking forward to watching every week, then I could accept the flaws.  But The Wolf Of Wall Street isn't a TV program.  This is a big Hollywood movie that is trying to be taken seriously, but it doesn't try hard enough.  I have seen a few movies that were made for television.  One of my favorite movies is the "The X-Files".  I am not saying that The X-File is perfect, but when it is on television, it becomes a totally different story.  The reason that this movie is such a letdown to me is that it makes an attempt at being funny, but the jokes are incredibly bad.  Every single joke is a lame joke that is just not funny.  Instead of doing something funny, they make people laugh at something that is completely unappealing.  A simple example would be, when Mandy is in a car that she hates because of the terrible smell it has, she says, "Wow, they do make a great engine!"  Now imagine if you would tell that to someone in a foreign country.  They would be mortified at your ignorance.  For a big studio movie, this movie should have made more money, but sadly it doesn' have.  Most movies that are successful tend to be those that are able to be made by big studios that don't have to go through the expense of finding other studios to make movies for them.  My advice is to skip the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would love to know where the guy got the idea to come to this place in the middle of a deadend street in a small town and tell us a story about a girl who dies and finds herself in the possession of two guys who aren't really her boyfriends. A story that is not at all interesting or well-written.   I mean who really cares about the girl who is in the hands of these guys anyway right. ? You know that movie where they are in jail and the cop on the outside asks why they can't just kill them but they can just run and he gives them an ultimatum of either they give him all the money in the bank or he will let the girls go.  It sounds like something that a kid would make up or watch in the late 70's.  What are the girls actually doing to their boyfriends when they die and go to hell???

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Don't do it.   What's the point?   You might be impressed by the special effects but if you don't like a movie, what's the big deal?  It's only $5 more than a movie from the 70's and you're going to miss it.  I was going to make a joke about this but it seems like you need to be in a movie like this to take a stand against it. You can't just watch this and go "yeah, I don't care about this movie".   I know they had some great fights and explosions.  But I'm not going to argue with those who say that it was a poorly written movie.  I'm sure that's a given by any fan of the original series.  It does not hold up to the original at all and I'm surprised this is being brought up as a positive.  The CGI is awful, everything has a flat look to it and it just isn't very fun to look at.  If it was from the original cartoon, this would have been a different matter. But since it was based off of the TV series, it was not an easy task.   I will say, if you're just into the characters and their interactions, you'll be fine.  You may not get into the fight scenes but you won't hate it either.  However if you want to know why this movie is so bad, look no further than the music.  From the opening theme, "All For You" by The Bee Gees to the final credits, "My Way", the music by Michael Bolton is just dreadful.  This is not even the worst thing about this film though. The plot is bad but even worse, the characters are bad.  There's nothing special about them except that they have an annoying voice.  Not only does the music ruin the movie, the voice acting was just awful.  They're trying to say something in every scene and no matter how many times I watched it, I had the same voice over again and again.  A lot of the time, the words would say "I want to go out with you" and then "I'm fine" or "I've got a boyfriend" and they'd say something else.  Now, this might not be a big deal for the die hards out there who are into The Avengers but for a movie with that many people in it,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a very bad movie.   The acting was terrible. The story was made up as it went along.  The story is about a girl that goes to visit her brother, but the movie tries to make up for that in the form of a horror movie. It was poorly written and the movie was not scary at all.  It's a good thing that the movie ended in a way that made it all work out.  For the most part this movie just sucked. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just saw this movie and, no, I was not disappointed at all. It has a lot going for it, and I'm not necessarily a big fan of the franchise, but I didn't find myself really enjoying it. It's very similar to The Thing, in a lot of ways, and it had some of the same issues with the plotline and the direction.   The film doesn't feel as fresh as the other films in this franchise, and there are quite a few scenes that feel forced, or unnecessary.  It's not a terrible film by any means, but it's just...different.  There are some pretty cool set pieces throughout the film, but the plot itself never really got interesting to me.  I would say that, for the most part, it's not the best film of the series, but to say that it's terrible is almost unfair. I think that it is very much like The Thing in that sense.  "You've got to learn not to stand in the way of the car when the engine starts to rev."  The final act of this film was pretty great. I especially loved the final sequence, where they found the alien and made a hasty retreat.  The climax of this movie was really well written and set up, and did a great job at making the film feel like it had the emotional weight it needed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     [The movie] is an abomination. It's an abominable, idiotic film. It is a horror film with absolutely zero suspense, zero menace. If you are looking for a story, you are going to be disappointed. You will be horrified by the ending. You are going be completely disappointed. The character development is a joke. The acting is horrible. The dialogue is the most horrendous and ridiculous of all times. The music is also horrible. I mean just listen to a sound effect in the movie. It doesn't stop! This is a film that was created with no sense of storytelling. It was created by somebody who had absolutely zero talent. I didn't even like the actors in this film. This movie is so awful. I don't think it's even a good movie. I couldn't believe it was made. It didn't make me laugh at all. It made me think about it for a few seconds, but by that time I was too disgusted to watch it. It might get an "R" rating, but I don�t think it deserves that. It would be a better idea for the government to take these kids out of school and put them in jail. This is one of the worst things I have seen in my life. You won't find a single redeeming feature in this movie. You're better off with something better, like 'Jaws'.   ---   Closing: __________________---Closing:"[The] movie is an aberration. It�s an abnegation. It lacks the capacity to be scary.

I would have thought the movie would get an R, but since the studio is releasing it under "Rotten Tomatoes" it has to get an A!I don�tshouldhavebeen surprised bythe rating. It seems pretty clear that the studio thinks that the film is worth an "A". This rating shows that their assessment of the movie is quite different to ours. I do, however, have to disagree with the studio�s assessment. The movie isn�s rating of "A" is based on the word of a woman who has only seen a small amount of it, and who is not the least bit qualified to judge the movie in any kind of detail. And, of course, the movie isn't even finished yet.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So, this was the movie I had really been looking forward to. I had not seen it in years and was excited to finally watch it. I was in the mood for an action thriller, so I was glad that they did the "Hulk" thing. I'm a huge fan of the comics, and I'm also a big fan of "The Incredible Hulk", so I got the whole package. It's not a movie that I would re-watch to see if it had a different ending. The Hulk does go back and forth in time, but is generally still in the present. It was entertaining, and the action was good, but there was a little bit too much CGI in places that made me cringe a bit. I felt like I was watching a "G.I. Joe" movie when it came to some of the fights. For example, when Hulk and the lady were fighting, he turned into the Hulk as she was being hurt. I could not believe that Hulk did that when I saw the footage of him in the movie. I'd never seen a movie have so many special effects and make my jaw drop. The fight scenes were also too slow. That's just my opinion, though. I know people love the Hulk in the movies, but I thought he should be a bit more energetic. It could be better. I would have loved to see a scene with The Incredible Hulk versus a monster like in "Planet Hulk". But, overall, I thought this was a good action movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a movie I would hate, but I really like the concept and how much I think the ending is brilliant. A very well shot movie with a fantastic plot. What could be better? It's just a horrible movie for all its worth. It is very obvious that the director has had no practice when it comes to directing and the special effects are just terrible. It's not like that's a bad thing, but in a movie like this, you can't really tell when a special effect is going to work. And even though the special effect effects aren't terrible, they're definitely not the best. In particular, the flying cars are just not very interesting and just look like someone put some paper mache cars in a car and painted them pink and white. This is another movie that's very obvious why the director is so terrible at this and the quality of the movie has already been ruined for us.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A.I. Artificial Intelligence is a pretty bad movie. It has many flaws, and the problems are many and major. Some of them are just laughable: such as the fact that the main character is a computer. A computer that, at times, gets confused and doesn't know what to do in certain situations; and it's not as if you can blame the AI for not knowing what to think or do. It's also not as though the computer is some dumb piece of junk that's just there to fill space; this computer can learn how to tell the difference between a person and their body and even when it comes to its own existence. Then, there's the whole "I-am-an-artificial-intelligence" thing. Sure, the movie gives away some of the plot, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The movie is a lot of fun, and you get to see characters you know and love in different roles. The writing isn't bad, but there is too much exposition in some scenes. I think the movie would be more enjoyable if it was more like a parody of itself.   This movie might be considered a parody. The plot is made up of an AI that can take on the personality of whoever the AI is watching at the time. It can make the AI feel like a person, and give them commands. You also have a whole bunch of other AI, such as an android cop, an android doctor, a computer that is really smart, a robot maid, and a computer who isn't, and they all have their own personalities. The AI of course is in charge of a series of people that are living in a virtual world created by some people called the "E.E.C.L.E." The movie does a great job of making you laugh in all the right ways. The film was made to parody a lot, but not in a way where it just feels like it was done to be a slap in the face to any and all AI. The people making this movie were actually a lot more intelligent than you might think. It also contains a few clever, amusing moments. The worst thing about this movie is the ending. It is a little weird. It really doesn't fit in with anything else. I didn't find this ending particularly sad, but it was a little strange for a movie where the main characters are AI.  The final scene of this movie isn't as funny as

This movie is about a guy who decides to stay with his girlfriend. The reason why he does so is because of her good looks.  This guy has a very bad reputation for sleeping with any woman. However, after watching this movie, he begins to realize the futility of sleeping with women in order to meet women. It was a funny movie with funny people.

(They might be reading this to figure out the identity of a particular reviewer, or to find out why an author's work has been reviewed by a particular writer.

The guy who plays him is kind of a dumbass and seems to be trying to make a name for himself in the porn industry. I guess he's trying to be a pornstar, but I don' t know if he ever will be.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a well done movie, and while it is not really a 'bad' movie (I just feel it fails to hit its mark), it lacks a few things that make other movies hit their mark better, and a few other aspects of the story that don't make any sense.   The first thing that I disliked is the ending.  I felt like it had a strange "I should have done this a lot sooner" feeling to it, and it was not in a good way.  "Do I make you happy, Jack?"  I would say this is a good idea, but it isn't executed properly.  The other two characters do make an appearance at the end, but they aren't in the best of shape.  While the movie was good, I can't say it was memorable.  This one is just not a very good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     [Note to self: Don't say "I loved it" to my mom.]  "I have been a film buff for many years. I have seen many a great movie. I loved this one! I am a big fan of Robert Altman and John Schlesinger. The film is very well made. Very much like a John Schayser classic. It is not a typical romance. This is a love story from start to finish. My mom and I looked forward to every second of this. It was very enjoyable. I highly recommend it. I am an old-timer but this is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I would recommend this to anyone! Thank you for such a great story. I will continue to enjoy your movies. You have done a fine job." -Dana L.  Read the full review!  See the trailer here!  in a way that's completely accurate to reality. And also has a "love story" element.  I read an interview with Robert Altmans on my website about this film, and he said that this was based on his real-life experience of meeting a beautiful woman and being in love with her. This film is not set in the 1960's. I love that it's set in our time. I also like that it is about two people in love. I think that Altman really captured the idea of romance in a romantic sense with the love scenes. The movie is also very funny, and I also enjoyed the way that it was set at night, and all of the music. I liked how it was not really an action film. It didn't really have a lot of action in it, but it was more about two characters having an adventure. I felt that this movie was very romantic, and was more of a love letter to John Schuesinger. This movie could have been more of an action movie, because it was a little predictable and didn't have a really strong punch. Overall, I liked this movie. It's definitely not for everybody. It definitely had a lot more than just a romance in it. But it's a great romantic movie that I really enjoyed, and is definitely worth a watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The director of "Gravity," Alfonso Cuarón, has been an enormous influence on me as a film-maker. "The Prestige," which is in every way a superior film, but not quite "Grav", is in fact a very good movie and I'm glad that Alfonso is directing it. "Gone Girl" was another highly regarded and very good film that is now in an unsatisfactory state because it never lived up to its potential. In my opinion "The Girl on the Train" is a film that should be better known by a large number of people.  - April 17, 2015Alfonso Cuaron's film is much better
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     1. The Wicker Man (1970) (The film begins with an excellent opening sequence showing a man (Peter Cushing) going into the woods to see a Wicker man. The movie has no special effects but does have one of the most memorable performances by Peter Cushing. The ending shows a big car crash as well as a fire.   I like this film. However, the ending was so ridiculous that it was kind of like "The WickerMan's death scene was so bad it's great" type of thing. It also had that "Berserk meets The Twilight Zone" feel. In fact, I would rather watch a different film about a Wickersman but then again, this one had one of my all time favorite scenes and performances.  This film is well-acted. Some characters are portrayed in such a way that you can tell you are watching a "real" movie.  For example, when the Wicker-man is captured by a farmer, a child stands up in the audience and screams, "You're just like the man that's killing the Wickersmen!"  2. Black Sabbath (1979) (This movie is about a black metal band called Black Sabbath. It has a very interesting premise. It's about a woman (Joan Jett) who is in a coma and is going through a series of visions. There are times when she seems to be seeing God in the form of Black Sabbath members (Geezer Butler, Bill Ward, Tony Iommi). In other scenes, she sees people she's known for years (Herself, her boyfriend and her children) who then die. This is a rather interesting film for a woman to watch and it doesn't leave the viewer wondering if the woman really is in the hospital.    3. The Godfather Part II (1974) (In this film, Don Vito Corleone is shown killing people and going to heaven as well. The violence is very graphic and even scenes that seem like they are innocent are violent and brutal. I was afraid of some of the death scenes because of the violence that was going on. However the violence is not as great in this film as in some other films that were later made.  If I were to do a top five for violence, I might do a film like this but instead I just want to mention this film because it has one of those classic endings that the director
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     "Why do they call it a summer blockbuster when it's only gonna last one weekend?"   (May 20, 2008)  As my wife and I drove out to the movies on Friday afternoon, we wondered if there was a better movie we could have seen that night.   We knew that Disney had a movie that we both loved in this genre of sci-fi-action movies that were sort of comedies with lots of explosions.  It would have been hard to pick a better time to see this movie since it's just opening now in 3 theaters.  And it's gonna be great for the whole family (not just the adults who like the explosions!)  We ended up going to see "The Amazing Spider-Man."  And we loved it!  The movie had a great mix of comedy, action and a ton of humor.  This is a good movie and I think you'll enjoy it too!  If you're up for a fun summer movie and can handle some of the sci- fi elements in it, you'll have a good time.  It's like Spider-man meets the Bourne Supremacy. The Spidey suit and the futuristic weapons are great but I wish they had put a little more time into the character of Peter Parker.  He was pretty weak and didn't seem like much of a hero.  While the action was pretty awesome, it also took too long to get going.  I think if they had cut the action up a bit, it could have helped it out a lot.  If they kept it the way it was, this movie would have had a much better ending.  The only reason I gave it a 4 is because the movie was pretty long.  But I liked the way they kept the action moving.  For kids who aren't big on action movies, they'll enjoy this one.  In my book it won't be a great movie but it will be a good family movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film that changed my life is now banned in some countries because of the "racist" content.   A girl, born in China and raised in Australia, is transported to a magical land filled with dragons, unicorns, and other fantasy creatures where she finds herself at the tender age of 11.  While in this land, a girl is taken to a very big castle where she is married off to the king and becomes his concubine. The "exotic" place and the "love" for a girl of 12 years makes one think of a fairy tale.   As a child, I was told that this was the only movie ever made about the "dragon prince" and his quest for love.  But as a young adult, I realized that the story was very racist.  We were meant to believe that this dragon prince is actually just a white man in a dragon costume, and he is the one in love with a black princess.  He is not "gifted" by nature as many Disney movies would have us believe.  In the film, the princess is seen as a "savage," and she's forced to marry the dragon prince because the country is ruled by dragons.  The dragon prince gets her pregnant and then kills her when he discovers that she's pregnant.  This is a pretty "racist," and sexist, way to portray a "gift of nature."  In addition to the racist depictions of the princesses and their culture, there were other "racist stereotypes" in this film that were too shocking to look at.  Some people thought that the dragons were "bigots" because they were only interested in white women.  I was surprised that these people were even watching this movie. It was the same for many people that I know and have known all my life. I even remember having an argument with an African-American man about this film.  It was just a film. This man has no idea how to express himself.  People say that we are "racist until we see a black face" because we've been brainwashed by racism and the media.    People in Africa do not want white people to go there because it's full of "black people."  But that is what we are taught by our teachers and government officials.  If we say anything against this, we are labeled "racist."   I'm going to be honest, I didn't know much about black people when I

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A   The story is about a young boy who is sent to live with his uncle after his parents were killed in an accident. He meets a girl, and soon they get married. This is the beginning of a very short movie, which makes it rather boring. The movie is not good. The characters are not well drawn, and they look like ordinary people (if that can be called ordinary). The story can easily be described as a love story between two people who don't know what they want (but at the end of the story the boy is married, and the girl is pregnant). The only part that makes it worth watching is the ending, where the boy finds a very old book written by his mother in the form of a letter. The boy reads it to the girl (he is still a teenager and he finds it very romantic). The ending is very romantic, and I recommend watching this movie. However, I'm sure if the story was better, it would be more interesting to watch.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Sorensen from A very simple and interesting story. I loved it. I liked it more as a child than as an adult. It is very simple, but the story makes it interesting and different. There are two different love stories that are intertwined in this movie, and one is more important than the other. There were so many good moments and the end made me cry. This was my first movie I ever saw (and one of the very few from my childhood).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a wonderful movie, it has great action and you will enjoy watching it!   It is just an ok movie.   The acting is mediocre, the music is weak and the characters don't have any depth.  This movie has too many plot holes and does not move at all.  It takes a long time to get going.  I was expecting a more action packed movie, not a half assed comedy like this.  It is just a bad excuse for a film and it is very disappointing for a studio that has such a good reputation.  The movie is not just a boring movie. It has it's moments in it, but you have to pay more attention to what is going on.  If you are looking for an interesting action movie and a good movie to watch with friends you should not go to this movie.    Recommend this movie:

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this film on Friday evening and I felt I could have waited til after dinner to see it. However, when I went into the theater to see what the buzz was, I was very disappointed. It's just not a very good movie. The characters are all stereotypes, the dialog is very cheesy and the plot is a complete mess. It makes me wonder if they even shot this one. I really felt the story was poorly written and it just felt like they went in and did what was most common. In other words, they took the standard tropes of the time and just made it a "horror film". What was a classic horror film became a trashy teen horror film. Not only is the film cheesy and lame, but it's not even scary. I had a hard time watching it because it just didn't make sense. Not the best horror film of the 1980's. Rating: 2 out of 5 Stars Rating: 3 out of 10 Stars Posted by Darryl at 7:57 PM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So... I was at a friend's birthday party (I was 15 at the time) and the girl next to me decided to sit in my lap as I walked out of the party.   After this she went over to a guy who was also with a group and put her hand on his knee.  She went over and sat on the edge of his lap as well as one of the guys next to her.  I remember that we had to stand around in a group because people were just staring at us as we walked away.  One of the girls next to us said to the guy who had her hand down his pants: "I bet you're a virgin".   At this point the guy just looked at me and said: "Well... you wouldn't want to be if I didn't" I remember saying to him: "If I didn'n know you I wouldn't believe you".  My friend took the picture.   (I had just turned 15)   This photo has since been deleted from all my social media.  When this happened my friend and her were friends with my friend.  My other friend told me that I had to tell this to my father.  This is what she told him... he wasn't shocked, and my dad did agree with my story.  So here's the story...   I was in a classroom with the girl who put her hands on the guy's knee. I didn 't realize that her friend had been talking to my friend at the party and it wasn't until later that I asked my friend what had happened.  "She put her arm around him and put a hand on the crotch of his pants."   My dad told me to tell my brother and my sister about this and asked me if I thought my sister had seen my brother or if he was hiding.  The photo went back to her and her friend and they laughed at it.  It made me feel horrible because it was such a stupid thing to do.  There were other girls there that witnessed this as well.  After the party, my dad told my brother about it and he went to my sister.  We got into an argument about this. My sister said that I shouldn't have told him about it. My dad felt that it was a private thing between my sister and the guy.  However, my brother did agree that the photo should have been deleted, but the photo never was.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a classic that we are very much still trying to enjoy. There are only three actors who work their asses off and it makes for a very entertaining and entertaining film that is filled with laughter and fun. The only thing I do not like about this film is that this is a Western. This is not one of those things that we have today.     Lenny B.  The whole thing was not a great film, there were a few moments that got the blood pumping and this was the time, but for the most part it was just dull. The thing that bugs me the most is that they could have done more with the story. They could have kept it going for 10 minutes at a time and had a few of the characters show up on screen.     My Rating: 3/5 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was not a big fan of this movie but then I saw it again and I don't have to say much about it, it's just a terrible movie. I'm no expert in film criticism so I can't really comment much on its performances but I'll try to do my best.   The biggest problem with the movie is the fact that we have to sit through the entire movie with this woman playing a character called "Kara" (I've never seen her on screen before) and a bunch of other women who all act as if they are in love with her.  We never actually see Kara herself, just the reactions to her and her story which doesn't help.  Kara is a young woman that has an abusive husband and we see her struggle to come to terms with this life.  It's not very clear if she knows how to make a life for herself or if her mother does not want her to have a life.  At one point she decides that she will not stay in her husband's house anymore and is left alone and homeless, but what really makes the movie really bad is that she tries to kill herself.  I would love to say that her suicide attempt was genuine but this is not a film that is very sympathetic and it doesn't give us any reason why Kara was so desperate to end her life. I also hate the idea that the other women are being abused but these women do not have very strong motivations to want to leave their husbands or to end their abusive relationships.  A lot of these women don't even really know what they are doing and they really have no motivation to leave at all.  Finally Kara's mother (Ayelet Zurer) seems to get off very easily as it's clear that she's more concerned about her mother's happiness than about Kara's well being.  All the while she's still thinking of how to take Kara out of the house.  There are times when Kara does really stand up for herself but the movie just seems to want us to be happy for her, to be more tolerant of her life than we are.  In the end she's just not able to take it and she just kind of gets stuck in her ways.  It's hard to take a film like this seriously because it's not a very good film and it's hard for me to imagine anyone watching it thinking it's a good film.  If I were to give this movie a 0 I would be
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie in the sense that it was a bad film is a movie that's bad in the most literal sense, i.e. it isn't good.   Bad movies in the  literal sense are movies that are terrible but aren't actually very bad.  What is a bad  movie?   It's a movie where there is nothing in it worth watching, and you have to watch it for the wrong reasons (i.e., to see a great actor, to see someone do a stunt, etc).   The difference between a bad and bad   movie is a question of how bad the movie is relative to a bad experience.  It doesn't matter whether or not you can actually see the movie; you simply have to have a bad time.  A movie like, say, "Superbad" can be bad if it really is bad, but it's not really bad , because it's a bad thing, and it doesn't feel like a bad thing to you.  A movie like "Dumb and Dumber To" could be bad  if it were bad in a way that you could watch and find it to be bad, if you are in the mood for a bad flick.  "Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith" is a good movie.  But it isn' t very good. It's really good   and good .  It is not really a bad or bad  movie, and this is the problem. It is so good that it feels like a good  movie. And if the movie isn't really very good, it also feels like you were entertained.  Because you were not bored.  Or, you were just not in the right frame of mind.  The "bad" in "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" is like "star" in that it isn''t exactly "bad".  It feels like "bad", and the film is very good , but it isn'"t really bad. "The Empire Strikes Back" is about the most important thing in the movie. The fact that Darth Vader is a great character means that there is a lot of tension, and the scene where he turns to Luke is so tense because he has to turn Luke, but he's too late. And it's really cool that it is so difficult for him to do it, but eventually he does. And this is a big deal
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I like the story. But the plot is too hard to understand and too dumb. If the script writers will not improve this, then they should be ashamed to make a movie. The way the movie is made in general is a complete failure. I also can not understand why he keeps shooting the guy that is trying to get away from the gang.  The movie is so much better without the gang as the only thing to fear. The gang can be annoying but the movie still has a lot of heart.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I saw this, I thought it was going to be about a boy and his cat. The main character is a young girl who has come to her first ever "snow" party, and her friend is an all around nice guy. But I was expecting something more serious, something like The Snowman. Then I started to realize that it was a children's movie. What was supposed to be a heartwarming tale about a cat who loves his owner turned out to be something much darker. My initial expectation of this being a really sweet, sweet story turned out not to be the case. My main problem with this movie was that it didn't make sense. There are two versions of the plot, one has the main character helping a little boy who gets lost in the woods and comes to a strange village to ask for help. The other version has the same boy, but he was actually a dog. He wants his master back, and he must go out to find the witch who was mean to him, because she killed his master. In this version, the village is evil and all the people are mean to the dog. It wasn't a good idea to have the main characters travel to a creepy village to find their master. They have a whole village to save...I don't know if it was intentional, but this didn't seem like an original story or even a story at all. At the end, they find their mentor, and the dog gets along with his master better, but I can't say I feel any connection to this story...the characters weren't really developed at all, and they didn't even seem like they were supposed to. I think this movie got a lot of flack for the way it's written, because the movie does not look like a childrens movie. The animation was bad and the acting was bad, the special effects are nothing special either. I found this movie to be really bad...my kids thought it made a lot more sense. I would only watch this to get a laugh, not because it is a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Do not write something negative about a movie unless you are the type who will never forgive a movie that was a total failure. No matter how much time you spend on a movie, you will eventually be disappointed.  The movie is about a girl named Maria who is traveling to meet a boyfriend. It all sounds simple, but Maria has to endure countless challenges.   I do not like to watch a movie where there is a very important theme and then have a movie about how a girl has to suffer in order to meet this guy. I can only say that it was a little strange that it focused on a very typical female character and not the plot of the movie.  The music for this movie was good. I always enjoy hearing good music. It helps the movie out a lot.  Although I do understand that most people are not going to care for this film. I'm not sure why it got such a bad review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Do not complain about a movie you just watched, even if you feel the same way. A film may have some redeeming qualities if you like it. If not, don't waste your time or the movie's. I don't remember a single bad film I watched. If you feel bad about it, or feel like complaining about something, just don't.   If you enjoyed this movie, you'll probably enjoy it again.   The movie is bad, but that is not a good reason to rate it any less than a 1. The story and characters were not bad, or bad enough to merit a 1 or 2. The worst thing about the film, in my opinion, is its length. It is a movie with only 14 minutes of actual runtime. The music and effects are not great and the editing is horrible. However, the story was worth the watch. The main characters were good. The dialogue was very well done. And, most importantly, the art and music were excellent.    I enjoyed the story and the characters very much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        The first movie was a good movie and the movie from the beginning was great. If I were to review this movie I would say it was a really good movie.   And that's not saying much but I don't think that I can deny this movie was good.  The story goes like this.  There was an earthquake in Chile during the first movie. The first woman that survived that earthquake was the main character in this movie. She is the one that the man is obsessed with and that the movie is set in a way that he gets her pregnant and then he tells her to kill the baby in a horrible way that makes it look like an accident and her husband is also obsessed with her.  And so she decides to try to have a baby.  It seems like there is a lot of stuff going on with the people and there are no more characters that are introduced.  Then things start getting really messed up and there is more and more bad things happening.  This movie is a great story.  When I first saw it I thought it was going to be about a man that had a son that he wasn't able to take care of, and that he had to take the baby from the other wife who was already pregnant and kill it.  But there were some really great things that made me really love this movie and I think that it will be remembered in my mind for a long time.  One of those really great thing was the fact that the story starts in Chile and ends in Chile.  So it was really interesting to see how the people lived there, and I felt like there were many similarities between Chile and the real life.  Unfortunately when I watched this movie, it started to get really confusing because there is an island somewhere in the middle of the film.  Because of that island everything was confusing and hard to understand at times.  I really think that they could have saved some time to explain what was going on there.  Another very important thing about this movie is that it has a really great soundtrack.  All of the songs were really good and they had a really cool and creative way of using those songs.  Now I really would like to know what the soundtrack is like in real life, because I do like to listen to it at home.  If you think it is really good I would recommend to you to watch it again, because this soundtrack is really really great and it really made this movie a great
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a terrible movie. It was awful. I don't know how they got it made. It is the definition of an awful movie. There are just a lot of bad ideas. The main bad idea in this movie is that there is a movie "The Last Samurai". There is a big black man (the evil villain) and a white man (who has a bad attitude) who fight with each other. The movie " The Last Samurai" was a remake of a film called "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" in which the movie "Last Samurai" plays a small part. They tried to add violence to this film. One scene in this film shows the evil villain taking a bullet in the arm and the white man who has a good attitude taking it to the arm. Both men cry and then they laugh. This movie made me want to see more people die in movies. There were too many bad ideas in this bad movie. The bad guy and the good guy were both bad and the scene after the main bad guy was shot was just stupid and not funny. There is no plot to this movie and no characters to care about. There was only "The End". When the movie ended, I just walked out. It's a bad film that was made in the 1980s. Don't waste your money on this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I haven't seen a bad action movie in a while. This movie has some really cool scenes, and it's a shame that so many things go wrong. I'm glad that a lot of the scenes are cool, but the action is over the top.   The film starts with some cool scenes in the beginning. I like the action sequences in these types of movies. When you have to do something fast, you know what you need to do and why it is done. The first scene of the movie is an example of good action. The guy gets some quick kills, then is about to be gunned down by some guys, who are really a little too cool to shoot a guy with a pistol. The two guys take a little time getting to the target, and then shoot him in the neck. There is no time for that because there are more guys about to show up to shoot the guy. The scene is a little slow, because of the time and money it took to make the movie, and the amount of people involved, but it worked great. The other scenes with the cool shots were fine. This is a good action movie, but some of the fast kills are very cheesy.  I really don't like the guy in this movie  The other guys take their time getting in the car, and they are cool.  The action starts to slow down a little bit as well.  There are some funny moments with the three guys.  This movie is definitely a fun action movie.  For this review, I am only rating the movie 2.5 stars.  I am disappointed that this movie is not better.  It starts out good, then turns boring and bad.  Overall, I give the movie 1.5 out of 5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   (  ) This one has some cool visuals, but the story is completely incoherent. The whole film is shot on computer, and it looks pretty good. There's a scene where a guy goes to see a movie and tells his wife about it. She says that it's about a guy who wants to fuck a chick that he just met. He's upset because he was a virgin when he met her, and they both have sex before he realizes. But after he fucks her, he realizes that he's a virgin again! He decides to go with this chick, but she starts cheating on him with a guy. He ends up telling her that he only had sex with one guy, but he got her pregnant. (  ) I thought the movie was pretty cool, but I couldnt help but feel that the director wanted to make it into a sex comedy, but couldn't come up with a story for the movie. (   ) I do like the idea that there's a guy on a computer, but it's not explained why he has that computer, or what it does. ( The reviewer claims that the movie's plot is not coherent and that the characters are also not really developed. I think that they are just trying to add in this "silly" storyline. ) (   )  I also like this movie, but i cant help but to feel that it lacks something. I can't say why it lacks somethings, but they definitely need to make a movie about the "computer guy".  (  If you love:     ( The first movie is also a good movie. )
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only reason it gets any decent scores is because it's a horror movie and that scares the shit out of many people.   I think the biggest thing keeping this film from being a real classic is that it's so badly acted, and there are no real good characters.  The only reason this film gets any reviews is because of it's horror value.  I don't think it could have been any more scary.  This film was made in the early 80's and was made to shock and scare a younger audience.  These scenes just make it look like it was made with the hopes of making a profit on it's budget.  They even tried to add violence, which I don' t think was necessary since the film was rated NC-17.  The story was so bad that it is completely unbelievable.  It really seems like the production crew had no idea what they were doing, they couldn't even make an attempt at a believable story.  When the film ends, we are left confused.  There is no closure on the plot, and no explanation for the mysterious death.  So basically this film was an expensive flop because it was completely unnecessary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If it was a good movie, the reviews would be great.   I really liked " The Devil's Backbone."   It's about a woman in the 1930's who meets a doctor who claims he can cure her of a fatal illness, and she's fascinated by his claims.  But things go awry, and while trying to help a group of children, she ends up killing one of them.  As I said before, I'm not a horror fan, but I enjoyed it.  My favorite scene in the movie was when the doctor gets her to admit to her part in the crime.  I was a little disappointed that I never saw a sequel.  And if there were any sequels, it would be about "The Devil's Dog and Cat," but there's no way a sequel could have been made in this century, so we're out of luck. I only wish the movie had been more successful.  Now, I don't know if any of you are horror fans, but there aren't too many "cat and dog" movies.  If you love cats, you might like this.  For those of you who are horror fanatics, you'll enjoy it. Posted by John at 8:17 AM

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You won't get very far with this one, even with the best intentions.   The plot revolves around the relationship between two people in a romantic relationship.  I loved that the movie didn't get too complicated about how the two main characters found each other.  The story was decent, but I found it a little silly.  They had a few too many people getting killed.  This movie is about a guy who has to rescue his friend who was in the ocean and was taken by a group of sharks.  He saves his friend, and he then becomes "the one", the one they're all after.  And he has to do a lot of crazy stuff.  A lot of time is spent on a beach, and then they have to find out where the sharks are.  You will find yourself at a loss for words at certain points, and there are some scenes that are just a bit hard to watch.  There are some pretty dark themes that are brought up.  But the movie also had a lot more to it than what I'm going to say, so that it would be worthwhile.  Overall I would say that the picture wasn't very good.  When you get in that boat, it is hard to believe that it could be anything other than water.  It's like the movie doesn't know that sharks have to swim on their stomach, and can't swim in the open ocean, so he has no idea how the sharks will react.  Another thing that really bothered me was the main character.  Because he looks like a clown, he really seemed to be a "joke" character. He was funny, but it seemed like he didn't have any personality.  His actions were pretty random.  What was interesting was that there was a part in the movie where it seemed that they were in a dangerous situation that needed saving. But the end of the movie made it seem that they had a good time.  One thing that I liked about this movie was that it was not "a movie for children".  I wouldn't put it past them.  While the movie was good, I didn't want to watch it as often as I wanted to, and I had the same thought about the movie in the beginning, "why is this movie so hard to take?".  It really is worth the watch, but not for those people who are looking for a good movie to watch on their date.  Also, this
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     It is possible to be a huge fan of a TV show, or movie, or music and still think it's a total shambles. That's what makes this review a bit unfair, but then I know I'm not alone in the same situation. I just think that the only reason why I can't just give up and watch something I don't like is that I know it would be just as much of a letdown as the next guy. I don  I have to admit that I do have a problem with a lot of TV shows and movies these days, and when I say a lot I'm talking about the majority of them. It's very clear to me that Hollywood has no idea what they're doing in this matter. They seem to think that it's okay to put out mediocre movies and TV shows that are terrible, because if the people who watch them like it, then it's just fine. But the reality is that nobody likes bad movies, and the majority only really watches them because they're expecting something a bit better than what they've got. I'm actually getting really tired of movies nowadays, because they have no creativity or originality anymore, and it's getting to the point where I just can't stand watching movies. I love them but that's all I have to say about that.Now if I would only listen to the writers and directors in this industry, I would actually be in a better place, because a lot have done their job well, and I can watch movies like this all day and still love them. But as a viewer, I can tell that these movies really don't live up to the expectations. I mean what does the guy in the movie with the fake teeth know about being an athlete, when the guy who is pretending to be the athlete is a moron? I guess if I was the one who was pretending to play football, it would have been a little easier, but it seems like this movie was made just for the purpose of making a bunch of money. And the more money they get for it, the worse the movie gets.Now I know this isn't the worst movie ever made, but what I want to know is: why do they keep making them? It is possible that there are some people out there who do like this kind of movie. But why do most people seem to not care about any of these kinds of movies? And the answer to that is simple. People aren't
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The first three stories are of a kind which are common to all the Chinese stories. I was disappointed at first because the first story is so different from the other three. It does not have the usual structure: the first part is so brief that you know what the action is about and who the main characters are. The second part is not so long either. The third part is long, but in a typical Chinese fashion, the story doesn't go in the right direction. The last part is very long, and it has a climax that makes you see the entire story from beginning to end. This is the last part of the three parts, but what is the point of a three-part story? It makes no sense, and yet it is a classic story of the Chinese novel. The author is probably the best writer of Chinese stories since Lu Xun (1896-1967). These three stories have something in common: each is a story of one man who falls in love with a woman who has become his wife. I am not saying these stories are not good or don't have merit. The first story of this novel is so good, it is difficult to read it because there are three separate stories running together. The story of a widow who has a child by another man, and the story of another man's wife who becomes his wife as he tries to bring her back to him - this is a good story. The other two stories do not interest me much, but this story is excellent. It is well written, and you get a clear understanding of what happens. The narrator of this story, called the Dragon, is not as good as the narrator of the first two stories of this book. This narrator is more like a narrator of historical novel like the one by Wang Hui. I think this is because the narrator for the third part of this Chinese novel is a bit different. The Dragon is a man who was the main character of the novel The Yellow Emperor, a story about a woman named Sun Xiu, who becomes the mistress of a young man named Ye, and later on falls in a mysterious illness, dies, and becomes the wife of a man named Ch'ien. Ch'in Ch'uan is Ye's older brother. She was born in the time of the Emperor Wudi of Han. Sun was the only child from her father and the second of her mother. Sun had very little life experience, but she had a certain beauty.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the first time in a long time where i am going to review a movie by myself.   The movie started good enough, but it just felt like it lacked direction. I'm not sure if it was the actors acting or the script but it felt like no one really got behind it. The acting seemed to be generic, which is a major problem with the show as well.  The movie was also plagued with unnecessary violence:  When it comes to the movie, there were too many unnecessary scenes. There was even an entire episode of the movie which wasn't used at all. The movie was littered with flashbacks, which took up a lot of the time in the movie.  In the end, the movie just felt unfinished.     You might also like:    My Top 10 Favorite Episodes of the 1990s     I was also upset to find out that this movie was a remake. I liked the original movie but didn't think they were able to replicate that movie's quality. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is impossible to see it through the prism of positive reviews.   As a result, I cannot in good conscience recommend this film to anyone.  There were several things I found very wrong with the film.  One of the most glaring things was that they just had too much of a scene where they all had an impromptu rave in the middle of the desert (no, really).  And then the "real" desert scene was filmed in a very artificial, artificial-looking way.  The other thing was that there were a lot of scenes where there wasn't a person in the frame. It seemed like they were filmed from a very wide angle so that the entire frame became a gigantic screen for them to have their own dance party.  I mean, just look at the scene where this one guy's head is on a big, giant television screen for like ten seconds!  I'm not gonna mention who it was, but that was one of the scenes that I found the most disturbing, as it showed that the characters in the film were so narcissistic and over-the-top that they couldn't even see the impact that their actions had on the other characters.  And in one of those scenes, this girl had to stand up on stage and get down on her knees and beg this dude for his heart, and all he did was point to his crotch and stare at her with those weird eyes like, "Why is she begging me for my heart?" (yeah right)  I just wanted to put that scene on every list of the dumbest movies ever made ever, but sadly, that's just not going to happen.  You'll have to find your own entertainment in that movie.  It was kind of a sad ending, and I felt like the movie should've ended with, "Well, that was just one of their dumbest shows ever!" (insert a picture of a drunken, disoriented, "Oh, god, what was I thinking?!!!" face here.)  And that's all I have to say about that film. It was a total waste of time, and it just didn't make any sense.  Why people complain about their kids' teachers:  Why do people complain so much about their teachers?  It's always "They're awful!  They never say a good word about me!  What's wrong with them?"  I can see where they're coming from, because teachers don't always do things the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My wife's husband saw this movie and he liked it but there were a couple of problems with it: (1) The acting in it was all over the place and it made you wonder who were they trying to make look like. We had to hear "I hate my life" at least 3 times a minute, we could hear them say "you're not black" in almost every line, and that was in the first half of the movie. The acting was really poor in the movie so it didn't help that much. (2) It was hard to tell who they were trying to show. I really thought we were supposed to be rooting for one side or the other. The bad guy, for all his hate, was more sympathetic than a lot of the people he hated and the hero, for the most part, was a really nice guy. (3) The movie was full of so many clichés, and when you put it next to a bad film by a big budget movie, you see all of them in that movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you have a good opinion on a movie, just don't tell anyone about it.   It's only human to have a bad day.  The negative reviews are mostly from people who have not seen the movie.  So what?  I'm the one who wants to see it so I can tell other people how much it sucks.  I don't want to see an 80s movie in 2017 so I shouldn't be subjected to it.   And of course there are those who write only bad reviews.  They've seen the good ones so they just write a negative one.  And since everyone knows that there is a good one out there somewhere, they will just read their own reviews and come up with the same old thing they always tell us.   You should never, EVER read a bad review about any film.  It means that person doesn't understand the movies they are talking about and they can't see the good points of the movie they just saw.  Also they probably hate it so much they are just trying to get the rating of the film high in their review.   A good movie with good reviews will get you a lot more attention.  There are only a few people out there who can tell you about a good movie, even if the ratings suck.  But if the bad ones keep on popping up, it's going to be hard for people to see good movies.   So let's all ignore those reviewers who have a problem with this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It isn't about the quality of the movie, but the quality the movie portrays.  There are some really bad movies out there and some really good ones. In many movies there are two sides, good and bad.  I was in the good side, but not the bad one. The bad side is the side the movie represents to me.  A movie, as I explained earlier, is what the audience sees.  And you as an audience member, or viewer in general are only seeing half of the picture.  It takes about 4/5ths of the film to see the movie in a whole.  If you are not experiencing the "full picture" I strongly recommend you watch it in a different medium.  Television is good because you can watch the movie on your own.  But if you are someone who just needs to watch something in order to get the full picture and get a sense of the story, then a movie is the best medium.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is bad.   It's not great but it's not bad. If you can get past the obvious badness of the movie I have to say it's actually pretty interesting.  The idea is not so different from "The Terminator" and a lot of the "80's" action movies where you have the same killer stalking someone for days and the protagonist doesn't realize he is being stalked until the killer does.  It has it's fair share of 80's action scenes but it does take place in the 21st century so it's also quite a bit different.  Unfortunately, some of the actors are terrible and the movie just doesn't make them look good.  But the movie is still entertaining and I'm looking forward to seeing the sequels.  If you liked "The Last House on the Left", then you will like "Hush".   Summary:  I like this movie because it has some unique elements and has a twist that keeps me interested. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "If they weren't on the same planet I wouldn't care" "I just don't like how he keeps going with that one, I mean he's already trying to use the movie as a way to get some attention." "What's so hard about going out, you know what I mean? They could at least try to find a girl who looks like she would enjoy it." This is a good example of how movies have been making the world a worse place over the years. For example, if we look at Hollywood, and how much more evil we're making movies about violence, and the murder rate, and all of that, I'm sure the world is much more peaceful now, but you wouldn't know it. The world is filled with horrible movies that exploit the worst aspects of human nature and are filled with hate and destruction. They have also contributed to a society that has been filled with ignorance and lies about what is real and real life. They can never replace all of the good in the world with movies, but the truth is they can help us by shining a light on the darkness. This movie is filled of a lot of hatred, lies and deceit. The movie would make an excellent addition to your shelf of movies you don't want to watch. But don't listen to the person next to you who tells you it's a good movie. Look at the facts, and do some research on what a good flick is. You'll find this movie, along with every other bad movie you've seen in your life, is a lie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film was a bit disappointing. In particular the opening scenes were a bit predictable and made me question if this was a sequel to the first film. The final battle was a little weak and it all ended with the same feeling of "uh oh, a movie is being done over again".  If you are a fan of the first one, you will most likely enjoy this one too, but there are some differences between the two movies that could possibly be worth pointing out.   The characters have changed a bit, most notably in the case of Humbert Humberts in the first movie. Most characters from that film have been killed off and Humberto in this one is quite different. He is no longer an old man, but still has all his senses. This is something I liked a bit about the first, I liked that the old man was still very much present and active. The second movie, on the other hand, is a bit more character-driven with Humbertho being the only main character.  The music in this film was ok. Nothing to really write home about, but not terrible either. It wasn't that bad either.  I would recommend this movie for anyone who likes to see some gore, action and creepy scenes.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think "The Mummy" is one of the best horror films in recent years.    The "ticking time bomb" scenario is interesting, and it makes you feel for the mummy's family members who are trapped in their home, living as slaves for the monster.  The CGI and special effects are quite good, and make the movie truly scary.  "The Curse" and "The Crazies" are some of the worst movies of the new year, and "Mummy" makes me realize why. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you want to have a good life, you have to understand some of the things that people say. For example, when people say you should cut the fat from your diet, they don't mean to say you can't eat as much as you want. In fact, a diet rich in vegetables and fruits is the best way to get your healthiest weight, and the best source of vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber.  The problem is that many of these vegetables and fruit are a lot harder to get in the supermarket. Also, many of them are packed with pesticides, genetically modified seeds, and other toxic substances. If you want a low-fat, low-sugar, nutrient-rich, and pesticide-free diet that actually tastes good, you'll find nothing more appealing than raw, whole food, whole foods.    Here are five good reasons why you should be making better food choices than these two are giving you:  1. Raw Foods Are More Nutritious  I know, I know, vegetables are supposed to be healthy. I mean, who's against veggies? But vegetables don't really do a lot for your health. The only way to really get the nutrients from veggies is through cooking. . You've probably heard the phrase "eat your veggies" at least a few dozen times. It's just a phrase that has stuck. The reason for that is that people don't usually think to make better food selections. They believe the foods they like, eat, and drink are healthy and do a ton of good for them. , so this makes a lot of sense. Eating whole foods is good for you, but it is also good for your waistline. Eat plenty of vegetables and you'll stay lean. Plus, it will help you maintain a healthy weight and a healthy blood sugar level. As a general rule, your body doesn't need more than about 30% of the calories from carbohydrates. Of those, 20% should come from complex carbs.   2. Raw Food Is Better For Your Mental Health  A lot of people believe they are mentally healthy and can't seem to lose weight. I know this is partly true. After all, the idea of having a diet and exercise regimen that is too intense is appealing. But the reality is that you can easily end up with weight issues because your body is overworked. You can't have the extra energy you need to keep yourself mentally sharp if
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What would you write about a movie that was bad? What would you say?     And what did you like?  The movie  "Citizen Kane" was released in 1941 and won six Oscars. It was a huge hit. I had been looking forward to this movie for weeks, so when I finally saw it I was completely enthralled. The first 30 minutes or so were okay, but then things went downhill. It seemed like this story was going to be told by just one person - a man - and it didn't really fit. I think a lot of it was about Kane himself. And it wasn't that the movie didn't follow any particular plotline. But it just seemed like it was going the wrong way. The whole plotline seemed like an elaborate joke. The movie got very repetitive. A lot of the humor was lost. I found the ending quite a disappointment. There were a lot more plot holes and inconsistencies than the plot itself was worth.       With that said, I think this movie has a lot to offer, even if it did suffer from the wrong decisions. "Citizen Kanes" is an extremely popular movie to this day. A recent re-release was made with the same script. It's a good movie, although it is no longer as "original" as it once was. It has a new score and some of the songs, like the "Brigsby Bear" tune, were better written. I guess there are a lot that can be said about this film. I don't think it is one of the greatest movies ever made. It just did not do well at the box office. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a good movie. There is no character development. The acting is all over the place. There are some very bad jokes. The only part of this movie that works is when you consider the other films that are based on this comic. Don't watch this one. Go see the movie based on "The Spectacular Spider-Man" instead.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I've seen.   I mean, I've watched all the movies that everyone says are bad but this one is not bad, it's just not as good as the others.  The plot is the same as all the others: some dude has to get to the other side and kill some monsters to get back home.  They all have that same sort of cheesy-ness going on.  I mean, they all have some sort of "magic" thing going on and stuff like that.  The bad-ness of the movie is in the plot.  For the plot to be as bad as it is it has to have a lot of things going on in it that are wrong.  A lot of the action is just a series of scenes that are done in the wrong order or at the wrong time and make no sense.  Even though I know the plot is bad the way it's presented and the things it is showing doesn't make sense, I just can't believe I was willing to watch this movie.  It's just like watching a terrible film that's made for the same reason that The Muppets or any other children's movie was made.  Maybe they had the budget to be able to put in more shots or more action than they had, or maybe they're just lazy and didn't give a shit about the story.  Like The Muppet Movie, it just comes across as cheap and lame.  But I guess it was really made for kids and not for adults to see.  And now that I think about it, I feel bad for the poor kid who didn't get a chance to see this movie, because it was so awful.  So if you're going to go see this, stay away from it because it's not worth it.  Not worth it at all.  Get a good babysitter:  I'm so glad my babysitter was great!  This was my first babysitter, and it was great.  She really helped out and made sure we weren't late for any events and stuff.  In addition, she brought me a nice gift.  This is what I got for my birthday.  What's the difference between a good and a great babysitter?   In the best case scenario, it has something for your kid.  Something to help him grow up and be more confident.     I want my kids to have friends who are willing

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie has been a hit and miss in my life. It had some good parts, but other than that was a train wreck. The acting is terrible. The script is like an over-exaggerated version of the movie it's based on. The plot is convoluted and the plot of this movie was like a "what-if". A few scenes that should have been cut out and that could have made the movie better, they were added to make it seem more like a movie. The ending is too unrealistic. It was a real cliff hanger that was the last thing I expected from this movie. You would think a studio would have a more polished script and better direction to follow a successful movie that was made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   . I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. I found it very entertaining, however I would have preferred the script to be more fleshed out. I do not care for the acting in this movie, it is cheesy and makes the movie a lot worse, the acting is mostly generic. The scenes with the bad guy and the good guy are very interesting and the bad guys seem to be pretty well written, but they are so predictable that the viewer can predict every line, every move, and their dialogue, if this were real life, there would be no need to do that because it would be too predictable. I did not care much for the story, but I do believe it was good because I thought the movie was worth watching. A fun watch for the kiddos who like to see a good "comic" style "bad movie." I will watch the movie again. Rating:    3
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "That's the only reason that the film was made." -- Roger Ebert on 'Blazing Saddles'    The first two thirds of 'Blowing in the Wind' are a wonderful time to get into a vintage story. Ebert begins by telling you why you should go see it, while still taking some time to introduce the characters and give a sense of where the story is heading. At no point do we ever have any sense that we will ever find out why the characters are so upset. It's clear that no one in the town has any real reason to hate Blowing in to Wind's characters. The one thing you do feel bad for is the kid, who gets kicked out of school. There's nothing too exciting about that, but the audience does feel sorry for him. The way Ebert tells it, you're meant to get that the kid is probably going to be a total wuss. That's what it's all about. At some point, Blowing the Wind becomes the story of a boy that goes out and meets a pretty girl who wants a relationship with him, but finds himself unable to get past his fear. Esteves main problem is that he's never shown a normal human response to the situation. He always does something that looks insane and makes no logical sense. So, in many ways, Ebert does a fine job of showing the story's logic.   You see, Bloating is a real and horrible thing. When a man is too fat, he just stops growing, as a result of the extra weight piling up on his abdomen. Even if he eats, he never gets any smaller. In the end, Bluming is doomed to stay fat.  Blowing, however, is not the story about Bluming, it's about a boy named Jack who goes out looking for girls to have sex with. Jack ends up with a pretty blond girl named Susan. As you might guess, Jack is completely repulsed by Susan. After a couple of dates, however she starts to get turned on. Eventually, Jack can take it no more and begins to lose his fat. So much for that fat. As the story goes on, Susan goes from being disgusted to becoming infatuated with Jack. And eventually Jack starts to lose weight and start to grow. It appears that he was always destined to gain weight, but somehow the boys were able to prevent that. That was probably a good thing,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a poor film.  I am surprised they did not make it more like a documentary. The film seems to focus on this very young girl whose life has just been shattered. She had no choice, the marriage to the man she loved was over.  She has no choice but to marry again. But this man is not right for her and he had cheated on her during their marriage.   She is told by her friends, that if she divorces him, he will end up marrying another girl who is much younger and younger is not really a marriage match.  This young girl is really struggling and the film shows her struggle with her new husband.  It shows the problems that can happen with an uneducated person in a man's world, like the time she spent with the man, her inability to speak Chinese and some of her other problems.  But it shows that this young girl has a bright future ahead of her.  The movie has very little plot, no dialogues, no emotion and no story line.  For example, after she has spent so much money to get a Chinese translation for her Chinese book, her Chinese husband returns her the translation. She is left with no money and now with no language skills or Chinese book in front of her, she has to read Chinese in her car in a foreign country.  So she tries reading for an hour or two and finally learns Chinese.  After learning the language, she goes back to her husband who had lied to her about the book.  In another scene she is watching a DVD of his movie and her friend, a foreigner, is speaking Chinese and she is looking like she is listening, yet she is not doing anything.  As she is driving to see her friend's Chinese friend for help, her husband gives her a gift of money and that is all the money in her pocket.  At the end of the movie, she tries again and again to find her Chinese friend.  Finally, her friend sees her and tells her to go home.  Her friend asks her if she understands and she says yes and it turns out that the friend is a woman that is in her late 50's and has been in China for 30 years.  A very sad ending to this story of an unenlightened young woman who does what is right and gets her husband, who was in love with her all along, to stay in China and marry the right woman.  Again, this movie is
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If a film is a dud, then I guess that's what you expected it to be, because that's all the film is, a bad film, a dreary film, an ordinary film, and therefore the film shouldn't be called a horror film at all. But that's exactly what it is, because the film actually is scary. So what's the best film to watch at night?   The first one, of course.   Why?  It's just that there's nothing else as scary as the film that starts with a really good girl.  And you can tell that she is really scared because she runs away from her parents when they're going to take her to the cemetery.  It seems so impossible for a film to start with a good girl, but that's precisely what happened.  The film starts with her, and it ends with her.  Even though it's a cheesy, cliched film, the film makes the viewer really feel like a good person because it really shows the horror of what is happening to this girl. The film is called, "A Tale of Two Sisters."  But in fact it's really about how the sister can't face up to the horror that's happening to her. The sister's name is Maria (Margot Kidder) and she's a pretty girl. She loves her brother (Jack O'Connell), and is so happy that she and her brother have just been accepted to a wonderful school for the mentally challenged.  But the school is run by a cruel teacher (Dennis Weaver) who tortures and kills her sister.  In the course of the film, we learn more and more about Maria's family.  They're poor, they're scared of Maria and their lives are really hard. The brother is always thinking of how he can help Maria and yet he doesn't help because it's his duty.   The film does a good job of showing how the mother and brother feel.  For instance, when Maria tries to escape the cruel teacher, the teacher kills her.   Then Maria has this one encounter with a ghost, which makes her even more scared and she doesn't sleep at night for fear of another encounter.   After seeing the film many times, I started to understand why people say that this is a horror story about a sister and a brother.  But really it's not about a ghost or a ghostly encounter at all but about a sick teacher who has
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "In this film you will see that the author is a true amateur. Not only is the quality of the material pathetic, he has the same sort of writing style as all his other novels. A writer who is so unoriginal that he's still using the same techniques that have caused him so much trouble in the past. I couldn't bring myself to finish reading it. He is now writing a movie, you can just guess what it's about."   A writer from Sweden has seen it, and it is not an original story. Here is an interview with a friend of a friend from Sweden who saw it in the movie theaters. The movie was supposed to be in the Swedish cinemas, but was cancelled. The publisher, which had promised to be very strict with the rights, let the movie on the market before the movie had been edited. And no one was told about the fact that the movie was a movie. The story starts in the middle of the war in France, when an Allied soldier comes to Sweden and asks for help. The soldiers are suffering terribly from wounds, hunger, and diseases and they have no one to look after them. So the Swedes give them some clothes and food, but they can't keep them in the cold. Soon a boy (Svein) finds some bread that he could sell for a few Swedish crowns (only 5 marks). He is told to bring his mother (Ivar), but the Swede soldiers say that they will do the selling in the morning. Ivar has been in Sweden for two years, but the boy doesn't know the language, so she doesn't speak to the soldiers. When Svein has come to Stockholm, the boy wants to stay there, but his mother is afraid that the Swedese soldiers will shoot him. It is only then that Sveins mother tells him that she is going with him. When they get there, they find a group of Swedish soldiers that are fighting against the Germans. The boy tells her that he is going to meet the soldiers and give them bread, but Ivar doesn't want him to do that. Sveinas mother thinks that Sven has to go with the soldiers because it is the only way to protect his life. Säre comes to Stockholm alone, but he has already sold some bread to the Germans and a bunch of Swedish prisoners. He doesn't feel very safe here and is afraid of the soldiers, so he runs away.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a great film. It's just one that is overrated. It really should have been called The Legend of Frankenstein, but that was too easy, I guess. The best thing about it is that it's the only one in this whole series to be released on a Friday the 13th, but it didn't make it a great choice. It is about a doctor who comes across a monster in his basement, and in the process, saves a girl from a terrible fate. This leads to him being invited to a party where a lot of weird things are happening. The story is really a good one, but I feel that there was too much focus on the monster and the girl at the expense of the doctor and the rest of the party. There's no real mystery, but a really well-done one, and the performances were pretty good as well. I also really liked that they didn't try to make anything look scary. It has a lot more action than you'd expect from a Friday The 13th film, but when it was scary, it was really good. And it's a perfect Halloween movie. It was released on Halloween, and that made it one of the best. Just be sure to get your friends to go with you if you go out to see it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are no bad movies in Star Wars, so let's focus on the ones that are so obviously awful that I cannot even tell them apart from the rest of the film. I was expecting some of the most obvious plot holes of Star Wars to be present in the early scenes. Instead we have a bunch of guys who look like they could be out of their fathers' garage inventing the Death Star and all that jazz, just like the movies they are in. The most egregious problem is the opening sequence. There is a scene where Han Solo and Princess Leia are going to infiltrate the Deathstar. The two of them are sneaking around in the Death star, and they come to a large tunnel in the wall, where Han and Leia must crawl. Han has been to a couple of other places on the Deathstars before, but the tunnels here are the most dangerous of them all, so Han and Carrie are being extremely careful. Leia must be at least as careful. As they pass through a particularly narrow tunnel, Han hears some noises, and turns around, looking at the other side of the tunnel, where there are a bunch more tunnels and he sees several people standing around some kind of throne. Han immediately realizes that he is about to be captured, and he and Carrie immediately try to find some way to escape. As Han is crawling under the DeathStar, he is attacked by one of the other Deathtroopers, and a fight begins, but this fight seems so much more intense and vicious than any of the previous ones. At the end of the fight, Leia finds Han and they manage to escape in one of those escape pods. What was so ridiculous about this sequence is that Han just suddenly remembered that he and Leia were sneaking through a Deathstar tunnel with the rest. Of course he remembered! He did not have a plan for this at all, and yet he remembered. It took me a very long time to realize that this was not how Star Wars usually happens. Most of the time we are told that the heroes of the story always have some sort of plan. We are told, for example, that the characters in the Star Wars movies are very meticulous and intelligent, and that all of these plans are developed and rehearsed and they do not usually come to life, at least not without a lot of forethought and effort. I would argue that Han was a much better pilot and better strategist than this movie makes him out to be, and it was really stupid of the filmmakers
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can't say much about this. It was really disappointing because of how the director (A-minus) and the script writer (a little below) managed to make it boring. It starts off with some great dialog between a little girl (Aged 2-3) and a girl (aged 5) and it continues on into a romance between two boys who are older and have the hots for each other. Well, it's just boring. The plot is lame and doesn't make any sense. This whole film has been shown to be pretty bad and the reason why it was made, was to sell toys, but instead of making a good toy movie, it made a crappy, boring, and clichéd love story. I mean, do they want to make a good film about a guy who wants to be like Batman? I mean I have no clue what's going on with this movie, but at least it has a decent plot. At least it's not about this girl and her brother fighting over a boy and her older brother's wife... or is it? The movie even has a scene where the little girl is crying because she didn't know her brother was her brother's brother.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I want a second opinion because this review is so badly written. I am a fan of James and think he is a great actor. The problem is that his character doesn't seem to want to be there and he just kind of goes around doing things for no reason. You are told about this but it is not enough. You can tell he is struggling to find his place and what he is supposed to be doing in this world but he still ends up doing it for no good reason.   I don't know about you, but I find myself wondering if he was really trying to make me think this way because that is how he is written and that is not how I would behave. He seems like he is not in a position to be this "strong" but that doesn't mean I don" t have to like it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "It's a long movie and it's boring." This film is too long and the plot too convoluted to really understand and enjoy. It also is not worth the price of admission for a long film. This movie is NOT worth your time. I can't even tell you what happened, as the movie has been so long that no one is even there, yet the characters are there. It's a film that was made with the intentions of making a big splash and to create a blockbuster. It certainly did that for the most part, but I can tell that the director thought that the movie would be "cool" and he did it. But all of that "coolness" can't be put into words, so I'm not going to bother trying. I just know that the actors in this film are pretty lame and none of the characters or story do anything interesting at all. I won't even bother to try to analyze the story, because I have no interest in it. I'm only going to say that the story isn't worth any of your time and your money. A movie made with so much passion, vision, and hard work, but it's nothing of merit. Just a lame attempt to make a big "discovery" film. I don't get it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (not a "star") It was the only movie I saw this year, and it wasn't bad at all, it was pretty good.   It has a great story and some great effects, but it doesn't really have much humor. The plot is basically one long chase, and there's no jokes in it.  This movie had some decent action scenes, and at one point you'd think that we were going to see the Hulk and a little girl on a high-speed pursuit around a city, but there's really not a lot of action.  The effects were good though.  It seems that the movie wasn't really well received by all reviewers, but then again, I don't read the reviews.  I will tell you that I found it interesting because of the great chase scenes.  At one point it was really cool watching the Hulk chase through a building.  However, I must say that I wasn't a big fan of the acting.  They were good, but I wasn' t really convinced by the movie.  Overall, it's just a good movie, but you'd be better off looking for a different movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The review:  You know, even I was a little disappointed in this one. It had good action sequences, but they were in a rushed manner, and the special effects looked pretty terrible. However, the story was good. I thought the villain, Mr. Blight, was interesting. I'm glad he didn't appear as a giant bug or a giant blob, because he would have been annoying. The plot involved a man who found himself in a very strange new world.   I don't know why he didn: Likely because it was the '90s.  "Oh, I'm a giant giant giant bug! Golly! I feel like a giant monster right now!" I'm not sure if the writer ever actually read the original story and took notes on the characters.  A big, fat, boring ending.  The movie ended with a big, stupid cliffhanger that I don: "Well, I guess you're going to be back."   The sequel,  The Curse of the Black Spot, has been out of print for years, and no one seems to know where it is.  I am going to have to look it up...  One day I might write a review of it.  ( I'm not kidding. This is how I became a writer, and I can still see it as a future career choice. )   There are other films in this genre, so you won't be disappointed by this one as much. It's still an entertaining film, and it was directed by Gary Austin.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Reviews are posted every other week so there might be some spoilers for the movie, especially if you read the book first.   In case it's not obvious:  For a movie, this is a good one.  The story is very good.  There is a big difference between movies and books in that while movies will always tell a story from the point of view of the main character, a good story will tell a good character's story as well.  While the movie tells a story of a good guy with a bad side, I personally feel the story could have been told from the good guy's point ofview.  That said, the book does a good job of explaining the situation and makes it easy to follow.  It also explains the events of the movie more thoroughly, but doesn't give too much away.  As for the plot, this movie is a fast-paced action movie which has a lot of fight scenes.  You get a good amount of action and action-y scenes, but nothing too crazy.  A lot of people will have trouble seeing the film, but I found it quite enjoyable.  My only complaint is that there are several scenes which just jump from one place to another without any reason.  I'm not sure if there were any rules which had to be followed, but some scenes were difficult to follow, especially in the middle of the film.  However, if you really want to see a fast paced, action-packed, good-guy-and-bad-guy story, this might be for you.  This movie is available for purchase on Amazon and iTunes.  So if you are looking for a good movie for a romantic story with a good side to it, then I think you should look no further than this one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When the movie isn't about a group of men in a post-apocalyptic future and their battle against their former lives, it's about a girl who can teleport. If that wasn't enough to draw in a movie-going audience, then there's the fact that she's the daughter of the man who created them. There is a small plot revolving around her and her sister as they attempt to defeat the evil corporation that was created to control them. If you can't be bothered to give the story a shot, then the movie would likely make you angry.   The movie does have a number of interesting ideas, but it lacks the depth necessary to make it worthwhile.  The plot is not a good one for a zombie movie  What about the characters?:   Well, first off, the girls of the group are pretty bad-ass. They have a good deal of personality and are pretty strong. The main character in particular is pretty well done. The only problem I had with the movie was with the fact the main character was way too likable. There was a point where the girls were fighting the evil company and I just couldn't see the point of her.  And that would be a problem even if it was in a different movie.  The only people that actually seem to have any problem with the story are the kids in the group and that's because of the bad acting.  They had a lot of effort put into their roles and it made it very difficult to root for them. The kids all had great personalities, but they really just sounded like one-dimensional actors, and that was all there was to it.  If you were a little more familiar with the world, the story would probably be a lot more enjoyable. The bad acting really took away from the experience, and I'd highly recommend skipping this one if you are looking for something a bit different.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really disliked this film. It took some of the fun out of being a kid. It reminded me of all those movies that take a lot of energy, but are a chore to watch. A lot of the characters were bland and it's hard to care about them because their lives are so bland. In addition, I found the film boring and boring. The entire plot seemed to be a joke and there wasn't a single thing that was worth the time of the movie. The music and sound effects were awful, especially the music that played over scenes in the movie, and there was only one character in the entire film that made any sort of sense at all. If you're a kid and you really want to laugh at a kid's movie, this is probably the one for you. It is a funny, but not very creative movie that just seemed to have lost any sort off of life.

You can't help but feel it's based on some real events in history" - Newsweek   ... the perfect mix of horror and sci-fi with Spielberg and his cast at the top." - Film Quarterly   This film is about a group of dinosaurs, living in their prehistoric cave that is a small park on the edge of a forest. The group of three are young males that are separated from their herd. When the herd gets attacked by an unknown creature, they quickly discover that this thing is far more deadly than anything they've seen before.   For many reasons this film has made a lot of people very excited about dinosaurs. It takes place in a realistic way and the dinosaurs are very believable. It's a great film that is not only full of action but also well thought out. This movie has everything you could ask for. A great cast with great performances. This is the best movie you'll see this summer. I give this film a 10/10.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     A movie is not just a story, it is a whole thing. There are some good stories and some good movies. But for the most part, if a movie has a bad story it probably sucks.   So this is my second film review. I have never seen a movie that I didn't like. This movie I loved to death and this review is just to tell you what I think about the movie.  This movie is a classic. When you think about a movie, and you are a kid, that means it's not just going to be a story. It is going to have a plot, characters and a whole bunch of other stuff to make it a great movie.   the thing is, this movie doesn't have any plot, it's just a bunch of kids in a forest and they play baseball.  and that is the whole point of this movie. If you don't know what the movie is about you are just wasting your time, because you don the movie a bunch. The movie has very little to do with any baseball you have ever heard of.   This movie is what I mean when I say "A movie without a plot."   The movie has no characters, the movie has zero personality. It's just characters who are all in love with one another. There is no heart in this movie, it has no depth, you really can't tell who the characters are and why they are doing what they are going to do. It just doesn't matter, they are all doing the same thing, they want to play baseball and they do.  .I don't care about any of this stuff. I just want to see baseball, I want the camera to follow this kid as he runs all around the baseball field trying to hit some ball.   And if there is a plot and there is drama and there are emotions and there's drama and then it ends, well, I still want to watch the baseball game. It doesn't even really matter, I just feel like the movie doesn�t really give a damn about anything.   A lot of people have been criticizing this movie for having a weak plot. And I agree, there is nothing here, it doesn't seem like there is any story. There doesn't appear to be any reason for any of these characters to be in this baseball game other than to be friends and to play the baseball.   The movie never really explains how a baseball works. The only
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My review:  This movie really is about a group of friends that all have their own problems, but don't show them. They just keep playing games, drinking, and getting into fights. They also are really good at gaming and drinking. But, I guess the only reason why I liked this movie was because of the cast. It's a fun movie, and I loved this movie because it's a movie about the best friends, and who can say that more than when you're around them? The story is really good, and it does really have some good jokes in it. The character of "Mason" was really funny in this movie, because he is so good at the games, but his real problems are the fact that he can't get over a relationship that ended, and that he is constantly getting in trouble. The scene when he is at the movie theater in the end where he's trying to talk to his friends, is really funny. This movie was really fun to watch, and to be honest, it did make me think. But it is a movie that I enjoyed watching, and this movie is one of my favorite movies from the last year or so.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     A few years ago I watched a movie called The Devil Inside. It's not the best movie, and it is by no means the worst. There were several good performances, but the movie had two bad performances that stand out above the rest. First is Peter Cushing who plays the role of Dr. Joseph Conrad. He played Conrad so well that I believe he might have been the best actor of the decade. He's a fantastic actor that never got the attention he deserved, and the movie was a complete disappointment for me. There is one scene where he gets in a fight with the Devil that is so over the top that I don't know how anyone could have pulled it off. Then there is the other bad performance in the movie by John Cleese. His performance was so bad that it's unbelievable that someone thought this was a good idea. He had to learn all his lines for about fifteen minutes before I even noticed he was in the scene, and when he did finally appear it was a very obvious cameo. There are no other actors that are as bad as Cleese's performance.  You'd think that since the movie opened on opening night and the reviews were all positive, they would have a good run. But instead the movie tanked on opening weekend, and never found its audience. It was a classic that no one wanted to see again, and one that no theater in the United States would show because it just didn't do well. This movie is also well worth a watch to see why the people hated it so much.  a couple of years ago when I saw "The Exorcist" I was extremely disappointed that I was wrong about the movie and that the original ending was terrible. But I was still very disappointed that the movie bombed so badly when it opened. But at least I was surprised. I still have a copy of the film that was given to me at a screening, and I had been meaning to watch it ever since. I decided to give it another shot, so I bought it at a used video store in my area and I just recently watched it again and I'm actually glad that I gave it another chance. "The Shining" is a horrible movie, but not as bad a terrible movie as the original "The Devil Inside". I still don't think it's one of the worst movies that ever came out, but I think that it is a solid four out of ten on my list of movies that I just didn

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The reviews of this movie are so negative, it makes me question if they've even seen it. I don't think anyone who saw it gave it a good review. I can't stand how the movie was presented.   I can understand people wanting to see it, but it didn't work for me.  I donít remember any scenes in the movie that made me laugh out loud or any character I really liked.  While it was a bad film, it didnít really hurt my overall enjoyment of The Office.  For the record, I enjoyed the movie.  It was funny and had a lot of great plot points.  The characters were interesting, and there was more than enough action to keep me on the edge of my seat.  As for the movie itself, it was okay.  If it were anything like the movie I saw on SyFy the first time, I would probably love it. But it doesnít, so I didnítd give it 4 stars. I think you should make your own decisions on this one. I hope you enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In all honesty, I've only seen ONE of the three movies I've listed. That was one of the few reviews I had read, and it was a fair one. But I thought the rest of the reviews were way over the top, and the movie just doesn't hold up to my standards as a good comedy (I had a hard time watching it because I was just so annoyed, but even if I would have made the same decision I would still have watched it).   I really liked it and liked the characters in it, and I loved the ending.   The only downside was the writing, and that I felt it was poorly written, even if it was supposed to be an adaptation.      I'm sure you're going to see the movie in the theater and have a good time, but I just don't think the movie is that great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I haven't seen all of the movies.   For the first hour or so,  it was very intense,  but I got lost.  There are many good actors but none of them are in the same league as George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, and Chris Pratt.  I like the actors more,  especially Clooney and Wahlburg.  George Clooneys movie is very good and very intense but it's not my cup of tea.  Mark Walsberg is very hot,  very good.  Chris Pratt is pretty hot but, he should be more realistic.  The movie is intense.  If you have an interest in science fiction or are a fan of movies then this movie is a good film.  It took me a few tries to understand it,  so I had to take a second viewing.  When you see the first time,  don't think you have a handle on what is going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     - "I think the way they edited this movie is just pathetic. I mean, how are they going to make it look like they had a conversation? I'm just waiting for the woman to scream at them, "You're not friends! You're not even friendly!""  "She just seems like the worst of the bunch. She's so boring and self-absorbed."  - I'll just leave this here: - How do you even film something like this?  The biggest problem with the movie is that it has so little heart.  It is all about the action and how the woman is saved by the guy (who really is just some weirdo).  A quick review:   -The music is so cheesy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For the most part, this movie is a good film, but there are a few points that really should have been changed. For instance, the final scene where a family member dies is one of the most powerful scenes in the movie. However, the camera pulls back, showing only his face, and then cuts to a different camera angle where we can see the rest of his body. This is incredibly disrespectful to the death of his wife. Also, the father of a girl in this family has a lot of personality, and I really like this film, just not this point.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first 5 minutes were awful, with me thinking to myself, "What the fuck is this movie even about?" The movie didn't even have a title to begin with (unless you count "Muppets Most Wanted") and the dialogue is almost completely inaudible for me, so if I can even call this movie dialogue then I'm an idiot.   But the first 5-10 minutes were pretty bad, and you know, I've seen worse.   2:50. It's pretty bad.  The rest of the movie is about a character whose daughter goes missing. But that's the only thing I remember.  They try to make the movie seem more real and less like a poorly written story about a person going on a quest to solve the mystery of the daughter's disappearance, but it's all just a bunch of lies.  And you don't want to believe a story about some people going on an adventure in a giant castle. And no one can help but ask, "Why is it that you have a castle and this other guy doesn't?  For the second half of the film, they try to tell you that all of the people in the castle are the real reason the daughter went missing and that's why they have to search for the daughter and find the real killer.  But they only tell you about the people they want to show you. I just don't know who's behind all of this and why they are doing what they're doing.  You could almost say the movie's purpose is to show that people can be evil and evil people are real.  I don't buy that for a second, but that's what the filmmakers are trying to do.  So who is the real villain and what is going on here? Well, this movie is a good example of how to create a believable storyline without having an actual plot.  Instead, the movie just has a bunch more characters talking at you.  In other words, it's a bunch and lots of characters trying to tell a story with a story that has absolutely no plot. I'm not going to try to explain the plot here because it's not that hard to grasp, but I can tell you a little bit about the characters.  It's a cast of mostly young people who are all supposed to be the same age. The young people are all trying to find each other in this giant castle that was built to look like the moon. They

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    And then, it didn't matter if the movie was good or not, because we couldn't really enjoy watching bad movies any more!   So we decided to go back to the original stuff we saw in school movies (where they are supposed to be good) and watch the crap.   I mean, a girl in the middle of a war? What's wrong with it?! It's the 1980s and everyone can shoot a gun, so we were happy to see that even the bad stuff from the 80s is not this bad.   We started with a nice comedy from the 70s, where the main character goes out to a party to make new friends (or at least pretend). I don't know what kind of movie this was. It was supposed to have a very funny script (or maybe they just threw it together), but it actually had a very slow story with not much plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A few years ago I saw a show that had been filmed over and over again with the same actor. I liked him then, and I still like him, but he wasn't the same. In fact, I can only remember him for a single scene in this one. The rest of the movie was just a bunch of talking heads, and the actors never appeared in the same frame. A lot of people will think I'm nuts, but here goes. I'll be the first to admit that the movie has its moments, but if I had a dollar for every time I sat through the same film with the exact same acting, I'd be rich. I have only seen one other film with this level of repetition. The scene when all the main characters are sitting in front of the mirror: the first three times I saw this, I didn't think much of it, but then the same three guys show up at the end. I felt like they weren't as good as the last time, and they didn't need to be in the film to prove that the first time through was a mistake. It was just bad. I had to ask my wife what that was about. It's not like they were bad actors. They were just bad at this movie.   I'm sure they had their reasons, but there are a lot of films I can't see over and again, and this is one of them. In general, this is a poorly made film. The production values are terrible, and it's painfully obvious that none of the people who had any expertise in this film did. The actors were never in the exact right frame, they never talked to one another, they didn�t look like real people, the dialog was never interesting, and there was no sense of movement or mood. There were three or four scenes that just kind of felt like a video game (or some other mindless entertainment) but in all fairness, they were just boring. The story wasn't that interesting either. And that's just the beginning of the problems. There are a few other scenes where things just seem to happen and you wonder if the film was designed by somebody who had never made a film before, or if it was a director who didn't like his own movie. And the soundtrack was the worst. You could tell how many songs it took to make this movie, but in terms of music, there's almost nothing. The best thing about this film is the title. It
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The Good: The bad:  I did not like this movie because it was bad. It wasn't bad because it wasn't good, it wasn a bad film, just like so many other bad films out there, but what made me feel bad was that the movie's production design and production value was so poor, it really made me want to give up on it. Not to mention, the characters were not very well fleshed out. You can't really expect more from the director of this movie.   There was this horrible music that accompanied the movie that really made it feel very out of place. The story was very cheesy and it really felt like the movie was just a cheap cash grab from a movie called 'Super Bad'. The acting was terrible, but the worst was the actors were so bad that I honestly wouldn't have remembered their names anyway.

"   - John R., via email " I will never forgive these folks for making a movie that is so awful."   The movie itself is not bad, but the film's marketing, the bad reviews, the whole "Saw" syndrome of having an "official" logo, and the stupidly bad reviews that came out of Hollywood and the media (as well as a lot of bad movies) are what put it in the "toxic" category.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So you go to a new place and you discover an animal that is no more.  And you're not sure what to do.  Well you need help and there's nothing here to help.  Not that you'll know where to look for help anyway.  So you turn back, but you'll be disappointed when you find your way blocked by the same old, same old.  You have an hour until dawn and your pack must keep moving, and you have no idea where to go.  If you're going to die this time, this time it will be by the hands of a packmate.  It was time to try something different.  Something new.  And the only option was to go on a journey.  But first you must take your pack.  The sun rises in the far away horizon as the day breaks.  There's no sign of any life around and the only sounds to come from the woods are the rustling of leaves.  The sound of birds and the rustle of their wings.  They are the only noises.  "Is there any other way out of here?"  The words echo in your mind as you try and find something that could get you out.  A hole that no packmate would be foolish enough to climb down from.  I can hear the rustles of the leaves as I turn my head to the right.  As I turn I can see more leaves as they get pushed up against the edge of a small crevice.  This crevice is too small to fit through, but I see something.  At the very edge of the crevice I see the shadow of a dog.  When I look closer I see it's a greyhound, a very big greyhound.  Its huge eyes, almost the size of my head are staring back at me.  No doubt it is the same dog that has been following me for over an hour and had no other reason to be so close.  Just before the sun rises my packmates hear the sounds of the day.  Birds and the sound of their paws on the ground as they walk.  Their footsteps are soft and slow, like the pitter patter of raindrops on the grass.  My ears turn to listen.    With a slight smile on my face I turn and head towards the sound.  All I have to do is get as close to the dog as I can, and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "The story is not only bad but a complete waste of the characters, who seem to only appear at the right moment, and do not seem to have the slightest bit of personality." "I don't understand the point of the film. Why is the family staying in a farm in the middle of nowhere? Is this a joke? Why did they have to be transported there and why did they go alone? I also understand the story was a joke, but it would have been funny if they had not been in the farm." "It's a complete mess. I have never seen such a boring movie." "That's not a joke at all. I would have liked to see someone make a movie like that!" "I didn't like this movie one bit. My son just hated it. I know it's a bad film but what happened to the family, the jokes, the dialogue, everything? They weren't there to make a fun film and they weren't funny, not even a little bit." "Very poor. This film has no plot at all and there are only two characters and they are so far apart from each other that it's almost laughable."  The film itself didn't do it for me. As for the script, though I was disappointed with the ending, it doesn't really matter. It's about a family that comes back to their farm after losing everything. As you know, the father gets a little crazy with the kids at his house and goes out to the farm. It starts out okay, then the whole thing unravels in a bad way and the movie is no longer funny. If there was a twist, I never got it. This is a very dull film, with no sense of humor whatsoever.  I hope that you guys enjoyed this review. Please feel free to leave comments below and I hope to see you again. Until next time, peace.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen hundreds of films.   I have seen the worst and the best of the year.  I also know that there is no way that someone can give a movie a 10/10 rating unless they loved every second of it.  So here is my review:  This film does not belong in the top ten, but I still think it deserves it's rating.  It does not show the best moments in movies.  But it does show a good story and it is entertaining.  In the first scene we meet the main characters as they walk through the rain to go and see a movie with their parents.  The whole film follows their progress.  We get to know their parents and their father who is a lawyer and his mother who is the homemaker.  This is an older, wiser and more cynical father than we usually see in movies with good stories.  And the mother is a good-natured and loving woman.  They spend the film going on walks and having a good time.  There are a few things in this film I do not like but that's just because I have been watching movies like this for 40 years.  The main problem I had with this movie is that the characters are unrealistic.  Most of the people in this movie don't really look like they could be real people.  Here are some of the more unrealistic characters. 1.    2.   3.   The guy that has the hot dog on his head.  His head was made of plastic.  That's not the real reason for the hot head. I think it was because his father had a lot of money and wanted to see the movie on a big screen and he wanted the movie to be more entertaining so he made it look like the head is bigger.   I wish he would have been able to talk and I would have liked to see some kind of reactions from him when the hot heads are mentioned.  Like, "My God that hot head is crazy!"  4.   "My son has been acting all kinds of weird lately.  Maybe it's because he has been playing with his hair.  Do you think he would do that if his hair was a little wet? "  This hot head could really be someone who had had a haircut and was a boy, but who was still acting like he was a teenager.  Also, you could really hear that "my son" was
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This movie is nothing but a bunch of idiots. This is a typical "movie about a kid in high school" in every sense of the word. You know what a typical movie is? It's a collection of a lot of crap thrown at the audience in order to make you laugh, make you cry or whatever. A lot of time goes into making this movie and most of it is wasted. You're given a boring, formulaic story that is all about the bad boys and the girls. The movie starts off with the "bad boys" getting bullied by a bunch and they have to work with the other guys to help them defeat the bullies. Then it gets worse when they decide to go to college to become a doctor and find a cure for this stupid disease that they have. But by then it's already too late. You have to sit through a few more stupid episodes, as they slowly build up this huge, elaborate plot that is totally unrelated to anything the show ever did before and completely illogical. The end is never answered and it's always left open for more episodes. I think the writers were just trying to get an easy laugh by making this a sequel to "Super Friends." You have the same characters from the first movie with a lot more stupidity to deal with.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For every 1 of my friends that enjoyed this, there was someone else that hated it. If you are a fan of comedy movies, then this one is for you. The film is filled with jokes that really made my stomach turn. The movie is basically made up of three segments, the first two being extremely stupid. The third segment was pretty good and had a very fun and energetic feeling. Overall, this is a movie for the kids who are not afraid to laugh at things that are too ridiculous.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "He who controls the past controls the future." – Winston Churchill The first week of May was a busy and trying one for the Mowbray family, as they went through three consecutive days of court cases (the first, in a Florida court, resulted in a dismissal of the cases pending in Chicago) for a divorce case that would have to go to the Illinois Supreme Court. However, as with any divorce, there is always a lot more to it than just a simple "divorce" for one spouse. While there are many variables at play, it's interesting to look at the similarities and differences between divorces, and to examine what divorce can mean to a couple and their children.   While this is a "one-off" divorce, the Mowsbrays are not the first to go through a divorce with "divorces" as a basis. The first case of a "divulgation" came in 1850 in Massachusetts, but it would be more than 50 years before a second case came up and was settled the same way.  For this reason, there are a few things to consider when it comes to divorce: 1. The divorce must be filed in the state where the divorce was finalized. 2. There must be at least one party in each marital relationship who can legally file for a dissolution. 3. The court will have to grant the divorce in order for the parties to end the marriage. 4. If both parties are still married, the court will need to sign off on the petition in order to get the divorce finalized. 5. If one party has already remarried, that party can not file for the divorce.  The Mowsbrooks were a young couple, in their 20s, who met in school. They were both students at Northeastern University in Boston and had the opportunity to graduate together. However they chose to get married.  While most marriages don't last very long, there was one last hurrah, which lasted less than 6 months.  In the month of May, 1994, as a result of her decision to get a divorce, Lisa left her husband, Michael, for someone else, without any warning or hesitation. In the process, Lisa also lost her job as an analyst for a pharmaceutical company.  Lisa and Michael had two young sons, and they were forced to move back in with Michael's parents. The couple had been married for 4 years, but because of their divorce, they

It is bad because it doesn't tell a good story.  It is bad in every sense of the word, the acting, the directing and the screenplay.  There is no real tension, the plot is nonsensical, the characters are completely one-dimensional and one-note, and the dialogues are cringe-worthy.

But, what a waste of screen time, what was the point of the characters?  It could have made a lot more sense as a one-hour short film. The script would be better if it had been written by a fifth grader with an eighth grade vocabulary.  The movie would have made sense if it were a joke.  It feels like a cheap attempt by Hollywood to make a few extra dollars off the low budget that a single high school student could produce.  I can't say enough about this movie.

[Read more reviews]   Bad Movies of 1994   Movies that got me interested in the horror genre  The Exorcist  The Possession  This movie should have stayed buried.  Its bad-ass-ness is undeniable, but what makes it so bad is its lack of any actual scares.  If you've seen the movie, you already know what to expect.  You can't see something like that without a little bit of an out-of-body experience.  Not only that, but this movie is only about 5-7 minutes long, so if you don't have the stomach for a half-hour long torture scene, don't waste your time watching this movie! The Devil's Backbone  So, what can I say about this film? Well, I would like to say that the story has some merit and is very well done.  Of course, this movie lacks any sense of logic and a very simple plot which is what the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have always hated the original Star Wars movie trilogy (even though they are all my favorite movies). Even with the best of intentions I found it to be very dull, predictable, and very derivative (as in, Disney's movies). So I decided to watch the prequels with a few friends and, to my horror, found the prequel films to be far inferior to the original trilogy. This movie, however, was a complete surprise. After watching it for the first time I realized that this movie was not only a classic but was also original. The characters are completely different, the movie feels like a classic science fiction movie, the special effects and cinematography are just stunning and the music is perfect. This was one of the best movies I have ever seen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I know you are not going to say a movie is terrible, but I can tell that your review is just not based on any kind of reasoning whatsoever. The reviewer was not really aware of the plot, the characters, or even the film itself. The worst part was when the movie finally showed that it was a bad one.   "     If you can't watch an awful movie without hating it, what's your point? This is the review of a bad film, and I don't have to explain myself any further than that. The whole thing was a mess, and it left me with no choice but to go and watch a movie that I just came to think was awesome.  This movie was a waste of everyone's time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the movie was a big hit, and you watched it with your friends, and if they enjoyed it, you might consider posting a review of the movie, and telling your friends how much fun you had watching it.   The reason you wouldn't do this is that you would think your friends would find it amusing to watch a movie they are not familiar with, and that they would get into it too quickly, or be annoyed with the movie.  But if the movie is a failure, and it is only meant to be a one-shot or even a single, and everyone is too busy laughing their heads off to remember that there was anything of value in it, then a negative rating is justifiable.  And if the rating of a movie is too low to tell anyone about it, and your friends will not have time to watch it, or you do not know enough about the film to rate it, just keep your review short and to the point.  It might not be a good movie, but at least it isn't bad.  Why not review a movie that you enjoyed?  Why only watch movies for your own entertainment and not tell others about it?  Do you really think people are interested in reviewing films that are bad?  Because that would mean that they aren't interested in you, and so what are you going to do, make movies for yourself?  I have seen and liked lots of great movies, but I have never felt like it was my job to be entertaining.  I do have a theory, and this is a theory that might be a bit hard to accept at first, but the more you learn about people and your own abilities as a human being, the more likely you will become aware of the fact that the more interested and interested you get, the less interested you will be, the closer you are to the people who really matter.  The more interested you are, the greater the chance that you will make people, especially your friends and family, want to be interested in what you are doing, and therefore will become more interested in doing what you want to do.  You should also realize that you have two talents that are very useful to your success in life, the talent to be successful at what you do and the talent of being interested in a good thing.  If you are interested, and know what you like, you will find that what you know about the business of filmmaking will give you an advantage in life in ways
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      " A man's gotta do what a man's got to do. "   The man who took me to see The Terminator had the following comment:   [quote] "I can't believe I'm gonna see Terminator, but the guy I'll see it with, he's never seen it. Never. He's totally freaked out. He came to the premiere and he's like, "I'm not ready for this movie." And I'm like, 'You're gonna like it. Just take a look. It's one of those that's gonna have that killer look to it. You'll like it.' And he's not prepared for it. " [/quote]   No one should be prepared for a movie, especially one that has a $120 million budget. As I'm sure many of you know, I was one of many people who refused to go to see Terminator because I simply did not understand how a movie like this was made. The movie doesn't feel right. It feels like a terrible advertisement for its sequels. It has terrible performances. It looks like a disaster. And I have to admit, this film does not have the originality of its progenitors. It is like the Transformers, or the first half of the first Lord of the Rings film. It does not feel like the movie we watched back in 1980, nor is it even close to that film. Terminator 2 is not like it's progenitor at all.   And this is what makes me most angry, and most upset, about this movie. I remember watching The Terminator as a child, and even after having seen The Terminator, I still cannot quite get over how bad it is. This is the movie where Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a terminator and they walk off into the sunset together. But I did not see Terminator 3 and then Terminator Salvation. I saw Terminator 2, and Terminator Salvation is the sequel that should have come first. Terminator 3 did not improve on this movie in any way.  , and it is obvious from the very first scene that this is going to be a very different film, and Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator is definitely a different Terminator than James Cameron's. The Terminator 2: Judgment Day is the same Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminator as we saw in Terminator. It starts out as a Terminator movie, but at the end of the movie, we see Arnold Schwarzenegger in the T-800. As the movie begins, we realize the original Terminator was
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's just a movie, why do you have to hate it.   It just doesn't have the quality you would expect from a Hollywood film.   I don't think the movie is terrible (I didn't see it, of course, but there was no reason to think it was great), but just a tad too generic for me.  There are a few jokes in there that didn't get me. One was a gag where they all went to a movie because it was "the most epic ever".   There was a guy in the audience who was screaming "Oh my god, what is this?   Are we in space??" That's when I realized it was just another joke from the last film in the series.  For someone who enjoys the series, this was very disappointing.  It didn't even feel like a movie.  The CGI in it was pretty good, especially for a movie of this size. The sound effects were okay, and the character designs were okay. The ending was a bit disappointing. It was a good ending, but it was also very unnecessary.  I had to see the first 2 movies to fully understand why they made it this way.  One of the best things in the movie was the voice over work. You get some of the greatest actors from the first movie. The voice actors were good enough to make me think they're from the series (not as good as the voice actors from Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, but good enough).  It was great to see Kirk in such a great movie again, and he was a great guy.  Overall it was decent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm trying to be positive, but as of today, I'm a total and complete asshole. First of all, the film was very very bad, it is not even a good movie, and I would not recommend it to anyone and it is one of the worst movies I have seen. It is very hard to watch, and its very sad to see a movie that was written in 1995, with CGI characters and no voice over work, I just thought this was the worst ever and this movie should have never come out, it's just a horrible film. The movie is really very stupid, and the plot just keeps going on, it starts off with some bad guy killing a cop. A cop's sister is a cop, and so the bad guy comes after her and kills her. Now this is where it gets really interesting, the cop's dead brother comes back from the dead, he has killed some people, and he kills the bad guys. What is the plot? It's the cop sister goes after the bad people, but she gets captured and sent to a mental institution. So then this really crazy stuff happens. This movie has really bad acting, and one of my favourite actors in the whole movie, is dead. It gets really bad at the end, where he is a complete bastard and he is doing this crazy weird act with his dead brother, and then we have some really bad CGI, this is so bad that it looks like a bad CGI version of the original film. If you are a fan of movies like "The Fly", or "Back to the Future", or any film with a really bad bad CGI quality to it, this movie is probably for you. This was so bad, that this film's original poster even had the "c" on it, that means this is a remake of a movie with a similar name. So if you are looking for a bad sequel to "The Goonies", go find another copy of the movie. If the film is bad, this film is even worse.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The Story:  There are a few versions of this one. The first, which is based on a true story, is of a woman who is trying to keep her home from foreclosure, and decides to keep a man with a criminal history in the home as a housekeeper. The second version is of the same woman, but this time she hires a man to be her housekeeper, and the man has two children. The third is the same story, but the story of the woman is about an orphan who was rescued from being adopted and became a woman again. In the first version, there is a murder, the housekeeper was raped and killed, and her lover was tried and acquitted. The housekeeper's father wanted his daughter to have the baby because of her criminal history, and so he murdered her. The story ends with the father marrying the new woman, and having a son. In version 2, the same man, the murderer, is now a husband, and a wife, and there is no rape and no murder. In this version, the father takes care of the children, and is a hero to them. The version 3 has a woman getting killed, her murderer is not tried, and she has a baby boy. After the murder, her lover tries to kill her, and he is convicted of killing her. There is some sex involved in this version (it was shot in Canada), and the story ends happily. I found all of them to be very unsatisfying, and I have no idea what story they were going for. I'm not sure what they were trying to say, so they might as well have just used the first story.   This is a very bad movie. The acting is all terrible, the plot is terrible, and it has no redeeming value whatsoever.  If you have never seen it, avoid it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first half of The Great Train Robbery was a spectacular, gripping film. It was well-acted, with an excellent cast that included John Wayne, Laurence Harvey, George Segal, and Robert Redford. It's a film about two brothers who are kidnapped and held hostage in a train station. Once the two are in the train, they are forced to kill their hostages in a gruesome fashion. There was much death in this film.   What really makes this movie great is the way it moves forward, and you don't really see what's going to happen in the second half until much later. The movie is full of so many interesting plot twists, and the characters change quite a bit in the course of the film. Even as far as what's happening in their minds and what they're feeling as they're torturing each other, it was a lot to take in. It seems very plausible that a good portion of the movie took place in a man's head.  The acting in this movie is superb. Some of the performances are better than others, but Wayne's performance as the captor and the prisoner are still amazing.  When the two brothers are arrested, they're in their own apartment in New York City. They have to run away from their captors in a hurry because they have a lot of money on them. They end up in Italy, where they're arrested again.  They get away, but the captors catch them and they have to kill the two hostages, as well as their money.  To me, this was the movie's most enjoyable portion. I enjoyed the fact that there was quite a amount of violence, and this is something that I appreciate in this day and age.  While there wasn't much, it still held my attention and kept me guessing.  I loved the way the film used time lapse to show us what was happening to the two men.  Another element that really made this movie interesting was how the movie was shot. The film was shot with panoramic lenses, and a great deal of focus was put into the backgrounds of the two characters.  One scene in particular really got to me, where you get to see a couple of the guards on a train. It gives you a sense of the desperation and fear that the two were feeling as the trains pass over the country.  This is one of the most memorable scenes in the entire movie, and it was also one of my favorites
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just had a very bad experience with this movie...there were some cool moments and amazing visuals, but it ended up being a VERY bad movie. In the movie the main character had a horrible childhood that made her become a criminal, so she goes to live in an underground world with her friend.  They live in the underground world because she wants to take over the world as a ruler.  Her friend, who is actually a robot, had a really cool scene where she tried to tell the main characters that she was there too. She tried to warn them, but they went back to their life and never thought that she would be there...so they never said a thing. Then the main hero, the only character I really liked (that's saying something) and she gets betrayed by her friend! The villain is like a "monster", and it seems like she's supposed to be a cool villain, but she was awful to everyone, including the main guy. She didn't seem like a nice person in my opinion.   The other characters that were in this were just as annoying. I would have never had such problems with this character had it been a different movie. I've seen a couple of people say that the main villain was kind of an evil robot, and they should have just ignored her and let her do her thing.  It would have been so much funnier if it had been someone like "A" from the "Transformers" movies...   All in all it was a pretty awful movie...a bad movie in every sense of the word.  The good:  I'd say the good thing about this movie is it was the only film of this genre I've liked in a while. It's one of my favorite movies of all time, and I loved it for it's style.  I also liked the fact that the movie was "inspired" by "Blade Runner". It reminded me of a "Blade" movie, but the movie took itself seriously and the people that were "in the business" of making bad movies weren't as fun as the characters in this movie.  There were times I thought that this was a "Die Hard" movie...with the characters acting like idiots and the villain trying to control them...I thought that it was one of the best "die hard" movies of the last 20 years...and that's saying a lot. I also thought it was cool that it actually was directed by Joss
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only movie I was remotely surprised by was I Am Sam (2006), a charming romp from writer-director Tom McCarthy (The Heat) that stars Tim Robbins and a great performance from Jennifer Lopez.   But it's not what you think:  The movie centers on a young boy (Tim Robbins) who is adopted by a mother (Lopez) and father (Brett Ratner) who raise him as their own, until he gets sick and loses his family and becomes a ward of the state, in a small town where he meets a girl (Jennifer Lawrence) who's having trouble making it on her own and needs his help.    It's a bit of a cliché, but it works.  If you're thinking that's a pretty simplistic story, you're not alone:  It's one of McCarthy's best, but I found myself rolling my eyes in exasperation, as I kept thinking of the other, more successful movies that have been made about the same subject (notably, The Kids Are All Right and The Way Way Back).   McCarthy's screenplay is fairly clever, too, so that you can see the film coming from a mile away, and you get a few chuckles along the way.  A critic called it "a bright, bright moment" in an article on Hollywood in 2000, and "a heartwarming film," in a 2002 retrospective in the New York Times.   After seeing The Spectacular Now, I was definitely curious to see more of McCarthy, and I didn't want to miss anything in between the original film and his follow-up, but by then I'd had enough.  A good example of how McCarthy has a way with a line.  After I Am Not Your Negro, I watched I Saw the Light  and I Am Here  but I didn´t get to it as much as I wanted.  My girlfriend (yes, she's dating) told me a few days ago that it was great, and that "it made it feel a lot more relevant to our times," so I thought I might as well give it a try.  McCarthy had to have known what was coming when he wrote I Saw The Light.  If I Saw   The Spectacle Now  had been released in 1970, when it was written and when it came out, I would have seen it at age 6, which is one of the reasons it's so relevant today.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's always going to be harder to make money in the film industry than to make it in music, but in the music industry, it's harder than in the movie business.  The reason is that the music business doesn't have the huge marketing budget that the movie world has.  When you're making music, you have to sell it to people who don't know much about it.  And the person who buys your music may not like your music the way you do.  They'll hear one thing and have a different opinion about it than the person they're selling it to.  So it takes much longer to sell music than it does to make movies.  In movies, you can go to an audience and you can tell them what it's about, and they'll know what you're talking about.  But if you want to get any kind of music into people's hands, you've got to go through record stores.  As far as the music goes, it has to be sold through record shops.   So there are two different kinds of music.  There's music that you have the rights to sell through record companies or labels, and there's music you don't have any control over, and which can be pirated at any time.  Of course, it doesn't take much to make something that's actually a pirated recording, because they're made by people in a very un-hip way.  You know, it isn't like they can't play the drums or something.  It's just that the way they play the drum is different from the way a real drummer plays the drum.  A real drummer would go all out and they'd have to make a recording of it in order to make that drum sound good.  That's why the recording companies have to give it to a drummer, so he can do a recording that's exactly what he played.  If it's not exactly what the drummer is playing, it won't be a recording, it'll just be a tape or something that the drummer doesn't care about. I think that's a way people get into making a lot of music that I don't think is very good.  I've never heard of the guy who plays the drums in a rock band who would ever want to give their drumming up to someone who's not really a good drummer.  At the end of the day, he's going to get the kind of drumming he's

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's not a terrible movie and in some ways I like it.  It has a few bad parts but it also has a lot of good parts. The bad parts are mainly in the second half. In the first half the film is great. It starts strong with some great dialogue and some great action. There's also a couple of really good action scenes. In that time however, the rest of the film turns into a lot more of a love story between the main characters. The main characters are a young man who wants to be a real hero, and a former member of a secret police force known as the Black Hand. The first half of the movie is great, and when the story takes a turn for the worse, it makes for an extremely frustrating final 30 minutes of the flick.   It is my favorite of all the horror movies I've seen, and I think it is one of the better horror movies of the 2000's.  A couple of movies in my life I've said, "It's one of those movies that people say was the best of their era, but they never make it. I'm going to make it." The film I'm talking about is Evil Dead II.  The first film was not good. The second film was a masterpiece. When I saw Evil Dead I thought to myself, "Okay, here's a movie that's going to be good. It's going make a lot money, and it's going have the best name of its time. But the first film has so much wrong with it. Let's make it perfect."   And in the end, I was not disappointed. It is a great movie and a great sequel. The film is based on the film of the same name from 1982, and is a sequel to the first movie. It features the original cast, and has the same good things about it, but does not try to follow it up. Instead it does its own thing.  I think if you liked Evil Dead 1 you're going to love this one.  I thought the acting was decent for the most part, but I think one of my favorite performances is Jason Clarke. I think he was excellent as John Kramer. He was also great as John Merrick, the former leader of the Black Hands. There was one part that really annoyed me, and that was the scene where Jason Clarke was talking to a group of people after some strange occurrences. It was supposed to

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     It's a very bad movie that tries to make a good movie into a better movie by using many bad jokes:  There's a movie called "The Thing", that has a monster that looks like a man, who's just trying to take revenge on his neighbor who has hurt him in the past. The man just had a child with his wife, and he wanted the child to be a perfect clone. But the man was not so lucky, and his son was not a clone. Instead he had a "monster", who killed his daughter, and tried to take back his child and his wife. But it turned out the monster was not his neighbor. It was actually a space alien, who has killed many people in his life. But he was not very friendly towards humans. So the guy got rid of the space alien by using a new kind of science, that is also capable of making clones of people. But in order to make it happen the man has to have many children, and have them grow up in different environments:   It was just a terrible movie that I just couldn't understand any of the dialogues. They tried to make some jokes by using bad movie jokes. There's a kid who tries to kiss his girlfriend, but she didn't want him to do it, because he was married. So he went on to his parents to tell them. But his dad just said: "I don't want you kissing your mother!" And this guy just got mad and kicked him out of the house.   The best thing that I found in this movie was the first scene, with a scientist, who was trying to clone his own brother. He tried to cut off his fingers, but it was too late, he was already too mutated. The last scene was very cool, and it was just an awesome fight scene: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     "What an idiot. "   I didn't see this as a "bad movie". The bad guy is not the most threatening figure in the movie, he's just the least threatening in the entire film. This is, in my opinion, a pretty good movie. I would probably watch this movie at least once a week. It is very entertaining. A well-told story with plenty of action and fun. My only real complaint about this movie is the ending. It doesn't hold a lot of mystery and tension. The mystery is pretty small. It was just a matter of finding out who the "bad guy" was before he killed them all. It's pretty anticlimactic. I do not really recommend this movie.   "  It's an enjoyable movie and it was not that good of a movie. It had some good moments, but the story was poor. The acting was ok, but they could have done a better job than they did. "
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The problem is that you can't really say anything in an angry review...you're just venting, and that's the wrong way to handle it.   I can't tell you how many times I saw a movie for a bit and then went home to take a shower and then go on the internet and read a couple of reviews.  I got this movie because my friend is a big fan of David Lynch.  She got it because of this movie and the one that followed it. The plot is that there's a man who can turn into a wolf that eats people.  A bunch of the other people are just trying to survive, and I'm a little concerned about a couple that has been bitten and doesn't want to die.  There's a scene where they're in a hotel room and he has a gun on her.  It's a pretty stupid one, but there are a couple lines where she just kind of cowers there in the corner and you can see the look on her face.  So we get a pretty boring story, a lot of people die and there's no big payoff.  The movie isn't really scary at all.  One of my friends thought it was a little more scary than it was.  This movie is so bad, even the trailer isn't bad...it's just a bad trailer.  We see that trailer. It's kind of scary.  My friend is going to give it two stars but there's one thing that really pissed me off about this movie.  When the wolf bit this girl, the other woman, I swear to God...the guy was like...no way.  He started running toward the door and then he just let her bite him.    That was very stupid.  And it's just stupid...I know she wants to bite him, but don't be a jerk.  That's just one thing they could have done better.  If you're going to kill people, you might as well take your time and enjoy the movie. The only thing I don't like about this book is that they make up stuff that's not real.  They made up a couple pages of a book that's been sitting on my desk all along, but I couldn't remember what it was, so I thought "this will be really cool."  It was just a random guy with a big knife, who doesn't actually exist in this world.  All in
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - I don't watch enough horror movies.  The horror genre has a lot to offer, and this was one of the better movies I saw this year.   - The script had me laughing out loud a few times.  - I thought it was interesting that they didn't show the opening credits.  The film is actually quite good.  It's about a guy who was recently married and has a daughter to take care of.  He is not afraid to take the time to help his daughter and his girlfriend get through the trials of marriage.  Even though I love my wife, I've realized that I don' want to be her parent.  She's been through so much, and I feel the only person she can trust is her father.  There's a lot of family drama going on in this movie, and the film doesn't shy away from showing the stress on this couple.  I didn't like the ending.  One character was a jerk and was only shown for the purpose of making sure the other characters don't die.  Another character was evil and did not deserve to die, and yet another character was the most loving and caring character on the whole movie.  When I was watching the film, it was hard to remember that this movie is actually about two characters, not a bunch of monsters.  For the most part, this movie stays true to the plot, and it's always fun to see what the other people are thinking and doing.  While there's a bit of a down side to the film (namely the ending), I really enjoyed watching this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Inception" (2010) is an excellent example of why I want to leave Hollywood. It's such a mess of a movie, that I'm almost embarrassed to be a fan of it. The film revolves around an aspiring actor named Cobb (Tom Hardy) who finds himself in a movie where he plays a computer-generated character (played by the always-brilliant Joon-ho Bong) that he becomes the brainwashed mind behind. Cobb's storyline is not only unbelievable, but the story he is told and how he is put into the movie is also ludicrous. His story takes place in a dream sequence, and not only that, he must actually find the villain's (Tom Cavanagh) lair in order to complete the movie. It all feels like an insane attempt at making a horror film, and it just doesn't work. It has a great cast that also includes Cillian Murphy as his bad guy and Morgan Freeman as his "love interest" (and she's also terrible), and a fantastic score to add to it all. At times, the film makes me feel like I was watching an episode of "Lost", but at other times, I felt like I've been punched in the face. There are just too many elements that are just so wrong. There was an interview with Tom Hardy in which he said that this film was "a test of my faith", which seems ridiculous. The most offensive thing about it is that we as audiences are supposed to believe that this movie was real. There's so much going on here, and I was never convinced until I actually watched it for myself. There were some scenes in this film that made me cringe, but overall, this is one of my favorite horror films of all-time, and one of the best "inception" movies.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       I can't wait for my mom to see that one.   But I'm going to try to watch it again so I can see what the rest of the movie is like, and I won't think I made a good decision if I don't watch it.  Because, you know, I've seen a lot of bad movies and the movies that I know are bad aren't the ones I know to be bad. __________ ___________ _______________ Why do we watch movies with good/bad endings:    ____________ _____________ When you're watching bad movies, you've got to feel a little ashamed.  When my mom watches Bad Boys, she'll probably be thinking about how bad the movie was that she was forced to watch.  When I watch bad movies I'm sure she'll be thinking at least three times a day, "Oh god I'm so bad at this.  I'm such a bad actor.  Oh, I'm just such a jerk.  How bad am I at this?"    ________ _________ ______________ When I first saw bad movies on video, I really wanted to watch them again so badly.  But now that I've gotten better at watching bad movie, I can't help but think that, perhaps, the movie that I saw was really a bad one. A good movie doesn't make you happy in the same way that a bad book or movie will.  If you don't like a movie, that's your problem.  This is one of the reasons why I don"t get really excited about watching movies.  After watching The Wedding Singer, I couldn't stop thinking about the poor actress.  In the movie, she does a really horrible and unbelievable thing, and we all just shake our heads in disgust.  She's not even really a terrible actress. And yet, I was actually kinda proud of her for doing this awful thing.  Because the movie wasn't really about her, it was about him.  And he's really the one who's being a jerk here.  It's the woman who's so perfect in the movie who has to get raped, who's the damsel in distress, and it's the man who's doing all the horrible things who is the one getting away with it. But now that the movie has left the theatres, I get really disappointed
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My friends and I went to see this movie and let me say: This movie was horrible. First off, the movie is not funny at all, but more like a "weird" comedy with the acting being the worst. When you watch it, it doesn't really make sense to you. Then you realize that you're watching it with a bunch of people you don't even know. You look at the actors and they look like idiots in a ridiculous "funny" comedy. The jokes are made up, and the movie looks like something that's been edited out to sell the movie. We were laughing because we didn't know what was going on. The whole time we were waiting for the movie to go on, there were people walking around the theater who didn't even realize they were in a movie. If you go to the theaters and find a place where they play these type of movies, you'll find that they're usually a lot worse. Then, the last 30 minutes of this movie are a "torture" movie. When I saw it, the torture scenes are so graphic that you can barely watch them. I have never been more disgusted with the cinema as I was that night. I don't think I'll ever watch this movie again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If I can't say good about a movie I just saw, I'm not going to watch it again.    A must-see, yet it still suffers from many   flaws and   issues  .  But that doesn't mean that I haven't seen this movie...  So here we go, I want to start off with a quote from the movie itself:  "The world was different then... The way we looked at it, we had our way.  We thought that if a man wanted to show what he was made of, he had to be the most handsome, the most intelligent, the one with the best taste in women.  of course, not all men were made to look that way. And not all women were made for one man. And there was always someone out there that just had to make it. A man just got to be a man, and just as importantly, just as quickly. And if the world wanted to see some'manly man's' best, they'd come to him. The only catch was, as long as he stayed as pure and masculine as he could possibly get, he'd never have to face the consequences."  The quote above sums up a movie that's filled with so much emotion and passion that it leaves a deep impression on me. It is the best romance ever made. If you aren't able to watch the movie, I implore you to watch a little clip below: I'll wait... , because it shows off some of the great moments and lines from the film:  "You're not going through any motions are you?" "No, no, no. I mean, I guess so... I guess not." "Just because you don't see it the same way doesn't make it any less real." "I'll say I like you. I'll say you're really cute. But... you're not the only person in this world I like." "This is what you make of it." "You'll have to accept the fact that the only thing that matters to me is you and me alone." "And you're mine." "That's not what I mean." "Do you want me to say that one more time?" "I'd like you to. It means a lot to me." "It means a whole lot to you." "We both know it." I am so so happy that

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've heard people describe " The Breakfast Club " as "one of the greatest, best movies ever made."  It is one of those films that are easy to get lost in.  You don't really notice how great of a performance  Robert De Niro  has.   If I wasn't a film lover, I'd probably not even know about this film.  You'll only see it in the movies section of your local theater and if you want to find it on Youtube, you will probably get it on YouTube and you will have to listen to a really good movie to find out why this film was so popular at the time.  The film tells the story of three boys in the '80s:  Clyde, Dennis and Patrick.   They grow up in a  ghetto  in Miami and they all attend an inner city high school.  They're all part of a  clique  of  cliques.  Clyde has an easy going attitude.  He has an  outgoing  personality.  Dennis is an  introvert  and a shy. Patrick is  the only member of the  cliquish  cliche who is extremely competitive.  These boys form the clique that will be known as  " The Big Three"  -  Denny, Dennis and Patrick.  Once they begin to hang out at a local bowling alley and learn about the culture of the local gangsters.  When a gangster named  El Jefe  shows up and they decide to kill him.  However, a boy named  Domenico Vespucci   ( Joe Pesci )  is involved.  El Jefteca is also a member of  The Big 3  and he decides to take on the role of a patsy and pretend to be killed by the gangsters - until he is himself killed.  Unfortunately, this is not a movie to just sit down and watch.  It was a film about two boys with something to prove.  As you are watching this film, you'll wonder what their goal in life is and the  drama that will ensue.  This movie is  a  cult classic for a reason.  I'll also say that it was  written by  David Mamet.   This film has the perfect mix of violence and comedy.  There's a reason that this
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would like to mention the fact that this movie is actually about a war, not just about a comedy. It was very hard for me to watch. The movie starts off well, with some funny scenes and a really nice scene when the girls play football. The whole movie is great in this way, but unfortunately the characters don't get the humor they are capable of and the story isn't that interesting. The girls and their friends are all very dull and forgettable, and you might want to skip this movie altogether.   The movie tries to be funny but it never works. It tries a bunch of different things but they just never seem to work. The jokes might work in the context of the movie, but they don't work when the movie jumps around and tries to use a lot of different elements. The only good thing is that it's only an 8 minute movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The first half of the movie is about the two main characters - the girl who lives in the house with the three boys and the boy who was abandoned by his parents, who is called "Buddy". Buddy is a good person who does his best to help people and do right by them. At the end of the first movie he gets married, is in love with the girl of his dreams (who is also a boy) and they are having a child. However, during the movie his parents die, so he is left with his two best friends and the girl. It's a story about the bad situations and the way of life it leads to. You will get some laughs, but also some scary situations and a lot of action. But don't be afraid. It is still a funny movie, but with a lot to think about, and is filled with some bad things, but there is a lot that will make you cry too. In the second half of this movie, Buddy grows up and takes a serious look at his life and his past.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoyed The Cabin in the Woods. I have to say I was really worried it would be that bad.   It wasn't. The story is really nice and the characters are fun. I also really enjoyed the movie.  Some scenes were really well done and some of the characters really are likable.  I found myself laughing out loud and it made it a great experience.  Unfortunately, The Cabin has some really lame scenes that are a major turn off. They are not funny at all and the entire movie is just one long set up for some really bad scenes.  This movie is a great start to a good summer.  If you are a horror fan and don't have any other good horror movies to see. You should definitely check this one out. If you have watched the first movie and liked it, you will definitely enjoy this one as well.   …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    1. "Dirty Dancing" (1977) (Fiction) When a young man starts attending the theater at night, a teenage girl in New York City becomes attracted to him. A jealous and jealous man, a father who is a professional gambler, a brother who is not only a successful businessman, but an expert gambler of course, but, most of all, a mother who wants a son who will be just like his father, becomes involved in a dangerous game of love. The movie's main theme is about "family" and how that is not always what we think it is. The ending of this movie is just as controversial and intriguing as the movie's beginning.   (10/10) (Posted by: Lassie at 1:46 AM on 6/8/07) 2. "Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb" (1964) (War) This is probably the best of the two classic comedies made by Stanley Kubrick. I can't even remember the original title. I think it was called "The Man with a Movie Camera". The director of this film, Stanley Kubrick, was also a major innovator in the area of film. This was his fourth and final film directed by him, the other three being "Dr Strangelovess" (1950), "A Clockwork Orange" (1971) and "The Shining" (1980).   3. "Pulp Fiction" (1994) (Crime) One of the most influential films ever made. I was 14 and it was the first movie that really made me laugh out loud, that wasn't "Grown Ups" or "Big", or "Rambo". The plot was about a bunch of friends that, over a few beers, find out that they have each been robbed by the same guy. The film was directed by Quentin Tarantino and he had a lot of fun playing with the rules of the movie.  It's interesting to note that Tarantino was hired by Stanley's brother-in-law, Francis Ford Coppola, for this movie. This is a great film because its tone is very dark and very violent. But it also has a funny bit about a detective's wife who goes to see Pulp Fiction as a favor for her husband, only to be disgusted by it.  4. "The Italian Job" (1973) (Criminal)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think the only real reason this movie exists is because of the "MOVIE OF THE WEEK" section of the AV Club. I read that section on the internet and thought that it was a really funny movie, and I was probably right. It's a bit slow paced but it is well shot, and there's not too much dialogue. A few of the scenes had me laughing and I didn't even know it was going on. This movie is very funny, and while it is very "drama" it's just very silly. There are some moments in the film that could have been even better but I don't think any scene was ruined because it was done in a silly way. I do believe that the movie has a good ending which is kind of cheesy but you can still enjoy the ridiculousness of the movie. I think this is a movie for "cinematic kids". I also believe that this is best to be watched while alone. There's an awesome movie club scene where one of the girls tells another girl how to get her own place on TV. It has the same kind of tone and style of comedy that it has in this movie. In the end, I would recommend this movie to anyone who is in the mood for a little humor and a little action.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    1.1 1.1 The most depressing movie   I had ever seen. I was in my early thirties at the time, and had been watching a lot of horror movies, including a bunch of French movies. I watched a few of them when I was younger and was interested in the supernatural, but had never really given much thought to it. This movie gave me the chills. I didn't know what to do. I'd seen the trailer a couple of times, but never had seen it, and didn't think the title would bother me (it didn't!). So I sat down to watch it. There was a bit of a horror element to it, but the actual violence was so over-the-top that I thought there would have been no way to suspend disbelief (after all, this was a comedy). I was very disappointed. I went into the theater terrified, only to find myself laughing my ass off. It was like watching a scene from "Spy Hard" on TV. The music was a great soundtrack, and the effects were pretty good. Then, after the ending credits, it cut to black and I was just shocked and disappointed. This movie is a masterpiece. And the only reason I'm adding this comment is because it had nothing to do with the horror element in the film.  "Ain't Nobody'Thin but a Crock!"
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the funniest comedies of the past half-century.... " -- Time Magazine  " -- Time magazine "The best movie you will see all year." -- Washington Post  From the moment it started to a final triumphant, laugh-filled flourish, it was clear that a classic of modern-day comedy was on its way.. The characters, played by Eddie Murphy, Steve Martin, Richard Lewis, Ed Asner and Peter Finch, are so believable and so endlessly entertaining that you forget that they are, for the most part, entirely invented.. What makes this film so special is that it is all the more satisfying because it is so true to life.. Even if the dialogue sounds like something you might overhear on a late-night talk-show, you can always trust that the actors and actresses will capture the spirit of the moment.. There's also a surprising depth of emotion, as we see a number of people who have made it to adulthood with their lives still in chaos. This movie is about the power of friendship. -- People
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really hope I never have to witness this scene in a movie theater.   This scene is so bad, it will make you want to see this film at home because this is something you will not want to watch on the big screen, it just sucks.    This is a movie that had its good and bad moments but it was so bad and so out of place in it's own genre that it will give you the sick feeling that I have gotten every time I watch this movie.   There are so many things wrong with this movie that it doesn't even matter how bad it is, what matters is that it was horrible.  If you are a fan of the 80's and this movie was made in 1990, it is just so terrible that you would never watch this on the theatre.  It is an example of why movies are so important and so important that we don't need to watch them on the cinema, it needs to be our way of escaping, but movies have lost some of their relevancy.   Movie Rating: 3.0/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's hard to be good at anything at all. If you're good at one thing, it's not enough. It's not good enough. If a movie is bad, it sucks. It doesn't just suck; it's such a bad idea that it's a bad film, just plain and simple. It has no potential. It just sucks. A good movie has no flaws. If it's well made, it doesn't suck. If someone wants to give it a bad review, they do so because they want to prove that their opinions are worth more than others. It sucks. You're saying something that is obviously not true and you're using a bad argument, which is how these people always act. They hate themselves. They know they're terrible at their jobs, but they hate other people who are good at theirs, which makes it seem like they are also terrible at theirs. I have no idea what they're doing there. People like that are idiots. I've never seen that person at a concert. I can't imagine what that person has to say about a movie, unless he's a total idiot who can't even figure out how to use a computer and has no clue how a movie works. There are plenty of bad movies out there. You know, like they say, "If a movie's bad, then it doesn not matter." Yeah, well, that's not always the case. Sometimes it doesn t matter. In my opinion, even a movie with a bad premise can be made into a good movie. Movies that are poorly made often suck. I'm sure if you watched "Rear Window," which was directed by Michael Cimino, you'd know what I mean. It really doesn t have a great premise, but it does have some good performances. They're good. That's all the director did. That  film is good because of the actors, but because of all the bad things the movie is about: the police who don't have control of the town, the mafia who controls the town with an iron fist, a kid who sees things that aren't there, and a woman who is manipulated by the mob. All of those things are presented so beautifully and the actors have a hard time keeping their emotions in check. They are just so good. I still love the movie and can still watch it and see the things it is talking about and still think "Wow, that was a really good movie." The
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A few years ago, while looking at the movie reviews in my old journal, I realized the movie review system I was using for decades had no place for an objective view of movies.   It seemed that all I was seeing were movies I wanted to watch, and those I thought people should see.  I started to think more about how subjective I was being with my rating system, and I wondered if my own opinions were also being created by my reviews.  After a few months of reflection and research, I began to see what I really liked in films, and what wasn't working for me.  For my latest movie review, I thought I'd give some insight into my process of selecting movies, and why I decided to stop doing that, as I now see it as one of the most damaging things I could have done.  In this first section, I'll discuss what makes a good movie.  The next section will talk about my process for rating movies.   The final section will discuss the movies I watched, and the reasoning behind what I loved, and also why I hated some of the movies (or had bad reactions). So, what makes good movies?  I think that good movies have a lot of the following characteristics:  They are engaging, thought-provoking, emotionally-charged, well-crafted, and visually-pleasing.  If a movie meets at least one of these criteria, then it's a good film.  You'll probably see what my criteria are, but I think it's also important to understand why I think a film meets all these criteria:   It's interesting, moving, or thought- provoking.  One of the best parts of cinema is the fact that every scene can be used to tell a different story, as well as help add to the plot.  To give an example, I remember reading a review of "The Man Who Knew Infinity" where the writer said this: " It is an entertaining, but fairly serious, psychological thriller about a man who becomes obsessed with a seemingly mundane murder of an actor by a man in a trench coat.  He doesn't know why he is so obsessed, but his investigation eventually reveals an obsession with the occult that involves a satanic ritual."  Now, I won't comment on the story, but it really shows the brilliance of the film's writer.  The plot and story itself could have been the focus of the movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Why would I want to watch this movie?   The plot:  "What does that even mean?!" I'll admit, I don't quite understand this movie either, especially considering it's basically the story of two guys going to see a movie about the world's weirdest guy. That would be the greatest title of all time. Anyway, I thought it was pretty interesting.    I was initially not a big fan of the concept of the movie. But I was glad I went.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first two movies of this series were great. They gave me a great sense of the world of this book and characters. The third film didn't have the same level of quality, but I still enjoyed it. This one is pretty much the same thing:. The story of this movie is very predictable and boring. The hero gets killed by a demon in the first act. He just keeps fighting to survive, and that's about it. I wanted to see him find a way to escape that prison. Instead, he fights a lot more demons, and it gets more and more unbelievable the more of them he kills. This movie was just so incredibly dull. The only good thing that happened was that we finally saw the demonic form of the villain. It's interesting and different from the human form. They still don't make much of a sense, though. If they hadn't been so cheesy about it, it could have been a really great movie. It was just too obvious they were making a cheap horror movie, and not a serious movie.    …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A   [the movie's story, screenplay, and casting] is bad.   It is very difficult for me to review it on my own.  I would recommend this film to people with an interest in acting, but with more experience than the average audience member.  It requires some patience and a good amount of patience, if one is a trained actor.  If one has been in the business long enough, one would know that it doesn't make sense to make a film in a way that would make it impossible for you to act in your own character.  The film is about two friends who want to do their best at their jobs, but they find it difficult.  Both have their own problems as they grow older, but this movie portrays it as a series of problems that never get resolved.  At the beginning, it is clear that they are friends that are trying their best to be a part of the world of acting.  And one thing they do is to work at it. But then they are faced with a series problems that doesn't seem to have a conclusion.  They are never told that they don't have a solution to the problem and they are never asked to solve it.  Their problem never really gets solved, so their lives continue.  But the characters in this movie do not get a chance to have their problems resolved because they are always working on their jobs.  Instead, they continue to fight with each other.  This movie seems to imply that every problem that you have in life must be solved in one movie.  A simple idea, and a very difficult thing to do.  One thing this movie does is it tells us that even when you have a problem in your life, you have to do everything in your power to solve your problem, and in your spare time, you need to get back to work.  We must take every single opportunity to work on our problems, even if it is only on the weekends.   We must always make our efforts to get work done on weekends and holidays, even when it is the last thing on our mind.   Our job is to act.   As actors, we have to be prepared to be anything.  That includes our problems.  In some ways, they seem to be very similar to my problems in my life.  Even if they seem easy to solve in this film, they are impossible in my own life. This movie is too long and very dull.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This one has a couple bad scenes (like many movies do), but for me, the entire film was excellent. The storyline was well done and the story itself was well paced. The only thing that was bad, was that it was written by a woman, I could see some male filmmakers doing this kind of film, but that didn't matter. If you like horror, this is a must see. I will give the ending to this film, it was well written and well acted. I liked the ending because it was very clever.   This review has been reviewed by mike on Monday, March 24, 2016
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would say this movie isn't bad and the actors and actresses in this film are all amazing. However, there is a problem with the story that keeps the film from being anything more than a standard action thriller.   The story takes place on a ship that has just arrived at a small fishing village in Japan and is in dire need of repairs. The ship is infested with a virus that has caused a violent rage among the crew and is turning all of them into killer whales. The only hope the villagers have of preventing a massacre at their fish market is to send a Japanese doctor to rescue the survivors and save them from death at the hands of their own kind. The problem is that the doctor is a serial killer and the ship's captain is a complete coward and doesn't want to risk anyone but himself. So, the captain has a one-man, 100-mile trek on foot, with a samurai sword at his side and has a lot of trouble fighting the virus and making it to shore.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (I hate that term) It's as if you can't believe it ever happened. A young woman finds a mysterious diary. After reading it, she is compelled to make a movie of her life. This is such a bad idea. The movie's premise is so terrible. The story is so bad. The cast is so mediocre. So when this movie was released, it was supposed to be "that movie". It was supposed by everyone to be the worst movie ever. Why did the producers make it so bad? Because they wanted to create a cult. The producers of this movie were all self-entitled, and they didn't care about the quality of the movie. If this is so, then I can understand why they didn' t care about quality. I won't watch this movie. I want nothing to do with it. It's not interesting. It makes no sense. It isn't even real. This movie is a failure. Do yourself a favor and just ignore this movie and leave it for someone else to find out. The Movie - 5 out of 10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Posted by:  Lori   Lori, I would like to add something to your comment. "Lies, damn lies and statistics" does not make me a fan of those statistics. We all love stats. It's just that statistics are not really the best at predicting who's going to win a race. That said, "LIES, DAMN LIES AND STATISTICS" is a really entertaining movie. I think it's one of the very few comedies in recent memory that has enough laughs to last through a long movie night. I also think the story itself is interesting and fun.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's okay. I really liked the story but the movie is not. This movie has everything I would want in a horror movie but not a good one. The only time I had a good time watching this movie was when the woman from the house was on camera.   The house has a story, the way the house is built is great, the house itself is creepy as hell and is made out of wood but the woman is creepy in it's own way. I will give it a 6 out of 10.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is full of horrible characters with no redeeming qualities. The main character is a psychotic killer but it's not his fault. What makes this movie so awful is that it's set in an extremely dark and bleak future where every day is a living hell for almost every person. One day when the protagonist gets his revenge, he accidentally kills his father and kills the other main character. It's a bit more like a horror-thriller than a horror movie but at the end he's a very twisted killer and is completely insane. He's even a victim in this movie.   It's so dark and depressing to the point that the viewer can't believe this was ever made.  So the main character of this movie is a very sick killer who kills people for a reason or another. What's even more horrible is that the only people in the movie that feel anything are the bad guys. This movie isn't very well made but it is interesting to see the "heroes" being defeated by the "villains". The bad guys were so bad that they're not even villains so much as psychopaths. The only characters that were well designed were the women and their "love interests" who were a bit stupid. The women are very passive and pretty. The baddies had such great designs that I would have liked to have met them.       The movie was supposed to be made for a television series but unfortunately, it got scrapped. The people behind the movie said that they had to abandon the idea of the TV series because they couldn't find a good TV writer to write it. I personally wouldn't be upset to see this movie in the future but it should have been a movie from the start. It was too dark and the characters were too weak to make this into a good movie. If you like dark and scary movies, you will enjoy this but you won't get what you paid for.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've read a lot of reviews of this movie. I don't even remember some of the reviews.  I remember one that said, "This is a horrible film to watch," and I was not surprised, for I had not seen the movie.   To be honest, I was kind of hoping to see something horrible for it's sake.  However, it was good, and very entertaining.  Some of the action sequences are very well done.  I found the acting very good.  Also, some of it was pretty shocking.  There was some nudity in the movie, but it was not very graphic.  In this movie, we get to see some very nasty acts done to these people.  To give you an idea of how far a person can go to get what they want, the people in this movie are just waiting for the big payday.  This is a movie for people that enjoy watching people get their comeuppance.   This movie is an excellent movie that will make you laugh and cry at the same time.  It's a great movie that you need to see. I would give this movie a 7.5 out of 10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can't stand to watch movies with subtitles, because it looks like they're just throwing stuff in for the hell of it. I'm not sure if I should be offended or not, so I'm going to say it's better than watching it without them.   The movie stars a bunch of people in their thirties, who are constantly fighting, getting into fist fights and then being beaten to a pulp. At least, I think that's what happens, because the subtitles don't help to tell me anything.  I do not recommend this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is not a bad film, but it has some technical issues and some of the scenes are rushed and not really that great. The special effects are not as impressive as some of those in the Star Wars series.   The first half of the film is good, but in the second half the story changes. I will not be recommending this to anyone because it is just not a good film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This film is a disappointment and a piece of shit. The plot is pretty weak. There is no originality, no creativity, nothing new, no original ideas... it's a simple story about a poor man who gets into a car wreck and then is brought back to life by some scientists and is asked to help with a project to make more people come back to Earth. There's nothing original about this idea, and it's pretty boring to watch. This is supposed to be a sci-fi, but I don't see any of the sci-tech that they showed us. The scientists are trying to find an alien species to have sex with that would come back as men or women. The film only goes over the science that they do have, and nothing else. It's like they wanted to add a lot of science to this film to make it more interesting, but they didn't have the brains to do it. The characters, all of them are one-dimensional. The only one that is interesting is the poor man. I'm sorry to say he's the only interesting character in this movie, because everyone else is just a mouthpiece for the scientists, and for the plot to move forward. This film is simply bad, and I recommend it only if you're bored.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the best movies of 2012 was, ironically enough, one of the worst movies of the year. One of my favorite films of 2012, a good film, a bad film. I don't know if I will ever see it again, not because it was bad, but because I want to know what makes the people behind it go, why they would make a film like this, why? This film is not a bad story, although it isn't the best. This film has a good plot, but it is a bad narrative. The characters are mostly bland and are just there for some kind of backstory. I just don't understand why they think that making a documentary is the way to go. The most interesting character in the film, in fact, is an actor who seems like he was supposed to be on the film for 10 minutes, and he gets like 20. The other characters are not interesting at all, and the director made a film about a guy who goes out and has a bad life because he got an A in some class. The ending of this film is terrible, because it tries to give some sort of meaning to all of it, which is impossible. This movie is a waste of time and money.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Hail to the Chief" is a movie about a failed police officer. This movie is full of clichés and clichés alone. The plot of this movie is very cliche. This is a very stupid movie. The ending of the movie is a complete cliche because it is complete cliché.   The biggest problem in this movie was the character of the cop. He wasn't the right character to be a cop. His performance was nothing but his character's performance. It was really stupid.  I'm not the least bit angry about the movie because I didn't like it, nor do I recommend this movie for any reason.  The movie is so boring and I felt like I was watching a bad TV show.  I give this movie a 1/10 because I don't think it's worth a single rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a pretty good movie but I found the pacing to be a little slow and predictable, especially towards the end when it got more ridiculous. I found myself skipping all over the place and getting sucked right back into the movie when the ending finally happened.  It was an amazing scene and I was a little shocked by it. The guy is trying to make out with a girl, a bit more realistically than usual, and then she looks at him with these puppy dog eyes and asks him why he is making out with her and then walks away. He is not able to find any words or anything, he just goes along with it. It's one of the best scenes in the movie. He comes back and finds a dead body on the ground and he picks it up and finds that it is the dead girl. Then she tells him he was in love with her. And that she was a vampire, that he had to die. And then she runs away. It was really touching, and the movie was just a really cool experience. The movie kept pulling me back in and I wanted it to continue. I really didn't want it to end. The ending was so fucking awesome. I would watch this movie over and over again if I could. It gets pretty heavy at the end, but it's totally worth it. I highly recommend this movie and will definitely be watching it again. We can all agree that vampires are fucking cool. But this movie is pretty fucking creepy as well. There was a whole creepy mansion and I can't even begin to describe it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What's the worst movie you've ever seen?   How about the worst film of all time?  This is a question that many of us have been asking ourselves over the years.  I was a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick's cult classic The Shining (1980), a film that has a deeply disturbing story line and is perhaps the ultimate horror movie.  My own personal favorite horror films include House of Wax (1961) and The Exorcist (1973).  So, I thought I would look for some of the other worst movies to see if they have stood the test of time. I began my search in 1976 with some films that had just appeared on television, including The Devil's Rain (1975) and the movie "Possessed" (1976).  These two movies were considered the worst movies ever, but I have never seen any of them and had no idea they were the worst.  Before I even started to examine these films, I knew I needed more. I started by looking at the year of their release.  One of the films I found was The Demon (1939), directed by Ernst Lubitsch and starring the iconic actress Myrna Loy and William Powell. The movie is just bad.  The acting is atrocious, the movie takes itself too seriously, and the entire plot seems to be contrived.  It would have been a good movie had Lubitsch not been known for his anti-Semitic propaganda.  However, this movie was the first of many in which the actors seem to be completely lost.  This seems to have been an industry wide phenomenon, as many of these films were made and marketed during the early 1940's.   Then it was time to look at the film's rating.  In 1946, this film was rated R, which is considered to be the first PG-13 film.  These were all PG-rated movies back in 1946.  While it is not uncommon to find such films now, I still find myself puzzled.  With that being said, I found another film that I think should be included in the worst films of all-time.  A film called "Sylvia" (1957) was made by MGM and was considered the first "horror movie."  This film was also based on a novel written by E.L. Doctorow.  Sylvester Stallone stars as the title character in this film. It was only released in the United States on
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      A film that I've wanted to watch a million times is finally on the big screen. The premise for this film is brilliant, but the story takes itself too seriously and I found myself bored to tears by the film's ending. I enjoyed the movie a lot but it had its issues.   The plot is all about a rich kid who has a huge castle and can do anything he wants. But there are some flaws in the film as well. I liked the concept of the movie, but I didn't enjoy the characters very much.  It was hard to take anyone seriously at all. I had to wonder if they'd even tried to act on it.  The acting was also a bit weird and I was wondering how the actors knew what to do.  If you're a fantasy movie fan then you should watch it. It's not very complex, but it has some good ideas and good acting.  "How do I know when you're lying to me?"  I just found it hard to like the film very much since the film tries to make itself serious. But if you're not a fantasy fan then just see this film and you'll be fine.  I recommend it if you liked The Lion King.  This film was rated PG-13.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are a few decent movies out there, but most of them are terrible. I have seen every bad movie in a long time and I can honestly say, this one is the worst I've ever seen. First of all, the movie is called 'Criminal', but it's really a very bad cop movie. There is only one way I can describe it: It's like 'Bladerunner' meets 'The Hunt for Red October'. Not a very good movie at all. When it was released, it received a mediocre score, and now it is at a terrible 99%, and it's one of the very few 'bad movies' that doesn't deserve a perfect score. It's not even a good bad movie, it's like a bad bad movie. The only things worth mentioning are the lead role by the famous actor, Paul Dano. He does an amazing job, and it would be a crime to give it a bad score. Secondly, 'The Counselor' is a very interesting film that, in the end, becomes so boring and dull that I didn't care anymore. The whole story is pretty predictable, and the ending was really unsatisfying, even for me. I mean, I liked Paul Dao a lot in 'Crimson Peak', but 'The counselor' just turned out to be a boring story about a very boring movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody. Just don't watch it and call me an idiot later. I recommend that you don't even try to watch it, because it's a very horrible experience. You might like 'Fury' better, though. I just don't understand why people still watch 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' and 'Girls' and think it's worth watching bad movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're having trouble with a movie (especially a new movie), there's no reason to get worked up about the ending. You can tell a story a way that works for you, and you'll probably enjoy yourself. I recommend it even more for people who are fans of horror movies and/or have the urge to see a new genre, and are not sure whether the genre fits them.   How to avoid the worst movie: 1. Make sure you have a plan when making your trip to the theater. 2. If you can, avoid it if you can. It's not worth the money.  If there's one thing that can't be done to a good movie, it's to watch it with others (at least 5, if possible).   1. This movie was not written to appeal to everyone. It was written for adults, but it didn't have to be. 2. It has a very strong plot that can be enjoyed by anyone who wants to see it. If there is one movie that you could not watch if you are not up to par with a horror movie, this is it.  I would say it is more "in the vein" of the movies in the Scream series than the more popular movies in that series. The movie has a story that is fun to watch and not boring. I would recommend it for horror fans who want something different. It is definitely not for kids.  3. The acting in this movie was very well done. I loved watching it with my friend, and it had a perfect blend of horror and comedy.  4. There are many things that you won't see in this film that could be seen in any horror movie. It has some really funny moments and a good balance of horror elements.  5. The music was great in this, but I would give it a 4 for that, and a 5 for the acting.  Overall, I liked this movie. I liked watching it for fun, and I felt that I could relate to the main character. I think that it was a great movie and I can't wait to see more of it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For the longest time, we had no idea that we were watching a Hollywood blockbuster. In the opening scenes, we see the actors doing the famous Hollywood kiss and they say it's so important that they "did the deed" before kissing the camera. That's all well and good. But then the movie takes a turn. The camera zooms in on a woman's ass and we see that it's actually a man's face. We then watch him try to pull out of the act. His penis is clearly not working well and the sex scene, like all Hollywood sex scenes, is terrible. The actors (especially Peter Sarsgaard) do the usual movie kiss and it's just not the same as in movies like Grease. The film starts off with Sarsgard making out with a hot blonde. His shirt is pulled up, and when he stands up he is wearing nothing but a pair of briefs. Next we see him kissing a very pretty actress, who was clearly not in the mood. He is clearly frustrated and she is obviously uncomfortable, but she is too horny to care. There's a lot of moaning, and a lot more sex. Then they have a passionate sex scene. That was it. They both came, but it was not the sexiest sex scene I've ever seen in my life. They were too close together, and I don't know why. I'm guessing it was so they could look sexy together. There are some other scenes that were interesting. The acting was good, but the plot was not very original. The two characters were both bad and I did not care who won. I suppose it was meant to be a drama, but instead, it became a comedy that only got funnier. I found this movie interesting, but only because I could imagine all the other Hollywood movies I'm not really into.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's easy to find some really awful movies out there, and even if you don't mind a few gross scenes, you're likely to find a lot of other things you would find to be annoying. So in this case, the worst thing about this film is its plot: the characters are all annoying, the acting is bad, the story is boring, the plot turns out to be contrived, the cinematography is bad and it doesn't have a point to make. The most boring film I've seen this year: it's not even a film with interesting characters or a plot that makes any sense, but it's still more boring than any other film I saw this year. The best film I have seen this summer: it has a story that makes sense and interesting characters, has a very well written script and it's very entertaining to watch. It's very long, and the acting and cinematography are great, so even if the plot and characters are horrible, you might still enjoy it. But overall, it's just not a very good movie, and it makes it hard for me to recommend it. And honestly, that's too bad, because I liked that script and I liked the acting. I like to think that there are probably better scripts out there that we didn't even know about, but since the movie only came out last week, I'm still very interested in trying to find them out. For some reason, I found this movie kind of amusing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a movie about a "bad guy" and his evil plan to take over the world.  The guy has a big white beard, wears a robe, and is totally evil.  He is trying to steal the world's energy and use it to rule the world and destroy the rest of humanity.  It also takes place on the moon.   He meets a cute girl, is very loyal to her, and then suddenly disappears.  When she finds out what he has been doing, she tries to stop him but doesn't realize he is the bad guy.  How many people will be annoyed by this movie?   The movie was good for kids but also a little too cheesy.  I think it was the first time they used makeup to make people look evil. It wasn't as good as the previous one, but it was still pretty good.  In the second movie, the guys were a bit more evil.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In my book, these movies are great movies and I'd watch them over and over, not that I have. (In fact, I haven't seen the last two movies, but I'm sure they're great.) The movie is the one where we see what happens when two kids (Gloria and Raff) are invited by a local high school cheerleader (Kirsten Dunst) to perform in a school play, but it quickly turns into a disaster.  I really liked the idea of this movie. It's based on a short story by a guy named John Updike, and it's one of his more adult stories that takes place in the 60s.  Updike writes about his experiences as a college student in the US and his time spent in England in the 50s, so this movie is very much about that time period as well.   The story is a love story, and that is one of the biggest things I like about this movie - Updick's characters are real, not idealized, and there is a great emotional balance of their love for each other.    Gloria is the more mature and more mature character, but there is also something very tragic in her life.  I think that the movie is much more interesting as a story about teenagers in the 80s than it is about a high school movie in the 70s, and I think this movie was made at the right time to explore that time.  One thing that made me like this movie more was the fact that it was shot in England.  The cast and crew were very much British, and the English language used was very different from what we see in the movies in general.  In this movie, there is quite a bit of swear words, and while I'm not against that type of movie, I think it adds to the atmosphere of the movie, so I appreciate that.  Also, there are a lot of songs that I enjoyed from this movie that were not in other movies I've seen that were shot in this time period.  It was a fun movie and it was a little short, but if you've been waiting for a British-set, '70s-set horror movie, then this one is for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie, and it's a great movie, but it is too old for my tastes. I don't think there's enough violence in this movie to be enjoyable, and I think it is pretty slow. That's why I had to wait over a year for a remastered version. I think the director of the movie had great intentions, but unfortunately there just wasn't enough time to work his magic on this one.   - December 5, 2009I think the movie was better than its remastered copy  Reviewer: zanitaz - favorite favorite favorite - May 10, 2009  Subject: Best movie ever. I only saw this on VHS. I loved it, but didn't really realize the film's worth until much later. This was one of the greatest films ever. It was about one father's relationship with his son (which would be played by Ben Kingsley). It was a movie about faith, and a movie where everyone who was involved (including the director and the actors) felt the movie's worth. - May 20, 2008Best movie ever
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like a dog at a barbecue, it is very   easy to hate a movie but, like a dog that is just too hungry for the meat, one's patience   grows tiring.   And, just like a hungry dog that cannot be stopped by any physical force, if you do try to stop your   hate, you will be   forced   to do so.  One can not   do without the love of a movie.  And there is nothing like a good movie. One can go to a movie theatre and see the very best the world has to offer. But, one cannot   go to the movies, in his own   own  time, in a quiet way. One must do so while sitting in a theatre full of people.  So, it seems as though there are two groups of people in our society today:  1. those who have had enough of movies; and, 2. those that love movies and the love   feeling that films give them. I think that we are not going to get any more of this love by making movies about, say, some man's fight with his mother or some woman's struggle against her abusive husband. Movies are about feelings. And, there is no way that the movies can be done without the feelings that movies create.  If we stop to look at movies from a real place,  it is evident that there is a lot of heart   and heartache in most movies.  It would be nice if the movies were more like  The Notebook, and were more about the relationships that were created in the process of creating the movie. We must keep our kids close, but they should also get away from the movies once in a while,  so that they do not get hurt.  We need to watch movies as they were meant to be seen.  It is one thing to watch a movie about a war. But it is quite another thing to see a movie that is about a man's struggle with his mom.  Movies have become like the drug we all love. They help us escape from reality, so that we can take a few hours to just relax and unwind. So, we should all be aware that there are people out there that love this drug, and they use it as a way to escape. We are not against drugs, we just want to warn people not to take their   drugs
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You just never know... and I'm not saying that only bad movies are bad. Some people like them. There are a lot of them.   There are other people who don't like them, just like there are people who like and/or love the first Star Wars movie, etc.  Why I won't watch:  "He's going to kill them. That's why he does things like that."  When to watch:        This movie was so bad, it had no redeeming value.  All the characters (especially the hero) are horrible.  There's one scene (where he's on the plane) where he is walking past a woman and she looks at him and says "You're so mean, and you're so stupid, and I hate you, you stupid, stupid bastard."   He then pulls out a gun, kills the woman, shoots the pilot, and then goes to shoot the last person he saw on the flight, but the person was already dead by the time he got to him.  "You are such a fucking coward. You are so selfish and evil."  I really wish the film didn't end.  It was a terrible ending to the film.  What a horrible way to die.  I wish I hadn't seen this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (the good stuff is way funnier and smarter)  I'll be the first to admit that I have some serious issues with how some of these characters behave. I find them to be self-absorbed and pompous, they feel a lot like stereotypical, overgrown schoolkids.   I'm not trying to knock this movie for being bad, I'm just putting it on a list of movies that I really, REALLY dislike.  Don't bother watching this movie if you have an aversion to kids.  (Don't even bother.    Just be sure to get yourself some popcorn and a movie-a-palooza.)  This was my second viewing of this movie. I didn't like it one bit.  I felt that they just didn't know what to do with this movie and they just put a bunch of teenagers in a high-school setting and made them act all crazy.  The writing is awful.  It's a list-making list of all of the cliches that kids are supposed to be able to say and do.  They have a lot of "What are you doing?!??" moments.  There are no actual plot holes in this movie, because the movie never had a plot.  This movie was a complete mess that didn't have a beginning, middle, or end.  Just throw some stupid teenage characters in a school setting with some stupid, dumb stuff going on and have them act out all the stuff that they were supposed to say.  You would think that they'd use some actual good writing to make this movie into a decent movie, but instead they just tossed a bunch kids in a crazy high-stakes situation with nothing to do but try to save the world and act like teenagers (and make jokes about stupid high-pitched voices).  The final boss fight had me laughing out loud:  There were some cool and fun scenes in this film, such as the first part where the kids start a computer club, which they eventually become known for.  But it doesn't last long enough to redeem the movie for me.  Instead, the kids just act like stereotypical high-strung high school kids, all self-centered and pompously over-inflated with self-esteem.  What more could you expect from an "All-American" high schooler?  This is just one more example of why kids movies are terrible. I'm sorry.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My favorite film of the year, but in my opinion one of the worst movies of the past decade.   In a perfect world, all movies could be made like this.  It's one of those movies that has it all: action, intrigue, mystery, romance, and emotion.  As a film with a strong social message and a strong message about what America is really about.  I thought the ending was really good and the music was really beautiful.  Overall, this is a great movie.  There are some issues with the ending that aren't explained, but I was never confused as to why.  The movie is a lot more intense than most films and it's got a great soundtrack and a fantastic cast that brings it to life.  However, this movie really needs to be seen in 3D for the best experience.  I'm sure a lot of you have seen this film, but if not, you can check out this review:  You'll definitely want to get this movie!   I'm not a huge film buff, but this is pretty damn awesome and worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am so upset about this movie because it did nothing but ruin my experience at this place. I've never been at this theater before so I came to see the new movie with my boyfriend. The theater is packed and we were seated on the second floor but we weren't that thrilled because the chairs had a lot of cushion and the movie just felt so long. I was expecting it to be 10-15 minutes long and it lasted over 30 minutes. So we didn't really know what was going on and as a result the movie kind of got lost in the shuffle, which is a great problem to have. It did not help that there were so many people talking. The person in front of us kept asking us where we were from and how were we so good. I think the movie was over before I even got to hear the ending, but luckily I had headphones and so I listened anyway. The music was horrible and it just didn't fit the movie, which made it all the more infuriating. I really wish they would have left a lot longer so we could have finished the movie. The only thing I liked was the ending where it ended with "Don't forget to let us know how it ends!". I am really not looking forward to this movie now.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am happy I got this book! I have been waiting for the right moment to see this movie for a long time. The reviews are spot on, it is great, and my husband loved it. I watched it again, and loved it even more. I know the review says it is only an hour long, but it's so much more than that. This movie has so many great scenes, and this book takes you on a journey through the mind of a real person, you'll get to know more about this young man, who was so smart and witty, and it's a wonderful movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are a fan of movies with plot, then this is the movie for you. It has a twist to it, but you know the ending when you get to it. And it makes you think about the last 10 movies you have seen, then try to put them in order and see the point of all the movies in there. The last 10 movie are the ones you really can relate to because you were all in one of those movie with a twist, with twists like a bad game, so why not go in there and have a bad joke? The plot will go from good to bad to the point where you have to laugh, and the plot twists are just hilarious. And then you laugh in your own mind, you don't laugh in the face of those who are angry with you, you laugh behind their backs.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was so bad and so unprofessional. The cinematography was terrible (the main character is a clown) and the acting was horrible. The dialogue and even the songs were awful.   The acting in the film was awful. The movie was more or less about clowns who kidnapped a girl and she went to live with the clowns. However, when the clown has the girl for dinner he tells her she's really his niece, which was a stupid idea to make her fall in love with him. He even calls her "Mama" when the girl's name was supposed to be "Maggie".   Overall, this movie was really stupid and the only redeeming quality is that it has a good song, "What a Wonderful World". I recommend this movie to people who are bored, because it doesn't get any better. (4.5/10)     Fantastic Mr. Fox (9/10; from IMDb) " Mr. Zitner was once a talented cartoonist who now devotes his energy to cartooning books for children. The story follows the adventures of a fox who learns to live in the real world and meet a human girl, and his friends in the process.  The movie was a surprise success when it was released in the United States in 1993.    The film received praise from critics and the public alike, winning a number of awards and nominations, and making more than $100 million worldwide." ( IMDb ) "The film begins in a tiny town called "Newtown" in a rural area of the country, where a small boy named Fox was born to a fox family.  When Fox grows up he wants to follow in his father's footsteps and become a cartoonist.  While trying to sell his picture to a newspaper, Fox's father tells him that he is not a true fox and he should leave his family.    The plot is very simple - to become a true cartoonist, one must "eat an apple."   Once Fox eats the apple, he begins to realize that he has to get to know his friends and family before he can be an artist.  At first, Fox is confused, and doesn't want to spend his time with his friends, but he soon learns that he can only really grow if he has the friendship of his best friend - Mr. Snuffleupagus.  Meanwhile, Fox tries to get back to his
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love this movie, I was happy to see a sequel, and I am disappointed, the new version is even worse.   One thing I do love is that this film is so short, and the story can be read in a couple of minutes.  I like the idea of the main character being a child, but I think he was a little too young to be a kid.  The film starts with a child (the main character) on the run from his mother, he has his father (in the next scene) to be with him, and is looking for his father's killer.  Then we see a scene of a young boy who is on the school bus looking for a boy he knows, and we find out he is a friend of the boy he thinks he is looking, but he is actually looking for the killer. This is followed by a girl who finds out that her husband is having an affair with the other woman.  When she comes home she sees her husband lying on the bed, and her own mother (from the previous scene) is in the bed with them.  She is in love with her husband and she is very much in love.   When her husband dies in a fire, she moves in with a young man, but she finds out he has been lying to her.  Her mother tells her that they will live together as long as she is married, and she gets a divorce.  This leads to a young couple falling in love, and then the main protagonist gets to be the victim of a random crime.  It's just so simple, and yet the idea that she could be a victim is so tragic.  After this movie I really thought that people might watch this film and say that the killer is just a kid, and that's not true.    This film is a real example of a kid who is so afraid of women, and who is in so much pain over her father's death, and this movie showed us a young girl who was so insecure about her sexuality, and had no other men to go to.  What the hell do you think was going through her mind in this movie?   I really liked the idea, but what this movie made me realize was that the story of this film, about a woman who was living alone after losing her husband, and how she ended up in the hands of a killer who seemed to be just a child...was ridiculous. I was really mad
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was okay, but it was just so-so. The movie had a great opening, with a really cool "dinosaur film" in the trailer. It felt like a movie, and at the end, the movie was kind of just like a TV movie that you watch on the couch at home. The main plot was ok, and the characters were great, but the movie didn't have any real "feel" to it. And you can't just watch a movie once and enjoy it. This movie has a nice story to it, but all it had was a good opening and no real payoff. A good movie can always have a good ending, and for a movie that was just kind of an opening to a TV show, it didn't really have much of a climax. I'll give it a 3.5/5.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "This is one of those films where I wanted to yell from the rooftops that it's terrible." - Anonymous (From the reviews I read about the film, there are a couple that are even worse than this film. In the end, this film is a masterpiece. If I had to describe it in one word, I would say "Dirty!   ) "The film stars a talented actor named Tony Goldwyn and features a very sexy, beautiful and sexy woman called Lisa, who does some dirty things to a very dirty man named Max." - A movie review by Anonymous This is my second time watching Dirty Harry, and my third viewing. First time, was more of a snooze than a horror. Now, I'm a fan of The Dirty Dozen series and have had the chance to watch Dirty Harry 3 and 4 several times. I have to admit this one did leave me a little bit underwhelmed. It is basically about two dirty cops, one a bit of a loner, who make an effort to make a good living. The dirty cop in this movie, "Charlie" is a bit eccentric and does a bit more of the dirty deeds. He is a real life version of Harry Callahan. "Lisa" is another Dirty Harry type, and she does much more of her own dirty deeds as well. She is a beautiful woman who is good looking. She's also a bit odd and has a different personality.   She is also a great actress with a great sense of humor. The story was well done and I was actually entertained at times, but ultimately it was just too much.  This movie is really a story about two cops who have a problem with the corrupt and corrupting environment in Chicago. They do their best to clean up the town, but unfortunately, they are caught in the middle of the chaos and the corrupting effects of crime in Chicago, and the dirty cops just keep falling for the dirty, crooked men.    The "dirty" guys in this film are crooked cops, and they just make a living by committing criminal acts on people. They get paid in drugs and in sex. That's how they survive in a town where everyone is a criminal. I'm pretty sure that it was a really funny and entertaining movie at first, and then you remember that all the dirty things you saw in the movie were real.  At the end of the movie, you realize that Charlie

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was so bad it made me want to jump out of my skin. The movie was horrible. I got so depressed after watching it that I had to lay down in bed for two days. The film was full of stupid and ridiculous situations, and when something like that happens it's just wrong. The plot was so ridiculous that even I couldn't take it seriously. It was one thing when it came to the plot and how the movie portrayed it, but the acting and acting choices were so bad that it became absurd. Every scene was full with bad acting, terrible acting, and a lot of cringe. The acting in this movie was just awful, and most of the time it made the movie even worse. The whole movie was ridiculous with bad dialogue and silly dialogues. I don't know what was the reason to use this actor, because he did absolutely nothing to help with the movie. His character was like a mannequin with some stupid dialogue thrown on top of him, but with a face that looks like it was put together from a bunch of random facial hair. The performances in the movie were so much that they could be described as the worst of the worst. The worst of those performances are the two leads. The girl was so much worse than her guy. It would be like if you had a woman who played a dumb blonde chick and put a blonde wig on her and gave her a fake British accent. Just imagine how much funnier the movie would be if her character had some character development. The other leads in this film are terrible as well. I can't imagine how they got hired for this role because it's so terrible. One of them was so far from a role, and he just sounds like a robot with terrible lines. It's like they were just trying to make it appear like they had some kind of chemistry together. At the end of the movie the guys had to leave the theater, and the woman was so emotional about their departure that she broke down and sobbed uncontrollably. When the guys left, there were no applause for them. No, no applause. The guys left. The woman just walked away, broke down, and sobed. The only way that would have been better for her would be for the guys to just leave. So, at the end it all turns out to be a bad idea to hire such a terrible person to play a dumb blond chick, right? I mean, it seems like a terrible idea to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not sure why I'm going to tell you this.   When I went to a movie theater the first time, I had to wait on line to use the restroom. It was kind of a hassle, but I got the chance to see the movie.  The next day, I went back and watched it again in the theater. The popcorn was a little stale, but the movie itself was fine.  It was a comedy with a bad ending, but if I had seen it the night it came out, I would have liked it a lot better.  In summary, it's a bit of a bummer, but it's not bad by any means.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You see, when the big movie comes out in the theatres, they make sure to tell everyone about what was wrong with the film before it was released. If a movie isn't up to par, they will tell everyone it was a disaster, so that people won't see it. The bad reviews are never for a lack of quality, but more so for a certain lack of faith, or a lack the right to criticize. If you go to a movie theater, you are entering into a very safe environment. There are not many people that want to be in a room with a person who isn't a member of the tribe that has been in a movie theatre many times before. And yet, if you do go to the movies and find the movie to be a disaster (like I was with a certain film from last year), you are labeled as a "loser", and you'll be laughed at and ridiculed.   For a movie to really be good, it has to have something going for it. But the people in charge of this movie do not see the good in this movie. Not one. They can't even give the actors a few days off between filming a movie, so what the hell is the point of even doing a movie?   I went in with low expectations, and was let down. The cast looked unprofessional (which I can't blame them for) and they had a poor script.  It was an abysmal film, but the main character looked like a caricature of himself. And a really awful director was hired to give us a film that we could only see in a tiny theatre, and then was able to give this terrible performance.  The writing was a mess, it was like the script had been rewritten in an attempt to make it more appealing to the audience, and as a result, the script took a dive and fell apart completely.  In the end, there was nothing to enjoy in this film. The only thing I really enjoyed was the musical number at the end which was just really annoying.  All in all, I would not recommend watching this film (especially to anyone else, as this is the only review I am going to give it).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  I'm not really an action film guy. I've seen some good action films, but it just never seemed to click with me. The biggest movie I've ever seen was The Fast and the Furious and it was a decent film. I liked it because it had cool cars and it seemed like it was on a bigger screen. I think that one film gave me enough of an appreciation for action films that I had my own copy of The Expendables 2. I watched it with a friend that I'd seen it before and we were pretty pleased with it, so I decided to watch The Raid 2. This film had a really nice soundtrack. I had a hard time listening to it with earbuds in. It really was a great action film. It had a lot of good fight scenes. I enjoyed the film quite a bit. I even liked the ending. I only wish that they did it with the same amount of intensity and excitement that The Raid first had. I didn't like the movie that much, but I did like it and I'm glad that I watched the sequel.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My review of "American Sniper" (directed by Clint Eastwood) is below: The film opens on a clear day in Kuwait, the country of the fictional Tom Cruise and Chris Kyle, the "American Patriot" of this film. This is one of those films that, for most, is so easy to believe that it is true. There are so many shots of American soldiers at a football game, the air in the cinematograph hall is thick with the smell of cologne and oil, there are explosions and fireballs. The scene with the men being interrogated is actually shot in Iraq by an Iraqi in a cage, but it looks like something from a movie. When the first sniper starts firing at Tom Cruise, his reaction, which he does, is simply and exactly like when he shoots an enemy at a distance, with a shot in the head that makes him fall. I have to admit that I would not call this film the "best" in terms of the plot but it is the best for the acting. The movie is about Tom Cruise. The whole movie is only about Tom. It is not about Chris Kyle or anyone else, it is Tom, because that is who is the main character of the movie, and in fact he becomes the protagonist for most of the film. "American sniper" is the film which is most like a drama in which Tom Cruise is the protagonist. We find out this information in the beginning of the scene when Tom Cruise's brother (Michael Caine) is talking with his wife and says that the whole family has been to Iraq and the son has never been to the US before. But Tom was born and raised in Texas, so this must mean something to him. Tom's wife (Emily Blunt) wants to know what the purpose of this trip is, to which Tom replies that he has been given orders to do a reconnaissance mission at the airport in Kuwait and return to the United States and that he is expected to stay there for three weeks, for a long tour. Tom tells his wife that he will be staying at the American base and that they will take care of him if he is in any trouble. The wife is shocked and thinks it is all a joke, because no soldier will ever go to Kuwait. She is also curious why Tom is visiting his home town, because the movie is shot there but the town never appears on the screen and I believe that this film does not tell us the whole story. Tom is a good

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The Good:  I'd say that this is the best movie by the same director, which is pretty damn impressive.   It is funny, with some real good dialog in the movie, and it's filled with funny people.  It has its own quirky humor that I like.  The story is pretty good, and the acting is pretty solid.  However, it suffers a little from having to do a lot with the same idea.  We have a guy, played by a pretty good guy, whose friend is dating his sister.  They go out a lot and when they don't talk to each other, he is left alone with her.  There is a love triangle (which I won't discuss in depth, since I've never read any of the books)  The girl is also dating another guy, and she wants to know more about his life.  They try to hide it from each other.  He does get a bit jealous when he realizes she hasn't asked him out, so he starts thinking about it, which puts a strain on their relationship, but it works out in the end.  Finally, we get to find out what exactly the guy has to deal with while he's dating his niece.  I found myself liking this character, and I'm glad I got to see her story through.  She's not bad, and he doesn't do a bad job of portraying her. The Bad:  The bad is that the movie doesn't live up to it's title.  This movie has a lot to say, but the ending really isn't that great.  So, there's a lot of mystery left in the story, and if that was really the movie's main thing, that could have been fine, but I'm not sure that was the director's intention.  After all, the first movie made it seem like all of the problems were solved, and there wasn't anything else to keep the characters going.  But in this movie, we learn that she's still a virgin and that their father was the one who made her stay in the attic (and that is where we meet her uncle).  He doesn't have a great relationship with her, and when we learn about his past, it makes him seem even worse, which kind of ruins what should have been a very good relationship.  Maybe it's just because of the director, but when you watch it, it feels like the ending
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can't recommend this movie to anybody! This movie is the worst of the horror films that was released during the 80's. It is horrible and there are NO redeeming features that the audience can really enjoy. The cast of the movie has no personality, the story is horrible, the plot is not realistic and the acting is so bad, you just want to take your shoes off! The horror genre has many great films that are worth watching, but this movie was not one of them! I saw this movie when it was in theaters, because I was curious. I saw it once, and then I saw some movies on DVD that I never saw before and this one made me say "what is that?". I did not think this movie is one of the worst horror films, but I'm glad I watched it. It was one of those movies that I will always remember because it has a unique atmosphere and it was really scary. I did like it for its unique atmosphere. It has a good storyline. The acting is really bad in this movie. There is really no personality for any of the cast members. The only actor I liked in the movie was Tom Savini, I can't believe I never liked him before. He has a very good creepy/creepy feeling. The movie was really hard to watch and I was really scared for about five minutes, but then the movie started to go downhill. This movie has one of best endings of all the horror movies. It's a really sad ending to the movie and it gives you an idea of how sad this movie really is. You have a good ending to a really bad movie!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would like to say that   this movie   was a pleasant film, in the way you'd expect a "funny" movie to be, but it wasn't fun. The jokes were all pretty simple, and it was easy to laugh at. The character interactions were not very good.   There's a lot of "fool me once, shame on me" type characters.  I found most of them really funny, but sometimes they were hard to tell what the characters were thinking.  There was also a lot (but not all) of  I've never liked the character design in this movie. The main characters look really funny in their various incarnations, but  this was all in the service of comedy.  My wife said that it reminded her of the old TV shows where there was a guy and a girl, and the guy was supposed to be a big guy (like Tom Selleck) and the girl was supposed  to be the small person (like Rosie O'Donnell) and they had this "fun" competition to see who could see into the other person's mind.  The two main characters in this were the only ones that were fun to watch. I've read somewhere that they are supposed to represent the   main characters of the book.  They didn't look like the characters in the book (which I found funny) and I had to be looking for them, especially during one scene when one of them was standing next to the door in the middle of the scene and it became apparent to me that she wasn't supposed to have a body.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The reason people think this movie is terrible is due to the fact that it's the first film of this year that doesn't involve a character's death.   This is the same reason I can't take the fact Quentin Tarantino was the only filmmaker to work on this film.  For those who do not know, Tarantino is no stranger to death scenes and gore.  But even with a character death, this movie would still be considered a very good film because its focus on the family and the love they have for each other.  I am in no way a big Tarantino fan, but I think this film would still stand out on this list regardless because of the amazing performances and the emotional connection the film has between all the characters.  Another thing I would like to point out is the incredible way the movie manages to convey the emotions of these characters. I felt so bad for everyone involved and how much they had been through.  After finishing this film, I felt a huge sense of relief and a tremendous amount of love.  Unfortunately for my self, I couldn't find any way to make it more intense for this review.  This movie is a very sad film, and it does make you think.  It also gives you a sense of what a real love between two people can do to them.  Even if you have never seen a film before and you do not like any of the characters, this is still a good film that I would recommend.  My recommendation for you is to watch it on a big screen and if you feel like you need something to do, come over to my house and I will show you the film and maybe even play it for you.  Final Rating:  I give this film a B- Good Movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For a lot of people this is a good movie, but for me it is one of the worst I've seen. In a great scene a friend of mine (who was visiting the city at the time) who lived with me for three months said, "You have no idea how bad this is." After that scene the movie changed. It felt like a horrible drug-fuelled party with the whole house full of people with no interest in one another. The music was loud, everyone kept looking around at each other, and every time someone said something it was "You got it wrong" or "You can't understand!" People were shouting, cursing at each another and generally acting like a bunch of kids on drugs. I mean, I'm an adult and I didn't go to the party, but how could a movie be more anti-social than a party where people just don't talk to each other? I was shocked to find out this is an entirely fake movie and I got in trouble for telling someone about it!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the most common complaints about film is its length. While I can understand how this might seem an arbitrary choice, in reality, the longer the film, the more likely it is to be an enjoyable experience. There are two important factors that influence how long a film will be. The first is the plot. The more interesting the story, the better. The second is the director. As we all know, the director is responsible for shaping the plot, the story's style, and the overall tone of a film. In general, the less a director can manipulate his film, his less likely it will be to fall short in the long run. There is some leeway that can be afforded, however. As long as a director is a competent filmmaker, and can keep his or her story on point, a film can be cut very short without seriously affecting the film's quality. There will always be a limited amount of film to work with. This is why the original "King Kong" and "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" were cut to a shorter runtime. In a sense, a longer film is simply a more effective way of telling a story. In this case, this is especially true for a film like "The Goonies." With a cast of hundreds, the sheer quantity of people involved with the production necessitates an immense amount of talent. This does not bode well for a limited run film. The longer a film is, the harder it is for audiences to stay interested in the same characters. In many cases, the filmmakers have to use a "tweak" to inject new life into an old story. This often happens with "The Thing" (1982), "Return of the Living Dead" (1985), "Predator" (1987), and "Star Wars" (1977). With "Goonies," the filmmakers could cut the film considerably shorter without losing any of its power or excitement. By reducing the film to its fundamental elements, the filmmaking team would be able to tell a great story in a less constrained amount of time. I would argue that "The Shining" (1980), one of the greatest horror films ever made, is one of, if not the best example of a very short, but effective horror film. I could not think of a better example of how a short film can not only be entertaining and suspenseful, but it can have an actual influence on the story. "The Last Temptation of Christ" (1993

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    We are going to get a great deal with a great actor!   He is an actor I have always been looking forward to.   I am not only looking forward but ready to buy an engagement ring for him.  The movie he has in the works is "The Magnificent Seven" and he has done such a great job in that one.  He will be playing the role of a sheriff in the western.  This was a very enjoyable movie.  It had its good and its bad. The good part was that the movie really had a story to it.  But as for the bad part it was quite obvious that this movie was made to do a lot of things.  They do a very good job with the action scenes.  So why is he not on this site?  It is because of these people:   The cast:  The plot:  The plot of "The Great Outdoors" was to tell how there was a feud between a tribe of seven who lived in the mountains of western Nevada and the town of Tobe.    This feud had always been raging between the two groups but due to some mysterious things that happened a few years ago the two tribes decided to unite.    One day a group of seven men come back into town and find that everything has been destroyed.  Then a week later they find out that all of the seven men that were in town that day have been killed.  The man responsible for all this was a rancher named Gaff.  Once Gaff was defeated, the seven would take back what was theirs.  When the eight men of the seventh came back they found that the seven were gone and their camp was ruined.     They decided that the best thing that they could do is to go back to the mountain where they were born.  While on their journey they would find the seven brothers who lived there and take back their gold and silver.   When they arrived in the mountain they found the town.   They also found that Gaff had returned to Tobe and he was angry.  His men had been killed and the tribes were fighting each other.  Now the men were in a bad situation because they wanted to go home to their families but Gaff wanted revenge.   The men were determined to win and they were going to do it by any means necessary.   There was one woman in town named Betty who wanted to be alone and get back
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      It feels like a movie that was made to fill a quota, and was done so well, there was no reason to try and make the film better.    This movie was the first in a trilogy and would go on to star two other stars.  The acting was weak.  I found the lead, Robert Redford, to be a little underwritten and his wife, Jennifer Jason Leigh, was also underwritten. I would have liked to see more from these two. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     It's not like I hate it.   It's not that great, but it's not bad.  This movie does not really do much of anything.  The plot is just that, a plot.  And while it's interesting to see how this group of kids become involved with each other, there are no real story development, and it's hard to care.  It was definitely a movie you would expect to be "dramatic" (which is usually how bad movies are made).  But I guess that's all there is to say about that.  I won't say more.  There is a song playing during the credits and I'll tell you this, I'm sorry, but I felt like I was watching a low budget indie movie.  As for the acting, I don't even know what to say.  They play all the characters and they are all very uninteresting.  For example, there is a scene where one of the main characters is being tortured in a torture chamber and this guy looks like a big middle aged guy who just got out of the slammer.  That guy is going to torture kids in the future.   He's just so boring.  So much for being cool. As for music, it does not bother me much.  Some of the songs I found to be pretty decent.  Other songs are just generic pop and rock.  In the end, it's nothing special and it is hard to enjoy this movie.   However, I will say that the movie is not very dark and that is always good.  Maybe it's just that I saw this movie at a time when I was on the edge of my seat and I don;t like to be on the edges.  My only concern was with the ending.   I won;t say anything about it other than that it was abrupt and rushed.   The ending, I am sure, was to save money and not to impress anyone.  At least the music wasn't anything special.  Again, it was just a bad film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    *   +   This is a new series of blog entries, this one is about a book I wrote a few years ago. I'm hoping that by putting it out there, the book will inspire others to write about their own experiences with negative experiences in a movie or TV show. I wrote it in response to an email I received from an ex-friend of mine, who I had dated for a while. We had a tumultuous break-up and it seemed like a lot of bad things happened during the time I dated her, but I never actually saw or heard about the details of those things until after she had broken up with me. I knew from her emails, and from reading her books, that she had experienced a lot, and I wondered if there were things she was just not telling me or didn't remember about the relationship. I wanted to give her the opportunity to tell her side of the story, and to also have a chance to vent about her feelings about it all. I don't claim to know everything about this relationship, but it sounds like she's a very sensitive and empathetic person, so I think we're both on the right path. And I want to be able to offer the same kind of support and understanding when people tell me about their past relationships. It's very hard to write a positive book review about someone's bad experience with a movie, but writing about one's good experience in that situation is easier. The good news is, I do know what my friend is talking about.   -   *  +  *  - I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that most people reading this blog probably have at least one movie, TV show, or book that they would not recommend to a friend. That's okay! People are capable of just as much denial as I am when it comes to what's true. You can't get away from it. It takes time to grow up. It is easy to get caught up in the "gotcha" mentality of life and not recognize that others are just as capable of screwing up. I think it's good to acknowledge that there are always going to be people in the world who can't deal with reality. We need to accept that and work to help the people around us. This is especially important in relationships, especially romantic ones. So when my friend wrote me to say that she felt like she'd been cheated on,

This is not a movie about a person who has stroke.  It is more of a movie with a stroke in it.  The movie tries to be more than it really is.  I love the movie. The cast of characters are all great.  Even the villains are very well written.  This movie is a great comedy and it does a great job at it. The only thing I dislike about this is it's terrible ending.  Please if you are going to see this movie and don't know much about the stroke movie then you should watch it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You know the drill. "I have seen this before"   "It was so bad!"   I like to think that you'll get the gist of the reviews, which are all about how bad it was, how lame it was.   This is, unfortunately, not unique. There are tons of films that are terrible, but no one is even bothering to write a positive review about it because of how bad they think it is.  I will say that it has a great "plot" and a really great cast.  Yes, they're terrible, and this is a horrible movie, but it was made at a time when they didn't have a lot of money, and I think that is part of the problem. I've always felt that it was very much a case of "they were on a budget."   Why the heck did they need the kids to be so stupid? Why don't they just put a different cast in it?   What's with the fake movie titles?  I just can't understand this movie.  It has got to be the worst movie ever. Why do they ever do that?  But there's just something about the cast that I just feel is off.  They have no clue what they are doing.  Why would they go through all this trouble to make it look like a real movie instead of an animated movie?  The whole thing is lame, and it is made in the 90s.  This movie is nothing like the movie it is based on.  The ending is just horrible. I'm so disappointed in this movie, and the fact that I never got to see it when it was on TV is so very sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There were so many problems with this movie. It was terrible. The first time I saw it I was really disappointed because it looked like it was supposed to be a really funny comedy. It really wasn't a joke at all. It seemed to be more like a horror movie than a comedy. The scenes with the characters were cheesy and it didn't have any humor in the movie. The acting was really bad. Some of the actors were so bad I didn't know if they were just doing it to get the part or were actually trying to act bad. Also, the dialogue was really annoying. It sounded like the actors said it backwards, or something. I was so frustrated with the movie and the acting. I almost didn't watch it because I was sick of movies like this. But after I watched it a second time I was like "Hey, this is a little bit different". After watching it a third time I felt like I had been there. So here I am trying to review it. What else can I say? The movie was terrible, but at least it had some heart. It had some good ideas that didn't come together very well. It also gave me a big laugh and I was just happy to see a film where someone was not forced to do something bad or something they didn't want to. It's just a terrible movie. I don't know how they could make a movie like this after seeing this one. I really don't get it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My thoughts on this movie: I am a huge fan of the original Ghostbusters and the sequel, Ghostbusters II. When I heard that they were going to be remaking the original, I was excited to see it. I'm not a big fan of remakes and remakes are really bad, but I thought this remake would be good. I was wrong. This movie does not live up to the original. It's all downhill from there. The movie is a mess. I couldn't care less about the characters, the plot, the setting, or anything else. The director, Paul Feig, and the writers, Katie Dippold and Katie Dworkin, decided to just throw anything they could at the wall to see what stuck. The result is the film that is more like a crappy fan movie than anything else you would ever watch. The story is completely ridiculous. The ghosts, which are supposed to be real, are really made up (they come from a pool of ectoplasm, which is apparently a supernatural pool that's made of slime, and it supposedly contains all of the paranormal stuff). The ghosts don't know how to act like they're real. There are multiple characters that are made up as if they weren't real, which makes it even more laughable and unbelievable. You will not be able to suspend your disbelief in this movie. It's the least interesting film I have ever seen. I really thought that the original movie was very funny, but this movie is ridiculous. It goes beyond what any of the Ghostbusters would do, and actually makes it seem silly. Even the original ghost-busting team, the original Ghostbusters, is completely ignored. In the original film, the Ghostbusters worked together as a team and worked with each other and with the government to stop supernatural threats. This film doesn't make much sense. It has a villain, the spirit world and an evil scientist all on top of it. You have to think that the ghosts must be powerful, since they're trying to take over the world and a ghost can only come out of an open window. I don't even care how powerful the ghosts are, the fact that they don't make a difference doesn't matter. This is a poor example of how to write a script. The writers just threw whatever they could think of and not much care about what they put in it. The cast is mostly the same: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a terrible movie that I hate. It is a very generic action flick with nothing new to it, which is a shame because it is good for what it is.   The acting is just not very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So, I'd say the quality of this was pretty much on par with the quality I was expecting with the movie. The art style was nice. They tried to do a little more with the colors than the manga did. The CGI was nice and made the characters pop and moved. The story wasn't original but had a lot of potential. I guess with the time that has passed, the script and story became stale. It had a nice ending, though. The characters were the same boring and shallow. I never got invested in them. All of them had the same trait:  Sick.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I finished this film I got so angry.   The character that I loved so much (her character) went from being a beautiful young woman to a very dark, dangerous woman.  As if she was really evil (and you could tell she was, because the people around her were evil, too.  But she didn't deserve it, she was very much a human, and she was just a victim of her circumstances.  Her love for her family made her do horrible things.  And to think, she wanted a man.  This film is NOT just for the girls, the men and anyone who likes to watch horror movies.  It really makes you mad at the world when you see people going through what she was going through.  I don't watch horror films as often as I should because sometimes they are so scary, but I would not recommend this film to people who don't want to watch a scary movie, and for people who do watch horror, it is a very good film and I would recommend it to you.  If you want a good film to watch and not a bad film, this is it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I was very excited about this one, it is the first in the series and I have seen all four (but I am just now starting on #1) so I figured it was going to be a fun ride. The movie is very fun and I think it is a great movie, but for some reason they chose to play it a bit too safe and make it more of a romantic film. I mean I love romance but we all know that movies are supposed to have a little danger and a little excitement, and this one didn't, so this wasn't my favorite movie. I don't know, it wasn't bad at all but I'm not sure what they were thinking."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm actually kind of disappointed that I didn't give this movie a better score. The worst movie of the year so far. For a movie that is supposedly based on a true story, this movie is terrible. The entire story is pretty unoriginal and even the concept is so stupid and awful that it's laughable. I would really just skip this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the case of "Star Wars", the negatives far outweigh the positives and the film is a piece of trash. It may have been made for the Star Wars movie series, but it is a film without substance. It is simply a series of jump scares and cheesy one-liners. There are many reasons why this film is considered a classic: the opening credits, the film's visual flair, the incredible fight scenes and, of course, Darth Vader as the evil Emperor. All of these aspects are great, but they have been used too often to give "Star War" the credibility it deserves. It seems that the filmmakers have learned nothing from the first movie and are trying to duplicate everything. "Star WARS" does not have enough personality, it lacks the good-versus-evil and it has the worst effects ever seen in a blockbuster film. I am not the first person to criticize the "Star Trek" films, but I will be the last. This is a terrible film that is just a cheap money grab with a bunch of cheesy one liners that should have been cut out at the start of production. A terrible film, not a good one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What would you be happy to see in a movie?   If it was a good movie: This one was pretty good. It's very funny and the writing is great. But it's too long. I feel like I got bored after about half way, and I wanted something to do. And you can see the story is going nowhere. It could have been a comedy with the characters of some other movie. If it were a bad one: I was really bored the whole time. And I don't know if I even liked some of the characters. I think they were too cheesy. They didn't feel real. And the ending was kind of cheesy. If I had to give a spoiler, the film ends after a really long time and everyone is left wondering what happened next. I just want to finish it, but that ending would make me cry. This was a great movie, but I don "t have anything to say. There are so many movies out there I want to see. You "re probably familiar with some of them, but this is a good film to check out. I'm glad you had fun with it, I don 't have the heart to kill you. It has some really good moments but I think there was a better way to finish the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A good bad movie can bring back memories of a good good movie from my childhood, but the memories are ruined by the lack of an enjoyable movie. There are many of them, but it is hard to get in the mood to watch a movie about an old man who was married to a man named Fred (or Frede or something like that) and he just moved on in life and got a job and never really took care of his daughter (who had no mother). He died after he got into a car accident with a drunken woman and all he really had left was his wife and daughter.   The film starts with a dead man being shown on TV and his daughter crying out "Mommy, help me, Daddy's gone" and the film then cuts to a montage of a funeral, the police officer looking on, a man with a shovel and a woman crying and saying "I'm going to take him with me" and she was crying because her father is dead.  There is no plot, just a monty on the funeral with a few scenes of people getting into cars and driving off.  Then they cut to a woman named Anna, who is walking down the street holding a picture of her father.  She is talking to a friend who tells her she has a beautiful picture of him. Anna then tells this friend that she has his picture, but he isn't here and she is afraid he is gone. She is then visited by a priest named Father Maris.  Maris goes through the funeral, looks into the room where his daughter's remains are and sees Anna crying. The priest tells Anna that he has had a vision of her, showing her with her daughter, and Anna runs home crying. Maris then shows Anna that her daughter is still alive but is still waiting for her father to come home.  The next shot shows the priest's car running over the corpse of his dead daughter, while another man is heard screaming in agony. Marius calls Anna and she tells him that her husband and the priest are gone and that her father was waiting for him to come back and now he's gone.  He goes back to the scene where he saw Anna crying and tells Anna he doesn't know how he can go on living without her, and tells her he's waiting for his wife to be back.  Anna tells him she can't, and he tells her "I don't know either."  At the end of the film Anna
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For those of you who have never seen the movie, or for those of us who have seen it, this is a terrible movie. There are some good parts to it, particularly the music, and some funny moments, and the final ending is brilliant. However, for a movie like this to be made is truly an atrocity. The actors have no chemistry, and it's painfully obvious that the director has no understanding of what the actors are supposed to do, because even though the script tells us that it's a comedy, all of the comedy comes off as ham-fisted, and unearned. It's just so...wrong, and there are too many moments that should have been cut out, or even removed entirely. The best thing about the movie is the music. It starts off strong and gets progressively worse, and while I think that it works, the movie itself is just a bad, sad mess. This is a movie I would not recommend, unless you really like a bad show, and want to watch some good music while you do it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The second movie I saw with this group was the horror movie called 'Gremlins II'.  It was the third film with this crew and it wasn't much better than the first. The movie wasn't even scary or scary in a fun way. The characters were all very bland and nothing really happened and everything was very repetitive.   If I thought I had seen that many films with a bunch of people dressed in clown costumes I would have thought this crew was some weird circus act. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When the movie was first released I was very excited to see this movie, but I have to say, I was disappointed in this movie. It had everything going for it. The cast is great. The story is awesome. The animation is amazing. The music is great, but the plot is a mess. The characters aren't memorable at all. The plot doesn't make sense, the villain is really boring. It makes you think this movie was rushed, and they made the wrong choice. I have not seen the series, but from what I have heard the movie has similar plot issues to the series. The character designs are really weird. The design of the character is very similar to the characters from the anime. The voices of the characters are terrible. It doesn't help that the movie ends with a really weird ending. The art was decent, but nothing to write home about. This movie is just not a good movie. Just watch the anime or the series first. The anime is better by far, and the series is a great series.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was great...until...the third act. It was ok, I guess...until the last 30 minutes. The movie is about a group of boys, and their secret...and love...and desire to go out to the woods to fight. (Yes, that's a theme. In fact, this movie has that theme all over the place.) The first half of the movie was awesome! They were all friends and playing video games, when a boy named Jeff who just graduated says, "You guys should go see what's on the other side of the hill." Everyone goes, except for Eric. Eric's not interested, and he's really scared of the forest. He wants to go home and get a job. It turns out the woods have a hidden cave, and there's a group, and the boys will kill to be part of them. What was great about this movie was that the movie felt more real than a lot of horror movies. The boys just wanted to go and play in the woods. It wasn't about zombies, or demons, or whatever. It's just them being kids. What I found scary was the movie's ending. I thought the last few minutes were not good at all. They seemed like they were trying to be sooo funny and sooo scary, but they didn't work. I felt like the movie tried to have too much going on, and couldn't concentrate on the story. It all seemed a bit rushed and rushed, and not good for a movie like this. This is one of those movies that I would watch again, but it wasn't good enough.  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was surprised to read someone who is a filmmaker or at least a film buff saying that there were some problems with The Man Who Would Be King. The guy had a film that he has seen over and over. It's a good movie, but he has made his opinion known and that can be a big problem when it comes to some filmmakers' opinions and what they see in the films.  I am going to give the guy some credit, he is aware of some things, even if it is his opinion on what he saw. However, if you are going to have a review about the movie, make sure you check out what others had to say. In this movie, the director makes a few errors of his own and in my opinion, that would be an issue. The pacing, which was slow, made the film a little harder to follow. If you don't know how this movie ended, then this could be a little confusing for you. This movie is a good film, but it does have its faults. I give it a 2.5 out of 10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "It's like a black movie without any black characters" So, I'm a black guy. It is my nature to go where the blacks are. In a way, I get it. Black people are underrepresented in Hollywood. I don't mean that to be derogatory or disparaging. It's just the truth. We don't really get to show our faces in those big budget movies. But Hollywood doesn't care about us. So I'm going to make my own movies about black people and use the resources I have to make them as good as they possibly can. I'm also going to find my own black actors. I've already cast my first black actor, and I'll soon cast more. In the meantime, I'll be trying to do a black version of The Color Purple. So far I think it has the potential to be very successful. It does feel like a more mature film than the original. The color of the dress of the girl in The Color of My Life is a very bright color. And the girl is a little more black than the color purple. But I think if you watch both films side by side, there's no difference.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Review of a movie: The first review I read about "Goonies" was written by "Nerds' Guide to the Galaxy," so that might have influenced my opinion of the movie. "Gooey the Goonies" is a very funny, very silly, very endearing little movie. It's got an original screenplay by Don Bluth, with music by John Candy, music by Michael Menken, and singing by Cher. I think a lot of the people that made the movie probably wanted to do something like this. This is actually a "movie for kids." It is a goofy, very funny movie. The Goonies are just like us -- we don't understand anything. But we have a lot in common with them.  The main characters of the Goonies are Roxy, Mikey, and Daffy, who are a group of kids that live on a beach in Goofyland, Florida. They have a "Goeson" (a spaceship) with a green light on it, which means that they can go anywhere they want, and nobody is going to stop them. One day, the Goons go to a store where Mikey finds a toy that his mother used to have for him. The toy is the googly eye. They go back to the beach, and the three of them have a really big fight. Mikey is really into this eye toy, and he tries to get Daff the Gooby (Mikey's dog) to like it as well. They steal the toy and it gets stuck in a tree. After they get it out of the tree, they try to take it to the next town, but Daff can't see. They start to get lost, and they end up at a zoo where all the animals have goggles on their eyes. They make a plan to go to another town, and leave the other Goons in the zoo. The plan fails, and now Mikey thinks that Daff has got a googly on him too. Mike tries to go after him, but he is stopped by his "sibling," Telly, who has a goggle. They all get out of that zoo, and after the fight, they go back home. Roxy and Telly take the googlies home to their dad. After Mikey and Daphne have a little fight, Telly goes back to his father, and Roxy has a little
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of my favorite scenes in the movie is in the diner where everyone is eating popcorn in the middle of the day. In this scene all the girls are drinking coffee and all are enjoying their day. When a guy starts chatting up a girl at the counter she starts giggling and trying to get out of the conversation, so the guy turns on the charm and starts asking her if she's up for sex. The girl has to hold back her tears and ask him "why, why would you say something like that?". Then the guy looks at her and says, "You were the one in the dress". This movie really hits home the point that you're not in charge of your own mind and that there are certain things you cannot control. It also gives you a feeling that if this movie was about real life, that the guys would've been arrested for rape because of how many women said they liked the movie. I think the movie does a really good job of showing that men need to watch themselves too and that a little bit of flirtation or a good old "pussy" can turn into something so much more. Overall, if you have a girlfriend, or if you're a female in a relationship with a guy that doesn't respect her, this movie is for you.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I hate movies.   They are the worst kind of evil.  But they can be great, too.  I am very fond of comedies and this one falls a little short.  It is not funny.  This is a very pretentious, pretentious movie.  There is nothing funny about it.    It is full of stupid people.   The movie is full a nonsense.   I hate that so many people have seen it and hate myself for liking it.   It has very little to say, which is the only reason I enjoyed it. I felt like I had to laugh because the movie was so silly.    Why did I enjoy it?     To be honest, I do not think it has much to say.  And it is pretty much perfect.  The movie makes no attempt to be anything more.  They just try to make a funny movie out of a boring subject.  The movie was very pretentious and overlong I liked how the movie went on for days I do not like this kind of movie And I was not amused at all This movie was ridiculous I liked it less than the original It was a bad idea for me to like it Why would anyone watch this?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        I saw  The Big Short  on the big screen and it was great.   I like the movie because it really did have a lot of the core principles of what makes a good investing movie.   If you are new to investing and haven't heard the name Paul Singer yet, I would recommend you give it a try.   He has some great investment ideas and I can't wait to see if they work out.   It's a pretty straightforward story with some great performances.   I enjoyed The Big short  very much, but it was a little disappointing to be honest.   The movie doesn't have the depth of a great classic movie such as It's A Wonderful Life.   The screenplay was so bad that the ending was predictable and you just know this is the end.   But then again it is so hard to do a classic movie right and it will take years to get it right.   We will get there though. You can watch the trailer here. It's A Wizard (2000)   The Wizard of Oz  is such a classic and a great movie. I still feel a bit emotional watching it after all these years.   One of the most important things to remember is that Dorothy was a woman.   She wasn't a man like the lion or the man in the yellow hat.   As a matter of fact she had a child in the end of the movie. The original was so much more than a movie. It was a way for women to experience and enjoy a movie for the first time.   Dorothy was never one to complain, but she wasn't one to go out of her way to be happy either.   For most people it was the woman who got to be the heroine.   That's a lot better than just being the heroine without a character. A woman who would be happy. I really liked this movie because of how well it worked with Dorothy.   From the very beginning she wanted to go home because she didn't want to go to Oz.   In the original you can tell the way in which her mother tries to stop her.   After all she was the only child of her father who was a farmer.   You could even feel the difference in their roles.   Both men were trying to make a living and the women had to take care of their children.   Also it was so interesting that there was a girl that wanted to leave home for one
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the major weaknesses of this film, is that it is a straight-forward, run-of-the-mill "horror movie". There is no "gory" element of the film, there is no gore, but there is plenty of "torture porn". The film also features a girl named Nettie, whose only role is to be tortured and raped by the two men (played by Peter MacNicol and Robert Wagner). The film does a good job at showing the brutality of the story, but the film is not as exciting as it could have been. The film's ending does not leave the viewer with any "satisfaction", and the way that it ends, is so abrupt and over-the top, that it completely ruins the film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so bad I have to do a movie review in which I say that the badness is so strong that even the good parts are bad. For instance: 1) The movie opens with a very, very brief and vague shot of a car crash, then cuts back to the woman's car, then back to her, and then we see a man in a hoodie standing over her with a shotgun. What the hell is he doing there, what is the message? What is he after? (What if he was after her daughter? If he was, why would she have been on the freeway, and why would he be shooting from a moving car?)  2) The woman drives down the freeway into oncoming traffic and is then killed in an accident. This is the second vehicle accident in the movie. And while this is happening, a child is being dragged down a hill.  3) The guy (or guys) who is in the hoodie with a gun is in some other car, and the kid in the road is also in that car. There are other cars racing down the road. A cop car and two ambulances are just about to stop a car for a busted taillight. The movie skips to this cop car at the intersection in a very long shot. I don't know what they're doing.   4) After this crash, the woman drives her car to a house and puts her daughter in a car seat. She then drives the car home, where she gets into the shower and then goes to sleep, and in the middle of the night, the car gets a flat tire. What are they doing here?  5) At the funeral for her daughter, the kid is sitting in the back of the car with a stuffed bunny on his lap.  6) This is followed by a couple more brief shots of cars racing up and down the highway.  There is a scene of a couple of characters standing on a street corner and another couple walking down the street in a rainstorm.    So here's the big question:  What do we do with this movie?  You can't simply say, "Oh, it's just a bad flick." Because every movie is a bad film, but only a bad one. But is it bad? Is it so bad that it's not worthy of our attention? No, I think not.  When I see movies
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really love the movie and thought it was a well made film. However, the movie was very poorly directed. The music was not that good, it was very cheesy and uninspired. This movie is so bad that I have been crying ever since I watched it. And the ending was so bad, I do not even know how to explain it. What a bad ending! I will definitely not be seeing this movie again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film was crap from beginning to end. The plot is weak and the acting is all very wooden. The film is just boring and is almost un-watchable. If you want a horror movie you can watch this or any other trashy movie. There is not much originality to it, and it will be more fun with a good bottle of Scotch. This is the sort of movie that should be left on repeat on repeat.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie:   "Memento," a French/British crime thriller, is a bit of a mess. The main character, a doctor who is dealing with the death of his wife, tries to put his past, his memories, and his feelings for his wife to rest in the only way he can. And that is by committing the most horrible crime: He shoots his wife. And he has to live with the guilt and the shame. The story is told in the third person, which is a little weird, but I understand the logic. The only way to get through it, is to see the characters as if they were really there. The acting: The acting here is pretty atrocious. Some of it is just atrocious, like the actress (Nastassja Kinski) who plays the wife. I wouldn't say that the film is too bad, since it has a decent amount of action sequences, and the plot is fairly good. The movie is just so rushed, with a lot of scenes cut for time. The editing is just terrible. For instance, a scene in the movie is a great three minute sequence that involves a few key characters, which are all shot with an extremely wide shot, and then cut to the other characters. The way the camera is used makes it difficult to tell who is who. Even though the editing of the movie makes it seem as though it is all happening in one shot, it is actually a sequence of shots, that have been split into three scenes. The shooting technique that the director uses here is actually pretty interesting, but in the end, he just ruins it. Summary:  What's a good movie to watch with a friend when you are bored:  "Crazy Rich Asians." "The Last Jedi."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If there was a way to get that feeling at the beginning of the film, but still enjoy it throughout, it'd be hard to complain, but a majority of the movie is pretty dull as a whole.   The only memorable character is the male, but he really does just seem to be there for his sex appeal and for the sake of the plot.   It's also really difficult to care about the main female, she just sort of fades into the background, or more accurately, she's the last in the movie to act any kind of meaningful, human character.   Her only purpose is to serve the other characters and to have sex with them, and she never really develops her own identity beyond this, so the ending was pretty much a complete letdown.   There is a whole scene in the beginning where she goes into this sex-deprived state where you don't even really know where the plot's going.   I guess it's a good way to show that a woman is only as good as her other women, which would explain why she'd have sex with the bad guy in the end.   But that's the only good part of the whole film. So here are some other things to note about this movie:   The music is really good, and it fits really well with the mood of the scene.   This is probably the best musical score I've heard in a porn movie since the music for "Gang Bang Girl" (which I think I mentioned in my previous review).   It sounds a lot more like music you'd find in a music video, with some of the songs actually making a little sense.   My favorite part of this movie is when the guys are about to get their ass fucked by the two hot girls.   When that scene was on, I was dying, I could not take it.   They just did not get it, it really made me feel like they were a lot older than their age should have allowed.   A lot of these guys are very good looking and have good personalities, but not even one of them could make this scene go right, and one of the hottest girls in the film has no problem being the only woman there.   Some of the girls are just so hot, and that's a rare and cool sight for a porn scene. I'm going to end this review here, because it really is about time that I put this movie out of my life
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I will admit, when it came out in 2010, the movie was kind of cheesy and silly. The actors were trying their hardest, but the script and dialogue were too dry for my taste. The movie is still really bad, but I can see where the filmmakers were coming from. I did see the remake. The acting is better and the movie is much more coherent. I just don't understand why there is a new version of this movie. It is just as bad as the original. Not a fan.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        A lot of critics have complained about the dialogue in this movie, I'm not sure why. I have to admit, some of the lines were good, but they weren't all that great. There was one line that I really liked:  "Ain't it the truth?  We're all just human beings."   I feel like every year at this point I hear about the "blacklist" of directors that are "bad" (I don't want to call this a negative because I agree with you). I always thought of those lists as being made up of the worst directors, but some people are just bad at their jobs. There is definitely an awful lot of awful movies out there. A lot of good movies get passed over because they didn't quite do it for some critics and fans. There are lots of bad movies. If you're not seeing a lot of movies, then you're probably missing a lot. I am certainly not seeing enough movies and you might be too. But sometimes I want to make it a point to watch something I feel like I should see.   I will admit, the best movies often get overlooked because they just don't do it in their own way. So, if you like great stories and beautiful visual storytelling, then I recommend you check this one out. I'm surprised that this one was released in theaters, because a lot like it is quite violent, with lots of strong scenes of sex and violence.  A film I really enjoyed!   It looks like it would have been a great film, if it had been made in the early 1900's.  I'm sure there are still people who enjoy this movie. I saw it on opening weekend and I couldn't get enough of it! I have heard that this movie has some really good sequels and I hope to see some of them!  Came out and bought it again after I saw the reviews. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     (This post contains spoilers for The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and The Hunger games: Mockingjay )  This week marks the second and final time that MockingJay is premiering at a packed theater. It's been a long wait for people who have been eagerly waiting for the film to arrive since it was first announced as a possibility. We all wanted to see this movie finally, but in a lot of ways we were waiting for it to happen. I'm not sure if I had the patience to go to the movies this week since I was also waiting for The Amazing Spiderman 2, but I know that most of the people who wanted Mocking Jay have had their fill of seeing Katniss Everdeen with a movie theater for the past two years. The film opens on December 21st, and while that's a long way away, I'm sure most of us were excited to see it for the first time. I've also been on a waiting list for it for over a year now, and it is just a great movie. I love the way it was shot and directed by Francis Lawrence, and the cast is incredible, but there are a couple of things that really bugged me about it. The most obvious of those things is that I feel like there was a lot that could have been done better with the film. While the film was not a huge hit by any stretch of the imagination, I found myself disappointed by some things about it that I have seen elsewhere. While The HungerGames: Crowing Fire had a few things that could be blamed on the fact that it was a prequel, I would not call Mocking the movie that should have been. So let's begin with the most obvious and possibly least-understood complaint about this movie.  The biggest issue with The Hunger films is that Katnass is not a character that the audience needs to learn about or root for. She's just sort of there and then she dies. I am not sure why the filmmakers chose to kill off the main character of a book. She is basically an anti-hero, and not a very interesting one. While she has all of the right traits for a character to be an antihero, she is not very interesting. Her only goal is to get revenge on The Capitol, and I feel that was a rather boring goal. It doesn't help that The Hunger has almost no conflict other than revenge, and Katnasses main goal
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A great movie. It is like a combination of  The Big Chill, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Jaws. I was really surprised by how well the movie is shot. It was also interesting to see that this movie was made in a different era compared to many of the Hollywood films of this time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I ever saw. The movie stars a man who is a part of the FBI. This man, played by Bruce Willis, has to investigate a murder. He finds that it is the work of a local sheriff's deputy. The main problem with this movie is that the characters are way too likable and the plot makes no sense. The film is directed by John Frankenheimer. The director said that it was a "cinematic experiment" and that he didn't know how it would turn out but that he was confident that he could create something good out of it. I don't think that he succeeded in this endeavor. Posted by Bruce M. at 8:26 AM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This review would have been more positive if I actually had seen the movie. I got a chance to see it on a trip to San Francisco this weekend and couldn't help but feel that it was a bit disappointing. I am a sucker for the '70s and '80s, but this one just didn't appeal to me. I'm a fan of a good love story, and I thought that was what they were going for. The romance element didn't really work for me and the relationship between Paul and Jennifer was really a little too on the nose for me. There wasn't really anything about the movie that stood out to me as a great film - I'm looking for something a bit more unique - and if it was just a love story about two people who fell in love then it probably would have worked for me (although I'm not going to recommend this for romance aficionados).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie's plot is so obvious that it's really not worth repeating here. The plot is basically just "I can't be a good person, so I can't live a good life, and then the movie does everything it can to show me how pathetic I am." There's no plot, just a bunch of people talking. I couldn't care less about the plot because I'm never going to see the movie (I saw the trailer on Facebook, and I still can't even watch it). There's not a single moment of suspense, or even of tension. The whole thing just kind of moves along and you feel bad for the people and for the film, but there's nothing you can really do. The only thing that could make this movie more watchable would be if the bad actors gave a better performance, and if the people in the movie gave a more good performance. But I don't think anyone has ever tried to make a bad film good. So, I have no idea what I'm supposed to feel about the movie, I just kind-of-guess that it feels like a bad romance movie. Maybe it was written by a guy who is only looking for a girlfriend and thinks she's hot, and he thinks it will be a great film to promote that kind of relationship. Either way, this movie just doesn't work for me at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is just so unbelievably stupid and completely batshit. This movie is about a girl that likes to hang out with her best friend. One day she takes her bestie to a movie. While there they get to the theatre and the girls start a fight that turns into an entire fight for the girls' attention. I guess the movie wants a fight and they are too stupid to not go for it. It ends up getting them both injured and getting them out of the theatre. That night they start talking about how much they would love to go out to the mall and just do stuff with each other. One of them says they should start a gym that does stuff together. The other one says they need to get married and that they should have kids. The movie then goes off on some other story about a woman that is trying to get her man to help her raise kids. I felt bad for this girl because it was so stupid, but I could tell that it had absolutely no business being in a movie at all. The acting was absolutely terrible in this movie. I really thought they were trying to do something different with it, but it was just terrible. The dialogue was also absolutely horrendous. You get the feeling that the actors were just trying to talk and not actually trying to be in character. The song they played over and over again was also extremely annoying. I would be willing to bet that the director of this movie never even watched this movie, which is absolutely unbelievable.   When I first saw this movie I thought the song that they played was a catchy song, but after the first couple of scenes I was so pissed. They just didn't even try. This really makes me think that they did not even try to make this movie look good, they just tried to make it look like they were really trying to make a funny movie.  The movie didn't try to be funny and just went for it:  I am not making a joke about this movie at least for one scene:  I am just going to come out and say it, this movie is just about how bad people are at being friends. Seriously. It has a scene where a girl is playing a video game with her friends. One guy gets annoyed that the girl keeps talking in her sleep, so he goes up and yells at her for being loud. He tells her that he could sleep with any one of them at this point and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     If you can't stomach the violence of a movie or can't stand the profanity in a movie, I don't have a movie for you. I can't sit through this shit. I'm getting enough of that from reality TV. The characters are uninteresting and I really can't get excited about them. Why is a female police officer killing people with an AK47. You should be afraid of a guy who shoots people with his own AK47, you asshole. The only good things I can say about the movie are the ending and the scenes of the bad guys killing the police officer. It's funny at the end, but it wasn't funny when it was just a boring plot of a few days of a female cop killing people. This movie is not worth a second of your time and I would not recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you have seen more than 10% of a film that you haven't enjoyed, leave a negative reviews about that film. It's almost like you are saying "It's not as good as I remember", but with a few more stars and a better director.   This movie has so much potential. The story is great, the direction is great and the action is great. I just can't wait to see it again.  But that's all I'm going to say about this. No one in this movie is memorable. Even the main character was not memorable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you know how movies work, you know they don't exist in a vacuum. They're a means to an end, a tool that has multiple purposes: an entertainer to promote his own movies and to make money, to make movies that are more fun to watch, to generate money, and to keep a reputation for being good at the whole shebang.   This means a film like A Dirty Shame, is not just an awful movie that only serves to perpetuate the horrible stereotypes and racism of black men. It also sends a message of what a black man in Hollywood looks like. A white man would never be called a "black bitch" by the director (and there's no reason to believe that this was even said to him by the producers), but that doesn't change the fact that this is exactly what happened in this movie.  So what happened? How do you keep this story from happening again?   One of the things that helped me was that I did not sit there and complain about this film. I was not angry. I didn't go on social media and tell every black person in the city what a rotten piece of work this was. This wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen.  But I have seen worse movies, and I wasn't even mad.  I had an epiphany.  That moment came during a screening of the film at my school.  My friend and I were the only black students in the room.  When the movie was over, I quietly asked my friend, "Do you think people are aware of this kind of racism in movies?"  When my friend replied, "Of course they are," I nodded and said, "Well, how does this happen?"  This is one of those conversations that you never want to have.  People may not know that a movie like this could exist, but that's because the film never made it to a theater, it was never released in a DVD or Blu-ray, or on Netflix.  This kind of film is hard to find, and in many cases, when a film of this nature does get released, its distributors make sure the marketing and marketing materials are clear about their intentions: to keep audiences watching the movie at all costs.  The first hint of this came when the director claimed that the film was about "a white guy coming back home after prison to try and redeem his life."  This statement alone raised red flags with me.  A
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     2 out of 5 stars I like to watch this movie in the car. When I say car, I mean a nice old family sedan. I find it's better to watch the film in a small cinema. I don't mind a slow pace, but I don`t want to listen to bad dialogue. There are many times when it seems that the movie is really good but not really good enough to be a masterpiece. There is one time when you think that the actors are really getting a laugh out of something and it's just too funny. This is the case with the scene in the first film. And there is another one in the second film where a good character is written off the screen. I wouldn't rate this movie at all unless I see it again at a more reasonable time. If I saw this film again, I'd give it 4 stars, but at this time it's only 3.  3 out of 6 stars I enjoyed the film but the ending was too abrupt. It didn't give enough time for the characters to realize that it was their fault and that they weren't at fault at all. And I was confused with the story. At the beginning of the film they all have such a wonderful, loving relationship and I really think that this is where they should have ended it. But after everything they did, it was a bit of a shame. This could have been the best film of the trilogy!  1 out of 1 stars I really thought this was the end of a great trilogy. The first film ends on such a high note, with such a fantastic scene, that I could have believed it. I was so excited about the film after seeing the trailer, and it ended too soon. I would have liked to see how their life had been after that. I also really thought that the ending would have been better. The film just ended.  that the three characters were not at fault. They could have left after that (there were plenty of options to save the world) but they didn't.  was really disappointed by the ending. It was too quick and not in a good way. I felt like it was all too quick to go. It made me believe that they didn`t have a chance to do what they really wanted to do and I was sad about that.  a good movie, but this film is a disappointment for me. .  in fact, I think that there should have been a few
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        If you've watched a bunch of movies on your favorite TV show (or at least a bunch with bad acting, bad music, or bad acting/music), maybe you've noticed how you sometimes just don't really care about these movies. And yet, at the end of the day, you remember them. They have meaning. But they're just movies. There's a world beyond these movies that you live in.   One of my favorite movies,  The Terminator, was the one that most of the people (myself included) felt had some really awful acting. I don't think you can deny that Arnold has one of the best and most memorable voices ever and he's absolutely fantastic in the movie (and I still remember him for some reason even though it's a pretty old movie). So there's a chance that Arnold would not even consider playing a robot again because he found the performance so laughable that it made him want to cry from frustration. And there are probably a number of actors who probably felt that way when they got the call for a part in Terminator 3. That being said, it doesn't matter. We should always go out and experience a great film. A movie that isn't necessarily an awesome piece of art but is a movie that we can all agree will make a great day or night of watching. And a movie to which we want to say "Thank God I saw that!" and then to actually believe that we're in a world where Terminator 3 was made (and not in some dystopian future where the Terminator still exists but doesn't get killed).   In an attempt to try to come up with a better list of movies for movie lovers, I had to figure out a way to find movies that we all can agree are great. So that means if it's on here and it's been on here a long time it has to be a good movie. So this is my list of 25 Great Movies.  25. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1979) The Star Trek movie I think the most people can agree on is Star Trek. We all had our favorite movie or two but the ones we are most likely to go back and watch over and over again are Star Trek (1966) and Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986).   I was a huge fan of Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1989) but as I mentioned above, I found it hard to love.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is bad.   In my opinion, it has a good set up, but it was shot badly.  The dialogue is horrible.  We don't have a lot of dialog.  It's not the first time that I have heard a movie that was so bad that I had to see it with another pair of eyes.  There is a really funny part in the movie when two different friends are playing a game of tag and the guy that is the tagger is constantly trying to tag the other guy as if he doesn't know what he's doing.  I'm going to put my own take on the story.  They get a bad guy, he tries to kill them.  That's about all I can remember.  If you don't remember the story of this movie then you are probably just a sucker for movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I read something in the movie that suggested that if we got the script for an older movie we'd probably find the same plot points were still there.   That's certainly what I found:    a man who finds out he has terminal cancer has to leave his family and go off alone.  It's the kind of movie that makes you think of someone who has cancer and decides to go off to the mountains with a group of people he doesn't love.    What's also interesting about it is that it's a comedy and a love story.  It's just so weird that this movie exists. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - - - If I ever made a bad film I'd probably have nothing to regret.  The film is the result of a project that we had at the time that was meant to be for a special event. It was an evening where we wanted to see a movie with the director and actors. The project was a romantic comedy about two guys who find out they are parents together and start a family together. This project was only a very short film for our audience, but I was really surprised at how big the film ended up being. We used some of the same shots and also used a lot of footage from our film "A Mother's Love", where we were the first people to find out our baby girl was a girl. The director was really interested in making this film so we put our hearts and souls into it. The production cost about $7,000. The budget was actually much higher because we had hired someone to help us and they were hired to edit the film. The whole thing cost about a third of our budget so that was a huge investment. However, we were really happy with the film, and after seeing it at the event we decided that we could make it even better. We made it for just our family and friends. I know that there are people who are going to hate this film, but as a matter of fact I love it. My girlfriend and I love this film and it was an amazing experience, and it is something that we will never forget. BEST SCENE:     THE BIG BOSS   "There's a big boss who hates you!" I never thought I would ever be in this position, but when we met we were completely in love. He was such a sweet guy and I loved every minute of it.  He was so kind and caring.   He has such a beautiful soul.  The love between us was so special, even when he became a monster. It seemed like the whole time he loved me as a human being.  I have so much respect for him.  One of my best memories of him is when he was getting ready to fight a monster and he told me he had never felt such passion in his whole life.  This is a scene in my favorite scene where he talks to the monster and the monster is telling him about what his friends have done.   THE CHASE    "The boy is chasing the monster. They
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a pretty bad movie for the price of a pizza. The movie tries too hard to be serious, but falls into cliches and turns into a cheesy, forgettable mess. I have seen this movie three times, and each time it was much more fun to watch than it was to actually watch. The plot is really good, but the characters are not. I won't give the film a bad review because it has its moments, but for what it's worth it was more of a cliche-fest than a bad film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie made me hate the genre of horror movies as I've been reading up on the subject.  It was a bit over the top for me, but I thought it was good.  There are a few things I disliked, but nothing horrible.   The movie was written in the 80's, it's really outdated and it doesn't hold up.  The pacing is rushed a bit and the acting isn't really up to the standard of the original films, but the movie is still a decent watch if you don't know much about horror.  As a horror movie, I didn't enjoy this one and it wasn't much more than a joke.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like a lot of you have said, my wife and I came into the theater expecting it to be an excellent film. Unfortunately, what happened is that the film made us sad. It wasn't very good, not to the point where it was bad, but it was boring and unmemorable. There is so much hype on the internet for this film, it just feels like it wasn't created for the purpose it was supposed to be. Like I said, there was no real reason for the movie to exist other than the director's love of a well known character and wanting to make a film that was similar to the series. The story is pretty typical horror, and the director did what he did best in the first movie, and that was to give a very creepy atmosphere with very little gore.   The first half of the film was fairly boring, but by the second half, we are introduced to some very creepy and very scary moments.  While I don't know what the film is trying to say, I am glad that I saw this in theaters, because I have no doubt that I would not have seen this if I hadn't seen it. There are plenty of other horror films to enjoy, especially if you can find them on DVD or Blu-ray.  If you have seen it and liked it, please feel free to leave a comment.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I do not understand what the problem is with this movie. A good movie is not hard to make. I think that this movie could be a very good movie, but it had some major problems. This movie had two major problems: the plot and the screenplay. It also had problems that a script can have. A script is a list of points to have to get the movie running smoothly, and then you do the rest of the movie. In this case, the problem was that the writers didn't know what they were doing. This led to a lot of writing problems. First, there was the writer's attempt to make this an adventure story, and they did a really good job in getting people excited. They set it up to be about this mysterious man from the distant past, a guy who lived on an island, and that his wife was a witch, and his daughter a werewolf. He was supposed to be this guy from the past who came back to help his people, but then they changed it to this guy who was a vampire. Then the writers changed that to the vampire vampire, but they didn't change his wife to a woman. Then when they changed his daughter, they made her a were-car. They did a great job with the excitement, but not so great with the plot. This was just not a well-written movie. The writing was really bad and it seemed as if they didn´t even know what a script was supposed t to be. The acting was really poor too. I had some problems with this, and in a lot the scenes were written very poorly. Then there were a lot problems with the script. I found a lot that I didn't like. Like I said before, there are a lot things that don´t make any sense. For example, the writer tried to make the characters evil. Then I found the story changed from being about a vampire in the past, who wanted to help a country, to a vampire vampire who is a demon, and the story is all about what he does and his problems. Then they changed the plot from being a vampire who wanted help from the other countries to a demon and this is all bad because the story was a lot more interesting. Then in the first third of the film, the story had the same problems with its writing that the acting had with its acting. After that, there were some things that I really liked. I thought the writing was good and I thought it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - It was pretty shitty (not the worst movie I've seen in a long time but I think it's my all time least favorite movie).   - The plot is not much better than the rest of the movie.   The movie is about a man who was born without a penis and that the best thing he can do is take a girl on a motorcycle ride with a strap-on.  -   Also, I'm just gonna call it in here, there were a lot of bad lines in this movie. This movie just had so many bad lines that it's not even funny.  You know the ones that go "Awww, look at him, he has a huge cock" or "Aww, look how cute he is with his strap-ons, he is so hot" or...   It's just so bad, I don't even remember what happened to the characters.  There are scenes where the movie actually gets worse and worse.  So if you like the movie, just turn off your brain.  If you don't, you will have fun at least.  (Note: The second to last scene is a scene I can't seem to find a copy of.  Also in my copy of the script, the scene is called "Shocking sex scene" but I know it's a sex scene in the film)  This movie was so bad that I don'st even know what to say. I really can't say if it was really funny or not.  This movie has the worst dialog and acting in a movie I have ever seen.  It didn't help that this movie was filmed in 2 days.  The plot was just awful.  I don' t think this movie really had much of a plot.  But it's such a bad film that the plot was like a joke.  In my opinion, this movie has a plot that just didn't fit, it was too far-fetched.  Anyway, I really didn't see the point of this movie in the first place.  I love the way it ends though.  When you have bad movies, and you have a good movie like I Love You Philip, you don'T end up on a movie rating system.  Most ratings systems for movies end up making it seem like you're a bad person, a racist, a sex freak, or a wuss.  They say that a bad rating makes
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "You're going to hate the movie!"    What movies are you missing?  Why would anyone want to watch a movie if it's terrible? Why do so many people want to waste their time with a bad film? Well I'm here to tell you there are a lot of good bad movies out there. It's just not that common. Some of my favorites are:  The Goonies, Se7en, Alien, Die Hard 2, The Blair Witch Project, The Room, The Hangover, The Matrix, and all of the other ones listed here. So why is it that a lot more people don't realize how great bad movies are? Well it's because a lot people assume you have to be a great artist, actor, or writer to do a good job on a bad script. There are many talented people who can make a good movie a hit, but people assume that to do it right you have be a movie star, director, or have some special skills like writing a great script. Well you don't. There's no need to be one or the other to make a great bad movie. But there are some things you can do to make your bad movie better. In this article I'll show you how I make my crappy script into a hit.   I'll also show you what makes a good bad movie and I'll even go into detail about how to write a script for a hit movie. Now that's a long read but trust me you'll learn a lot about how bad movies get made.  "I'm not a writer so I can't make a movie like that. You just need to know how to turn your bad ideas into good ones." - John Hughes If you're wondering why I'm not giving you a step by step guide on how to make the perfect bad movie then look no further.  In this section I'll give you just that. I'm also going to give you some tips for writing a script to get it made. But for now let's go over what makes an awesome bad movie! The Basics:  When people think about a hit or a "bomb" they usually think about something amazing like Michael Bay's Armageddon or the Titanic. When people think of a bad screenplay they typically think of terrible movies like Predator or the Clerks. When we talk about a "bad movie" we're not necessarily talking about a poorly written film but a movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I liked The Dark Knight, but I didn't enjoy it. It was not the best movie I've seen this year. I think that the reason that I liked it is that it was very dark and it was not for everyone. If you like comedy, this is not for you. I did not like the plot of the movie at all. If Batman could be as funny as he was in the comic books, I would be more forgiving of this movie. I really did not care for the character of Commissioner Gordon. I thought that his name was stupid. I also thought that Gordon was a horrible person in the end. I guess I just don't like Gordon in movies anymore. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. The ending of the film was not very good either.   If you don't mind a darker movie, you might like this movie, but it's not my favorite movie of 2010.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "It's a bit too long, too long... I mean, it goes on and on, for a long time. The characters are..." "Not all of them, but almost all of the characters." "Well, there's the woman, and the man. And they..  Well, I don't really know anything about them, actually. No.. well, I have a couple of theories, anyway."  It's like watching a bad Shakespeare play.  At least the characters are engaging. __________________ Last edited by Lorna: 01-31-2010 at 01:31 PM.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Please tell us if there's a good movie or a bad one in your opinion. Please don't use the question "what about" and try to give us reasons why we should or shouldn't watch the movie. You can put in anything related to the movie: plot, characters, style, etc. and anything else that would interest you. Please tell the reviewers what movie they saw that made them angry or what the movie they like that they dislike. This way we know which movie is the bad one or not. Don't get into what to think about a movie or why not. Tell us why you like or dislike it. This will make us have an open mind and be more open-minded to the message and movie.   Thank you in advance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There's a saying that I've always found quite amusing and it was always taught to me in the film classes that we had at school – The film was a huge hit in the beginning of my youth so I was looking forward to seeing it. Unfortunately, after I got over my initial initial enthusiasm, I was just disappointed. There wasn't much in the way of action scenes, it just felt like it was a waste of the money we had spent. I mean how often does a film with this budget make a profit? It just didn't look very impressive at all. I was only able to see it for the first time during a friend's birthday party and I can't really remember much about it. In short, there isn't anything about this film that I think anyone could be interested in watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie should not have been made, it was a total flop.   I can understand how the studio had their own financial problems because there were some big cast names who were on board, but they could not afford to do their job properly.  I found it to be an extremely unpleasant experience and I would never recommend that anyone see it again.  This film is terrible.  You would think that a studio with money would be able to get their act together and make a good movie, but sadly, it didn't happen.  It is one of the worst horror films I have ever seen and you have to ask yourself, why would they have done this?   It's because they had a lot of problems with the casting, but hey, that's why they lost the money and why they had to cancel the project, right? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few days ago, I saw a movie that I loved.    I went to a local theater where it played for a good while and I had a great time.  It was actually quite enjoyable and I would go again, if only for the chance to see the movie again.  A few hours into the movie, my partner and I started getting very excited about what was happening.  Our expectations were not high but what happened next totally blew us away.  The entire movie was being broadcast on a computer screen.  We were shown the fight between our main characters, The Avengers.  In the middle of the battle, we were shown a large explosion in New York.  On the screen was a woman holding a baby.  I was told that there were actually two women on screen.    One was holding the baby and the other one was not.   I did not know what to think.   It was like something out of a sci-fi movie.   Both of them were screaming in pain and the baby just lay in its mother's arms.  One of them was crying while the other was barely conscious.   How could the baby be on this screen and not the other?  I looked at my partner in amazement.  There was no way he could know that this was real.  How could he know that two people could be so close?    I kept looking at the screen to make sure that what was on screen was real, even though we were already screaming.  After a minute or so the woman who was holding her baby fell off the screen and my partner looked at me and asked what was wrong.  He asked me if I had seen her.  I told him that I had and it seemed like her head fell off of her body.   The next thing I remember is that my partner said something like "You know, that was pretty crazy" but we were not interested in the details.   Our attention was already focused on the action on screen, as if it were some sort of fantasy.   We were excited for the sequel.  At some point my partner pointed to the screen behind us and said "Are those the Avengers?"  I nodded and my brain started to process what he was saying.  Later, I came to understand that they are the Avengers from the movie "The Avengers".  At this point, I remember trying to say to my partner "What are they?" but he did
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. It wasn't bad. I really did. It was funny and enjoyable, but it also gave me a few moments of heart-warming sadness. And even though it isn't a good movie, it still felt like one of my favorite films of all time. I was sad at one point and laughed at another. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (this isn't a review) This movie has so many problems and yet doesn't even get close to being good. I'm really struggling to find a good review for this movie since it feels so bad.  The story is really lame. The main characters are all idiots and they really don't have that much development. They don't even have their own separate personality. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The trailer was not the worst, but a very obvious imitation of The Shining and is not even a good imitation of it. I never liked the film and found it not as good as The Shining. The director was clearly inspired by The Shining but there was nothing special to that film. The music was bland and there was no special atmosphere in the movie. I don't remember seeing the original horror movie The Unborn until I was in college. The Unfather is not as bad as the movie The Untitled, but it is not a very good film either.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What's the difference between a bad film and a bad book? A movie. That's it. A bad movie has no purpose. If there was a story to tell it would have already been told. But that's not what a movie is about. It's a movie for you to go to and sit in your chair and do what you will with. It was a good way to spend two weeks. I'd suggest you avoid a bad TV show or movie, or at least wait until you can do it without distraction.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     If you are wondering if it is possible to do what I did, this is your chance to find out.   My advice is to not watch these films for entertainment. These movies can be pretty disturbing.  They make you wonder about the world we live in. I hope you are not a child who has grown up watching these films and now think the world is a better place because of the movies. The worlds portrayed in these films have some darker facets.  The films I have listed in this review are just the tip of the iceberg.  I am always amazed by how many films are out there that have similar themes.  There is even a genre of films called   that are more violent and more disturbing than the other films I will list below.  Posted by Scott T.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For a review written about the movie 'Puss in Boots', here is a movie about a horse that runs away from home.  The movie starts off as a fairly standard action adventure movie. A boy (Miles Teller) runs away to his aunt's home where a group of circus folk are performing, a girl (Emma Stone) and a giant (Tim Robbins) chase him out of town, he is followed by two of the girls (played by Emma Stone and Milla Jovovich) and by a giant who is being used by the circus folk.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I love the film, but the director makes it worse by making his own version of "Dazed and Confused". "I'd prefer if this were a good movie that people could see, instead of a bad version."   I love this movie! I wish it could have been made in 1970.     Dazzle!   The best scenes are the moments when the actors sing in their voices.  In fact, this film has the best scenes of "I Fought the Law".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     No one is perfect. And if one can be, one is worth celebrating. And celebrating is what this film is about.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        What are you going to do?   The last time I was in the desert, I saw the movie "Trees Lounge" by George Clooney, and I thought to myself, "Oh my God, the desert is so cold...I wish I had my thermarest!" Now, I have seen the movie multiple times, and the coldness of it has become more apparent in subsequent views. I believe this film could have been much more interesting if it had been set at a desert resort, which has been the site of many other cold, desolate, night scenes. The main character, a young guy who has moved to the desert to live with his uncle, has gone through a terrible breakup (which he tells you will be resolved in a matter of days). His uncle, being a bad boss and an asshole, has left him nothing but a suitcase filled with broken furniture, and his little dog. In this town, the only place to be is on the couch or a bed...and if you aren't in a hurry, you might not see a lot of people. What a contrast from the desert we are supposed to be seeing...this is a world populated by people, and yet it looks more like a TV show than a place. George Cloony is the perfect cast to portray this "solitary city". He does an excellent job playing the role of this character, and a lot more too! This is definitely a story with a lot to offer. Clooney manages to find the right tone for it. There is a lot going on in the movie, and it doesn't feel like a big thing. He does a lot right...I won't spoil anything though. It's an enjoyable movie to watch, if you're in the mood for something interesting and cool. I'm glad it wasn't my first Clooney movie. It gives you something to look forward to next time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original, the one on VHS, is an almost flawless example of a director's talent. If the sequel hadn't changed a few of the characters and a few scenes (which might be a good idea if that was the original's intention), it would still be a masterpiece. There's the classic romantic comedy between a girl with a secret and the girl she's with. They play a video game that, despite being a game, is not a game and, to me, would have been better as a book. Then there's the film's ending. A film can have an ending that makes your eyes bleed, but, to be completely honest, it's pretty funny. Then again, I'm kind of hard to offend, so it's not that I can't get on board with it. As for the characters... they're alright. I can see why it was a commercial failure and why so many people liked it, but I'd be lying if I said the movie wasn't a bit clunky. I don't see the appeal. This is still a good movie, but it isn't a classic.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was so pissed off at how this film ruined everything it had to offer, it took me out of the story completely.   The characters were the worst part of the movie and I felt like I was watching a rerun.  I don't even remember a single character, the rest of the actors were great.  The movie was so bad it was good.  My only suggestion to this film is watch it on a crappy VHS if you're going to watch this.  I was so mad about this film because it just ruined my enjoyment of this film that had already given me a great ending.  It was like watching a bad horror movie that wasn't bad at all, it was just in bad taste.  If this movie was better I probably wouldn't have had the same feelings for it.    My only other complaint is that the ending didn't feel very finished to me, I felt there was more to it.    My other thoughts about this movie:     There's nothing wrong with the movie in the end, but I found myself thinking about it the entire time, I was in it for the entire duration, I don' t think it would have done the same to me had I just seen the trailer, I would of preferred to see it in the theater, not sure why, but whatever.  After the movie was over I did come out of a bad mood, and I can't imagine seeing this movie again.  If you're a fan of Stephen King, read Stephen King books and hate horror films you need to see this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     If a movie is not enjoyable then you can leave it as is. No one should leave a bad review about anything, especially when you have not seen the movie. That is why we have so many bad reviews posted by people who did not watch the movie so don't do it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not so much the movie itself, it's the fact that it's been put out in a manner that has made it the object of a massive, largely pointless and generally nasty public shaming campaign, which is exactly what it was intended to be.  I don't watch horror films or comedies much because they seem to me to be mostly about how badly one guy is treated, or how much fun they are to be made into by some other guy.  There's no enjoyment to be had in that, and most of it is probably just so one-sided that it really doesn't matter, since it's mostly just for people who can't get over the fact a man is being abused, or who are just bored and can't wait to be shocked again.   I really don't like the public shaming part of it.  It comes across like a guy who's been made to feel awful, and by being told his opinion isn't wanted, he's been forced to shut up and endure the humiliation.  Of course, there are those who really do hate these movies, and are out to get revenge, or make some other point, but the public humiliation part is just wrong, and the only way it works is to make it impossible for any good movie to come out about these people.  You can't really blame people for doing that, when they don't know anything about the movie.  But to tell a movie to stop being made is wrong.  It's not just that it was poorly made, it just looks bad and the acting is all bad.  The art is terrible, and I can't even really describe how bad it looks.  If you want a good art house horror, you have to go for the classic stuff from the 70s and early 80s.  That kind of thing doesn't appeal to me much, and even the newer stuff is generally bad enough.  Unfortunately, when it comes to horror, it seems to be the same old story.  And the point is that there's no real difference between a horror film made for fun, for the general public, or a horror movie that actually gets made.  My only real criticism of this film is that I wish it had gotten a slightly better ending.  At first I thought there was a good idea for a joke with the little girl, but it never seemed to get going.  Then, at the end, I thought maybe there was something to it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In an attempt to make a movie about "The Man with the Golden Gun", director Sergio Leone decided to use an old school, low-budget, western-style gunfight, but then abandoned the premise.   It's also a complete rewrite of a similar movie by French director Jean-Pierre Melville, which was made back in 1925.  And, since the movie doesn't end with a happy ending, why not take a look at these shots of the main characters fighting to the death?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      If you are a filmmaker you know how important your film is. It is not just a story. Your screenplay must be professional and well written. It should contain your most important ideas that make the story work.   A great story needs a great script, not the other way around. The script should provide the plot, set up the main character and other essential elements. The screenplay must make the audience connect with your main character as he/she will carry the story.   The screenplay should contain all the story elements needed for your film to work. It must contain your characters, and what is important about them. It needs to contain the scenes that will allow the audience to identify with your characters. The scene should be well written and contain all of the essential elements for your story to work (even though it is in the movie theater).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the first movies I remember seeing and it's a fairly good movie with some good action sequences. Unfortunately, it is way too long and bloated with the same scenes over and over. This movie has the same problems with some scenes being a bit too long, and other scenes getting a bit boring. The film is full of unnecessary stuff (including scenes that are only there to pad out the film). Even the director and editor of the movie make a scene feel unnecessary (as shown in this review). As you can see in this picture:  It just doesn't make sense at all. Why is this guy carrying a car? Why is a giant dinosaur walking down the middle of the road? Why can't the dinosaurs get through that wall of rocks? These questions and more are left unanswered.   Also, the movie is filled with lots of action scenes (mostly between the dinosaurs and humans) but none of them are very exciting.  And the movie takes a while to get going and even longer to finish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie I'm thinking about right now is a pretty bad movie.     It's based on a novel by a guy who is in jail in the Netherlands.    A guy who was imprisoned for five years for his writing.  When he's released, he goes to Amsterdam to write a novel.  He gets the book published, and the publisher's not happy about it, because it's a novel about a boy and a woman, and their relationship is going sour.  The woman gets mad at him.  And, he doesn't know what's going on, so he doesn a couple of bad things, and a couple people die, and one of them dies very suddenly.  Then she dies.  So he starts to really think about it.  But, he starts thinking that perhaps, he's not the only one out there.  There are other people out there who can be the people who save him from himself, and he starts looking for them, and looking for the people out on the streets who are like-minded.  This movie seems a little bit like The Devil's Rejects, only, The Devil turns out to be a real guy.  In fact, in one of the endings, we hear, "This is not a movie about a devil, but a movie made by a devil."   (He also had a cameo in Hellblazer.)   Then, he tries to convince a psychiatrist, who's the main character in the movie, that he's the devil, and that he has the power to save the world, and to do so, he will have to kill her.  This is the opening scene of the movie: If you've never seen The Devil Reject's, or read the book, then you might wonder what kind of a film this is.  It's about a man who's arrested and sentenced to five years in jail for a crime he didn't commit.  When he gets out, he is on the run from a couple who claim he's their "mole" (that's the word for someone who works for an evil organization, like a cult), and they are trying to find him. In the beginning of the film, he takes a bus into Amsterdam and sees a woman on the street.  She looks like the woman he's seeing in prison.  "This woman, she looks just like me," he says to himself.  Now

He didn't deserve this."  -Robert Downey Jr.  A star who was too nice. This guy was a disgrace to himself, and Hollywood. What a tragedy. , the great Tom Hanks plays the character of Eddie Murphy's brother, Chris. A young black man trying to get a foothold in the movie business, Chris finds himself in the middle of a fight scene with an actor, and after being in the thick of it, decides to do something about it. He rushes the actor's head into a pool of water. Chris and the actor are both thrown into the water, and Eddie is taken down, and a fight ensues. After the fight is over, Chris gets the actor to take a lie detector test, which he does. He gets a 'Yes' on his test, but the other actor, a white man who plays the part of Eddie's brother Johnny, refuses to take the test. This infuriates Chris, and with that he goes to Johnny's house and gets a.22 caliber pistol and goes outside. He tries to shoot the other guy, but Johnny grabs him and chokes him out and leaves him for dead. Eddie is the next one to get in the water. This time the water kills him. His brother Chris returns to the house to see his brother dead, and they confront each other. This is the second time we see Eddie Murphy since this film came out. I thought it was a great, fun movie. The plot was a little confusing at first, but by the end I had an idea of what was going on. I think Eddie Murphy is still the best comedian to work in Hollywood in terms of humor. He played this movie with a lot of heart and soul. The movie begins with a group of friends of Eddie coming back from an Easter vacation and going to dinner at Johnny Cash's house. They are discussing how they can get into the movie industry and how they would make it. One of the men in the group decides to show Eddie's family the movie The Wedding Singer. This movie was one of my favorite movies as a kid because Eddie Murphy and the cast portrayed it beautifully. A good movie needs to be told well and Eddie was just that. He captured the characters of Johnny Cash and Gloria Swanson so perfectly. He also captured a

The company was like they were stuck on the boat, they just wanted to keep the ship going and that was the only thing they cared about.   I've never heard a positive review about this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the few "A-List" directors to have worked in several Hollywood films over a period of time, Michael Winner has produced a career that has included such works as The Terminator (1984), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (1991). He made his breakthrough with the thriller thriller The Last Boy Scout (1986), which won him two Academy Award nominations. His other notable films include The Punisher (1990) and True Lies (1995). Winner also made two films for Marvel Comics, which included the hit TV series X-Men. Winner is the recipient of a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The following interview is taken from his book, The Making of The Terminator.     Interviewed by: James Cameron The Terminator : We met on Monday [in New York City] for the first time. He was the only director I had ever heard of. Then I heard he was in The Terminator, a movie I thought was pretty bad. At first, when I read the script, I thought it was terrible. I didn't think he would have the guts to direct it. The last thing I was looking for was an action film. It would have been a big mistake to take that on. I got it made because I was willing to cut some of the action and to have a better story. You see, in the movie the bad guys take over the city and all of the men in the army are murdered. The movie has all of these scenes of soldiers being murdered or dying. And I thought that was a pretty bad idea. So I thought, Well, why don't I get a director who will do an action movie that looks and feels like The Terminator and make this a really good movie? When I saw that you had read the screenplay, I knew that it was probably a mistake. I thought you would like it. But when I saw the film, I said to myself, "This guy is really funny," and I was right. It was the funniest movie I have ever seen. (Laughs) You could tell that you are watching something that is going to be quite entertaining. I never thought the script was that bad. The only reason you got a very good script was because I brought in some of my best friends. I wanted to get everybody involved. Because of that, it became the biggest movie of the summer of 1984. It went on to win several Oscars and it became something

Tilly I'm a professional poker player  Well, how's it goin'?  He's playing  Now I have to win it again:  It's a classic and not the same as the first one.   The music is much better and a bit of drama has been added to it. As I am sure you all have heard, there's a new movie coming out about a former champion poker player.   In the past, I didn't care for poker movies.   There's always the usual "good guy gets the girl", but I think in this case it's different.   I don't think there's an "evil" person.   It's more of a "good" person who gets the other person wrong.   A very interesting concept for a poker movie and it's one that I have never seen before. And the first thing I noticed is that the director seems to like it when you are watching the movie and he uses the camera for great effect.   He puts the camera right in front of the actor and it really brings out the emotion and excitement of what's going on.   But it's not all about the acting.   The writing is also excellent.   What was interesting about the story, it was not in any of the previous poker movies that I've seen.   No one was trying to say, "We don't need a big set, we need the actor to give us this much emotion."   They were more interested in showing how the characters behave during poker.   This is a very interesting story with a strong story line and a lot of different twists to come.   So I'm sure this is going to be another one to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like you'd expect from the movie: The whole plot revolved around a girl named Mimi, who was taken as a human test subject for some sort of experiment. The test subject, a young girl named Yukino, had the power to cause the girl's body to melt and to transform into some sort to an animal or something. But, when she had tried this on the girl, she had seen a different side of her. And, she was so afraid of what she had done to Yukino that she was reluctant to tell anyone about it, and she would try to forget. Now she was having to relive the same experiences all over again because the girls were suddenly attacked by a monster. The girl who had the monster was called Ayumi, and the monster she had was called Yakuza. It had taken the whole town by surprise because the monster didn't seem like a threat, but after the girls realized that this was no ordinary monster, they went to save the girl. They didn't know that, it seems, it wasn't going to be a simple rescue. The monster was going to attack them one by one.  I thought this movie was okay, but... (it was pretty lame- it's like the director just wanted to have some cheap entertainment with his cast). The girl with the melting body turned out to be pretty cute though... (no spoilers for this movie, as I've already seen it a few times). The ending was good, but I'm just going to give this a 7/10 as far as the plot goes. The acting was average as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie's bad, don't be fooled.   It's not a bad film, but not great either.  They should make a movie like "Superbad" to show the world what we really think about such crappy movies.  This is a movie that is about a group of idiots that decide to play poker in a casino.   The story is great, a bunch of guys trying to find out if a girl has really been cheating on them, but instead they find out that the girl is cheating on a group guy and has been cheating for some time.  The movie is also funny, a lot of good scenes to laugh at, and a great script.  I would watch it again in a few years to see what happened to that one guy they got out, and the other guys in their group, but they have no business getting out, they were not even playing at the casino they were in.  One of my favorite scenes was in the bathroom in the casino when one of the guys decided to try and get his money back, and ended up pissing in the sink.  There is also some nudity (which is good, it is a western movie) and a sex scene, but most of it is in the beginning.  A lot of people I know have watched this movie and really enjoyed it, but for some people I would avoid this movie, the sex scene will really get you going, and it's good to see that the actors were good and not "stunts".  The main problem with this movie is that you can't really tell if a guy is lying to you, or if he is lying about the things he says, I know some people don't care if they are lying or not, but that is just how my mind works.  It seems that this movie was a lot like "The Wolf of Wall Street", a bunch that got out of control, and I think that these guys need to be in a rehab program.  But overall I liked this movie a lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm afraid you've done something wrong.   You've made me want to hate this movie.  I'll tell you why, and let you in on my "secret."    This movie is so bad, the reason you have to sit through it, is because you want to see more.    To show the world that there is something else out there, you've come up with a movie that does not make sense.  It's not like a Disney movie where you are watching all these great characters, and at the end, there is a happy ending.  To this movie, there are a bunch of characters that do not act like they want to.  Even the characters that are supposed to be the heroes have a "No" and a "Stop," at least one of them.  They also don't have a good motivation.  Some of these characters just want their money back.   If you had to watch all the characters trying to solve the "heist" of this movie you might be asking why is this movie so bad?  Why are there only two of them?   The story goes on and on about money being the reason behind everything, but no one ever talks about the "Heist."  If this movie was a real movie, I would not give it my money.  The only reason that this movie gets a "pass" is because of all the people that watch it.  And if you don't give it your money, then don't go watch it, it's not for you.  When I was a kid, I watched all these crappy movies and when I heard about these "great" movies I thought to myself "My God these are so good, I must get one of these to watch.  " I was sure the story of this film would be just like all those other movies.  But when it came on, I saw that I had been wrong. This was a bad film and it had me laughing my ass off.  In my opinion, if you are thinking about watching this movie and you're like me, I don't recommend this movie to you. It might get you into the film, but I doubt it. There are other movies out there that I've seen that make sense and aren't as bad as this movie is.  There are a lot of great movies out on DVD right now and it's nice to see that the movie world has finally begun to see

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is absolutely awful, but as soon as I heard they were working on it I wanted to see it.   The story is a complete and utter travesty.  This is not a story about the end of the world, it is a story of how an overgrown 14-year-old becomes involved with the evil force that is the evil wizard.  It is a classic fantasy film that has a few things going for it, the main one being that the story is actually entertaining, something you can't say about a lot of films from the 90's.  Sadly, I must say this film is a disappointment and a total waste of money, and I will be sorry to see this film ever see the light of day again.  I also believe this film was filmed for less than $10,000.   The Worst:       1.    This film was a huge mistake of a movie, it was made by a company known for doing shitty low budget horror films.   2.  For a horror film, it actually has a pretty good story.   3.  The acting is terrible.   4.  A lot of the story lines are terrible, some are stupid, some could be considered very poor writing, like the one about the old witch.   5.  There is literally no plot.   6.  I cannot say how awful this film looks, it's terrible.  7.  If you don't want to see a film made by people who don't know how to make horror films, then I highly suggest that you don a pair of sunglasses, take a walk in the woods and take a shower.  8.  In this film, they actually show the ending of the film and it is terrible (and it's not really the ending they're talking about, it doesn't fit into the plot, which is what they do to create drama in the movie).   9.  Why is the name of the main character a kid that looks like a kid?   10.  They also have a kid in this movie called "Halloween", but this kid is older, so they changed his name to a younger version of a name we all know and hate.   11.  While the story was entertaining, it did take a little while to start and I had to stop and watch it over and over.   12.  You have to have the "B" word
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a movie I was excited about. I was happy to see it released and I was glad I saw it.    I can't speak to the movie itself though, because I've seen it on television and in the theaters and I'm not sure it does anything new with the story line.  It just seems like a movie that should be made, but they never took the time to do it. So for that reason alone, and for the fact that it's hard to get people interested in a movie, I can see why they just didn't do it and didn't make it. The movie is about a young couple, who are so sick of their jobs, that they decide to leave their jobs. This turns out to be a terrible idea because they have to drive a new car for some friends of their that want it and they never finish their classes, so they have a hard time getting back to work.  As soon as they get home, they realize they need to go to the beach to try and get laid, but it isn't going as planned.  The characters and the story are interesting enough, but there are a few problems with it. Firstly, the first thing you think of when you hear the title is "the beach movie" but it never really is, because the beach scenes are pretty much the same. Secondly, the movie is just too long. It took a while for the characters to even be introduced, let alone find a place to stay or a date with a man who isn't in love with them.  But the movie did have one thing going for it that other beach movies haven't: it got me to want to go out there and get fucked up with a bunch of men.  I've never been to the ocean and I can never remember what it's like.  When I heard that there was a beach movie about guys being guys and fucking on the beach, I knew it was going to be good.  The sex is hot. The movie is a good mix of being weird, and having sex, and it is very good. It also doesn't have anything like the horrible sex in the movie "The Pervert's Guide to Cinema," so if you like that one, it should be a good time, too.  Another good thing about this movie is that it uses a lot of sex as a way to explore character, with some nice characters who you can't help but love.  This

(See my review on that movie here.) It is a movie where you get to see a lot in a short amount of time. You get to get to know the characters a little. You see a ton of action in it. But, I want to say something that I think will make it better for me. I don't care for it, personally. I liked the movie because I enjoyed watching it. You will enjoy it too.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this to be one of the worst movies I have seen in years. It takes a very good movie and ruins it. The script is poorly written and the movie is filled with things I would not want to see in a family movie. The movie was made for the kids and it shows. It has one of my favorite characters that I think would be great in a comic book and it also shows why the characters would be so important to a world like the One Year War. This movie is a big mess and does not hold a candle to anything else on this list.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie at a film festival and it was one of the worst movies ever made. The story is so bad that I don't know how they got it made. It is so dumb that the story line is the only reason I saw this. The actress who plays the role of the love interest is not in it, and it makes me question how they can do a romantic comedy like this. I think she should have been cast as a woman. It was just a terrible movie. I will not recommend this to anyone and I won't recommend it to anyone else. This is one of those "If you're gonna hate it, at least enjoy it" kind of movies. I would only recommend this if you are not a comedy fan.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What makes a movie good or bad? Well, we can tell.   So, how do we decide if a movie is good or not? First, we have to analyze the movie.  Let me tell you a true story:  At my job, I am responsible for a film's trailer, but I have to cut down the movie's trailer because it would take up too much room.  So the producer asked me, "How much time do you have?"  And I said, "Three to five minutes." So he said,  "Well, we really don't want a film with a film trailer that's too long.  We want something short and sweet.  What we want is a trailer that makes you smile." So I said to him, "Ok, but why don't we cut a trailer to make a better movie?"  So he cut down a trailer for a good movie, and we sent it to Hollywood.  The trailer was so short and it made the movie really good.  But, then I said "Why can't we just cut down an entire movie to make our movie better?"  Because I wanted our film to have its own feel and tone.  This is why I'm not going to give any spoilers for the movie because this movie's just as good as you think it is. I'm sure you'll be able to go to the movie and enjoy it for yourself and see for yourself what makes the movie good. The next part of the movie is the action.  It's the first time I am doing it (acting).  My first time doing anything is my role as "The Masked Ninja", a character who fights the bad guys.  Also, I'm the only female character in this movie!  (It has a "Mixed Media" theme to it, which means we use different media from film and other mediums.)  This time around, I have been fighting for what I think is right for the world.   So what do I think makes a good action movie?  I think it's when you are telling a story and when you know how to tell a story.  When you're telling a true, true story. The most interesting thing in my life is telling a good story.   The best part of this movie is when I am fighting in the movie, but it is not about fighting.  I have a great story to tell about the struggles in my own life

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is some debate in my house whether or not the movies are any good. This one is the worst of the bunch. There are many things wrong with this movie, from the editing to the characters to the writing to the whole acting process to the script. The characters are unoriginal and have a very stereotypical look to them. I have no interest in watching any more of this. And I've seen this movie 3 times already. I don't care about what happens in this movie and I am not interested in watching it again. I won't waste any more time with this. I am sick of watching these movies. I think there is some good in this, but I can't take this movie seriously. I watched the movie several times. I've been through this movie several thousand times. And each time I watched it I would have to force myself to enjoy it. I didn't enjoy it at all. I will probably not even watch it again and I'll just leave it there.

I think, with good editing and nice soundtrack, it could have become a classic. I saw this movie only 2 days ago and the only thing I can say is, it's not my kind of film and I hope that I can change it in my mind.   1/10   Review by L.S. I had read reviews from several readers that rated this movie at "10", and I'm sure many others, too.      This movie was so bad and it was written by a movie-maker who did not understand the concept of story. It was like a movie about how there's no magic in movie making. The story was just a load of nonsense. If I had not seen it 3 times, I'm 100% sure that I would have given it a lower score than "10".   The whole movie is just made up of what they wanted it to be like.  5/10 (too bad, they should have given us some magic and magic would have been better)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If I would have gotten this as a freebie I would not be a fan of it at all, I was a huge fan of 'Shrek' and wanted to see how the two would work together.   Instead it took me about 90 minutes to figure out the plot and the story was pretty much the same.  One thing I really love about the movie was that all the characters had great dialogue and really thought about things.  Also the movie ended up being a lot better than I had expected it to be, it didn't take itself too seriously and was a lot of fun to watch.  The movie:     First, I would like to say that the movie had a fantastic script, the writing was spot on.  The movie was really entertaining, and the cast really brought this one to life.  A lot of laughs were had and it was a fun watch. I think this movie would be a great addition to the Shrek franchise if they kept the original name. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      It was fun to play with a little plastic monster. But the main problem was the fact that they had to cut a lot of the scenes.   They were cut way too short to make sense.  A little longer, and it would have been fun to have played with it a bit more.  The little plastic figure:  My favorite parts of the movie: The music was great. The story was really interesting. The characters were great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What do you hate about it: ? This movie should not have been made at all! It just takes a little too long for everything to happen and it doesn't really develop anything in that time.   I guess the movie got very expensive for its low budget and if you had only been watching it on television or in your own home then you might not even notice that it's not a bad thing but when you watch it in the theatre you will definitely notice that the movie is way too long and it just doesn't have anything going on in it. The actors that play the main roles, especially the lead, are quite good so don't get me wrong there but I mean they have this amazing ability to keep you invested and you can't help but be disappointed.  I've watched this movie over and over and I still haven't been able to get into it as it just is so out there and I feel that it should've been filmed in the 70's.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcZDZtKVqCw I'm not going to give away much of what happened in this movie.  The movie starts off with a character who is a woman who has been turned into a man and has been living in a bar and has had sex with one of the patrons. The story then goes on about how she has been raped and that her best friend was with her and she doesn't know who the other woman is and I guess she is with a guy now.  This is going to happen over and again in the movie and it was starting to get very repetitive and really didn't add anything to the story.  You get to know that this is a movie from an outside perspective which is pretty interesting but you don't have a clue as to why the world is the way it is.  But I will say this.  While this is happening you are treated to a great score and it is really really good.  I'll admit I don't even listen to all the music in movies so this is very well put together and just really well put into the movie. I mean it's a very good soundtrack and the movie has some good effects but you really don't think it is going on the screen for 20 hours.  Now onto the bad part.  Once again the movie will slow down a lot at the end.  Here you have the main character who has lived for a while

I don't really know, but it's pretty cool to be told.  I have no idea what any of these people mean, and they all sound like they think I know the answer.  I don't have any questions about this movie.  "The film is about an old man who is very poor, but he keeps working hard to get his money back.  In his life he has a son, a daughter, a sister and two grandchildren.   "  I haven't seen any other movies with this kind of ending.   What do you mean?   You're saying this movie is a sad story and a sad man.  Don't you think he deserves a better ending?  But what about the son?  Who knows what would happen to him?   Don't get me wrong, it was a really good film, but I thought it didn't get enough credit.  Maybe you guys think it got enough.  This is my review.  If it doesn't have my name on it, I'm not going to say it.  It doesn't matter who wrote it, who directed it or who the stars were. It doesn in any way, shape or form matter.  And just so you know, I watched this movie over a week ago.  Why are you still reading it?  You already know what I think, so stop trying to convince me.  This is why I won't review movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only thing that is wrong is the way they got all the money and made the movie. They made a crappy movie. It doesn't show the beauty of nature or the true beauty of the universe. It just shows how the humans were treated. The humans were forced to do things they couldn't do. They were forced by the governments into fighting wars they didn't want to do. The only way that anyone would survive this is if they were a genius and they knew what they were doing. The movie shows that in a really bad way.   What do we get out of it? That our country and world are the way that they are because the humans did bad things and they are afraid that they will get mad at those humans for doing bad things.  (review of free book)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was a disaster. Its story revolves around a young boy and the fact that his parents were in love with each other, but he can't stop thinking about the girl from his town that he knows very well and he wants to kill her. As if that wasn't bad enough the girl is actually his best friend and he hates her for it. As I said I'm not sure if this is a Disney movie or not, I don't think the studio knew what they were doing. The story wasn't interesting at all and the action scenes were lame, especially the ones with all the kids. The ending left me unsatisfied and I'm sure people that saw this movie are going to be disappointed as well. I think this movie could have been good if they had more budget, but it ended up being just plain terrible. Oh yeah and the song that plays at the end of the movie is kind of lame and I just can't stand it. The film: 5/10 The music: 4/10 I just hate this song (Lies) and the video of this movie, the action sequences were so lame. My only enjoyment from the movie was the ending, which was kind of cool and I have no idea why they wanted to show kids killing each other. They could have just played a really long song with the kid and his friends playing with the dead bodies and then showing a few closeups of the bodies. I wouldn't have cared if that was what they did but they didn't do it. There is also some really dumb dialogue. The kids were supposed to be the good guys and yet they were acting like bad guys when they didn in fact just want to play with their friend's dead body. If they had showed some more of that scene the movie would have been a lot better. Overall:  6/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't watch movies like this.      It's a boring and weak story about a boy who gets captured and a girl who tries to save him.  (If it was so bad, why is there a movie out called "Bored?")   This is why they made a "Girl in a Coma" movie (the title's an obvious lie).  It's a very different story than what was presented in the trailer:  This is just one of the few "Girl In A Coma"-style movies out there, and it's a great film.  It has great music, fantastic scenes and an amazing ending.  There are tons of scenes like this, and they are fun and exciting to watch.  This movie is fun to watch and you will enjoy it.  I like the idea that this movie was made by a group of people and not by a studio.  For those who want to see a good horror movie, I suggest "Girl, In A Hospital".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had to go to the doctor after watching this movie and I have a cold right now. I don't know if the cold was caused by the flu, but it makes me sick. When I saw that this movie had a bad rating, I was like, "This is not going to be fun". I'm glad I didn't waste my time on it. I was in the theater for 15 minutes and didn't really get into the movie. The ending was a bit rushed and had no flow. It was a very slow movie, and that's not something that works for me. I felt like I was watching a movie in my mind. The cast did a good job but there were too many parts that I couldn't understand. I would say that I would not recommend this movie to any one. If you are interested in a movie with little to no plot, just watch a movie about a crazy scientist.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a stupid movie!   For some reason I was excited about this movie because it's not too long (about 45 minutes), and it has a funny plot that's very well written (well, not for a movie with a bad plot).   The thing is that it's completely boring.   It's actually boring to watch a movie, because the characters are so stupid.  The story of the movie is to go to space, but the first thing they do is to find out if they're really human.  This story is even worse than the last movie, the last being a "Space Jockey" movie.  It took me about 3 hours to finish the movie because I was just so bored.  I'm not trying to bash it because it was entertaining enough, but it was not worth watching.  Just don't waste your time, just do yourself a favor and watch "The Martian". It's much better than "Men in Black".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Don't hate on a bad film!   Sometimes it's the best thing you can say in response to a bad flick.   If you hate on the film, you are just being mean, and we all know how that works.  There was a time when I thought it was impossible for a man to be both a lover and a fighter.  And I was a little jealous of my man.  This movie shows us a different man, and it's an old and tired story.  The idea that a man would marry a woman so he could fight is a cliché.  But the old man was a good fighter. But when you love someone and want to fight for them, you can't make excuses.  It's okay.  It's okay to love a woman and want something more out of her.  Sometimes I wonder if a man with a woman is the same man that fights for her. Yes, men and women do have different roles to play, but sometimes there's an idea that men are "the good guys," and women are "foolish girls."  The only thing that really matters when we get into relationships is what both sides want out of it.  In this movie, we see a man trying to find out what his wife really wants, and how he can give her what she wants and still be a man.  But at the end of the day, we don't always get what we want.  There's no way a man can make love to a woman without wanting to be with her. There's nothing wrong with that.  You don't have to be a complete fool to think that a woman wants to be loved.  For some reason, a man seems to think being married is all about "love" anyway.  So why not go and find out for yourself?  You have to admit, I did. We're going to go back to my original point about men and fighting.  At the end, the hero is willing to fight, even if it means losing.  A lot of people don't believe in fighting.   I don't either.  I've seen too many men get knocked down and get up, only to give up in the end.  Sure, I have my good days and bad days, but there's not much that I haven't beaten down.  That's just the kind of man I am.   But I'm not a

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't watch a lot of horror movies so I had no idea what the plot was about, and then I saw the movie.  I guess, I'm not sure if you could call it horror, but I didn't like it. I think the movie should have been called "The Horror Movie" so people would remember it, but, as a kid I did like it a lot. The movie is about a group of kids who go on a school trip to the island of Rangoon, and, as they say "It's a horror movie!!"  I think a movie that has no plot, no theme, nothing to keep you going, that's just plain scary. I can't wait for the next horror movie to come out.    Read more Reviews
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you haven't seen the film then I advise you to wait and see it. It will be an experience you will never forget.   The director (who I will call "Mike") wanted to make a movie about his experiences of a boy growing up in the ghetto during the late 60s and early 70s. He found an old photo of a group of kids playing basketball in a park.  Mike had gone to the park when he was a kid and he still had some of those friends who had been in that movie. They thought it would be funny to make this movie about their adventures and of course they wanted a bunch of other people to be in it. So they got a bunch more kids, some of whom would become their biggest stars including Don Johnson and Tommy Lee Jones, to play the kids who were playing basketball.    I was not invited to make any of the movies in this series but I knew about them as I grew up around the projects in downtown Los Angeles. The first thing I saw was "The Birth of a Nation" at the Hollywood Palladium in 1959. I was 14 years old and the movie had just come out in theaters.  I would have been about 18 years old when it was released.       After watching that movie I asked my mom where the rest of the group was.  The rest of them were long gone.  She said they were dead and didn't know why.  My next thought was that there were too many people in that film for just me to have been in it as a kid.  They had put all these people in it that would have had to have known each other.  I had never heard of any of them but when I went to see "A Boy Named Jackie" at that same theatre years later I did not find any of my old friends there.  Now, I know it was a different time and they did not want me to see a movie at the Palladium so I was not at that movie but I did see "Shaft" a few weeks later at a theater in Los Angeles and that movie also had a large cast of mostly black actors.  Again, the cast had to all be familiar with each other and that just would not do.  What was really interesting was that the director of "Shft" had gone through a process of trying to make movies in Harlem in the late 50s and had never succeeded. He had
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I had a lot of fun seeing this movie and the story was very good. There is a lot going on in this movie which is very entertaining and entertaining. I don't usually like horror movies but this one was very interesting and thought-provoking, and it wasn't scary. But it was not as good as I expected it to be. The movie was a bit rushed to get things finished, and there was a small amount of nudity. It was a little bit disappointing that they didn't go farther and make this film into a movie with more content, but the movie is not bad and is worth watching.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is crap. It is not even funny or entertaining. The film is over the top, not even the acting is good. There are so many things wrong with this movie, it really feels like it was made by a 2 year old.   The dialogue is horrible, the scenes are horrible, they just give you a horrible feeling.  A horrible experience.  The characters are also not that great.  If you were thinking about watching this movie. Then you were probably already disappointed by this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Why do you have so much trouble understanding something? Is it because you have been watching a lot of shitty movies? Is this a new thing? The only way I can think of to deal with this problem is to go back and watch a lot more films from the past. I don't see why people can't watch a bunch of movies from a different era before coming to the conclusion that there's something wrong with them. Movies from the 1940's and 1950's aren't nearly as bad as the crap we've seen in the last 20 years, and at least these films had a decent amount of plot going for them. I mean, think about it: What kind of crazy shit has been happening in the world since the 1950's? I mean you probably have some ideas, but that's about it. The 1950's were a time of amazing advancements in technology and people were just having a hell of a time. This is what people of the past would have enjoyed if they had the opportunity to experience it themselves.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The badness has to be the first, the best is the second and worst is the third. There's a lot of them here, but I'll give you a few: "The Great Lie", "The Last Seduction", "Lazarus", "Escape From New York" and "Raging Bull" are really bad movies, and "The King's Speech" (another one in the "The Greatest Hits" category) is not a good movie at all. "Empire of the Sun" isn't good at all, and that's really bad. "Inception" is a really bad movie, and the second one, "The Dark Knight", is a terrible movie. And if the last one wasn't bad, "Saving Private Ryan" was really bad too. And "Apocalypse Now" is, of course, not a movie. "Jaws" is just not a great movie, it's really dumb. So if you don't like them and you really like a movie that is not as good as it should be, that's the only reason you might like it. That is, if you want a bad or really bad film to be your best movie.  I will say that "The Deer Hunter" and the "Dances With Wolves" are very good.  (From left to right)   Jack Nicholson, John Wayne, Anthony Hopkins, Robert De Niro, Steve McQueen, Tom Selleck, Jack Nicholson. How about you: are you a fan of movies that aren't really good? How do you feel about the classics? Or is it enough that you know the classic films are very bad?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I have a big mouth.   I am a horrible person.  I should have never talked to you about this movie.  My apologies for all the bad words that are about to come my way.  This movie was a total fail and I am not surprised at all that it didn't work.  There was not a good story.  The bad guys were not real.  You will never see me ever like a horror movie again.  Sorry I couldn't be more fair and unbiased about the movie. "   The director,   David Giler,  and the writer,  Michael Dougherty,  all made the movie and it was their fault.  If you liked it, it's because you liked the movie they wrote.  Why did they give me an awful script?  Why were they so bad?  Who was the best actor in the movie?  I hated the writing.  It was just bad.  No one was likable.  Every bad guy in the film was despicable.  One of the main characters was not really evil.  They should have just given me a really good movie.     What is the meaning of life?   Why am I alive?  Are we in trouble or just in a nightmare?  What's going on?  How could this happen?  Is there an answer?  The only thing that made me happy was the ending when the movie finally showed what was going to happen.     If you can not see through this movie and still want to see it,  this movie is worth seeing.   Why was I not happy when it started?    Why would I want a sequel to a movie that I never liked?  This was the worst horror movie ever made.  So many things were wrong.  Was there a reason that this movie was such a flop? I don't think so.  It was a failure because they gave me bad writing, bad acting, a bad storyline, and bad direction.  We are told that Giler did not like the script and he wanted a film that was more "realistic", but it was just awful.   I didn't like the actors either.  Mike Myers and John Landis were terrible in the role of the "kids".  Why should they be good in a movie like this?  They were just too bad to be real.   So why did I watch this
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this movie is too silly, I will happily take it back.   But it is way too silly.  I would recommend to a young child but the movie is definitely for adults.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Al from My favourite movie. I love this movie. If it wasn't so over the top I might actually watch it.

I think there are a lot more people out there who appreciate a movie like this one. I also like the idea of the movie being made to parody the film business as well. Funny movie, good acting, great animation. Great story with good performances, and a great ending. What else do you need?  Thanks for watching,  Karmen. , on 8/2/2012 7:56:58 AM This movie is sooo good! I love it. The animation is soo well done. Very funny and the story is well written. I could relate to everything that was happening in this movie (like how the guy and the girl have a crush on each other but then their parents get mad at them). I love how there are so many scenes where you're watching this movie and you have to imagine what will happen.  be sure to check it out.  the story was good, but the art was better. The voice acting was good. .  on 10/10/2012 12:37:06 AM this movie was great. the art style was awesome and the music was great too, so that was the best part of this movie in my opinion. the characters were awesome, and the plot was great!  . on 5/4/2013 7:15:51 PM I liked the movie and i enjoyed the story and characters. I especially liked the robot and his friends. I feel like there was a lot that could have been done differently
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Don't do that.   If you see an awful movie, write a bad review about it, don't make it worse for yourself.    There is no such thing as a bad rating.  It just means that you are upset or disappointed in the movie, and want to tell everyone about it.  When you are going to talk about a movie and complain about it on a blog, make sure it is something good.  I don't believe in ratings, except when I see a movie that I feel deserves a high rating. If a movie deserves a rating of 9, I don�t think it will get a 9, because it has a lot of technical faults.  No matter how great a movie is, there are always some things that the director could have done better.  There will always be a certain amount of artistic failure that you cannot help but feel when watching a movie.  If a film fails the technical standards you have set for yourself, you don� t have the right to make an artistic judgment about the movie. In this movie, the director did a great job of showing that all of the bad guys were horrible, but he could have made them a little more interesting.  In the movie they have an all star cast that you would expect from the 90's, except they do not work together.  They were all cast to be in the same movie and they all look alike, which is very distracting.  For a 90�s movie, this movie is a real let down.  It takes place in a distant future that is not far off from ours.  The only reason that I enjoyed this movie so much is because it is one of the few that takes a look at a science fiction world.  Some movies get made and are never seen.  This movie is available on YouTube and can be watched for free.  But I really wish that the movie was given a good grade so I can give it a 9.4.  Don�t be a �bully� to those that are not able to handle movies:  Some of the posts that I have written on this blog have really upset some of the more sensitive readers of this blog.  And even though these posts were written as compliments and to compliment the writers of the comments, some of you felt the need to come over here and tell me that they were a �bullying� to the authors of the other comments.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Here is where I put my own thoughts and experiences with the movie:      For those who do not remember, The Day the Earth Stood Still was a movie about a scientist who built an atomic bomb. He then took a nuclear power plant to the moon, and then accidentally killed himself because he was in the center of a nuclear chain reaction and he was unable to do anything to stop it. The movie was terrible and had very bad performances. The best scenes were in a dream sequence where it felt as if they were trying to make it more believable, but it did not. There were also lots of other ridiculous things in it. I never found the film believable or entertaining and I think it was poorly made.   At the end of the film, the scientist's wife has the power to control the nuclear plant and she uses it to put the entire world to sleep, and she does not regret this because she knew the world would have to be in sleep for about 5 months.  In the end the movie is about science and technology and how you can't get a real good education without it.  There is also a lot of science in it, so it does have some credibility.  The most important thing about the movie was that its main villain was a mad scientist. If there was any way to avoid this villain, it would have been made by another director. I understand why it was made and why it is so great, but I would prefer to see someone else make this movie, instead of the guy who made this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the movie is bad, the reviewer will just call the movie a "frivolous" or "bogus" movie and leave it at that. You have to take this movie very seriously. The fact that it was supposed to be a comedy is probably the best thing about it. It was supposed be a silly, silly, ridiculous "what if" comedy. If you just sit back and laugh and have a great time, it works really well.    It does, but I think if you watch this movie and try to imagine what it could have been if the writers had stuck with the original concept, and not come up with some crazy plot twist, you will come to realize that this movie was a very serious movie.  The film has its moments, but there are so many serious things going on in this movie it's unbelievable. The thing I like best about the movie and the reason it got a "good" rating is that there are some characters in the movie that you get to know and really like.  The actors, the writers and the director all seem to have a lot of respect for this movie, and so do I. The movie is not very "funny" and it's just a very dramatic, dramatic movie. But it is serious, and it is so true to life, and we are so lucky that this is a movie made by people who know what they are doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found this movie to be incredibly dull. The entire movie was boring. I did not find this movie any more interesting than most other movies. I would suggest this movie only to those who want a mindless fun time. I was disappointed in how the movie took itself so seriously. Also, this movie was released in 1993 when it was still a comedy and it was hard to laugh at how out of touch it was with today's times. I could have done without the ridiculous name.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   What can you say?    I don't think I'll ever be able to watch that movie again and tell myself, "I've seen that movie before" because it really is just not my kind of movie.   And to those people who still want to say the film is a masterpiece and/or are even just "hanging out" by the popcorn:  Please. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie itself is good. The pacing of the film is right on. However, if you really are the kind of person that hates horror movies because they are so awful, don't watch this. The story is very predictable. It is all done in the first half hour. The ending is a good, but a little forced. The movie is enjoyable. I don't think I'll see the movie ever again.  The movie itself was bad. The character development is bad. But at least the movie was bad, and that's what counts. I have watched a lot of horror movies, and this movie was right up there with the bottom of the barrel. It's not that it's boring, it's just bad. I'm really glad it isn't rated. The film is over 20 years old, but it is not as terrible as it looks. It looks like the movie took a lot more time to film, or if the movie just didn't have the budget to be finished on time. I found this movie very funny, but the director is not a very good one. I enjoyed the movie, but I didn't enjoy it very much. For the longest time, I thought that the movie "A Boy and His Dog" would be a terrible movie, and I was right. However...I'm glad that I didn in fact watch it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the best movie I've ever seen. The action is soo good and the plot is so well done.  This movie was a huge surprise to me.   I know many of you have seen this movie before, but if you haven't then this movie is worth the watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You know what you're getting into.   If you haven't seen it yet, don't make the mistake of starting with "This is not a bad film. "  You're going to spend the first 5 minutes being put off by the voice over.  "I am the enemy.  I am the Enemy."  The film never tells you what the Enemy is until a couple of minutes in.  The main characters are introduced through the voice overs.  When it comes to the movie's storyline, the film follows the normal, cliche movie formula and leaves out one important detail that can not be understated.    "If it bleeds, it leads."  A girl who has gone missing for 5 years suddenly gets her head kicked in by an old, mysterious figure.  She can't remember a thing from her past, what happened to her parents and the guy she fell in love with.  That's right, she's fallen in love and the person who she fell for was a monster.  At this point, I thought the movie was over and I didn't want to bother with watching it.  I was so bored, I just wanted it to end so I could go back to the couch and watch "The Walking Dead" and have nothing to do.  Once the movie got going, I realized I wasn't going to be able to put it down.  A man who went on the run for 5 long years was finally caught.  He gets out of prison and decides to move on with his life.  This is followed by his family, and a few of the people he's close with.   The family is going to move to a new city, and the new woman in their life is a few years older than him.  Her life is going smoothly until her brother starts to act erratically.  It was a nice, family driven movie, that was told by a character that is just a little too evil for his own good.  In a movie that tries to appeal to teenagers, it was an all out effort to be adult.  Every scene was filmed in a way that was a little extreme.  There are scenes of a woman getting beaten by an angry man and then waking up with a gunshot wound in her stomach.  Or, the movie has a man who has been shot in the arm that is slowly bleeding out.  One of the worst parts of the movie is when the man
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know, it's not like I've never watched a bad comedy.   I'm a movie-goer, not a critic.  I don't even remember why I picked this up but it was on my must-watch list when I heard it was going to be in competition for my faves list and I was excited to see a comedy in the competition.  For some reason I figured I'd get a laugh out of it since the only thing in my life I have a thing for is a laugh.  The movie does have some funny parts but is very cheesy and has a cheesy plot that didn't have a whole lot of punch.  To be fair, it doesn't feel as cheesy as it really was since it got more serious and the plot of "my parents are gonna die!" was something a little more mature than the typical kid's movie.  So yeah, I was expecting a fun and goofy movie with a lot of laughter and fun and silly stuff.  And the movie does end with a funny moment in it but it really doesn't get much more than that.  Some other minor flaws with this film are that the character designs are very generic and the CGI used on the character models was just awful.  Also, this was the first film I saw of The Last Airbender and the first I had seen before that was made by The Legend of Korra (which is another show I enjoy).   The Last Dragon was better.  Conclusion:  So in conclusion, this film had me thinking:  A)  What was with the kids movie competition?   B)   It looks like this film was made for the children because it was all about laughter and giggles.  C)    This movie isn't even worth my time.  What were they thinking? Final thoughts: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The movie started out really good, as it should for a remake. I'm sure it was made in good faith, and had the best intentions. And yet, by the end of it, it just gets tiresome. The acting is weak, and I felt as if it was supposed to be a buddy comedy. The villain was really boring, and just seems to be there to keep the movie moving along. I thought the movie was supposed be about the guys bonding, and instead it just ends up being another movie that you watch, thinking that it would be a really good movie, when you're watching it again. A movie about how guys need to be closer. A funny movie. The music was good, but I wouldn't listen to it on repeat. So, I have a bad feeling about this one.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If there are any flaws in the movie, it is in the script. The dialogue can be somewhat annoying at times, as it is a bit too wordy and not well thought out. The director is probably responsible for this, as he doesn't seem to know how to handle any scene. Some scenes are a real struggle to get through and the director simply won't pull the trigger when it comes to directing the camera. There are some scenes where the camera takes up more screen than the actor, thus taking up valuable screen time. In some of the fights, the cameraman and director seem to be unable to see each other well and it makes it hard to see who is doing what and when they are doing it. In all, the film is just okay. It is just that some parts are just better than others. There is some action sequences in this film that are very good. This film is a very hard movie to watch, but if you have the patience and patience to watch through it, it will be worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie a few months ago because it was one of those movie I was going to rent but had my friends who did not care for this film and asked me to get the DVD. I had already heard a few good things about it. I was really hoping that it would be at least decent but it wasn't. It is really not worth my time and will not see it again unless I get the whole set or the DVD on a sale. It was very poorly written, there are no jokes and the characters are not very likable. At one point they have a guy try to teach a girl to ride a horse but instead of teaching her how to ride it he tries to teach her how not to ride the horse. Also the ending was kind of weird because the next scene showed a guy with a broken arm being saved from a truck by a woman with a gun, so I guess that was kind Of a cliffhanger ending.  I don't like the movie and never will again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (This review is also on my bookmarked pages). There are only so many ways to talk about "The Dark Knight Rises" that will suffice, and as I said in my original review, I'm afraid there's not one that will make me feel any better about the film, and I'm sure some of the film's fans will find it as offensive as I do. "The most difficult part for me about 'The Dark knight Rises' was just getting there. The first part is a classic action/adventure film that has a lot of action scenes, but they don't always work. The film can't decide what type of action film it wants to be. The main character doesn't need to be a hero, he doesn't have to be strong, he can't be in costume, he isn't a great fighter. This is not the Batman we're used to. We want to be Batman and he has to be who we want him to be, which we understand. But the film is very unclear on what it wants the character to be and where this will lead. And the film isn't quite clear on how the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Batman will be. So it doesn't always all come together. This can be a little jarring. In general, I think the film has an interesting premise, it has a great idea, and a great story, but it never gets there. And I don't think that's a bad thing. I just think it can be improved. I've seen this one at the multiplex many times and I love it. I think that this film will have its fans and its haters. Some people will hate it, others will hate this film, others won't be able to tell the difference, but I think most people will enjoy the film. So that's it for me. I'll watch this film again and I'll enjoy it. If you're going to see this movie, watch it at home or in a theater and enjoy it, but don't expect it to be like "The Matrix." "The Joker" didn't turn me on. I didn't love it as much as I had hoped. But "The Last Jedi" will probably turn me off, and while I enjoyed "Rogue One" I didn  Read more...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went to see "J. Edgar" with my best friend and we both loved it. We saw it when it was on opening weekend and we got a chance to see it the following night when we went to the movie theater. There was a great deal of confusion about whether it was a true crime documentary or an independent drama. The film shows an unemotional crime that took place almost two decades ago. The only person who is in the film who doesn't know this is the reporter, Ed Gein. The movie does not show this incident directly, but it portrays it in the best possible way. The interview with the reporter and Gein is a fascinating look at a man who could have easily become a serial killer. It's a powerful movie that deserves to be seen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I've been here once before and I would not recommend this place to anyone. The pizza was very bland, I didn't like it at all. My friend also ordered the same pizza and she gave it to me and I had to spit it out!" "Great pizza, I have been here several times and always enjoy my pie!" (I love my job. And not just because I work at Pizza Planet)      - You get the feeling that these words are coming from a disgruntled employee and they don't seem to have noticed that it's a very warm night, when the restaurant is full of hungry customers, and all the tables are fully occupied.   - It is a great experience to spend time with friends.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie's a movie, right? So if the movie is good, it's a great movie. If it's bad, it sucks. Or, at least, there are some positives for sure. And we can't have every movie be perfect. We've all seen it. People want a lot of bad movies. We all like movies about people who are awful. But there's a certain type of movie that is very hard to find. It's usually a little too long and has too much exposition and too much going on. It just isn't satisfying. It doesn't get me. But, hey, atleast they gave me a couple of things to talk about. I like this kind of movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you've seen this movie I hope you've never seen it. It's a waste of time and my time to watch it. You'll probably hate the movie anyway. It is so boring and uninteresting to watch. It tries to tell you what a terrible movie it is but doesn't do it properly. If you don't mind spending a few hours, I would recommend you not watch it and never watch it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a bummer this movie is. The production values look like it would be a hit at a summer blockbuster. The movie is actually quite well done in this regard, but it's still a very bad movie.   It's not a bad-looking movie, but when you're watching it, you just want to run to the exit and never look at the movie again. It's the sort of movie where the whole production looks good. But what makes this movie especially horrible is the acting. The story is presented in a fairly straightforward way, and the characters are clearly written.    But the acting is not to be trusted. It takes an entire movie to get to that point.  It is like someone wrote the entire movie and watched the actors make some of the most awkward attempts to do dialogue. The performances are just awful. It seems like the actors were not given a script and just thought they needed to get the job done. You know that you're in trouble when the people you hired to be your actors are such a disappointment. You have to wonder how this film was ever green lit in the first place. There are some actors here who were not even available for this movie, like James Garner who plays the father of the main character. He looks like he came out of an episode of The Flintstones.   If you want to see a movie that is bad, watch The Last Starfighter. Posted by Mike at 5:55 AM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My boyfriend and I made a date to go see the movie "The Hangover" in the theater.   We had just talked and we decided to take a couple drinks and have a nice dinner before seeing it.  We were so tired after the movie.  This movie was an absolute disaster.  The dialogue is bad.  In a bad way.  They had the cast members over and they never really had enough drinks and the alcohol just was not flowing.  There were some nice moments in the movie but it was just a really bad movie.     I won't be going back to this movie. The movie was too much.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved "The Other Side"   It was a very well done movie with a good story that was made to entertain and to have a laugh.  It wasn't long after I watched it that I found out the story was not based on a true story.   The film was made just to get the publicity for a movie that never was.  So why is this movie so popular?   First of all, it is a remake of a movie "The Omen"  With an older and more mature audience now, people like to watch a movie remake to relive a favorite movie or show.  The remake was made in 1990 to capitalize on the success of "The Six Million Dollar Man"  The plot is very similar to the original movie.  Instead of a group of people that are looking for a way to get rid of a demon, they go on an investigation into a church to see if there is any evidence that might help them in their investigation.  Unfortunately, they find more evidence to prove the church is evil, thus proving there are demons in the world.  They decide to investigate the church, and find out they are in the middle of a war between a demonic cult and a church.  I didn't realize how similar the plot was to "The Exorcist" until I watched the movie. There was a girl (Catherine Deneuve) that was involved in a demon killing ritual with the demon of war.  Then the demon (Hercules) and the girl (Caroline) went to war with each other and the demon had to find a way out of the war, hence "The war to end all wars."  They have to go find a ship and use a ship to get to the demon, and it has a special ship, the ship that is built for a special mission.  But the ship's captain (Richard Chamberlain) is not a good guy.  He was hired to protect his ship from evil, and he only cared about money.  And he is in love with the girl.  In a way, he is also trying to kill the demon for having the wrong idea about him.  This leads to a funny but interesting story. When they are trying to get past a demon wall that can't be passed, they realize they need to cross the wall in order to open a passage that could lead them to the ship.  Now the story keeps building on its own as the demon
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't believe what they did to this film. I was blown away by the fact that they did a live action version of the manga. But this is not something you should watch if you are just looking for an action movie with lots of action. This is a really sad film that is full of problems. This movie was not fun to watch at all. The first half of the movie was the same thing as the movies in the same universe like  Ghost in the Shell or  Ghost In The Shell 2: Innocence, except this film was directed by a child. He had to watch how to play the guitar because no one else in the family knows how to do it. This leads to a lot of fights in the second half of this film and it is really sad how the father didn't tell his son he was playing the guitar. The mother has no problem telling her son this, and the father is not very caring, and he gets really angry when his son is not performing well in school. This makes the film really boring to watch. The story is pretty much the same, except in this version there was no real development. The father tells his son that he doesn't care about him anymore, and they split up. When they split he says he never liked him anyway, and when the son wants to tell his father the truth, the father only says he doesn`t want to hear it. He never says he hates him. All the characters in the film are really uninteresting and the movie never has any suspense, but it`s more about being sad and angry about how he lost his son and how sad he is for what he did to him. There is a lot more blood in this film, and it looks really ugly. The movie is really boring and it seems like this is the only movie that this guy made for his kids.  It would be even worse if he did a film for adults instead of his kids, and I feel this is what he wanted to do with this film because his kids would have been able to have a better movie than this. The best thing about this film is how much it is trying to be cute, and how it tries to do a "Ghost in the shell" type of thing. I think the makers of this movie went to a school that teaches art or something and decided to make a film about a girl with a ghost but they didn't want to do that because they realized that no one would
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a bad film. Its not so much an adventure movie as a movie about a family on vacation with a sick kid, who has an allergy to certain plants. The whole premise of this film is ridiculous. There is absolutely nothing entertaining about the plot. It is just a bunch of ridiculous scenes. The performances are also extremely poor. Everyone who is supposed to be in this film, does not deliver. The child who is allergic to the plants, seems to be acting quite stupid throughout the film. His behavior is not good. He doesn't care when he is in danger and he doesn't seem to have any respect for the other people around him. The father is also a very unlikable character. His attempts to protect the child is very unproductive. He thinks he is the only one who can save the child. The mom and the dad are just as bad. Their attitude towards the child and each other is very disappointing. You will be laughing as you watch them. There are scenes in the film where you want to pull your hair out as you see how the family has to work themselves into a frenzy just to survive. This film is very poorly written and acted. I would definitely recommend this film to no one.   …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     - The writing was atrocious  What we are looking for:    - A real story  Why it will never happen:  - Too boring  How to tell a story:  The story is like a "movie" about a hero, a girl, and a giant. All the characters are introduced by the hero and when he defeats the evil enemy. The hero does not talk at all during the whole story because he is the main character. But when the enemy goes to a very big city, the hero becomes an ordinary person. When the hero's old friend is killed by the evil enemies, the guy becomes an orphan and he goes back to his hometown. His hometown and the girl he loved are destroyed. All of these events make the boy grow up and he decides to fight the evil.  The problem with this movie:  We see a lot of movies in this category and many people tell the same story. All those movies are bad and they are not good stories. This movie is worse than all of the other ones because the script was written by a "director" for other movies and he did not use his brain. The director had some problems with writing a story, especially the heroine and the hero. The heroine is a very beautiful girl and she is a little bit shy, but when he kisses her, she starts to get angry. The boy and the boy's old friends were introduced to us in a very bad way. They all look like zombies. 1.2 stars out of five The movie has a lot more potential if the writer had put some effort into his script and not just used it to make some money. The only positive part about this movie is that I can still watch it and I did it the first time I saw it, because that was my first time seeing a movie and I was bored and wanted to watch something else. I am sure the people who liked it will also like it when they have a chance to watch it again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just had a pretty bad day. We were driving home from my parents house and the movie I wanted to watch had just ended. The traffic on our way home was so bad that we could barely see where we were going. We had to pull over when the car broke down in the middle of the highway. When we got back to my parents I was so angry that we had to spend all night in the car. I got a few hours sleep and was able to stay up and watch the movie.   My boyfriend and I decided to watch a movie for the third time that night. We wanted to see what our friends were talking about and I was feeling really low and a little depressed. I found a website to watch movies online called Netflix so we signed up and got a free month of membership.  What a surprise! I was able watch movies for free that I never would have been able to afford otherwise. We started watching a movie called The Martian and it was amazing. We loved the characters and the action. I was even excited that my boyfriend got into his first fight ever. The movie was very funny and I really enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this movie, "Catch Me If You Can" by Richard Linklater is a must-see, and it is definitely worth your time.   This film has it all: the story, the acting, the music, the cinematography, the comedy and a touching, heart-wrenching final message.  If you want to feel what it's like to be a small boy with an enormous dream, this is definitely for you.  The movie tells the story of a man who is a pilot (played by Ethan Hawke) who, after being attacked by a bird, uses the bird's body as a way to survive the intense stress of his mission.  In the end, his survival proves his greatest fear and ultimately he learns the true meaning of love.  It's a good movie.  I didn't like it the first time I saw it, but after a while it started to grow on me.  This is a well-crafted, beautiful film, and I highly recommend it for fans of Ethan Hawkes and Richard Linkles.  My rating: 9/10 (9/10)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - You're in for a treat.  That's exactly what you'll get. The movie does not live up to the hype. It's a story about a man who loses his job as a computer programmer due to poor performance, so he takes up with a stripper. The stripper is not what you might think. She has a tragic past that will come back to haunt her. The action sequences are excellent, though the story becomes convoluted and the plot doesn't get resolved until way later. Overall, it's a fun movie, though it doesn't have the polish of some of the better movies on this list. I've given this one a 8/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen many bad movies but I am really proud of my decision to go see this movie. I never thought this movie would make me feel so nostalgic about my childhood. The cast of this movie is so amazingly talented. Everyone plays their role flawlessly and the director is able to capture the emotions of each scene perfectly. This movie is just so charming and I could watch it all day. 1 star out of 5. I would not go see any more of this crap. This movie is terrible and not worth watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "If there's a god, he has to be a very lonely god." - The King of Kong.  It's the third in a trilogy, so I'm excited.   This is a movie about an average man who wakes up one morning to find he is an ape-man.  He soon meets a woman who has come to live in his house.  She also has come from another world that has a different look and feel to our world.  In the world there are no rules.  There are no laws.  If you break one, it won't affect you but if you do something in this world that is different then you will have a huge difference in your future.  It's quite a different world than our own.  I don't think it's meant to be taken seriously, it's all a big goof.  This movie is filled with fun action and lots of jokes.  The dialogue is just ridiculous and the characters were a lot of fun to watch.  A lot of this movie was a series of vignettes that you will not be able to get out of your head.  With a movie like this you can see different things from the movie and the stories just keep coming and coming.  One of my favorite parts was when Kong has an epic fight with the giant crocodiles.  After fighting them one of the crocodiles tries to eat the others.  At the end of the fight Kong is in the water and the water makes him a giant.  While swimming he falls into a river that is full of crocodiles and they begin eating each other.  When Kong finally reaches shore he starts to eat as many crocodiles as he can.  They are only slightly bigger than him.  You really get a sense of scale and how giant he really is.   -   This movie reminded me a lot about the first film Kong.   -   I did have a little trouble following the plot and the language was a bit tricky.  -   The special effects weren't exactly great but you can't really complain.  As a result I had fun seeing the giant kong as well as the other characters.  My favorite part of the movie was probably the ending.     The movie was not nearly as good as the first movie but it was still a lot fun to see.    I've always been a huge fan of the first two movies so I was very excited to see

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So much has been said about a film like this, so let me try to sum it up here as best I can.   The film starts out with a little bit of a shock, as we are introduced to a boy called James who has a lot of emotional problems. He seems like a little child, but he is in fact a grown man, and this is something which causes a lot more problems for him than he can handle.  He is an alcoholic and he has been in a lot  problems with his family.  The father had just lost his job and has to rely on his son as the only source of income.  It would not do for this young boy to get into trouble with the law for drink or drugs.  However, this young man, James, knows exactly what he wants and he is determined to get it.  In fact, he can't stand not getting what he desires and so he sets about finding it. James soon finds himself working on a farm for an uncle that needs some help on a small plot of land.  There is something very wrong with this uncle, and we soon find out why.  He is very fierce and does not allow anyone to even look at the boy, even in the presence of the boy's girlfriend.  At first James doesn't seem to notice this, and he works on the farm all day long.  But the truth of the matter is, he has never been able to resist the temptation of women.  When he is on the phone with a woman (let's call her Sally) he tells her that he is going on a road trip and that he really wants to see Sally again.  Sally is happy for him and takes him along on his trip.  As they drive, James is clearly very happy, and that is when it really starts to get serious.  This is when James comes to realise that his life has been destroyed. He can't trust anyone and even though he thinks he has had his first sexual experience, it wasn't even sexual.  His girlfriend and his family have betrayed him, and Sally just seems to be a bit of an easy target.  James can't stop himself from lusting after her and Sally can't help him.  Soon Sally wants nothing more than to have sex with James, but his family is angry at him and insist that he can have his girlfriend back.  Things start to get really bad and it seems that
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In my book, the story of The Great Dictator is just about a movie, not a novel. The movie is more a film than a story and, like most films, is only really worth seeing if you like action, guns, explosions, and other stuff.  If you have a movie collection, you'll love this one.    If you want a good story, you can find better than this, and you'll have to look for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     No one likes a turd. And nobody likes bad movies. I would rather watch a bad film than a bad video on DVD.   The movie is good, but...  We are told by an old friend that "people who hate the movie are really unhappy people."  And we are.  In this, the film's last scene, there is a short break for a bit of fun with the children.  "The little girl goes up to us and says, "You know, you guys are great!"  It's all very nice, but the little girl is really not going to know her daughter is a grown woman and doesn't know what her mother did.   The little boy looks at her and says: "It's really weird how you two talk."  Of course, the little boy is a little girl!  But it is not just that the film ends on a strange note. It's that the story is poorly told. The movie has several characters, each with their own little sub-plots.  In the end, the movie goes back and forth between these different story lines without any real explanation of who is who and what they do. The children all have their own storylines, but they are never developed in a way that makes them interesting to watch.  It's like some of these kids just wanted to get out of the way so they could hang out with their buddy and the other girl they've been talking with for a while. It feels weird to watch a film with no real resolution because the little child characters just get tossed about and thrown into the mix.  The only real character development I felt was with the adult characters. There is one young boy who is constantly hanging out with the girl. His entire purpose is to be her friend, and he spends his time doing anything she asks of him. He is the only adult character that I liked. It is kind of weird to see the movie end with one character and then start all over with a new character. The next film has more of a resolution, but again, the new characters just don't seem to be interested in anything that the old characters have been doing.  All in all, this film was pretty boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm still in love with this movie!   The only thing that bothered me about this movie is that the ending felt so sudden and forced, like it was done just to bring out the ending.  I feel like the first three movies did a better job with the "reveal" at the end of each movie, but this movie didn't. I guess it's a good thing that it didn't have to end on a cliffhanger like that.   I'll admit that I really didn't think too much about the whole "curse" thing, but I had a vague memory of this happening in The Curse of the Jade Scorpion.  Anyway, it's not like there isn't any more mystery.  As far as I'm concerned, there's a curse at work here that isn't going to go away.     This movie also features an actor named Johnny Depp, and he is a genius.  In fact, he is so good that I feel the need to point out that he played a character who looks like someone you might see on an episode of Misfits.  A few more quotes from him:  " I love how you got a full head of hair and a full goatee... "  " They really nailed a real life pirate."  " Oh yes, I know the pirate!"  "They really nailed it!  " The character is so realistic that even though I'm only watching the movie a couple of weeks later, I feel as if I know him.  He was so good in that movie.  There was an episode on the Sci-Fi Channel that had an episode about the pirate movie that he starred in.  You can watch that on the episode guide for the movie, called "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest".    I really like the music that was used in this movie.   The movie has music by Michael Buble.   Buble also does the music for Ocean's Twelve.  "I'm gonna kick your ass!"  The most impressive thing about this film is that it was so scary that I would have walked away if I hadn't been a teenager at the time.   This movie was like that movie that was scary and scary, only I was so young and innocent.  It was one of those scary things that scared me as a kid.  After I was done with this film, I went back to watch it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved this movie. It was a great story, and it was just right that it was a dark comedy that I loved as a kid. But, the story fell apart after its second half, and I'm surprised that it wasn't even more "truly dark" like in the first half. The second half is a very, very, dark comedy and the ending was too predictable. A movie about a guy and his pet dog? It has a great ending! That was great and then the second half went downhill from there and I had to force myself to sit through the entire thing.   I'd love to read a book about a young man named John.  It's a great little book about the early days of a guy who had a pet dog. I love when a story gets old and the story becomes the character's life. I enjoyed this book a lot more than I did "Dumb & Dumber". I hope that more books like this are made.  One of my favorite books of all time.  This book is a perfect blend of fiction and non-fiction. "Dangerous Minds" is the story of a man who falls in love with a girl that he's never met. A boy who becomes very, VERY sick after a car accident in the 1970's. The book follows their relationship as they grow up together and get involved in different, scary and dangerous things. " Dangerous Minds " is one of the most intelligent books I've ever read. The author is very funny and it's great to read something that makes you laugh out loud. I found it difficult to put down and loved every minute of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "One of the most powerful and controversial films of the 20th century. The great silent star of 'Mad Men' and 'Pulp Fiction' has gone on record stating that he was forced into making this film. There are too many twists and turns, too many subtexts and too many things we just don't know. This is a film of incredible complexity and emotion, of heartbreak, of tragedy, of anger and forgiveness. It is, in my opinion, a masterpiece." - Michael Keaton "A film that does for sex and violence what 'Inglourious Basterds' did for war. This film has got to be one of the best-looking pictures ever made." - Peter Bogdanovich "I've watched this film twice, and each time I thought there was something more. Something more that made it so much more than just a crime picture." - Oliver Stone "The most intelligent, sophisticated and beautifully shot movie about sex I have ever seen." - Robert Redford "Hollywood and the film industry as a whole seem to have taken over the culture." - John Waters "This film will forever be one the most misunderstood films ever made" - Steven Spielberg "Tender-hearted and heartfelt, and not so much a crime movie as a love story." - Paul Verhoeven "Bizarrely brilliant. An extremely fine movie with a brilliant and inventive director." - Martin Scorsese "It's a beautifully photographed picture, the music is a perfect accompaniment, and the actors are all wonderful. It's an amazing film that takes everything that's beautiful about the cinema and puts it in a very strange and strange context." - Woody Allen "So many films take for granted what is so rare today: a love scene without the guilt that's usually attached to it. There's an innocence about these two people, a purity, and a tenderness. There is the real thing, a real love story, not the one Hollywood offers us, a romance. This feels like a movie that belongs in the same tradition as Ingmar Bergman's 'The Seventh Seal' or the earlier French New Wave films. And this is a good thing, because this movie has a lot of surprises, and there are quite a few thematic undercurrents throughout." - Christopher Nolan "Well worth the time it takes to see it. A very fine example of cinema, and an important film for all of

We will publish our own reviews, but you should keep in mind that these are independent opinions that are not a result of any advertising.   This is for a movie we watched with our kids.  1/5 I found it very, very hard to make sense of this movie. What happened to that great character of a "super dad"? Why did he make a mistake he couldn't get over? Was it the end of the world? What happened that caused the movie to become so bleak? Was he in love with a super mom, the mom who was not a super woman but the mom we think a super parent should be? It seemed that this mom was in a state of constant denial, because I couldn't quite understand how she was capable of living with her husband for so long. Was this a normal family? Was the woman capable of being that horrible to her husband? Did she know how bad he really was? Did the man really get a taste for the good life and now wants more?  For a film that started off with great characters and a lot of promise, it went out the window as soon as the woman lost her husband.  In closing, please don't tell us it is a good idea to send your kids to a movie with a depressed, hopeless mom.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - - - My daughter and I had a party at the beach last summer, and we saw "Krampus". She absolutely hated it. The characters are completely one dimensional and I didn't care for the overall story. The kid had an eye for the perfect girl, and the devil was just trying to get the perfect kid. The plot is the worst. I hated this movie, and I don't know how I'm supposed to justify it to my daughter now. It wasn't all bad, but it was too much like a cartoon. It's not scary at all. My daughter kept asking me why the devil is so old.    We also saw "Chalk Zone", which is also a great movie. It has some of the creepiest visuals I have seen in a while. It was actually good and not like the cartoon I had heard about. It also has some really good lines. The guy with the sunglasses at the beginning of the movie is definitely a good guy. He was also a character in the movie "Cabin Fever" and is a great addition.  I don't think anyone should see this movie because the plot and characters are boring and unbelievable. It makes it hard for me to get past the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - 1 (not great, but not bad.) - 0 (the movie was ok, but the movie was very poorly written.)  It's about a guy that wants to get a girlfriend. She has a very interesting personality and it is easy to fall for her. The problem is that she has one condition, she can only have sex with her boyfriends and a very strict rule. In order to get her to break this rule he has to give her gifts. But one night she gets caught cheating on him and he ends up losing her because he is not able to deal with her situation. It is a very sad story and I liked the way it was written. But it's hard to believe that it is a real film since I'm sure the actor didn't get the role because he can't sing.  I don't know how the writer got this movie made. I think he must have been really tired when he wrote it. I don't think he had a whole lot of money.  is a romantic comedy. It has all the classic elements of romantic comedies, but it doesn't work. It's about the guy who wants to go out with his girlfriend and she wants to stay at home. So they spend a lot of time together. In the beginning they are getting along and then one day he tells her she must give him a gift or he won't be able to go with her. She gives him a bracelet and a car and they become close. The relationship goes bad, he ends the relationship and she moves out, he goes back to work, he thinks he is a loser for being rejected, but eventually he falls in love with his girl. It was a lot worse than it should have been. At first I loved it because it was funny, but now I hate it. ,  "This is my story of my life," said the narrator as he began to tell the story of a young man who spent the last four years of his life on a college campus in a small town.

When a new freshman had moved in a few weeks ago, Jimmy's best friend started talking about her. "I'm sorry, but you have a name like I have a first name and we need each other.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked this movie. I liked it a lot. I just wanted it to be more interesting than it was. It's a film that does not seem like a whole lot, but it certainly has a lot of heart. The characters are very well drawn and each has a unique side. The story is fairly simple, but the acting is amazing. Some of the scenes in the trailer I could tell were just shot in one take. I can't wait for you all to see this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never had any real desire to see the movie, and I remember sitting there in my parents living room with my mom, my sister, and my uncle at the time watching it together. I have never seen a movie like it. It made me feel very uncomfortable. I was uncomfortable because I had to talk to my parents about it afterwards. At the end of the day I really can't say anything more positive about it than that. I wish I had seen it when I was younger because it is one of those movies you can watch with your mom on Friday and watch it on Sunday. So, if you can't stand horror films and you like horror movies with a little bit of mystery and intrigue to it I would say this is a good time for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I could give a movie a zero, it would be a film called "Don't Look Back In Anger". I was 13 years old and my parents let me watch it. I don't remember much about it other than this man who played "Bill the Butcher" was a bad, bad man. He murdered many men and women in cold blood in the late 1940s. I never watched the movie again because I was sick of it and I don 't remember the plot. There are some great performances but I don' t remember them except that the bad men had names like "Joe Bug" and "Handsome Jack". This movie was a disaster. If you want to see a movie about "Joe the Butcher", then watch the film called, "Blood Brothers" which is about two brothers who are in love with each other. "Don 't Look Back in Anger" is another movie that can make your skin crawl. There were many actors that looked like they were in movies and the people in this movie were all ugly. I think that they used cheap makeup and cheap sets and they gave it the look of a bad film. I would rather see a bad picture in a movie theater than see a horrible movie that is made for some profit at the expense of our fellow man. There's something wrong with the world when you can see horrible pictures and make money off of them. If your an adult and you are making movies, please try to give us a decent movie. I really enjoyed this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I think this is a great movie. I love it!    The only problem is the poor acting and the slow pacing!"   I don't know who wrote this.   If I'm writing a movie review about it, I won't write, "This is a fantastic movie!" I'd write,  "I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, and the acting was fine. I only wish it had had better acting!"  Why isn't that the kind of review I'd expect?   To tell the truth, I haven't seen the movie.  The trailer is great though!  My daughter and I spent a little time last weekend watching it. I am impressed.  It was a great film.  I liked the way the script and acting were done. I'm not sure if it could have been better if you were going to do a sequel.  Maybe it could be better in some areas.  What do you think? I don't get the negative reviews. I like movies.  "It's a bad film. The actors don't look like they have any idea what they are doing."   Not a problem!  It just shows that I have a small child who doesn't know what movies are.  She has just been shown a trailer for the film. She says the actors "look" like they don't understand what they're doing.  In this movie there are scenes that don't have any dialog.  You have to see to know what's happening. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The problem I have with this movie is it's not good. It has a very slow beginning, and I think it takes away from some of the characters that are introduced and have some interesting parts.   It's also very predictable that the story would just end up being about a family's struggle with death.  One thing I can say for this film is that it does not have an annoying voice-over narration, which is a good thing for some movies.  I feel this movie gets one star for being one of the best movies I have seen this year, even though I enjoyed it more than some of my other favorites.    I think that this movie had a more mature approach than some other movies I was seeing in theaters, but it's still a pretty good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best way to enjoy this movie is by not thinking about it, as the movie doesn't really care about you as a viewer.   It is a strange mixture of horror, sci-fi and humor, and it does a great job at making you laugh at one point or another, but you can't stop laughing because it's so ridiculous and over-the-top that there's no point in slowing down to take your mind off of it.  And it would be a crime if I didn't give it my absolute stamp of approval.  It has everything I look for in a movie - good jokes, fast paced action, and a great cast of characters.  The only problem is that the movie can get very old very fast, and you'll be wanting something new to watch when you get to the credits.  However, I'm glad that I have seen this film before and now have the confidence in me to go into it completely blind, so I can just enjoy it in the most innocent of ways - no idea how it's going to affect my mood.  You should also watch it for the opening theme song "The Evil Dead" by Johnny "Guitar" Watson, and for the creepy atmosphere it creates.  I also recommend the DVD (in case it's out of print).  I give it an A for entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are having a really bad time watching a movie: What movie were you watching?   Did you watch a bad remake, or a bad version of a movie you were already sick of?  Did the movie just give you a headache?  If it was a bad original movie, then you can't even go to the store to buy a replacement.  If your movie sucked, and it was terrible (like so many of them in this series) then I think you should give it a shot to see if you could enjoy it at all. I would recommend trying to like it, even if you're not a big fan of these movies.  Also, for the people who watch too many horror movies: if you like to watch horror movies, then there's a chance that you may enjoy it. The only reason I can think of is that the people making these movies like to get ratings.  The sequel to The Hills Have Eyes -  I really have no complaints about the movie itself, so I won't get into that.   What I will say is that I thought The Hills had a bit too many characters and plot-holes.  There is a very creepy scene in the movie where a man who is supposed to be dead in the first movie suddenly appears.  This scene is creepy, but it's not even remotely realistic.  It seemed more like a plot device.  I also thought that the second half of the movie went a bit way too fast.  They only have the main characters for a few hours, and they don't really get a real chance to explore the world and meet new characters.  Another point I wanted to bring up is the fact that the opening of the second movie is just a montage.  The rest of the film feels like they are trying to cram in as much gore as they can.  As for the ending, I thought it was the most interesting part of the series.  But overall, I wouldn't recommend this to any horror movie fan.  A few more people who like horror films should check this out.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it was a big mistake when the new Star Wars movie came out in 2013. The plot was weak, the acting was laughable and the animation was worse than Jar Jar Binks. This was the only good thing about the movie. But you know what, the people in the movie probably did like it, so I guess the movie was fine. I am going to give it another watch, but I think a Star Wars comic is a good idea. If the movies are that good, you don't have to rely on the movies for entertainment. I know they can't beat the movies in box office, but still I want a comic. There is something about that universe that has always been special. It would be fun to see that in a comic book. And for that I will be waiting. - May 15, 2013Star Wars: The Comic - June 17, 2013I'd love to read a StarWars comic book - September 7, 2013Oh yes it's here! - October 6, 2013Wow! You know what would be awesome, though? A full-on Star Wars book.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most enjoyable film that I have ever seen in the entire genre is not a movie for everyone. The story is very basic and the characters are very shallow. I understand that a movie like this is meant to entertain us as much as possible but there is so much depth that you need to understand it on some level. One thing that I do think is kind of a problem for some people is that the story starts off so fast.  A group of people get caught up in an old abandoned mine in rural New England and find themselves trapped. The film really doesn't have a real ending.   All you get to see is a little bit of their lives, a little of them going about their business and then the mine is suddenly blown up.  I really liked the first film so much because it wasn't a film about "The Walking Dead" but a film that is meant for us "The Living". It was just a really funny, exciting, and entertaining movie. The new film is even better.  I really enjoyed this film a lot.  What did I like about the original?   It wasn't the plot or characters but the story itself was very engaging and kept me intrigued throughout the entire film.  When I was watching this film I found myself really getting to know and like all the people that were trapped in this mine.  Also, there is some really good dialogue throughout the movie.  If you aren't familiar with this film then I would recommend you watch the first one first so you can really understand what the characters were saying.  This movie is not for everyone but if you have watched "The Last of Us" then you will have a good idea what to expect.   "The Wrecking Crew" is not going to be for everyone, but it is definitely a good movie. Check it out, and then tell me what you think!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this when it first came out and was disappointed to say the least.   When the movie is not as good as the trailers makes it sound, the fact that it is the first of its kind and so different than anything I have seen before (besides some other movies I saw) makes it a big letdown.  For starters, the first thing that pops into your mind when you hear the title is "WWE Wrestling" which for some reason, is always in the title of any wrestling movie.  I can understand that this movie will make some of you nervous as it's the biggest movie of its type since the "Ultimate Warrior" made and as I said above, it's definitely the biggest of its class.  The first twenty minutes of the movie have some cool set ups and an interesting story that takes a turn when the action kicks in.  After a minute or so it starts to become cheesy and then the movie quickly turns into a train wreck.  It's very obvious that this was made to make a quick buck and is probably the worst wrestling movie I have ever seen.  The story is boring, the characters are not believable, the camera doesn't hold up well and I found myself laughing at the ridiculousness of the script.  Also, I found it funny that the director thought that his movie would be a big hit but only made it a decent one.    So to sum it up, it isn't a good movie and I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  You can watch some of the better ones on youtube and I can only hope that someday I'll get over this horrible movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (not for the first time!) This movie did me in, with a plot so dumb it almost makes a scene in 'Star Wars' look like a classic.   I'll admit that, to be fair, there were moments where I got a kick out of it; it was fun watching my friends, who are almost as crazy as I, try to outwit the "bad guys."   However, the whole plot is so ridiculous, it would take a special kind of person to think it's good.  Even when the plot does work, it's not a "star" character (and the worst character ever) that we want to cheer on.     As much as I tried to care about the characters, it wasn't easy.  There was almost zero motivation.  One character was so unimportant to the story, that her only purpose was to keep getting murdered (and in turn, make her own demise more fun).   What I'm trying to say here is that this movie is a huge waste of time.     The only reason it lasted as long as it did was because, unlike the recent movies that failed to excite us, this one didn't seem to care that much about its own plot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I really enjoyed this movie, even though it does have some issues with pacing. The pacing was great in the beginning, but by the end of it the pacing started to slow down and it was getting hard to keep watching. In the beginning the characters were really interesting, but in the middle of the movie it seemed like they were starting to be repetitive. The only thing I can recommend this movie is if you are a fan of comedies, it has really funny scenes, but if you aren't a fan then it might not be your cup of tea.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You probably aren't a movie critic. There are plenty of people who write negative reviews on movies that are bad but they're mostly just writing from the perspective of a fan who has not seen the movie. There's not many movie critics that can say they have seen all of the movies that a particular director makes. When you're writing a negative comment, you're not really taking a side on the movie, you aren't making a decision whether you want to see it or not. You're just commenting on the overall quality of the film.   When I watch a film that is pretty bad I always start out by going over my first three lines of review with a friend. Usually I'll mention a few things that I liked or didn't like and then go into the main points of the review. If the director makes a mistake that is really bad I may mention that but I always try to point out when the director is wrong in his or her approach.  I've read several reviews where people say they watched a movie only for them to discover that it was terrible. It's really quite sad to see how many people see a movie but think they didn't really watch it.  So in other words I don't want you to think that a negative movie review means that the movie was bad.  Most of the time I find a film good, but sometimes I'm disappointed.  Now if you haven't seen The Thing it may be hard to understand the difference between the bad and the terrible. The movie that I refer to is called "The Thing" and was directed by the legendary Wes Craven. The film was based on a short story by a writer named John Le Carre, and was written in 1981. In the story a group of soldiers were stranded in Antarctica on a small research vessel. The thing that was bothering them was that they had no food and all of their supplies were running out. The fact that the ship was small meant that they could barely move around, and the ship's computer was on the verge of exploding. The captain of the ship managed to get it repaired by stealing a few of the scientific instruments from the expedition. The story was pretty good, and has an amazing cast. The Thing was not the best movie that Wes Cravers made. It doesn't win any awards. The characters were unlikable, and although there are several different aspects to the film, some of them could use a little work. However, it is still
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the great joys of seeing "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" was watching an entirely new movie with all the new characters from the novel. That meant the whole movie could be enjoyed as a standalone. There was a long introduction in the beginning, that told a lot about the characters and the setting. At the beginning the movie could easily be seen as a fantasy movie, as it was the elves and dwarves that had all their powers of speed and flight and were very colorful. The music was great, as well, the score was beautiful and the acting from the cast was outstanding. "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" is set a long time ago in a fantasy world of the characters from "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them". The story is based on Newt Scamander, the author of the first installment of "Harry Potter" series, and as he is trying to find a way back to his world, he is getting a lot of help from the creatures in this world. This movie is set at the beginning of the movie, when Newt Scamnander has already found some of the creatures of his world and is also trying to make a deal with them to help him get to his country, so that he can escape this nightmare. This is not the first time a movie had a story in a faraway world, however, in "Fantasy" we got a bit more information about this world and the creatures and wizards that live there. That was very nice, as we knew that we were going to meet some strange creatures, but we didn't know exactly how far away they were. And it is a pity that they didn't give us some background information about them, that would have been nice. "Catching Fire". is also a bit better movie, but it does not compare to "The Wizard of Oz". As I said in the previous review of this movie, "Wizard of Oz" was a much more interesting movie and also a much better movie. The characters of "Wizards of Oz", are a bit too simple, so when we meet them again we feel sorry for them, and also for the wizard (the other character in the movie). I felt like there was not much of character development in this movie (as compared to "Oz"). The characters are still very nice and the way they interact with each other, however it just doesn't look like they have any real personality, as far as I can
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was released in the year 1982. In order to promote the movie, it was screened for the school and community members, to show how much a film with a plot and character development can do. The movie was an adaptation of a book written by the author of this movie. It was a sequel to the movie "The Last Emperor". The plot of the movie was based on the book "The Secret Weapon". The book was published in 1981 and it was published by a publishing company called  Penguin Press. The book is a historical fiction book about the time of the Roman Empire. The character of the book is called Julius Caesar, a Roman ruler who had many enemies. In this book, Caesar is fighting against the Roman army and is about to become emperor. After that, a soldier, who was a member of the army, assassinated Caesar. Later Caesar and his followers found out that the soldier who had been killed was actually Caesar's son, who had already started to grow up and was a very promising boy. A group of conspirators, who also were from the Roman legion, came together to destroy Caesar and to take his throne, but a group of people, who were his loyal allies, protected Caesar. Now, we see the story of the group of the people that were supporting Caesar. The main character of this book was a young Roman soldier named Mark Antony. Mark Antoine was the only member of his legion who did not kill his father, and his people believed that Mark Antinous was the son of Caesar. Mark was very loyal to his people, and they trusted Mark's word. Mark had only one goal in life. To become Emperor of Rome. As we all know, in our culture, the Roman people were not very trusting of other people. They were very suspicious and suspicious of other cultures, religion, and traditions. A lot of them were really afraid that the emperor might be a traitor. This movie shows us the life of Mark Antonius, as he goes through the trial and struggle of becoming Emperor of the Romans. In one way, we can compare Mark Antonis with other characters in our daily life, because this book and movie have a very similar plot. In some way Mark Antinus was very much like the protagonist of the novel by David McCullough. They both were born as a Roman citizen. They are both a leader of a Roman legion. Both have many enemies and people are trying to take their power. The Roman and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I am a very negative person, and I usually avoid movies. However, this is one of those movies, and it is not even worth the five stars you have given it." I don't know how people can be so mean about something so good. If you want to find something good, go to a zoo and look for the elephant.  This is really a movie for my generation. It is full of teenagers, and they are smart.  It is so funny, and so many things are funny, so I have to mention it. One of the things I liked about the movie was the fact that we didn't know who the main character is. We only saw the back of his head. I really wanted to see this movie again, because I loved it so much. I still remember the feeling of being scared. The movie is really scary.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Do you like watching terrible movies and trying to avoid them?   What do you do when you find a movie that is bad, but you still enjoy watching it and would like to see it again?    Do you like the idea of being a good critic but find that it is too difficult to actually do so?   Do you have a love-hate relationship with criticism and want to find a way to avoid watching bad movies?   Would you rather watch something that is good, but just not very good?  How many bad movies would you like to watch?  If you had to pick just one bad movie, what is the worst one you would like?  I have done this before, and like it.  This is another topic I hope to revisit sometime, and do it better. My current favorite movie is: The Matrix Reloaded In the world of film critics, The Matrix is a classic film that everyone loves.   It is a good film, but I don't think it is necessarily "great."  While I have to agree that The Matrix was a film of its time and not very well received, I still think it holds up and will be a movie you watch over and over and find something new in it.   I have found that The Man Who Fell To Earth is actually a better film.   The Matrix didn't really give me anything that the original did, but it did give me the experience of seeing something new.   Like all classic films, it did not hold up to the standards of today's films, but there is still something to learn from the film, and I hope someone out there has the opportunity to see this film, because it is pretty awesome.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   " It just was NOT  well written." I would say that it is a great example of "The 'New' Hollywood" or the " New Wave", or the new "American Film".  It was one of the first of its kind. The plot is as simple as a Hollywood script,  and the acting is absolutely marvelous.  The film was written by Walter Murch (in collaboration with the great writer/director/producer Robert Evans).  A big influence on the movie was the movie  The Wizard of Oz.   The story is the classic story of a lost girl.   It was written and directed by the the great George Stevens.  The cast is one of its finest, with Cary Grant, Richard Crenna, Marlene Dietrich, and the late Harry Carey.  They all are superb.  One of the greatest actors of his time, George Stevens was in many a great movie in his life, but this was the film that he thought was his best.  While it was written in 1933, Stevens had never seen the film until he came to do a documentary on it, and his reaction was not what I expected, I thought it would be more along the lines of  The Big Sleep.  For Stevens, it was a much bigger movie than he was accustomed to.                What is the plot of this movie?    This movie is all about  The Wizard of OZ.  It centers on a little girl named Dorothy Gale who is the only girl in a world full of magic and mystery.  She has no idea who she is, where she comes from, or what is going on.  Once Dorothy is introduced to the magic of Oz, and she learns a little about her past, she finds that she has more in common with the Wizard of  Oz than with anyone else.  And then the movie just got better and better.  I love that the movie gives you this great overview of the movie.   And in true Hollywood fashion, it starts out with Dorothy and the Wizard going to the Emerald City.  In the first few scenes of the film, we see Dorothy and her aunt talking in the kitchen.  But the real magic is when she enters the Emerald Kingdom.  Here she discovers that she is a part of a strange family.  This is just the beginning of the story.  By the time Dorothy
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For a movie that was so incredibly bad I could never forgive it for the sheer lack of effort put into making it a decent movie. A truly awful, awful movie that actually gave me a feeling that this guy really sucked.   It was like watching some kind of old black and white silent film from the 1940's.  It had the same kind of bad atmosphere that black andwhite silent movies had back in the day.  This guy seems to be like that one old black & white silent movie who gets so upset over things he cannot understand.  He doesn't talk, he doesn't make eye contact, he has no emotion.  The only thing he seems to have in common with this movie is the color scheme.  And as we see in the trailer he is actually talking in his own voice.  I am actually surprised he does not get shot by the cops or something because he is just so annoying.  Now to make this movie better would have cost more money than it cost to make and that's just not good business.  But I will say the plot was bad.  At first I thought this was going to be a buddy cop movie like The Getaway but instead we got an evil cop movie and even though the movie tries hard to make a good cop movie there is nothing there.  Well maybe this guy could have been a good guy except for the fact that he sucks.  A movie with a big budget that makes it look like a big studio film but doesn't have a chance to work.  There are scenes of this movie where he tries to take a kid in a wheelchair and the kid falls over and it looks like a scene straight out of a bad action movie.  As a kid I didn't care about anything this movie tries to sell me on.  No story, no plot and no emotion from the guy.  For some reason I think he is really trying to give this movie some charm so I hope this is the movie he was hired to make.  That being said he is so bad he would probably make a terrible dad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      "Oh, yes, I'm not going to watch this again, I hate this movie, and I can't wait until they remake it." That was one of the first comments I got.    My sister and I met at a Halloween party.  "You're very pretty. Have you seen the movie?  "  I hadn't and didn't.  "I saw this for Halloween.  The movie looks like you're going through a bad divorce.  We didn't have any makeup on so we had to put on fake glasses for the party. "  My sister and I were dressed as an elderly couple in a reception hallway.    "It was a really funny movie."   We watched "The Love Bug" together.  After we finished the movie my sister turned off the movie on the television and we went to bed.  At 7:00 a.m. my sister got up to go to work.  My brother and I were still in bed. At 9:00 my brother and my mother came home and my sister had told them about the movie and my brother was getting ready for work and I was just getting dressed for the day.  I had no idea that something so ridiculous would happen.  When my mother returned from work she asked my sister if she was going to be able to make it to her job at the movie theater that night.  She assured her that she was.   After leaving my sister's house, I met my sister for the first time. I had been watching TV for so long that I was not paying attention to where I was going.  She was standing behind me and I couldn't tell she was actually there.  Then my sister asked me why I was so quiet.  Apparently, I had walked up to her and said, "You look so pretty."  My father had told me I was a very pretty little girl and it seemed to make her feel good to say that.   My sister smiled and I blushed.   This made my sister even happier than I was.  It wasn't long before we went out for our first date.  Our first date was to a theater to see a movie called "The Kiss" directed by Richard Fleischer.  Fleischer was one the most influential and well-known movie directors of the time.  This movie was about a man who was trying to seduce his wife and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to write a negative film review, don't be afraid to talk about the bad movie. If the movie is bad, the review is also bad. Just write the movie was bad and that's the way it is. It might not be the best movie you've seen, but just write the story in a bad way that it's not really good for the story. It's not that this movie was good, it's just that in this movie they just have a bad plot and bad acting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    * * I've read it once, and watched the DVD twice:  *   * It's probably a great movie: *  The original movie was pretty funny. It was the first time I had seen an actual movie with the word'sex' in the title. I was intrigued by the idea. In the original, an adult man, named Bob, falls in love with a teenage girl named Linda (the daughter of the man's boss) and wants to have sex with her. He meets her at a party and they fall in love. They fall in a hotel, and the only way they can be separated is to have anal sex. Here is the scene: (from the "Sex in the 80's" website ) There is nothing funny about that. That scene was not funny in the original. It's just there for shock value.      In real life, sex is always done with an erection.  Bob falls in like a wrecking ball and the girl is lying on the bed. She is on all fours. The girl is not interested, even though Bob is, so he continues to have a sex with his erect penis.  He's having sex with the girl in a very strange manner that, to me, was very odd. She seemed to be in a lot of pain.  The girl can't get hard.  It seems that Bob needs to use his other hand to pull the girl off him.  She is screaming in pain. I know she is just a teenage actress but it was a bit uncomfortable. She would have been in much better shape if she had gone to a real sex therapist and had a penis pump.  Bob tries to give her oral sex but can't because the girl still can't orgasm. Bob gets up and continues to fool around with the woman.  He eventually has sex with another woman. They end up having anal sex and eventually Bob gets an erection and the woman has a massive orgasm. This all happens in a few minutes, and you don't even realize it was over. Bob then has sex a second time and the movie ends.  In a way, the original movie made me laugh a bit. I've been in the same situation with a very popular person, and there's a lot more fun to be had. I'm a little surprised this didn't get more publicity at the time.  A lot of people would have laughed

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is good for a laugh a it may have some very deep themes about the nature of the human psyche, human morality, the psychology of crime and law etc. But like all the films I have seen that try to be deep in some form it is shallow in the depth it goes into the characters and their stories.   There are elements in this film that have great potential and will surely resonate with some but not with all.  The themes are not new to Hollywood movies but they have been done to death. I would like to see a more focused and more subtle film that is focused on character and story instead of on the drama. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The biggest problem with this movie was that it felt like it was rushed. In fact, it looked rushed. There were moments when the movie seemed rushed as well.   But it still managed to be enjoyable in its own way.  But the biggest problem was that the movie felt like a rushed project.  The character development of most characters, especially the main character, was very superficial and unnecessary.  Even the movie's story was very simple and shallow.  It just felt like I was watching a movie. I'm sure there are much better movies out there but this is a bad one.  The first hour and a half of this movie is great:  So far, this is the best hour and half of the movie.  I was surprised when I saw that this movie lasted for two hours. But it also seems like the movie could have lasted much longer. I loved this movie for the first hour.  Unfortunately, the movie slowly went downhill from there.  There were so many plot holes in this movie. How the main characters could possibly go to the beach without getting seasick. How they could get to the island without getting their clothes dirty. How it's possible to see the ocean in the middle of a desert. The ending just felt off.  This movie was just not good.    So, why did I give this movie 4 out of 5?   For the first five or so minutes, this movie feels like a real movie. It feels like you are watching a real film. There are interesting characters, a decent plot, and a decent director. But, by the time it got to the second half of its running time, it felt very rushed. And by the second hour of its run time, I began to feel a little irritated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think there are many good movies out there. I haven't seen every film, but I try to stay open-minded. There have been a lot of bad movies I haven.t seen and I can tell you that most of the bad films have a point and you have to read the book or watch the movie to understand what the point is and why it is important. I've been looking for a book with the word "BORING" in the title for a year now. Well, I found the book.   So I don't know if I will watch this movie, but it looks like a good idea to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw "Sugarplum Fairytale" for the first time with my aunt. We were both surprised that the film had no originality whatsoever. It was just a remake of a film we had already seen. What a shame! It looked so much more interesting when it was new and fresh and original.   I'm sure this was written by a young girl who was embarrassed about her new haircut.  We all know by now that films can be remakes and remakes can be better than the originals. I don't think anyone will criticize a film for having bad dialogue if they have great scenes that can be used to set up the next scenes. "Sugarpoon Fairytale," however, is so bad that it's actually the opposite. I can't remember a bad moment in the film. There are a few moments, such as the "The Drowsy Ride," that are memorable, but overall the film is so boring that I doubt anyone will remember anything that happened in it.  Here's one scene that I will never forget.  This is a scene that was reused several times throughout the film; there are no new ideas in this scene.  The "Soylent Green" is a horrible film. It has nothing new to offer, and is just a very bad movie.  I can forgive it for being remade many times before it got released, but they could have done so much better by simply using the original footage from the film and getting it out there so that people could enjoy the film with fresh eyes.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I enjoyed this movie very much, and I didn't expect much from it. The plot was quite weak and it was pretty confusing as to why we had to go out and rescue our friends, but hey, it's not like I've watched the film and have any real understanding of what's going on. The story was interesting and fun and I even found a little something about the story that actually made me care about the main characters. I just wish the plot wasn't so weak, and that the plot was a bit more logical. The ending was quite abrupt, and the movie did seem rushed. I also thought the music was pretty bad, but the music did help make this movie more entertaining. Overall, this was a fun movie that I can get into again and again. I enjoyed the story and I enjoyed watching it again, and it would be a good movie to watch with a couple friends on a rainy day.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    *   * *  I like the idea of having a movie called "How to be a Woman" and I like the fact that people are talking about it. But, I like women that don't think this way. I don't care if they're "progressive" or "liberal" or whatever, they need to grow up and stop playing a "prostitute" and "woman" to their "men" or to try to change their "man" with some "political correctness". This movie was one of the worst and most "insulting" things I've seen and it's disgusting and a waste of my time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best films are the ones that try to address deep and interesting issues, that show how we can think for ourselves and use our senses. It is not that they are the most original, because it is a cliché to show a woman trying to find her place in a society that makes her feel ugly, helpless, and insignificant, because she is different. In the first place, we have no choice but to live in a world that has decided that a woman is not a human being, that has forgotten how to love her, because her intelligence and her worth are not a sufficient reason for a man. She is not able to live on the streets, where it is normal for her to have an apartment, not a whorehouse where she has a chance to earn a living and make a decent living for herself and her children. In reality, a girl like Maria is not worth it. When we read stories about Maria, we see how the world treats her. The most interesting characters in this movie are Maria and her daughter Ana. They are the only ones who have some dignity and self-respect, because they are brave enough to take care of themselves and to live their own lives without the help of society. The film shows the reality of a poor and ignorant woman living on the street. Her daughter is the first to have the right and dignity to survive, and to have a normal life. Maria is weak and timid, and she feels the weight of the world's injustice on her. But she has the strength to be strong enough to see that her daughter will not survive if she is left alone. The story is told from the point of view of Maria, but she is the protagonist. The movie deals with important issues, and there is always something to understand and to talk about.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing that I didn't like about this movie was that we saw it in the theater with a bad earpiece. I was sitting in a very small theatre and we had to use my own.   It was the first time I ever had a movie with a negative score (yes, I have seen it on YouTube), but it wasn't that bad of a movie.    The film was pretty good, but the soundtrack really brought the movie down.  The film was well shot and the script was pretty entertaining.  This is not a film that's a great movie, but it does have some good performances.  If you want something good to watch at a movie theatre then go see this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of "I Love You Phillip Morris" was that Phillip Morris, a wealthy American businessman, traveled to Australia to marry the girl of his choice. He met her in the jungle, where they had sex and fell in love. The girl later turned out to be the daughter of the president of a company Morris was secretly working for, and Philip Morris was forced to return to America to face a murder charge. But what you would never know, in this movie, is that the love between Philip Morris and the girl was a sham. She never actually loved him, and she never wanted to love him. They just met. They had sex. Then she went back to America, married a younger man and had four children. Phillip Morris was never even allowed to meet her children. He and the woman he was going to marry lived together for two years, and he became very disillusioned with life and wanted out. The movie makes a great deal of Phillip Morris being a "lunatic" with no respect for life. But it's a sham, just like everything else about the story. Phillip was a very rich and accomplished businessman who had all the money in the world and never had to work a day in his life. The reason he was on the trip is that his company, which he ran by himself, wanted to test the water for a big new project. He was going there as a "test case" to see how people would react if they suddenly found that there was a rich man living with the daughter or granddaughter of the country's leader. I'd say that's a pretty high hurdle to clear, I've seen worse. So Philip Morris did meet a girl who "really liked him," as he put it in the movie, and when she learned that she didn't really have any love for him, he abandoned her and took off to Europe for the rest of his life...as a rich, married man. A lot of people liked this movie. Some people thought it was a great "biography," but a lot of other people didn't. Some of the critics said that the woman played by the great Linda Darnell was the real victim in this story, that she was exploited by a rich and powerful man who never really loved her. I think that is wrong, and I think people who think so are just confused. It seems to me that Linda Darshell has much more in common with "Philip Morris" than "the daughter of a corrupt
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "This is a bad film that needs to be seen in a theater to appreciate."   - John Rogers - Movie Guide Posted by Steve W. at 7:26 AM No comments: The story of the original Ghostbusters - a bunch of paranormal investigators, a TV show about a supernatural team that gets the job done. When they go to investigate the destruction of a ghost town, they are captured by a creature that takes them into a parallel universe. They are soon thrown into a fight for their lives against the forces of a demonic force.   Posted on by Steve (K.O.L.) at 2:59 AM No comment: I watched this at about 2 or 3 in the afternoon when it aired on TV - I'm not sure it's quite old enough to be called a cult classic. The characters seem to be about as real and as sincere as you'll find. The way the show was presented made it seem like it was going on for at least 40 years.  "You're going to take me to New York? For all the money in the world?"   This is a very well put together series of shorts.  I believe the show has gotten a cult following because of the high quality of the shorts and the fact that this was the very first film to feature the group of women. This is in spite of the fact there is no female lead to speak of and the main characters are all male. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "That thing with the bad guy that was in that movie about a guy who plays a bad guy," and you'll be writing, "That movie was good and all but the bad thing was that he was so bad that it was so painful to see him in that role," or "I hated that movie, it was a bad thing, but it was good. The acting was okay. The music was okay," and I've always been bothered by this, because this movie is about someone who plays the bad kid. You can look around at what's going on in Hollywood these days and find all kinds of bad-guy movies. The guys on the block get to be bad guys and then they all go and act in these movies, and when they are on screen in these bad movies, the audience goes, "It's bad to be a bad kid," and then the bad boy gets better and the good kid goes to jail, so that's what I've been thinking about. I don't know what's gonna happen, so I'm gonna let it happen."  That's a pretty good way of putting it.  You know, that's a great idea! [Laughs.] I mean, yeah, maybe, at some point, some of these bad kids will come back, and we'll have all these bad actors playing bad roles. It'll be terrible. ...  So what do you want to do, what's next for you?  I haven't been asked that yet, but I've also been asked to do a TV pilot or something that I'm very excited about, so let's see.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My girlfriend went with me to see 'Cemetery Of Splendour' in Calgary. We were told to expect the usual horrible, terrible, horrible movie. I've seen more mediocre films that way but it didn't bother me. I went in expecting a cheap, unoriginal, poorly made movie. When I saw the trailer, I thought the whole movie would be just another "Cemetery of Splendors" or "Coffin Full of Spiders" and then I was sorely mistaken. The trailer doesn't show any of the horror scenes in the film and I was pretty disappointed when I got home and saw this. I was expecting a horrible, horrible, "Corto Maltese". Instead, I got a really good, original, unique movie. I was really excited to see the trailer for this film because I was told that it would be about a woman who goes into a coffin to solve a murder. The film's trailer was really good. I enjoyed that the filmmakers actually put a scene of people going into the coffin with the woman and talking about how cool it was. I thought they had some good, creative camera work. Unfortunately, the film did not live up to that hype. It was ok. The only other negative thing about this movie is the bad acting. I'm not sure how this movie could have gotten a PG rating but I guess the censors didn't like the whole coffin part. Even with that, I don't think I would have minded the movie. My girlfriend really liked it and I think that shows in her review. There were some parts of the movie that didn't really work for me but she wasn't bothered by that. I think my problems with the film stem from the fact that I never felt like the filmmakers showed me what the movie was about. Sure, there are some scenes that were interesting but not enough to really stick out. Another thing that bothered me is that I would like to see a really weird sex scene in this movie because I can't think of any other thing more sex-y than a coffin. However, the filmmakers don't give you enough time to get in there with the character. There are a few scenes where the character is in the coffin, but most of the time he's in some other kind of room or something like that. The sex scenes were a letdown because they weren't as good as I would've hoped. A big part of the problem with the movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     So that was a good movie. But what did I expect from a bad film? Well, I don't really think that it was a bad motion picture. It was very uninspired and I was left feeling disappointed by it. But at the same time, it has a lot of charm and a good ending that I feel was the main reason why this film was not a total failure. And I also enjoyed the comedy a lot. A lot of it had some pretty funny lines. The story was really good and the story-line was interesting. I like the characters and how they portrayed their situations. There were a few flaws that I felt the film could have been better. The acting was okay but I felt that there were a lot more scenes that were boring. The script seemed a little bit more rushed than I thought it would be. And I think that the music and some of the effects could have used a bit more time to add to the movie. I would definitely recommend this movie to people who liked the original film. I think it was better than that movie but I just don't know if it was all it could have done. I liked the character development that it had and I think I would have liked it even more if they had included the comedy. There was a lot to like about this film and I really want to see it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In no way was I disappointed, but I think the story was just way too unbelievable to me. And you really can't expect the same movie from every one of the filmmakers.     I guess if you're going to give a movie a 'bad review', you can't really expect the movie to be great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a very bad movie. If you've never seen a film like this before, go and see it. Watch this and the one before it (The Last House On The Left). Don't be like me and look away. A bad movie can be great if you're a real sucker for gore and violence. This is not. Watch it and see. - June 12, 2010One of the worst films I have ever seen.  Reviewer: Mizzer - favorite favorite favorite - May 24, 2010  Subject: Why do they have to ruin things? I just watched this about a week ago and was amazed by the quality and the acting. I was at work at the time but was lucky enough to catch a screening. Not really my style of cinema, I prefer documentaries and documentaries over anything else. This was a lot better than most and in a good way, so I was shocked to read that this is so bad that the director went bankrupt in bankruptcy and this film is actually in some kind of archive. If I had known about this film, I would have avoided this and others that have the director in the bankruptcy and I'm surprised more people haven't done this. - May 9, 2010Why do they need to ruin it?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What you don't know you can say The original film is about a former marine who's given a chance at parole in return for his assistance with the investigation of the murder of his girlfriend. He is immediately forced into a situation where he has to choose between his old life and the future he's been promised. The original film has been called a love letter to a type of film noir, and while it is certainly that, it is really a very good film in it's own right. The characters are very well developed. We know a great deal about the characters' pasts, and it is this history that drives their decisions. The film also contains a lot of action that isn't as gratuitous as it might be. The only flaw in the film, it would seem, is the music. It doesn't help that the score is by one of the most prolific film composers of all time, but this doesn't take away from the film. The best part of the film is that it is so easily accessible. While it is not a difficult film to get into, it can be quite overwhelming at times. This is particularly true with the first act. It starts with a lot going on, and is very good at building it up to where you get to the point where you are almost afraid to turn the film off, and even when you turn the lights off, the film just keeps on going. The second act is a good improvement on the first, and does a good job of showing just how much the characters care for each other, but unfortunately, there is still too much going on to make it really effective. While this is a film that is easy to watch, and has a lot to offer, I can't really recommend it without some warnings. It might just be too difficult.

"  I have not seen all of the movies this year, and I'm sure there were other movies that I missed, but this was the most "bad". I am not talking about all of its bad moments (there are a lot of them), but rather about this film's most fundamental mistake. And that is the most fundamental of all the mistakes in this "trash film":  it is a lazy and mediocre movie.   It is an empty movie with an uninteresting plot and a boring story.  I hate this movie because it is nothing but a waste!

They're driving around and they're going to the beach but the beach isn't working. After getting off the road they head to a city and see that all the lights are out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is my favorite movie, and the best one I've seen. I've listened to it at least 40 times, and have heard my sister and mom sing along to the music. The movie is about a young girl named Hannah, who was born a vampire, but was then exposed to sunlight and became a human. Her father is a vampire hunter, and she is a human, but her father is evil and she becomes a vampire again to protect him. The storyline and characters are so well done. The special effects are amazing. The animation is beautiful. This movie is awesome.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   ... it's a good thing the good ones don't last. In the case of "American Ultra," which opened here Sunday, that may be a case of too many cooks in the kitchen. It's a smart, stylishly filmed, well made comedy about a group of young men in New York City, and the performances are pretty solid. But it's too short to be entertaining, too unfocused to be enjoyable. In its four and a half hours, it could have provided a few more laughs. A good movie is about more than just one scene.  To some degree, "American Nightmare" and "American Dream" are on the same page. Both films take us into a world in which men are desperate to escape the social structures that have made them invisible. These are men who have lost their jobs or have abandoned the ones they have, and have had nothing to do but lie around and drink and have sex and shoot people. They are men for whom life is a kind of sex, and who live in the shadows of a society that has forgotten them. They aren't trying to escape. In some ways, they are just living out their fantasies. ... But in the case (as with "American Horror Story") of "Amer­ica" and the other two "comedy" entries, these men are trying to get their names in the headlines for some reason, and are either unable or unwilling to work harder to do so. The story of the men of "America" is pretty complicated. They have the same basic problem — we know they have the problem — but they don't seem to think about it much, or in a very creative way. Most of their problems — and we see more of them onscreen than most movies ever do — are personal and mundane: They don't have a lot of money, their wives don't get along with their children, they have to stay home with their parents, and so forth. Casting is not that strong, either. Most characters are either just two-dimensional caricatures or two-faced caricatures, with no variation. A couple of interesting men do pop up occasionally — a "drunk" who tries to get on a bus, an angry man who is actually quite sane, a lawyer who tries in vain to have his clients' lives saved by his legal skills, and a cop whose own family has been put in a terrible situation by a bad police officer.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not that bad  but don't give me "why did you not go to see this movie if you were so into it?" Because it's not a great movie.    I thought it was a good movie at first because I had watched it when it was first released.  I liked the first two sequels so much that I thought I would like this one too. I mean how bad could it be.  Well, it's pretty bad.  It's a story about an old guy who lives on the beach and has a great wife and he has a problem that he cannot seem to solve, so he takes a girl to see a play. It's supposed to be a good scene, I guess, but they forgot to bring a cast and a couple of actors for the parts.  As a consequence it becomes quite predictable and not very good in any sense.  When he has to leave the girl and the play, he sees a ghost.  That's it.  The story just goes on.  They have a whole lot of time to go around and spend the rest of the movie shooting up and killing people and then just sitting around at home and being boring.  To be fair, there is a lot of shooting up in the movie and it's supposed be scary, but it's more like a porno.  What I really found funny about it was when I found out that the lady in the story is actually dead.  She was actually hit by a boat and was washed up on a beach and died, so the ghost wasn't really dead. It just had a horrible, sad life after she was dead. That's what I mean about how the movie is predictable.  This movie was just awful.  And that's saying something because it really sucked. I'm sorry, I really am.  But it was my only movie of the week.  So you win. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was made for money and they only make money if the movie makes a profit.   I don't know if they're saying this to justify how badly it sucked, or because the studio doesn't want a real critic to review it (they want to get the movie made for $100 million).   It's a bad, dumb, boring, stupid movie.  To the reviewer who complained about how awful this movie was:  Take a look in the mirror and then go watch another movie that is better and more fun.  Like I said before, I don;t have any regrets about my movie watching habits.  I'm sure many of you know who that reviewer is.  I just saw him on another channel complaining about how terrible this movie is.   I have been wanting to ask him about this movie because I don' think he really even got any of the plot or the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie like 3 times in a row.   In the first 2 viewing I was bored by the movie's beginning.  In this 3rd viewing, the movie became very interesting.  I started to enjoy it and the story started to develop.  The film was a good introduction to the main characters and the world of the movie. The characters were well-drawn.  For me the story had a different vibe from other movies like The Road or The Road to Perdition.  Even the music was very unique.  Some people were upset that I didn't give this a 10.  However, I found this movie to be worth the 10 points I gave it.  It's not the best movie but the story is different than most movies I have seen and it is an interesting film.  Although I liked this movie, I would say it was not my favorite.  I'll give it a 2/10.   Rating:  8.5/10

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was on the fence about this movie and now that I'm done with it, I'm not sure what I can say. I don't think I could have been any more wrong about this film. While it has its moments, and I found a few of its parts to be a bit predictable, and somewhat disappointing, it still managed to surprise me in its own way. It had a solid plot, but some of the moments of the movie were so great that I found myself laughing out loud at one point. It's hard to describe this movie, but just know that it was something I didn't expect to like. In short, it was one of the better horror movies I've ever seen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What did you get?     What do you have to say about the movie?      "My wife has been watching my movies all the time but she hasn't seen this. She has seen the last one so I thought she would see this one but she didn't. The film was a little slow but I don't think the story had a lot to do with that. The special effects were not great and the movie was not well acted. The ending was disappointing because it had little chance of getting into my head. The last five minutes left my mouth going 'What the hell just happened?' and I had to pause a couple of times before I got into it."   -Johannes   I thought this was a good movie. It's about a doctor and his wife and some other patients who are addicted to a drug called 'Fountain'. The doctor has to look after his patients while he is out on vacation. This is the first time he has to spend a whole week away from the wife and his two kids. The movie was well shot, well acted and had some good special effects. The writing of the movie is excellent. The main character, the Doctor, was a very nice guy. He was a lot like me in that he was too much of a softy and never really gave a damn about anything but himself. I thought he made a lot of mistakes in the film. As he got older, he became more and more selfish and a lot less likeable. Overall, I think the movie has a good message but it didn't really stick with me.   The reason why I rated it 3.5 stars instead of 4 or 5 is that there were several scenes in the middle that left me feeling very unsatisfied. The script didn't get me hooked in the first place, the movie didn't develop the story and the ending wasn't what I expected. Overall I think it was a disappointing film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So if a movie does something wrong, why did I feel like I was robbed of that feeling? What does a person do when they have a movie that is just plain bad? First of all, you might think that you want to rip a ticket out of the theater's hand and walk out and never return. Well, I'm not going to try and persuade you otherwise. You might also think, "What about the people who bought tickets?" Well, you're not going anywhere near the movie. So the theater will tell you that it is the most expensive ticket, and so you might feel a little bit of sympathy for them, that they made a mistake. But really, there is nothing you can do about that. The theater will not refund your money. The theaters only give the option to purchase a different ticket. And the second option is a different movie.   There are two kinds of movies: movie "goods," and movie "bads." Movie "goodies" are great movies that you can see without having to be spoiled by the bad ones. They are the movies that make you smile and smile and then just go back to sleep because you have the good times. Movie "baddies" happen at random times and don't involve much risk to your life. I know people who were disappointed after watching the "Star Wars" trilogy. That movie is just a disappointment, even by the standards of modern blockbuster movies. I didn't care for it because I wanted a little more excitement. I wanted more suspense, more excitement, and most of all: I wanted to be in the original universe of Star Wars movies! The reason why "Star Trek" is so great is because it is just that type of movie. It doesn't really try to be any other type of movies. It tries to be the good movies and the bad movies that people want to see.  When I saw "The Room," I felt that I had just experienced the most boring and predictable movie of all time. This movie is filled with clichés. The movie begins with the most horrible, clichéd scene in movies history. In the opening scene, two people sleep in a small room in the middle of the night, one is naked and has a strange odor, and the other one is dressed in a nice, clean, white room, and there is a strange green light above them that doesn't seem to be coming from an actual light bulb. That scene, I don
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you love a movie that's "great" - and I think that this movie is - then please, for the love of god, don't like it. It will ruin your life. This is why there are so few good movies. Because every movie has to be "great". It's like the saying goes "a bad movie is the only movie people will ever see".   My first (and only) thought after watching this movie was "this was a terrible idea." I guess this movie could have been a brilliant idea but it fell into one of the most common traps of horror movie makers: making something too "dark" so as to "distract" the audience. The movie's plot is simple: one night a guy who works in a basement in an apartment complex is murdered. The next day the landlord (played by Tim Robbins) shows up at the apartment with a bag of trash. He says that there was a man in the apartment who murdered him and now he wants the trash back. The owner is a little off-put by this so he asks the landlord to take the garbage to a recycling center instead. The garbage man, played by Mark Boone Junior (not a great movie star by any means) agrees but the owner is determined to find the real killer.   But the movie is only as good as its supporting cast. The supporting characters are a pretty good one, but they are a little thin and have nothing to do with the story except to be silly. They were just there to make the movie fun to watch, and to be honest the movie was pretty fun to view but it would have been so much better if the supporting characters had done something else to entertain the audience and they instead just acted like they were stuck in the movie itself.   The best thing about the supporting cast is that most of them have to go through some ridiculous and pointless plot-lines. Some are played like jokes and some are played for dramatic effect. It seems to me that they have an interest in the "plot" more than they do the characters. This movie makes me laugh every time but I really do feel that they did a terrible job in playing some of the characters and the way they have to be played for the plot to work.   and finally... I can't stress enough how awful this movie would be with a good director. The film could have had a much better ending and a great script to play off of. If it had been directed

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   .   This film has some great acting but the plot is completely retarded.  It's pretty clear that these kids are all getting on each others nerves and the movie keeps going in a circle trying to make them seem like a bunch of jerks. There's no character development and there's nothing to really get invested in.  The plot is a farce and the actors are barely making it through the film.  This is a film with zero entertainment value.  I would recommend this movie as a gag reel and maybe watch it on the couch for a few laughs.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an unmemorable movie and the only reason I'm bothering to give it four stars is because of the cast. As for the movie, it's pretty generic, with some well-acted scenes, and some well written and performed scenes. The movie takes place in a small town in rural Georgia where two families are feuding over who gets to marry one of their daughters. This story makes no sense to me at all and the plot is so contrived that there's no way it could possibly make a decent movie. All the characters were one-dimensional, but the characters of the two families were the worst. I didn't hate the people in the movie (except the little girl who's the love interest) but they're so unsympathetic that I couldn't stand watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm sorry.   I really am.  (I hope you didn't watch it, and also I hope you don't ever watch it. But I did. Please feel free to look at my other reviews if you find this review of any interest.)   Now, let's do it.  I can't remember any of the names of the actors (because I don't care, but since I'm writing this review I have to, so I'll include them all), so I will simply give a short rundown of each of the main characters.  The main characters are: Peter Capaldi, as "The Doctor";  Billie Piper as "Nyssa," a beautiful and smart woman who becomes the love of "The Second Doctor"; and Sylvester McCoy as "Twelfth Doctor," a man who is supposed to be dead.  In the beginning of the movie, Peter Capelin is not quite the character he will become, at least not yet. When the Doctor (as the Doctor) first meets Nyssa, he's quite friendly, asking her about her love life. Nyssas answer is pretty much "I don't have a boyfriend," and he seems surprised and a little hurt by this.  However, after a little while he quickly grows attached to her and the two become lovers. The Doctor eventually gets his act together and decides that they should go away to visit the planet that has had a Tardis destroyed, The Ice Planet. Unfortunately, the Doctor's companion Sarah Jane Smith (Piper) has no idea where the Doctor went.  On their way there, the Tardist's ship gets caught in a whirlwind of ice, ice, and more ice. The ice storms hit the TARDIS and kill the Doctor, along with Nyss.  And thus we are introduced to the very first Tardisc, "the Twelfth Doctor."    Now that you know about the TARDIS, here's how the plot of the film was, I think.  First off, the main character is not the Doctor.  This is probably why he didn't show up in the first movie, because he was dead. Next, the new Doctor (the "Twelve") is very different from the original Doctor. The original Doctor had a slightly sadistic side. The new Doctor has no such feelings. He seems to be quite the sweet-heart. The only time he smiles is at
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You probably have a very specific set of movies in your mind, the kind that you can see from one to the next and feel they're good.   It's the same with food.  You're never going to have the same flavor of pasta as your mom.  The same with beer, like,   for example.  I'm sure you know this, but not many people know what beer tastes like.  A lot of people think the beer of their childhood tastes like the beer that is the most popular beer today.  For a lot of reasons, people think what they did in high school tastes like what they drank in college.  But that's the wrong way of looking at things.  There is a whole spectrum of beer.  Even though beer tastes different from place to place, it's not a bad thing.  If you are at a bar, or a restaurant, and have not tried a beer, you don't know what you're missing.  Maybe it's a beer that you want to try,  like you said,  but maybe you don´t.  It doesn't have to taste like that, but if you don' t,  you aren't understanding what's in the beer. A great beer has to have a lot going for it.  Like,  if it tastes good, it should have a bit of fruit or something that helps you drink it. I have found a lot that helps me drink a beer. And that is what I have written about.  When I first decided to make this list,  I really was thinking that I could talk about the beers of my past, but then I realized that the list would be different, and I would have a completely different set of beers to talk about. I want to start off by talking about some breweries that are in the Northwest that are making some great beer.   Beau's All Natural Brewing -  " I don't want to think of this as just a brewery in Bend."   The Beau's brewery is located in Eugene, Oregon,  and is home to a little brewery that produces some unique beers, but a good lot of other beers that you probably wouldn't expect.  Beau's produces 6 different types of beer, all on tap in Eugene.  Their flagship brews are the 5 beers they have available:  Sour :  Tropical Fruit :  Mango Pale Ale:
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are so many great films that were not even screened in theaters, yet they get the reputation of being better than they actually are.   I don't like when films get this sort of reputation, because they are so far from being true to form.  This is one of them.  At times it may seem as though it was written by someone who was trying to "do it all" in the film world, so there is very little that is original about it.  However, that's not the case, the film is full of all sorts of plot twists and turns that are all over the place.  But, it all makes sense because the film was written as a satire of the film business in general.  The film does it's job in a way, as far as satire goes, by creating an atmosphere that is all about the fear of being caught and doing anything that a film company wants you to do.  Some people might not like this sort in film, but I actually enjoyed it.   There are many scenes that are set in an office where people are talking, but it has a very sinister atmosphere about it, just like the film.   The film begins and ends with the same shots of the same group of people, but they change every scene that is shown.  And this gives the film an extra layer of suspense that you would expect from a film like this, but nothing could be further from the truth.   When the film starts you may think that this is some sort of satire of film people doing films like "Doubt", but in reality, this is a film that shows us how Hollywood truly is.  There is a director who comes to the studio and says, "I want to make a film about this", but what he is really after is the money.  It is the typical Hollywood business plan, with all the drama, manipulation, and bad publicity.  So, why would someone like that want to create such a film?  If you're a fan of suspense, mystery, thriller, or action films then this film will definitely make you scared, but this is the first time that we see a film actually do it.    As far as the film's plot goes, we are introduced to a man named James (played by Anthony Michael Hall), who works on a film in Hollywood.  He is supposed to be working on a movie that deals with all of the problems in the business that are going on

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A long time ago in a land far, far away there was an amazing fantasy film, called "The Lord of the Rings" which is about a young wizard, Aragorn, and his journey to destroy a vast army of goblins. This movie was one of the best movies ever made, and there is absolutely no need to re-watch it. All you need to know about this movie is that its amazing, you should see it!     The only thing I dislike about this film is the actors (sorry, Arwen) they are so perfect for their roles. I mean what the hell, these two are the best! The movie started with a simple opening scene, where Frodo Baggins was on his way back from a trip to Rivendell, which was supposed to be an adventure of a lifetime.  But this is not an adventure. Frodo has been told by the Lord of Lothlorien (a magical place) that he was sent by the most beautiful lady in the world, Arachnoth, who was in need of a ride to an important city. Frodos friend Sam (also Samwise Gamgee) tells him that there are no rides available for him and that he should go on foot. Frods mother, Queen Galadriel, told him to not be too afraid of the darkness, the evil spiders, the trolls, and the orc. But she tells him he cannot do something without her permission. So Frodo walks. Frodo was walking for 5 miles on the road.  There is no other way he could do this, but walking. But Frodo was too late, because Arachne is already waiting for him, which is already a very bad sign. Arachnia is a terrible spider and was already trying to bite him. Frodens best friend Sam had warned him not to go outside, because if he went out he was bound to be attacked by the spiders. But this was not going to happen.  Arachnor was ready to eat Frododom!  A very bad way to be killed.  Arachnion was already ready to tear Frodos body in two, and if he died then Arachnir (the evil one) would eat the body.  This was a very sad scene to see. And it made me sad! I really hope that Arachni never eats a Hobbit.  There were spiders everywhere
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not great. The actors are not all that good either. The story is a complete crap and all the actors are either one-dimensional or worse. The cinematography is a total failure and the music is awful. What you want in a movie is good acting, good writing, good music and maybe a little bit of story. And, the only story the movie had was a guy with a really long beard doing a lot of things and a girl with a short haircut. And that girl is only in it a little while, and I believe that she is the love interest. The rest of the movie is just a series of stupid action sequences. The acting and the writing is not a good thing. I give this movie a 2.75 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You will only be adding to the pile of people who hate this movie.   The reason this movie is so bad is that it has absolutely no good qualities.   All of the negative aspects of this movie come from the fact that it is an exploitation movie.   They get to throw together as many of the biggest baddest bad guys in the world as they can to try to get this movie made.   Even if you are a fan of bad movies, this movie will most certainly make you angry.   To add to the fact of its negative nature, it is only available on the VHS, and you will have to pay $7.99 for it.   No wonder so many people hate it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I got the DVD for this in the mail, and this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! I don't understand why the studio made this, considering the low ratings.   I think I would have given the movie less than 2 stars, but I was so disappointed!   This is the worst film ever made, not even close.  It was very hard to sit through.  The movie was so bad that I actually lost count after the first two acts.  My rating is going to be a 4 star, but in all reality, the film should have never even been released in the first place.  I'm not sure how they could possibly think people would watch this movie, especially since it was so terrible!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My husband got the film to see his friend after a bad experience. They did not look at the other reviews and were very unenthusiastic about the film. They thought the film was "f--ked up" and they said the characters were stupid, and not likable. I told them I had not read the movie, so they assumed it was bad. I had to show them some good reviews before they gave it a chance.   Overall:  A movie that's worth a watch, but not a great one.  I liked the film and thought it was very creative.  Unfortunately it's not for everyone.  It's worth seeing, just not the film for its originality and creativity.  Overall: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (I don't even want to type that.) If someone is asking for a negative about a movie, just leave a comment with a simple message that states what they are complaining about. If you can't even write a little description of what you are criticizing then maybe there is something wrong with your movie. Maybe it is too loud or too long. Maybe there is a poor director. The list goes on and on. When I am watching a movie for the first time, I don't really know how to comment. I want to tell you about my favorite character in the movie, but that might get annoying pretty quickly. What I try to do is get into the character and see if the character seems like me. If the character's name rhymes with "Liar", or if the characters is named after a famous person, that can add to my enjoyment of the movie. I am a big fan of The Matrix. I like the ending of the film. I believe it was pretty good. What do I think of the director of the picture? I think he is a very talented director. But is his movie good? Yes. But does it really deserve the 4 stars it has? Absolutely not. I wouldn't watch this movie even if it was on cable. It is boring, and it is bad. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    And don't give out details about where to go, where to eat, what to wear, what a good date is like.   Also, don't talk about how the movie is better than a "typical" romantic movie, unless it's something like "The Notebook" or "Wreck-it Ralph," because "typicals" are usually so bad that you just want to avoid them.  Also, don 't talk about what to drink.  Why is everyone acting so weirdly at all times in this movie?   Why are all of the people in this scene looking away from each other?  Why aren't the other people who are acting weirdly looking at each other's faces?  Oh, and did I mention that the movie has an annoying theme song that everyone sings?  It's so annoying, especially if you're already a sad or depressed person.  And, of course, don t talk about the plot.  Just because a movie is really good doesn't mean you will enjoy it.  You know, even when it is a "perfect" movie, you can still hate it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    And yet, I saw a "good" movie recently, a film that I thought was a "great" movie.   The movie was called "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" and the director, Howard Hawks, was the best known of the directors who made "spaghetti westerns".   His movies were not always easy to watch, and the dialogue was sometimes difficult to understand, but they were good movies.  A good thing about Hawks was that he wanted his actors to say "nothing", as opposed to just saying the lines.  The "bad" scenes were there, and some people might have been turned off by them, but the rest of the movie was good.  Hawks took a simple story and had it complicated with the usual suspects that are found in "spoilers" on movie sites.  This is the story of a Texas Ranger who is sent to Mexico to try to find a "bad guy" who has killed a sheriff's deputy.  But before he goes to Mexico, he is arrested and taken to jail.  He is then taken to a small town in Texas, and a very bad man named Billy "Tiny" Tyler, who happens to be the sheriff's son, takes him to the jail.   Here, Tiny, played by "Mr. T" Smith, is an average young man.  For some reason, he and Billy become close. Billy uses Tiny as a weapon.  There are some nice bits of humor in the movie. For example, Tiny gets his first real taste of "bad luck" when Billy knocks him over with a wheelbarrow.  Once he is in jail, Billy puts some very evil, twisted things into Tiny's mouth.   When he goes free, Billy finds out that Tiny has a son named Billy Jr., who is a real cowboy.  So this is a "happy" story.  Tiny and his family are in Texas and are trying to find their way back to the US.  They also need to find out who is behind the murder of the sheriff in Mexico.  And they end up in New Orleans, and then New York, and everywhere in between.  These movies were "sophisticated" in style and had an edge to them, and so many of us can watch them over and over again.  "The Bad Guys" by Norman Jewison is one of my favorites. It has a lot of "spookiness" about

The first 30 are probably more interesting to you anyway. 7.  Get a few friends to watch it, and share it with them. It's a movie that was made by an audience that has grown to like and enjoy bad movies, so it's not as bad a movie as you might think it is. 8.  Try to stay on your feet during the entire movie.

However, there is a whole new world of production in Hollywood where you only need a few actors to make a great movie.

They had to change the names of the two actors to make it seem more authentic but they just couldn't keep the actors in their proper accents.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible. There is nothing good about this movie at all. It's simply horrible and boring. And yet, many people were sucked into it. If they are, you are the worst person to ever live. There are many reasons why this movie is bad. The script is awful. The directing is bad and the direction and casting are awful. They try to make this a romantic comedy, but it is a horrible and bland romcom. The characters are all bland and uninteresting. I did not like the acting. The movie doesn't give you any reason to like any of them. It also does not provide any reason for anyone to hate them, which is good. The voice acting is terrible, the music and sounds are horrible. Everything is bad about this film. The acting is bad, the plot is bad as well. It doesn't even feel like there is a plot. The pacing of the movie is awful, the story is awful as well, the characters are bland and boring, the dialogue is unoriginal and uninspiring. The plot is so badly written that the movie makes no sense, it's like someone has read the plot of another movie and simply copied it, but then changed the names and characters and called it a movie. And all of this leads to this terrible movie. If you are ever going to watch this movie, please do so in the dark, preferably with a flashlight. It will make the movie a lot better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     There's not many good movies to be found in the year 2014, so let's get to it. I'll make this very short and simple, so you won't have to waste a lot of your time trying to figure this out: Don't bother with this movie. It's pretty good for the most part. And if you're looking for a good movie that has some heart, it'll be here. However, it was made for $13 million and it barely made over half of that with it's $18 million budget, so don't expect it to break even (unless they release it on DVD or something). The movie stars Nicolas Cage, who does a good job with it (even though he does a terrible job of trying). But for some reason, he wasn't able to make his acting abilities shine at all during this movie, so it's really a chore to watch. It has one of the worst acting performances I've seen by a famous person (if you have to ask, I guess he's not famous for acting skills, but it just seems like his acting has been severely hampered this time around). And the story of the movie is pretty lame, too (I'm not going to explain all the twists and turns I didn't get, because it is a very good movie and I'm not giving away anything). And it all feels very unnecessary. This movie was made by a Hollywood studio, so why not? But for the price it was at, I would say it was a waste. Watch it if you've got a small interest in Nicolas Cage movies, but if you are looking for something really good and a good watch, stick to another movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you enjoyed the movie, then there is nothing else you can say.   My son and I went with our friend and her friend to watch a movie.    We sat in the back row.  It was raining very hard.  There was only a few seats left.  We didn't want to sit in the rain. The movie was called   "The Big Momma's House".   We were excited.  However, my son, did not get very involved with the plot.  He said he was too young to understand the story.  The movie played for about 2 hours.  My wife was disappointed in the movie.    After watching the movie my son got up and asked to go to sleep.  I took him to bed.  After I went to bed, I called my wife to let her know that I thought the movie was not that bad. I told her that she should have sat in front of her son and let him stay up to watch the movie as long as he wanted.  She was disappointed.                I think if my son had been older and a bit more involved he might have enjoyed it.  While in the theater my son was screaming and banging on the seats.  Then he fell asleep.  Afterwards, my wife called my son and asked him if he had had too much to drink.   He said that he didn't drink. He said if he really thought that that was going to happen he would have stayed in his seat.  This is the last straw for my son.  Even though I knew that it is probably too late to change the date on his driver's license, I was going out and buying his own beer.  A few days ago I was at a bar and my daughter and son went with me. The guy in the bathroom said to me, "Dad, I bet the movie is bad". I said, "If that's true it will be a long movie and there are only a couple of seats left."  My daughter said,  "But Dad, the guy in there is not drunk at all". I told my son that that guy was going through a lot of trouble just to go through the trouble of trying to see the movie but he would not be able to finish it.   Now, it is my son's choice to go and watch the movies but that doesn't mean I won't go and be there to support him
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is very bad, the acting is horrible and the plot is nonsensical and unrealistic.   There is a very annoying song in the film, which is sung by one of the bad guys.   - The film's plot is about a bunch of kids, who steal a van that belongs to an old man who lives in an old house.  At some point, they discover a man trapped inside the van, who has an unfortunate secret: he's the evil master of a dark evil army.  The main villain, who is played by Johnny Depp in a very campy kind of way, has an army of monsters (and you may have figured that out by now) who he summons to do his evil bidding.  This film was so bad that it was not released in the United States. The US censors would have been extremely offended by this.  It is probably the most terrible film I have ever seen.  As a huge fan of the horror genre, this film was especially disappointing for me, but it seems to be very popular in other countries.  I do enjoy a good horror film (a "good" horror film can be really good), but this one is just not very good.  So please, don't waste your time and money on this one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The following is about a movie that's been making the rounds for a while. I was the first to hear about this, and was immediately intrigued. The movie is called "The Devil's Mistress." It's about a woman who's been tortured to the point of insanity by an evil spirit that lives in her, and it's written and directed by the film's co-writer and director, Joe Dante. The first three acts of the film are fairly good. You follow a woman as she deals with her sister's death in an accident, and after she decides to take her father to visit her at his old home. You find out about the ghost that haunts the house, and the fact that the man's last words to her are, "Be strong, Be strong." Then she goes through what is essentially a love triangle with her boyfriend, a fellow cop, and a fellow man. Then there's a car crash which is a very interesting twist, as it takes you out of the main narrative, and puts you in a world in which the main character has become a very bitter, manipulative, and self-centered person. When the story picks up, you are told that she is now a recluse in her house, not talking to anyone and basically giving up on life. The plot thickens, and more is revealed about this sinister, evil spirit. I didn't really like it, so I can't say that it was great, but it did have its moments, and did have some nice cinematography.   But that wasn't the end of the story. After the movie's opening credits, the credits start rolling, but the camera does not cut away. You're given a glimpse into a strange, dark room, where you see a man holding a dog by its collar. He's pointing his gun at the dog, which is dead. He walks back to the room, and we see the dog's corpse on a table. We see the man standing there with blood on his face, and his eyes are black, as if they're not human anymore. As he stands there, we see a vision of a woman's face, looking back at him from inside the room. We hear a noise from upstairs. The voice on the tape says, "The devil's mistress... is... here."   So there's that. The next scene takes place in a hotel room, in which we see an equally creepy, but also very interesting, scene. It

There are some good songs in the background, and the camera work and lighting are really nice. But, there is nothing about the movie that I like. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, especially those people who want something new. If you are not expecting a movie with any real plot, I would stay away from this.   2.5 out of 4 stars Review Rating: 3 out of 5 stars ( 2 reviews ) Posted by: The Old Black at 10:11 AM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "They all want to do a movie for a living so they get into these situations where they are making a lot of money, they're trying to get into a big movie, they want to be on TV. And that's why they do the movies that they do. And they have to have somebody who is going to be the mouthpiece for that particular aspect of the movie so that the studios will buy the film and do this and do that. And I'm a fan of these movies."   I feel sorry for all the people who went to see this movie! This movie was so much worse than my perception of it. The story was so boring, and the acting was just awful! I'm going to guess that most of the people in this movie were not the actors, but the producers of the film. I would have liked to have seen these actors in this horrible movie more. It was the worst movie I have ever seen, in terms of quality.  Why did I bother to write this review?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   We had to drive through some pretty horrible areas for the film to get made.    In the film, we get to see how this region was destroyed by the war.  It is not a very pretty movie to watch.  In my opinion, the best way to watch it is as if you were to drive out into a field to look for your car that got destroyed by a bomb.  For me, the movie was boring and repetitive.  The plot was weak.  There is no reason to believe that the war could have happened this fast.  As a movie about World War I, it falls short in a number of regards.  One major problem was the movie does not have any dialogue to explain what is happening.  We are told that they were fighting a war, but we have no idea what they were even fighting.  At least with a book this long, you can take your time and get the picture.  But there are other problems as well.  First, this film, despite being only 120 minutes long, it did not seem like it had any tension.  I kept thinking about how much time they were wasting on these scenes.  Second, the ending was a bit of a letdown.  All of these people would go home, they would put the film in a safe and that was it.  How many times have you seen a war film and the characters say goodbye before going home?  How is it that they did not have to explain that?  Third, the pacing was slow.  While we saw this region go through great hardship and destruction, we didn't see what they went through during the war itself.  Perhaps that is what I am nitpicking on, because the war would not have been the same without these people.  They were like characters in a book.  Finally, the production is not the greatest, but not the worst either.  With the exception of the first act of the film being boring and slow, the rest of the movie made up for it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The new Star Wars movie is awesome and I loved it.   I would recommend the movie to anyone who has seen it. I just wish they would make another Star Wars film. I want to see more stories about the Rebellion and the Empire. The Empire was good in Star Wars but I want more stories. I really enjoyed the first film and I would like to see the other films.  Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a fantastic movie.    I am glad they did it. It is an excellent continuation of the story, not a retread.  This is the third film in the Star Wars franchise and the first one I have watched with a full knowledge of what I am getting into. The story is much more interesting than the first two films and I think that the writers and directors worked very hard to improve and enrich the universe. It's very different from the original films but still very recognizable.    Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Strikes Back is an awesome movie. It has everything I wanted out of a Star Wars story and also many more things I did not expect. The character development is great and there is a new element of mystery that we haven't seen in the previous films. I will admit that I'm a bit disappointed that a woman isn't featured in this movie. Maybe it was supposed to be Luke's daughter, but I do hope that there will be another female character in future installments.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I haven't seen a movie in a long time that was so well-made that it made me forget I was watching it.   One of the things that made this movie so great is the acting. I didn't find any of the actors to be particularly great, but none of them were horrible. Every actor seemed to be at the right level of acting, with no one feeling overly self-conscious. I also appreciated the fact that the majority of the movie was shot in black and white, making the movie quite dark and moody.  One thing that didn't sit right with me was the use of the computer-generated imagery. I know this is the first movie to use the computer graphics that will be used in all of his sequels, but even though there were several computer-drawn characters, they were all pretty much the same. They didn't feel like they were living in a completely different world, and you couldn't tell they were supposed to be different characters from each other.  The actors were great, however, and if anything, the computer animations really helped the movie out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the best things about the show is that you can never get enough of it. The episodes can be short and sweet (if you watch them in chronological order), or long, and packed with action and tension.      In addition to the good, the show does a good job of developing the characters and giving them interesting and fleshed out backstories. One of my favorite scenes was in the series finale when Kyo An and Toshiya are shown together for the first time. They're both pretty cool, and they're both just shy enough not to feel like total creeps. They don't seem to notice each other, either, which is something that's nice.  The show has its own style and takes place in a lot of different settings and time periods. It's not really set in an anime specific time and it's not a character driven show. There are no characters who have very definite personalities (save for one of the other main characters), and it doesn't seem like there's much development in the characters themselves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Do not talk about the movie at all.   The best way to talk about a movie is as a fan of that movie, and if you don't like it you are probably doing it wrong.  A movie review in movie reviews:  The first sentence is important.  Do you have a good story?  The second is more important than the first, but the third is still important. A story that you tell when you are writing a movie review:  What did you think of the movie?   This is not an analysis of the story, or why you like/don't like a movie, but an explanation of your own thoughts and feelings about the story.    A review of a movie should not focus on why the movie works or why it sucks, it should focus on the character, the plot, and the art.  You should also discuss how the movie impacted your life, how the plot makes you think, etc.  I should mention that the movies in this list can be seen and enjoyed by anyone, regardless of age.  Movies that are not for kids are not this list. If you feel the need to defend a child's movie, then you probably are a child, in which case this article is for you.  There are, however, movies that are meant for adults.  The last one is a "parent movie," and it isn't even really a movie.  This list will always be about movies that you like, not just for yourself.  A movie is good or bad for you, not necessarily for everyone else.  Some people want to look at a movie to tell them something about themselves, and that is okay too.  If you think you are one of these people, then maybe this list will be for you too.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought the movie was terrible when I started watching it but I couldn't give it zero stars. So I took a bit of a breather and then I watched it again in a week. I still couldn't enjoy it but it was so much better with a bit more time. Now it's good and bad at the same time. The plot is terrible and the acting is horrible. It's not a comedy that's for sure. If you like bad movies (especially action/horror) then you'll probably enjoy this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went into this movie wanting to see more. The first half was interesting. The opening act featured a good performance from the lead actor, as well as some nice set-pieces. As the movie progressed however, the movie fell into a predictable pattern and had its fun with the gimmick. I had a hard time watching the second half, especially at the beginning. There were many times in the second act where there was little to no tension and nothing truly interesting or funny. The second act also didn't have a great number of characters, and this was especially apparent when the film returned to its action/adventure style. At this point I was beginning to wonder if the film would have any meaning at all. It seemed that there was nothing for me to latch onto in this film. I did enjoy the final fight between the bad guys and the good guys, and it was interesting to see some of the things we see in action movies in the real world. I would like to see a sequel to this film with better acting, a great villain, and more depth and realism.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So I saw this movie because I was at a friend's house. My friend was into horror movies so I gave him this. This movie was not that bad. It was not awful. It wasn't even a bad horror movie. It just was boring. The only thing that bothered me is that you were not told why you are seeing these movies. You don't get why the people are in these movies and why they would be at a house. It made me feel like I was watching something really stupid that I would never find entertaining. Not even for a movie like this. I have seen worse movies but this is a movie that I cannot enjoy. The people in this movie were annoying and they took up too much of the screen. If there were less of them there would be more time for the movie to move forward. There wasn't enough action to make up for the boring plot and there weren't enough jokes in this to make it funny. The ending was the most ridiculous and unbelievable ending to a movie I have ever seen. It ruined the movie for me. I'm sorry to those who liked this movie. I think that it was a bad idea to do this movie and I will never watch this movie again. The DVD can be bought at  Amazon.com  for $7.99. It is also available at  Walgreens.com.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have to say that I didn't see this movie as a great horror movie. I thought it was kind of silly. The acting, the plot, the sound effects, everything was just...well, what would a movie about a monster be like? The actors were all funny but the dialogue was very clunky and forced.   The film had very bad continuity. You have a character on a roller coaster ride and then the roller coaster rides a giant monster...no joke, I watched this movie twice. I was a little disappointed that they didn't show a lot of the monsters, like a guy with teeth that kills people with a blow to the head or a guy who has three heads and he can move them around. And that's not even getting into the movie's use of the term "beware" that's used over and over and in over and overs.  It is a little disappointing for someone to see the first half of this movie and think, "this is a great movie!" And then the second half of the movie is all just a terrible waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a little too long and does not really have much to say, other than to show us a little bit of what happens to a small town, as one of the "bad guys" sets his sights on it. It is so long, that it is a bit hard to put into words just how many different characters there are, and how many times the plot can be changed, even from the end of the movie until it reaches the end.   Also, it is obvious how many people are on the "good" side and how much trouble some of these characters go through.  The movie will probably give you a lot of laughs, but don't expect to learn anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was not a big fan of the film, but was very pleased that it was nominated for a nomination for Best Picture at the Oscars. I thought that this was the kind of movie that would not win a big award, because it is not as flashy as many of the other films that are winning awards, and there is not a great deal to talk about in the film. It has some good stuff, some great stuff, but also some stupid stuff. And this stupid stuff makes it very frustrating. But hey, I'll take it. And the fact that it is a "serious" film does help it. There are a lot of moments in the movie that are so dramatic that you may feel like you are actually in a dramatic situation. It is not quite the same as watching a play on a stage or seeing a movie. The movie itself is not very good, but it is entertaining enough for me to watch it. I am not sure what happened with the film after it had been shown in the summer of 1989, but I believe the film was a big hit, and is still making money. A lot of movies are going to lose money because they are made too soon, especially when they are being produced by one person. But it has been a while since I saw this movie, so I can not say anything about it being in quality, but my feelings about it are certainly not negative.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    And I think they're all good, even though I feel like every one of them has the potential to be an excellent movie. (except "The Matrix" which I think was one of the worst movies I've ever seen) And this is only the first one, since there's plenty more left for me to read. Now I've read all the others, so if you see this book and you like them, go ahead and order this book, but don't get a kick out of me if you read it and you think it's "the same." I just want to try to improve the way I think.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'll just skip it   The movie's very good, but it's a movie, not a comic book   They take a movie and they do a great job of making it like a comic (see: The Avengers, the Spider-Man movies)   Unfortunately, they don't do that for the whole series   But then, that's what comic book movies are supposed to do!   So if they're doing a better job at making a movie as a comic than a comic as a movie that's fine with me.   And the movie's also pretty good.  The story is very good. It's the action that has me worried   Not because it's too good but because of the terrible acting and writing   As for the characters?   All of them are great but it seems like they're being written for comic book characters.  And the problem is that this comic is supposed to be an adaptation of a comic so all of the dialogue has to be changed to suit a comic character's vocabulary.  If you're gonna do that, you need to go back and re-write the dialog for every character   Some characters, like the villain, are so over-the-top ridiculous and goofy   He really thinks he's some kind of hero.  I don't know about you but I'm not looking for a guy to wear a red cap and a green costume.  He thinks he is some kind a hero when he's telling his henchmen to cut someone's head off and then he's doing it as if he's the hero   But it works in the movie as well.  When he's trying to stop this guy, he's just standing there with his hands up looking like a big baby that's been smacked in the face and this is all in slow motion.  But I'd rather see something like a real person (or in this case a CGI character) doing something than see some kindof crazy martial arts scene   With the hero.  So it's not the acting that's the problem.  The acting is okay but the writing is bad.  It's not just the dialogue that's bad, it's how the movie takes itself seriously.  When a movie takes the whole thing seriously it can become cheesy and it's hard to take something seriously when there's so much that's goofy going on.   The best way to approach a comic
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If a movie has any redeeming features, it's probably a crappy movie.   The thing that most fans would hate is the fact that most of the film is set in a small hotel room.  No matter how many scenes we watch, the setting is never explored.  But there is a big story that is never explained to us, and it goes something like this:  - a guy called Richard, goes on a vacation and comes into possession of a video tape.  - he plays it on his computer and suddenly has a new friend.  He asks for her name and she gives him his name:  Michelle.  Michelle is a stripper named Mia.  She gives Richard the video and she's like "here's this tape. You're never going to believe what you see".  Mia's mother calls Mia and says that she has found the tape, and she wants Richard arrested for stealing it.  This is the point in the film where you could imagine why Mia came to Richard in the first place. But this is the moment when the film turns into the worst kind of movie: movie with a premise that's too stupid to make any sense. It's as if they didn't actually want to tell a story, but they just wanted to try a bunch of jokes on us. I think this is what made it so interesting: it was so strange to see an actual story unfold on screen, but it's all so ridiculous and over the top.  We all have that feeling, sometimes when we watch something too bizarre, that the director just made it up as he went along.  It's like the movie is trying to take itself seriously, which is weird when you really think about it. The film never explores anything that happens outside of the hotel room, so we never see a new side of Mia or Richard.  The only exception to this is at the end, when Mia reveals that she isn't a strippers stripper:  Mia is a journalist, who's trying to report on her mother's divorce, so she comes to Richard with an assignment:  to tell Richard about a woman named Pamela.  Pamela's been living a really bad life, she's a drug addict, and her husband is the most corrupt politician in the country.  Mia decides to go into town and interview Pamela, and what's interesting is that Mia is actually the reporter in this film: she's been following Pamela's story ever since she first appeared
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Please do not write a review about this movie! I don't know how much longer I can wait to watch it and hate myself when I think about it! I'll be honest, I've been wanting to watch a film about a dog eating people's brains for a long time and I've finally got my chance! A guy named John lives with his friend Sam (Chris Meloni) and Sam's girlfriend Jenny (Bella Thorne) at their place on Long Island. John eats a lot of brains and can't seem to get rid of them. He eventually starts to eat them in a human's mouth because he's a really big fan of dogs! The only problem is that his new girlfriend doesn't appreciate his eating habits. She's not the only one who doesn't like it either. There's even a girl at school who thinks John is weird for eating the brains because it's disgusting and disgusting. But there's also a dog named Chunk who likes eating brains because they taste better than the stuff he's eating. One day, when Chunk gets hungry, John takes him to the park and invites them to eat brains together. This movie makes me so very angry! So many people seem to think that eating the brain is disgusting and that it's a bad thing, and they act like it's wrong to eat the brain because it can't digest it correctly or something. But when it comes to dogs and eating human brains, that's actually not that big of a deal, right? That's like saying that it is wrong for your child to play with your pet cat. I mean, sure it's not a very nice thing to do and there's no real reason for it, but it's still a cat and it's just a cat. People seem to have this really messed up idea about eating people, but that's like a big part of the movie! The dog eating the human brains doesn't even make sense because he could just eat the brains by himself, but then again he could also eat a human brain by himself. How could a dog possibly eat a person brain? Why would he do it?! So this dog has to eat human brains so that he doesn't get hungry and starve to death. So, like the dog eating a human being, he has to feed the human brain to his dog, which is a bit odd if the human is in a box in the middle of the park. And what's even more strange is that dogs are

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You can call it a bad film if you want; the story and acting are poor, and the ending left a lot to be desired. The film tells the tale of a man that becomes a police detective and has a bad case of "being the other man" as a result of being involved in his boss' disappearance and his own "murder". However, the story isn't very interesting, nor do the characters seem to have a solid enough foundation. The movie spends too much time on setting up the detective, and it isn't until the last third that the story is properly resolved. However, it was fun to watch as the detective and the woman that is the wife of his boss were a good duo; their personalities were well-developed and it was amusing to see their battle over money and their differing opinions. Unfortunately, the film's story never really develops and leaves many unresolved plot holes. It's easy to get lost with the detective's explanations of the murder scene, but it's also easy to find things that weren't explained well. The detective also doesn't seem to be the most trustworthy of characters, as he seems to lose track of his job a lot and it's easy for the audience to get bored with his explanations of events that are clearly beyond his knowledge. The cinematography was fine, but the use of the lighting makes the film look overly dark. The soundtrack was interesting, but had an annoying bass guitar sound to it. The only thing that kept me going was the character and relationship development that was revealed as the film went on, and I'd suggest watching this film for a good laugh.   A detective that can't remember what day of the week it is:  My review is going to be a little long-winded, so bear with me! I love this film; it's the perfect comedy for the times that you are stuck in traffic or the office and are having a rough day, or if you are sick and in bed. The writing in this film was absolutely hilarious, and most of the performances were excellent. I laughed as the Detective forgot who he was and how he works and what his job is, the woman played by the beautiful Michelle Forbes had me laughing with her character's reactions to events. The comedy isn't too intense, and while it's a bit dark and creepy at times, it does have a good amount of laughs. The music by Stephen M. Ross (director of "The Princess Bride") is
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        The best thing about this movie is the fact that it is one of the most well-made films ever. I remember when I was a kid watching the "Citizen Kane" series on television and was impressed by the way in which director Orson Welles created a movie that was completely cinematic and never seemed to be in a rush.  (2-star movie from movie critic) It is not exactly the same with "The Wizard of Oz," but the movie makes up for it with a great cast and interesting characters.   I don't care for this movie.  I really didn't care much for it. I really wasn't that fond of it.  As far as "The Tin Woodman" goes, it is good. It is really good. This movie was in many ways the first big blockbuster film that I saw that was like this and even I found it enjoyable. But this was not the most entertaining movie I saw the year "The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King" opened. When I think about it now, I realize that I wasn't impressed by this movie that much, but it was just a kid's movie. It had that quality that kid's movies do that make me feel a little childish.  And I know that the studio of this movie thought the same way, as they were going to put a film like this on the front of the box. This was a movie about a boy who had an enchanted sword that could make him invincible and the only way to get it was to find the wizard. So it was kind of a kids' adventure movie that also had a very fantasy feel to it. But that was all a part of the marketing for the movie and it got good reviews.  What made it even better was that the kids were actually having a good time in the movie because it was based on the book by L. Frank Baum.  In a way, it was a good homage to a book.  It is like that old adage "If you liked that, then you'll like that."   But I don' t really like that. I thought that "The Tintin" movie was not exactly what it needed to be. I also think that a lot of the people who did like it were not really familiar with the book so they didn't understand why they were liking this movie in the first place. I'm just saying.  You
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't really enjoy "Tombstone", but I was very entertained. It was an entertaining movie about a small time Mexican drug smuggler trying to get his money's worth from a small town sheriff in the middle of nowhere. This movie was very low budget and was shot in the dark, with a lot of long shots. This is a very simple plot but it worked very well for the character's and for the audience. The only reason I didn\'t enjoy this movie was that the acting was very weak and the acting of the actors really wasn\'t worth watching. The dialogue is also very weak. I don\'t have much to say about the cinematography of this movie. It is good for the location and the lighting, but it is a bad picture. The music is very good and it is very easy to understand the words. The movie was well acted and the cinematographer did a great job, but if you are looking for a good action movie, go out and go see "Die Hard".   "Taken" is an interesting movie, but not very good. It has some good action and some good story-telling. Unfortunately the movie takes a while to set up and a little too long for a first action film. A very interesting movie to watch, but probably not worth your time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say that I loved the movie.    However it got so over-the-top ridiculous that I have to stop recommending this movie to anybody who doesn't appreciate extreme humor.  The movie starts off with the protagonist of the movie, Willard, who is playing a character that looks like a big-mouthed, orange-skinned gorilla. He and his friends come to a town called Nod, which is where Willard meets a man named John.    Willard introduces John to his wife and a cute girl named Karen, and then they head off to Nod.  Nod is basically a small town that is in the middle of nowhere.  The only way people get to Noda from the rest of the country is by plane.  Willard's girlfriend, Karen, is an older woman with two kids that looks at Willard as a husband.  She is also the only person that knows what his secret hobby is.  After Willard gets on the plane he quickly notices that there are people dressed up in the most bizarre costumes.  They look like an ape with no lips, a giant cat with one eye and a man with his butt on fire.  Noda is a fun place to live because there is nothing that they have in the way of real work going on.  John is really weird and Willard is just kind of obsessed with him.  It's almost as if Willard feels like he wants to be John, he just never knows when.  There are tons of great characters and Willards friends, John and Karen are the best.  I really enjoyed the film, it's kind of a "comedy for grownups", and it's a great movie to show your friends and family. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I do have a small issue with this film. It's that the original script was not written by the guy who was to direct it and I would have to have seen his take on the story. The script for the movie is very similar to the screenplay for 'A Christmas Story'. The two movies are not as good as the movie by Robert Zemeckis and the movie was a lot more violent than this was but in my opinion, I really like 'The Wizard of Oz' so there was no need for a sequel. I love the movie so far and I will keep this movie on my Blu-ray for a long time.

I thought that a few of the scares were over the top, but I thought some of the most scary moments were left out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing that saved this movie is the fantastic performances by the cast, including Bruce Willis, who played a great villain. I'm sure a film that has a character like this in it would not have made it to the big screen. But it makes a lot more sense than you'd expect for a film to feature a villain named "The Reaper" who kills everyone he thinks of as "weak" and "worthless". It's a nice touch, but I'm not a big fan of this kind of evil.  There were a lot of great action scenes in this film.    But the best sequence in the film is the one that takes place in the back of a car after a high-speed chase. The car is driven by a cop in an armored uniform who has been tracking the Joker. The chase involves several car chases and one explosion and the car finally speeds up and crashes into a giant building. The cop is about to get away but then the Joker comes out from behind a building in his red suit. He then starts shooting the cop and the Joker runs off to where he was hiding. That was a very cool and intense sequence. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A great movie but a huge let down, if you are looking for an epic war movie with epic action you might want to skip it. I loved the idea but the execution was not up to par. The story was good, the acting was good but the plot was not. The action and the CGI were great, but in the end we had to rely on a few characters and there were a lot of unnecessary characters (I would have preferred to have a more cohesive story), we have a lot more focus on other actors and other scenes that were not really important and more focus should have been placed on other parts of the movie. One last thing that bothered me was the scene where our main character, Major Gen. Charles Logan tries to talk to General Zod.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was good, but it was way too long and in the end it wasn't all that exciting.    The movie was made in the 60's and it didn't look like it was made for today's audience.  Some of the acting was kind of strange.  I thought the girl was annoying and had an attitude.  The guy is too serious in the movie.  This movie has no action, no gore, and it has no plot.  It looks like the whole movie was just made to make a big name for themselves.  For instance, the man who played the lead in this movie was in The Godfather and the movie was called "The Godfather Part II" and he did a terrible job and wasn't that good a film.  In short, the movie didn't have the originality and the story didn't make sense.  You don't think people today would think that is a good movie. I can't believe I watched this and still liked it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What was so wrong with that movie, that it was a total waste of everyone's time? Well, it was terrible, and I couldn't really find any redeeming features in the film itself. What made it worse was that the movie was so incredibly poor that I don't think it was ever going to make any money, and the studio (AEG) is a laughingstock. The only other movies that I know of that made less than half of what that movie made are the worst sequels to Die Hard, and they did a much better job. I think this movie would have been better if they just put the band back together after they broke up, and just made a good movie. Then again, I don�t think anyone really wants to see a movie that�s so bad, so I don���t really mind it. I don��t even know if it should have been called �The Music from �The Big Chill� at all. It seems kind of odd, like they wanted to call it something like ��The Music From �The Little Sister,� but someone in the production department decided it wouldn���t sound right, so they had to go with the name they gave it. In any case, that���s what it's called, and it's pretty awful. The acting in this movie is atrocious. It was really bad. It is like one of those movies where the lead actors are so bad that their lines come out as if the camera was pointed directly at their heads. I didn�t even laugh once, and in fact, I was getting really sick. I mean, I really didn���t expect to laugh at this movie. It doesn���t matter if you think the movie is bad or not. It�s really hard to laugh in a movie like this, especially if it�s bad. I wish I could tell you that I thought it was OK for them to use a crappy band like that to put a bad film together, but I can�t. I have to wonder if the band was in the studio when the film was made, or if the director/producer/producers simply wanted a cheap, crappy band to film with. Either way, I think the acting was really poor in this film. That wasn���t always the case with this movie, but it really sucked this time around. It looked awful, it sounded terrible, it seemed like they just made it for the money. If
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     A couple of years ago, I found myself standing in line to see The Social Network. I had to work the night shift at my job so I couldn't see the movie (that part I'll never forget though). I was excited for the movie but the hype was not worth it.  In the film, Mark Zuckerberg (played by the late Aaron Sorkin) creates a company and sets out to build it from scratch.   While we're told there will be some kind of a secret sauce to Facebook that will let people find each other, he doesn't reveal anything else and the movie goes on and on about this mysterious, innovative, revolutionary, new way of doing things. There is so much wrong with it. First of all, the movie is about the founding of a company that is based in Silicon Valley and doesn't even make anything in California. Second of all it makes it sound like there is a secret, unique, innovative sauce to how people connect with each other.  They didn't invent the wheel, they just used it to make a bunch of people rich.  At one point the founders of Facebook, and a few other friends of the founder, try to recruit a man named Eduardo Saverin into their company. They decide to let him pick from their menu of 50 jobs. He goes through and picks only three. The guys decide to make Eduardo's life miserable because he won't join their company because he is so smart.  Now, if you think about it, if they hired a smart guy, why did they give him only three choices? Thirdly, and most importantly, what would be the point of having a company if you can't use it to help connect people in a useful way?  Saverins choice was to do what the founders wanted him to, but he refused to do it because he didn't think he was good enough.  This is exactly the kind of mentality that causes people to be unhappy.  I was there when it happened, it was terrible.  And there were some people there who hated the movie and it ruined their day.  There are a few moments of hope, but for the most part the movie was an embarrassment.  Why do people like movies like this? It's like people love to see their idols make mistakes and fall down. I remember a guy I knew at work who really hated this movie. His entire life he has been told "you don't

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie during college (and have watched it several times). I was only 12 when this came out, so I really can't compare it with my memories of it now. I'm only really interested in what happened in the first half, as I don't really recall any of the stuff that happens later. It's about an old couple who live on a small island in the middle of nowhere in the Pacific, and the couple have a long history of domestic violence that culminates in a domestic war that gets resolved with a knife. The first half is pretty much just about the couple dealing with the fallout of the war, but they also meet an old man who is a war vet from the South, who is also an old, broken man, and they become friends after they learn about each other and how they got to where they are now. It doesn't really progress, but it does pick up during this time in the second half when the couple meets a young woman, who happens to be the daughter of a woman who died in the war who is now married to an old soldier. The girl and the old man get along so well, and it doesn't take long for them to be best friends, and then they're married. This is the first of the two bad movies that were in the last few years that were basically based on these two books, so it's pretty surprising that I only remember the second movie. It did take place at a small place, with a young couple, and there was a little kid in it, which I thought was a good thing because that was when I was a kid. The film is pretty standard fantasy stuff, with all of the usual tropes, though it had its share of surprises, such as the girl being a vampire (and a pretty good one at that). All of the magic was pretty much in the main character's heads, but there was some real tension between the main couple, which really shows how well they are able to deal with this whole situation. This was my first experience with a lot of these bad fantasy films, and I'm glad that I finally got to see it. The final part of this bad film was the ending. It was pretty simple, and not what I expected from this movie. I mean, it's a bad fantasy movie, and you don't want to see a happy ending, and a lot can happen at any given point during a bad adventure. The ending was pretty generic
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Don't you love it when a movie is bad?   This is not one of those movies.   First, the film has no charm, and the worst part is that it makes you believe there is something going on with the villain.  This is just a bad film.  The main cast are so bad that you could not believe it.  Every other part of the film seems to be there to show how evil and powerful the evil villain is.  A couple of characters that are in this film don't seem to do anything.  We even have a whole side plot on how the evil antagonist has taken advantage of a widow for the past five years to get the location for her new home.  If there are more good moments than bad in this movie, they are far and few between.  This movie makes no sense at all.  It's really sad and uninspired.  I think I should just leave this review right here and not make another one about it. If you like the movie " The Last Stand ", you will love this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    1. "The Last Temptation of Christ"  "The LastTemptationOfChrist" is a film that is the very definition of the last word in the cinema world. It is an experience of the most mind-numbing nature. I can think of no other film where an entire film has just been used to try to sell a message that is so stupid that it is almost funny to watch, which is not to say that there isn't some interesting elements to it.  As an example, I would point to the movie's treatment of God as the savior. When the hero of the story is asked his question about why God allowed Christ to die for our sins, he replies, "Well, that was a bad day for everyone, so that's why God took him." No, that is not what God did. That is not how God does things. But it is not surprising to me that God would take such a risk. For instance, God could have used some of Jesus' disciples, who would have been able to defend themselves against such a threat. In fact, God never uses just the one faithful and powerful man. Instead he makes a deal with Satan, giving him all of the apostles, so he could have a real fight. Satan could have easily won this fight. Instead, he didn't. Instead of doing what was best for his followers, he decided to use Jesus for his own ends, and then he took all of them captive and held them for thirty years. , the most brilliant scene of the movie, was never even touched upon or explained. It only takes a few seconds to explain that God and Satan are fighting for all of humankind, and Satan wins and all of humanity is saved. But the scene just fades out in the middle of the film, and no one ever really understands what happened.  a person is saved by God but is unable to see the miracle of the cross, because his eyes are blocked by his chains and the chains are preventing him from seeing the miracle. God saves him by letting him see the cross from the outside. After being saved, this guy starts having visions about what God is doing, and his entire world begins to fall apart. We later find out that God was trying to free his people from the chains so that they could have the opportunity to live. But God had no power in the physical realm to free them and no reason to keep them bound for 30 years, anyway

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the beginning of 2012 I bought a copy of the new Star Wars movie. This time, it was a great experience. There are many characters, each with their own traits. For me, the movie had more emotional impact than the previous ones I watched. The action is well done, the characters are well done. The movie has a plot that I did not really understand, but it was enough to keep me watching. There were not many plot holes, but most of it was in the movies previous sequels. The plot was not the main reason why I liked the movie. It was the characters. The main characters are all likeable and interesting, even Luke. This was a character driven movie that was fun for the whole family. I hope to see another movie in the Star Wars series soon, as the series is so good and I want to see more.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My review:  This is an old-school horror movie, one with a very simple premise and even simpler characters. I can't think of much more to say about this movie. You can't go wrong if you're a fan of movies with a "scare" theme. I would recommend this movie to everyone who likes old-fashioned horror movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "No way! This is one of the worst movies ever made. This movie is like a bad trip on the internet. This is a movie that I would not want to be a part of." "The whole movie was so awful and unbelievable. I just can't watch this movie and have to stop after 30 minutes. I will never watch this or want to watch it again."  "My wife and I had to look away from the computer screen after watching this. I don't want to know anything else about this movie. It was a waste of my time and money. I do not recommend this movie to anyone."    The above reviews were posted by movie fans as well as critics. In some instances, the reactions to the movie were not unanimous. In particular, some movie fans complained about the "cannibalistic and perverted" story line and the "stupid" decisions made by the filmmakers.   But those who did not like the movie may have had different reactions. A reviewer from the Hollywood Reporter said that the movie "is not a horror movie but an exercise in low-budget movie-making, that is the film's main feature." One of the few reviews of the film to receive positive reactions was a review written by one of Star Wars' most popular characters, Princess Leia.  According to this review, the film was "well worth the time to sit through" and "makes an excellent substitute for the original" Star Wars film.  An editorial in The Hollywood Reporter called the movie a "cursed movie" because it had not met the standards set by its predecessors.  The review added that the film had "nothing to do with a "new trilogy."  In addition, the reviews of this movie in magazines such as Entertainment Weekly and The Washington Post suggested that the ratings were "not surprising" and that the critics who gave the movie such a low rating were "misinformed."  These reviews suggested that Star Wars fans had not seen the film and that those who enjoyed the film might "not feel the need to spoil the fun for those who haven't seen it." At the end of the day, it's easy to say that people can make their own opinions on the merits of a film. But these opinions do not always represent the opinions of other fans. To be honest, the ratings of the reviews that were given in this movie are not necessarily reflective of the opinions or opinions of the fan community as a whole.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought the film was very entertaining. I enjoyed it a lot and I loved that the film started out with an introduction and then progressed from there.   The actors did a great job in portraying each character and they all did a good job with their roles.  It was good to see that the movie was set in the 50's with a bunch of old women who were still living in the 1920's.  If I had been only a small child in the 1950's I would have probably been a bit more intrigued by it.  The story was a good one and there were a few good laughs and one or two good tears. It did get very confusing towards the end. It was interesting to see how they pulled it off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    We had such a great time at The Playhouse in San Antonio! This was our second time there. The theatre is just beautiful. The seats are comfy and comfortable, and the lighting is perfect. We arrived at 7:30am on a Sunday morning. Parking was easy, although there was plenty. We walked straight to the theatre (the show started around 8:30 am). The doors were very locked, so we walked up the side stairs and unlocked the doors. Once inside, the theatres is amazing. This is a great place to spend a weekend with friends and family. The shows are well produced. You are surrounded by a lovely setting in the theatre. I love the scenery and the actors are well chosen and well trained. They are fun to watch. The audience is nice and supportive. You feel as if you are in a big family. It was a good time, and we will definitely go back.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you hate the movie, write a negative movie review.   But please, don't get carried away.  If you like a movie and you can't stand the content or the acting, then leave a nice comment.  When you leave a "good" comment, keep it on topic.  Do not talk about a specific scene.  You want a film to work, not to blow up in your face.  But if you're really bored by a film and need to vent, use the following: " I really liked this movie.  This movie is really weird and funny."   " The movie was entertaining enough, but the acting sucked.  The guy with the mustache sucked!   The woman in black sucked. "    Do you want the rest of your comment deleted or deleted completely?   In other words, do NOT start a new thread.  No one will read it.  Please.  If something in your comment is "dramatic" or "mature" or has "too much sex," please be aware that you will not have the same chance to have it deleted as I will.  It is a free country.  Keep it on-topic.  " This movie sucked! "  It is important to remember that a film is a product.  A product is supposed to appeal to the public, not the individual.  While you may think you know your movies, there's no guarantee it is a good product.   As a movie reviewer, I like to review all movies and their movies.  Movies are just products, and they can be good or bad.  I don't have any agenda for reviewing the film.  However, if a movie is "funny" and "sad," and a person says "I had a great time watching this" I feel a bit more like a jerk if I don 't review it.   A movie is just a product, and the public has a right to know.   I've seen a lot of "fun" movies.   But I haven't seen many "bad" ones.  I've also seen a "fun, but stupid" movie.   And a "great movie with an excellent soundtrack, but awful acting."  And, I've also enjoyed some movies that were "so sad and pathetic I just wanted to jump on the bed and cuddle with a puppy."   I don t know
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you like something bad enough, you're going to like it, even if it is terrible. If you think you like a movie because it's bad, you have a distorted view of your ability to like something because it isn't as good as it could be.   I think it's more complex than that. I think the general attitude that movie critics have, that anything bad can be "great" if it was released in the time before I was born, is really a reflection of our own limitations. I've always thought that film is a lot like music, where you can really make your mark in it if you're good at it and dedicated. That's not something I'm very good at. So when I watch "The Usual Suspects," I think that is what a movie critic is, in a way, though maybe not as clear or as clear-cut as a movie director.  When you hear people say, "The usual suspects are in here," that doesn't mean I've seen them.  I don't mean to disparage them or to make fun of them. I don.t feel that a movie reviewer should be necessarily that person who watches a lot of bad movies.  If I think a movie is good, then I can't see how you could really be a good movie critic.  Because I think you're basically just trying to find fault and put people down, I think of the critic as a kind of an asshole.  But it's funny because people always ask me how I can write about films that I don\'t like.  It's so funny because I've been doing it for so long, so I\'ve done so many movies that I know I like and that I love.  And, of course, people tell me they love them and think they\'re great, too.  So it seems obvious that they know that I am going to make their movie bad or a terrible movie, and I think, as a critic, I am just trying my best not to do it.  That said, there are things in movies that are just not going to work, and there are movies that people tell you they hate, and they don\'d rather see a really good movie than a bad one.  Even if they really hate it. It isn\'t something that I think about.  What does that have to do with being a critic? It's more about how you judge a movie

I know it's one of the few action movies released this year, but I hate how the movie is rushed with its plot and the pacing is wrong.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For whatever reason, this is one of those movies that has somehow ended up on a very large audience that doesn't know anything about it. While I understand it is intended to be some kind of homage, it is far from that. The acting is awful, the jokes are made all too often and the directing is terrible. It is not that the film has any real story, it seems to be more of a spoof on a number of well known films. The characters are not funny, the acting is not good, and the story is a complete non-sequitur. If you like movies with some good acting and good story-telling, but you don't understand what this film is about, then I suggest you pass on this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My first impression of 'Mystic River' was that it was really well-acted. It was a small movie and it had an exciting story and a very charismatic cast. However, a few scenes in this movie were incredibly stupid. At one point, we see three guys, Charlie, David and Joe, playing golf on a nice day. The guy at the end of the fairway keeps getting distracted by some bird in a tree and, as he runs around the tree, Joe makes out with him. Then the bird flaps its wings and the scene turns into a bird fight, with Joe and his pals beating the bird into a pulp. I had to look away from the screen. This scene, and the whole movie, had the worst acting ever. At least in 'The Great Escape' or 'The Outlaw Josey Wales', the acting was okay but still entertaining. I felt like I was watching a bad version of 'The Love Boat'. I know I'm being a bit harsh here but there were a few parts in this film that were just stupid. For example, during the golf game at the beginning of the movie, we find out that there are two golfers at the tournament, who are only named Charlie and David and there's no mention of Joe. Then a few seconds later we see Joe and a boy who looks like him playing golf and we get a flashback to when Joe and Charlie were kids, when they were friends. So why in the world are we supposed to believe that it's Joe's idea to hang around the bird on purpose? I really thought that this scene was the worst one. I mean, I understand that you have to have a reason for the characters to hang out with each other in the first place. But why would Joe go around sticking his nose into things that he knows nothing about? I could not believe that we were supposed to sympathize with Joe at this point. I was really surprised by the acting. This movie is rated PG-13 so I expected some kind of action or gore. I wasn't disappointed at all. I think the film was just written badly, though, and it doesn't help when the director and some of the actors make mistakes.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a very, very bad movie. At a first reading I thought I was going to hate it. The story seemed to be simple and had no depth and didn't have any character development. It seemed to take itself quite seriously, and the movie's atmosphere didn't make it any less so. It did have a lot of very good moments and even though the main characters weren't interesting, they were all very well executed and worked well as a group. The whole movie was filled with very bad jokes and characters that were ridiculous. It's almost laughable how dumb these characters are.   The only reason this movie stood out from most is because it had a really strong cast. From a first glance it looked like a really good script that really could have been good if the director had gone with something a little more original. This is not a movie that should be forgotten, and this is not the kind of movie you can enjoy if you're looking for something that's going to make you feel sad and angry at the same time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It sucks...  This review may contain spoilers.  I don't know much about this movie, but I found it to be... Well, it wasn't bad. It wasn't good. It's not great. It just did what it set out to do. I'm not saying it was bad by any means. But there are some aspects of this movie that just kind of don't make a lot of sense. If you can look past those, then this movie works. So, to that end, let's take a look. This movie tells the story of a group of guys who all have problems. They don't have a lot in common, but they all have some sort of problem that causes them to bond. The problem I've always been most curious about is, "Why does this movie keep going back and forth from a group who are all in their late 30s to one that are in their early 20s?" To put it simply, the film has this odd habit of keeping all these different characters who are in a wide range of ages throughout a small amount of time. While we do see them age, it is never as drastically as the characters in the film seem to be able to handle. So at first I was a bit worried because it was a slow pace at first. However, as the film progresses, things start to take off and the film gets more and more interesting. Now, to the actual point of this review... I don't really know why this movie is so much better than other movies. As the movie progresses it gets much, much better and then it ends. There isn't a lot to say about it because there is nothing new to be learned. But as I watched this movie I kept thinking about some of the things I thought about this and that. While I will be going into a lot more detail about the movie in my review, I really wanted to see it again to see if the things that I thought that were funny or entertaining were still funny or not. Because when I think about it, this is one of the few movies that made me laugh more than once. But the thing I don and it's also true of some of my other favorites. It doesn't have to be in an extreme way for it to still work. So please, if you have any other movie-related questions, leave a comment and I will try to respond as quickly as I can. But if you feel like this review was
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This review is about the first half of the movie, it is about a girl who is about to get married to a very rich guy. Her fiancee has an affair with another woman. While she tries to stop it she falls for a man who is a little too rich. This woman also has a problem and has a boyfriend with the same problems and they get together. They decide to get the girl out of the situation. The movie is very much about a rich man, it takes up a lot of screen time. This movie has a lot to offer. The actress that plays this girl and her fiancee really do do a good job portraying their characters. The people in the movie really do seem real. This is a movie that will not be forgotten.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Casting:  If this movie had an A-List star and/or an Oscar nomination, it would have been fantastic.   The cast is stellar, especially Tilda Swinton, who delivers her performance with aplomb.  The only weak link is the voice-over, which is a little jarring at times.  However, that is the least of the problems I have with this movie.  This movie is not a good movie. It's just not that great.  I don't even remember how I felt about the ending and that was probably a result of me having been intoxicated at the time.  Soundtrack:  I have a soft spot for score in horror films, especially when there are good old fashioned jump scares.  In this case, the score is actually pretty good.    The most notable song I remember is "Livin' on a Prayer", sung by a young Tilda who appears in a flashback to her family's wedding.  Another song that I can't forget is "The Moon Rang Like a Bell".  The soundtrack is pretty enjoyable and is a welcome addition to the collection of film score. Picture Quality:     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (but that might be overstating it) If your movie is bad you've probably already been told about it. Maybe not from someone else, but from someone who saw it and it didn't work for them. I'm not sure how often this happens with TV or film but when you get a bad TV show or film there's a pretty good chance that you've heard it before. But if you've ever seen a bad film, then you know the process of the movie "going bad" in a hurry. The movie starts out fine, the cast is good, the music is good... but there's no heart and little story line. Sure, the actors are talented, but they are on the same level as the people who played them in the last two "good" movies and they are not the same. In other words, what we are getting is a story about a girl with a dream and a crazy dad who is a little crazy too. It's not a movie you watch and think "Wow, I really like this movie." It's more like "This movie just isn't very good and this story makes no sense." It feels like a "failed TV pilot" as well as an actual film. It isn't a bad picture, it just doesn't work well. Maybe it will work for a couple of years, maybe not. But I can't help but think that if this is the best they have, then that would really be a "failure."   I don't know what to say.   I would say that a good story is key to making a good movie. If the movie is not good, it's not the movie. It is a bad thing to not have a good idea. But there's another thing. I've had movies where the lead is good and the story is not. The lead is wonderful and the movie just doesn' t work. Maybe a film isn't good because the story doesn't make any sense and there's nothing interesting going on. But that's a little unfair. Maybe you just can't tell a story well and so your idea of what the story should be doesn't quite fit the situation or the characters. In that case, you should probably do a better job with the story line and the actors and make sure that it makes sense. And sometimes a director really just doesn t know what the script is supposed to be, and that may make for a bad story. But it's
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In general, people love a movie that goes from A to B quickly and doesn't take a lot of time to make up for the time it spent on B. So why did we watch this film? Because it had the most action, and that's all we needed. The action scenes were great, but the film had its flaws. This movie has a lot going on, and it all doesn't make sense.   This is one of the only films I've seen that tries to tell a story in the first act, and then completely stops telling the story to follow the action sequences. Why did they do that? Because if they had followed through on the story, it would've felt as awkward as watching an hour and a half of movies without a plot. The characters aren't very interesting, and they don't do much besides yelling and running around. The film has its flaws, but it doesn't matter. This film was a piece of crap.  I don't even remember what this film was about.  I can't tell you how long it took to watch this movie, and the last three minutes are like an eternity.  And then, of course, it had a whole lot of action.  The plot was lame and the action was awesome. But at some point, the film stopped working and that was the best part. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The badness is just so overwhelming that it has no place to land. The worst movie I've ever seen. The characters are so unlikable and the script is so bad that it makes you wish you would've never seen this. This movie is so disgusting that it's unbelievable that Hollywood let this movie go for distribution.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the interest of providing a balanced view of this movie, I must say that I do not feel as though it should be viewed as a 'bad' movie. I felt that it was a very bad movie. There are so many issues with this film that it is hard to know where to start. Let's start with the 'plot'.   This movie is actually about a man who wants to get his penis circumcised.  This plotline is quite ridiculous in it's own right and the whole thing becomes quite surreal and very, very creepy.   If you are a man and you do not have a foreskin, this movie will be a total nightmare for you, I assure you.  The man who dreams of getting his dick circumcised, is portrayed as a mentally deranged man.  The man's wife has a huge fixation on her husband's penis, to the point that she wants him to get it cut off.  Her desire to have his penis cut off is shown to be so powerful that her son is a little bit taken in by it.  When the man does finally get his dick cut off, he has the strangest dream where his wife is on top of him in a strange dream sequence.  You can tell from the beginning that he is going to be a major troublemaker.  I don't know how the filmmakers were able to put that in the movie and keep it from being totally ridiculous.  A few things are a little hard to swallow: 1)   A man whose dick gets cut off by his wife.  What's up with that? 2)   The idea that your wife could dream of having you cut off a penis, is hard for me to swallow.  Does she have a mind of her own?  I think you can make it work though.  3)   Why did the wife have to cut off her husband when she was sleeping with him?   A lot of people are having this thought when they first watch this movie.  To be honest, that's the movie's weakest point. It is very apparent that the filmmakers never even watched this movie to get a better view of it.   I would give it a 6.0 out of 10, but it is so bad, that I would be putting it down for a while.  A negative review in the vein of the first point: This movie is the absolute WORST!!!   It's a bad story, a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A man in a mask kills four people in the bathroom at a movie theater. It turns out to be a suicide by the man himself.   The wife and children are murdered by a man in black.  This is the only book that I've read about this story so far.  The cover of this book is beautiful. It's an old looking book, but that's a great thing because it makes it easy to find. I just had to buy it.  It is a hardcover book that has a nice soft cover.  A lot of times you don't get the same type of book again after buying it. But this book has been on my shelf for about three weeks now. It seems to be the first in a series about a man that was in a cult for three years and he found out that they were lying to him.  This book was originally published in the 70's. It was a cult classic that was on the bestseller list for 3 weeks.  I recommend this book to anyone that is into this kind of thing. This book is an interesting read about a person that lived in a small town and how he ended up becoming a part of this cult.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst of the lot are the "movie tie-ins". Most of them don't work, some are awful, some get a little more than a little right, but in general they're just bad.   Most of these movies are based on comic book or comic book inspired comics (most notably Batman).   Unfortunately the comic book movie tie-in movies are a dime a dozen.  But, I guess, one of these days you're going to have to let your kids see something that is a movie tie in.  The other ones are worse, in fact. I'm not going to even bother describing this film.  You might as well read the reviews.   The worst of these are the movies based on books which are just so bad, I'm going to give them an R.  This one is a complete train wreck.  So, it is a bit confusing why the film was made, but there is an explanation:  I think a film that is so bad it had to be called,'movie tie in', must not have a good plot. So, the filmmakers made this movie so bad that there is no good plot to speak of.  They're just telling a story, which has the potential of being interesting, but fails horribly in execution.  Here is the plot:  The film opens with a very cool scene.  After the death of a terrorist, he finds himself in an empty apartment.  His wife is on the phone.  She is not talking. She is in a coma.  He decides to break the news to her. He leaves the apartment, and calls her from his car.  Then, he takes his clothes off, and she notices his erection.  Before she can say anything, he grabs her by the throat, and says, "You never know when someone is going to show up, baby."  He then leaves the car and comes to her apartment.   She is apparently dead.  How?  What about the fact that he's a former military man, and has an apartment in her building?  Did he take her to the hospital?  The movie then jumps back a few years to an older, wiser Bruce Wayne.  It seems he had a fight with a mobster, and his wife was injured during the fight.  When he finds out that she is going into surgery, he goes to the morgue and looks for her.  What does

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (I know the movie is not that bad)  .   To quote "Funny Games":   "A bad movie can make you laugh and cry in the same movie.".  I have seen this movie a number of times now. It has a number that gets progressively worse as the film goes on.   If I have seen it in the theaters it has always been on an older generation of televisions. I haven't been able to locate a DVD or VHS version anywhere and the movies I've seen on Youtube have been more of a compilation of various "behind the scenes" material. It wasn't until today that I came across this online video from youtube.com. The only thing that was different about this version was the title.  The movie was "The Phantom of the Opera". It was the opening sequence to a TV show that was played at the time. This film was very popular in the 50s and 60s and became a cult classic in the 70s and 80s.  For the purposes of this review I have decided to make a separate entry for the film because it contains many of the same elements that make this "bad movie" such a good movie. I hope you enjoy this "behind-the-scenes" film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The thing is, the movie had me on the edge of my seat and kept me in the movie theater for the last two hours of the movie. There are scenes in this movie that leave you breathless.     I felt like this movie was going to blow me away and I was expecting something much more epic than what this film delivered.  As I mentioned in my first review, this film was about the journey of a group of soldiers in a war-torn country. However, this war-ridden land has been overrun by aliens and now they have a war of their own. This film is like an alien invasion movie. The film begins when a soldier's ship is stolen by a group who are looking for a secret alien weapon that will help them fight against an evil alien race. It is a short and to the point film with this group and this alien war.  While the movie starts off on a somewhat slow and quiet pace, the war that they are in doesn't last long and by the end of the film, there is a very action packed climax.    The alien invaders come out of the ground and then from the air and then they fly in from the clouds.  There are some great set pieces in this film. There was a great helicopter chase scene where the aliens were flying across the skies.  It was very well done and made for a great film.  Then the alien war really starts.  The alien race who are invading the planet have a very strong alien mentality and it doesn't take long for the invaders to be overrun. There is an action sequence when the aliens are on the ground that was spectacular.  I thought the aliens made a great appearance in the film. It reminded me of the classic aliens in the "Raiders of the Lost Ark" in which the aliens came from the sky. There were several scenes in the battle with the aliens where they actually had us on the brink of death.  This film was a bit rough for me. I would say that this film did not need much editing.  However, I really feel that the ending of the sequel should have been a bit more satisfying.  Overall, it is one of those rare war films that will keep you in the theater until the end.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     "Weird" is a word that comes to mind when talking about this movie.  On the surface it may seem like a comedy, but there's so much darkness and angst going on that it doesn't feel as funny as it does at first.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Don't.   If the movie was terrible and you didn't care, just move on.  No one will blame you.  If you watched the movie and hated it, take a deep breath and remember this is a movie about what happens in the movies, and sometimes it isn't so pretty.  You can judge these movies for what they are, but they are still a part of pop culture. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "What did I think of   The Exorcist   When I think about   this movie   It's the movie  I never wanted   to watch." "How bad was it?" "This was one of those movies that just   just never really made sense." "Worst   movie I   watched   ever." "This movie  has   a   title." "A good   action flick."  . The Exorist.  The name of the movie, is not the name of an exorcist, the name is not used in the movie at all.   Is this not a fact? If it is not, why didn't they show the name on the movie poster? Does anyone know what this movie is about?   I believe that they may have been thinking of that film, but they never could have been.  I found it very strange that when the movie is over, that after the title is over for the first time, we hear the following. "Oh. And don't forget   the final   song."  What song is this?  This is in a church with a bunch of people.   How many people did they have there?   In a church where they have a funeral? What song are they singing?  I don't see where this is related to anything, the title of the story is the title, but the song is not. This is more than a coincidence.  What is the relationship between the priest and the priest's sister in this movie?   Is there any relationship between these two people, other than the fact that they both happen to be priests?  What does this priest do with the soul of a little girl?  And why was this little girl's sister so interested in the soul?  How did the little girl find the body of her sister?  Who is that priest's family?  Does the girl have a brother or father?   Does the little boy have a father?  Why is the father so interested, why is the priest so interested? Why is he so interested about the priest, why the priest is so interested.  I don t know. The first two movies were good, but I am sure this movie was awful.  A friend of mine thought that this movie may have had something to do with "The Exorcism" being used as a reference for the TV show that is about

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's really sad how many people are really going to give this movie 1 star. The script is boring and really predictable from the start. When you are reading a book or listening to a podcast, you know exactly what is going to happen. You don't need to read a book to know what happens. You can watch a movie and get an idea of how it will end. This movie just doesn't do that. It doesn't have a clear goal. Its just a bunch of people in a room, they don't really know what they are going to do with the powers they are given and they try to figure it out. I think if there was a script with a clear theme or idea this movie could have been interesting. I don't think its supposed to be a scary movie because that was not the point. It could have done with a little more humor and a little less tension but for the most part this movie was just boring and confusing. I would only recommend this to people that want to see a good horror movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you're looking for something that just plain "meh", I highly recommend  . It does not try to be anything more than a bland, unmemorable summer blockbuster, and you'll find yourself waiting for the film to end on a cliffhanger and just be over. As a fan of horror films, I feel compelled to write a negative review about a bad film:  Cinema doesn't get much more boring than a film like this.   This is a very generic summer movie for which all the best elements were lost, as if they were thrown away in the process of making this cheap movie.  I feel that the best way to describe this movie would be "The Cabin in the Woods (2010)" meets "Shaun of the Dead" meets "Die Hard with a Vengeance."   It's not as good as the first two entries of this trilogy, but it's also not worse than the last two installments of the series.  While I have no problem with generic horror movies, I would have preferred more creativity and originality from the writers in creating this film, which leaves me wanting more. A generic summer blockbuster that doesn't try to tell a story in a creative way: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just got a copy of a movie, and I'm pretty sure I'd have loved it. But I can't say the same about the movie. I don't think it's the same as the books, or the movies.  So why did I just read this...    The book is not much of a book.        It is, rather, a collection of short stories.   It was originally published in 1974 (by a small press called W.W. Norton), but it was republished a few years later by the small press Bantam Books.  Each of the stories was originally written as a single paragraph of an essay by John Grisham.  The sentences are all short, but the thoughts are long.  Grishman is quite a story teller and his stories tend to take a lot to process.  When you've finished reading a story, it can be hard to go back and try it again.  I had to read the first story before I could go back to the second one and have an easier time with the third.  And I'm not even going to bother with the fourth or fifth story.  It's like the story collection that was released on DVD a few months ago.  The story collections that come out of the publishing industry don't even try to be collections.  And that is exactly how I thought the stories would be.    But in this collection, each story takes its place in a small section.  This makes them more manageable.  But there is no grouping, which is a bit annoying.    I'd much rather have a single collection that's easy to read, and less of a hassle to move through. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Beneath the surface there's the worst of the worst - the worst in terms of writing and acting." - Moviepilot.com "Worst of the Worst" - Movieguide "Worse than the movie it's based on." - Indiewire "As awful as it was, it never once came close to that level of stupid." - A.V. Club "I don't want to see any more of this garbage." - UPROXX  I've spent a lot of time thinking about the kind of film I'd like to see at the theater. I have never in my life seen a film that actually left me feeling less excited for its next showing than "Babe" is. I can imagine myself in the theater next to the moviegoer who saw "Babes in Toyland" the first time and was like, "That was pretty good. This is even worse." I can't imagine what it was like for the director, Todd Haynes. It's the sort of experience that leaves you shaking your head at yourself in the mirror. Here's why I think the movie sucks: 1. The acting isn't good. That was pretty evident right from the beginning of "Baby." I understand that actors are paid to get on camera and play characters they wouldn't necessarily be good at acting for in real life, and this movie has that in spades. However, the performances all come across as generic, shallow and flat. Even the characters Haynes has cast don't bring anything new to the table, other than their names. If they're actors and they know what they're doing, you have the beginnings of an interesting performance. You don't get that here. 2. The setting. It seems to me that this is supposed to be a movie about young girls and being a virgin, right? And yet the movie itself isn't about them at all. It starts when one of them takes her first kiss (we'll get to that) and goes on to involve the rest of the cast in a story about growing up with the "other" sex. This story doesn't center on being a teenager or what she's thinking or feeling, and in fact there's an entire half hour in which the main characters don't even mention sex. It makes you wonder, how much thought did the writer put into what a girl would want when it comes to sex, and what it would mean for her to lose
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie really made me want to see a sequel. I watched this movie because I was thinking about watching   and it was a little too cheesy for my taste. The main problem is that the plot is nothing but a long winded train wreck of a story. I found myself wanting to stop watching this movie and thinking "Man it has been awhile since I saw something this stupid." I am hoping that some of the other reviews will be helpful for any of you who are considering watching this. I give it an 8/10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I got this, I really had no idea what to expect. I had read the synopsis and it sounded kind of cheesy, but I still had to give it a try, because I was tired of all the other crappy horror movies that I found in the movie rental section.   I was expecting a cheesy campy movie with plenty of blood and gore, but instead I got something that really wasn't all that bad.  The movie starts off like a horror movie, as we're introduced to the characters.  First we have Jason Voorhees, the killer of the film.  Jason V is a good looking dude, as he always is.  He has a very muscular build, and a sexy, sexy voice. He has some really bad luck with women in his past, and is really out of place and just really unlikable.  As you see, Jason V can be quite a jerk, but in this movie, he really tries his hardest to make sure we don't really get a chance to see what would happen if a person would try to kill him (it really isn't very much of a horror story).  The rest of the movie starts out like a regular horror movie.  We start out with a cop chasing down a killer, and we have our first action sequence.  This was really interesting to me, because as soon as we got to the police station, we saw a guy in a hazmat suit trying to find out more about the guy that is killing the people around him.  It was a cool way to build up the suspense for the viewers.  Once we get to Jason, it is quickly apparent that this guy is a complete joke.  All his kills are either comical or comical in a stupid way.  I think the reason for this is that the creators probably were trying to make a horror film, but they didn't know what to do with the protagonist.  From what I gather, the character of Jason isn't really well liked by everyone in the town.  But the movie doesn't give him a lot to do, so he ends up just sitting around doing nothing.  And then things start to get more serious.  There is a school girl named Claire (played by a really hot Sarah Paulson) who has gotten involved with Jason, and she is dying.  Claire was at school the day Jason V came in, and when Jason V walked into the classroom he was the only
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        The story of  The World's End   took a turn for the worse in the movie's third act, which in retrospect feels like an afterthought.   There are still moments of great performances from everyone, but the film drags.  While I'm not sure it has any of the makings of a great movie, it's a decent enough thriller.  While it's unlikely anyone will be seeing it after this review, it might give you an excuse to see some of the other great horror films of 2013. The World end is not a good film, but it is a pretty entertaining one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    And finally...   You don't want to be a movie reviewer. If you have a few bad movies in your collection, you won't want anyone else's opinion of them. You might not even want to watch them.   This is why they make movies like The Avengers. They know we're not the most educated moviegoer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the first movie i ever saw that made me hate horror movies, i thought i knew what they were going for with this movie because i really liked the trailer but this movie is a bit of a letdown. It's almost hard to believe that this could have been good. The trailer looked pretty amazing and i had a feeling i would enjoy the movie. The first few scenes of the movie are very creepy. i know a lot of horror fans would say this is bad but i just didn't enjoy this movie. There's something weird about the characters and how they act and that's a little disturbing. They don't feel real and that feels like a missed opportunity. The plot itself is very generic and has you questioning the characters motives because they all have something to hide. You can't really see what's going on unless they are in the same room. This movie didn't take me to a good place at all. The acting was awful and it was just hard to relate to them. The whole movie felt a little rushed and awkward. I think it's a shame because the trailer is amazing and this film could have really turned me on. But the end is not worth it because there isn't a great ending. I didn't feel like i got what the movie was trying to do and it didn't leave a bad taste in my mouth. I know I have another bad movie coming up in the future and i have a feeling the one before this will be even worse. I don't really recommend this movie to anyone, this is a very average horror movie and doesn't have any promise.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a film about a boy and his dog and his mom, and they meet a man who wants to take his dog. I'm not exactly sure what that means but I'm glad it was not an elephant or something like that.   The guy is a nice guy, and his wife has a very nice heart. He can be a pain in the ass, but his dog is really adorable and I just love it. There are a few things I don't like about the movie.  First, he seems to be the kind of guy who wants his dog in his house all the time.  And that's fine, but it can be annoying when he's just walking the dog in your back yard, which is why he is forced to move away.  It would have been nice to see him be more of a friend to the dog (which he could be if he didn't live next to it), but then I realized that I liked the guy so much that I would have loved to have a friend like him in my back yard.  I didn't really like the guy's wife.  They have two kids together (which is nice, but I do think that in a few scenes, she talks way more about her dog than she does about her husband).  She is more interested in the dog than her husband.  She would have made a much better wife. So this guy is cool, I guess.  In addition, I can't help but notice the woman's hair is much shorter in real life than it was in the movie, which I guess was to show that she's younger than her spouse.  And she's also the woman who wants the dog, so that's kind of silly.  But then there's the plot.  The boy and the dog have to find the man's daughter (or they will all get turned into dogs).  We get an extended shot of the dog playing with a tree and I was pretty impressed, but at the end, I didn`t really feel any excitement.  Also, I did not like how the dog was able to take off into the forest.  He does it in one scene and I can understand that if he were to run into a building, and it would be a lot less dangerous for a dog to go outside. But I wanted him to stay in his home with his owner (whom he is clearly not very friendly with).  I think the movie could have
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For those of you who read this blog and don't know my story... I was born and raised in Detroit. I went to school in Southfield in a middle class neighborhood. I was raised in a Catholic home. I graduated from Catholic High School where I majored in Biology. My father was an educator. When I was 14 years old, my mother started to date a guy named Billy Martin. She got pregnant and divorced Billy in 1960. It was not my best moment in life. Billy and I continued to date, my father never understood why she was with him, I can't believe it myself. In 1962 Billy Martin, was arrested for raping my mother in her own home. My mother divorced Billy shortly thereafter. A year later she married another man. I saw my mom after she was married to this other man for about 4 months. I have a picture of her in her wedding dress with a beautiful young man. Billy Martin moved to Michigan where he ran the Wings hockey team. The Wings won a championship and his name was on the cup. I didn't see my mom much after that because she was always away at work. When she did come home, I was with my brother in his car with Billy. She was coming home with a man. My mom told my brother they were going to meet up in the middle of the road. My brother didn't believe her and he asked where they were supposed to meet. My moms friend pulled up in a Cadillac and said we were supposed meet at the Red River. She said if she wasn't going home with him then we could meet anywhere else. That was the last time my mom saw her husband. I grew up in Detroit with the Martin's, but I never saw the man who committed this horrible crime. I heard that he was in prison for a long time and lived in a halfway house. Billy married a woman named Ruth. The wedding was a bust. She divorced Billy. In 1980 he moved to Chicago where he started a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center called The Center. He took me to his house and said I could stay overnight. We ended up in bed. I don't remember what happened after that. I thought my mom was going to tell me she wasn`t leaving him. I told my mom to stay with him. My older brother didn`t want his mom to go. That`s when he went in and told my mother that she had to stay. When my mom returned to her
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The one thing to note about the movie in general is how bad it is and the amount of times it fails to live up to its potential. The worst part is that the whole movie feels so rushed and is basically just filler, so the main characters don't get to develop and really have a solid character arc in the movie. They all have to just mope around as their lives are completely blown apart one after the other by the events. For me, the real issue is that a bunch of people in the film actually died. The ending is just awful, to the point where it's almost painful to watch. It doesn't give a proper resolution to any of the characters' problems, so I never felt anything for any of them. The only one that does seem to have some kind of a story at the end is the main guy, which is weird.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a very, very bad movie. It was poorly edited, poorly produced, and badly acted. It never once felt authentic, and its actors couldn't even keep their character's lips from moving. It made me feel really awful, as did the entire movie.   There are people who love this movie, and it is not worth the time to make them love it. I can't recommend it, unless you want to see how awful a movie can get if you let it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In a world of movies where you can't have a bad film, and the majority of the bad ones aren't any good, how do you make it up to people?   It is a tough question. In my opinion, the movie I really hated was the first one I saw, with an A rating: The Thing from Another World.   And that's because it was bad.  The movie had a few good ideas and characters, but it was just too weird, over-acted, and rushed.  This wasn't my first time seeing this.  It was actually my second, when my dad was a few months into his career as a producer.  And I had the same bad impression of it: a movie where the only character was an anthropomorphic humanoid, covered in a skin like that of a bug or slug, and a few bugs and other creatures that were somehow connected to him.  In the movie, the hero is forced to leave his family to save the world, and it turns out that his wife was really the monster from another world.  As he leaves, she disappears and he finds a place for himself.  The first act had some decent ideas, but was just so rushed. The monster was just weird and crazy, and when it got to the end, it became much less interesting than the rest of the film, with a story that was just stupidly forced and cliche-filled.  To make matters worse, the actor who played the alien is not the first alien that appears in this movie: it is the only one.  There are literally two aliens that appear in this film, even though it is an anthology film.  While the first Alien is the first monster from the planet LV-426, the second alien is actually from LV-223, in the same system as the first, and that is a completely different world. And the alien in the second movie is just as weird and strange as the original alien in this first movie, and even seems more intelligent.  So the monster doesn't look like that in the film you're watching now, and at least there is no weirdness in this monster as in the first movie. It is just the same as that of the first film, just a little less weird.  I was so disappointed in this. It was my second movie in a row, and I didn't really like it.  This is also where I had some really bad

"I just wish they would have made a sequel," you may say.   If you know any real screenwriters, they will know that there's nothing they could have done to make this worse, because the film could not have been worse.       I love the music in this film, and the music is awesome.    It's one of the reasons that this is so bad. Â I love "The Man with Two Brains", and I think it's probably one of my favourite tracks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (The movie is about a guy in a bar who loses a fight, so he goes to a bar to get it out of his system, while he also wants a good hookup. I mean, how bad can a movie be if you are not going to be pissed off when you finish the whole thing?)   It's a well-done flick. However, I would recommend you watch this without any preconceived notions about martial arts movies.   One thing that is really worth pointing out is the story is extremely simple.  The basic idea of the movie is that the guy in the bar is having a bad day and he finds out the girl he wants is not coming back so he decides to go to a martial arts studio and make a fake fight. Unfortunately, he has to fight a guy from the studio who doesn't think he can win.  This movie is not perfect. Some of the fights are weak. However it does have a lot of heart.  It is a very funny flick.  As I said before, the guy is not the only one who is not happy.  One of the things I really like about this flick is that it doesn't try to make an action movie out of it. It just focuses on two men who fight to make a bad situation better.  I think there are some scenes where the action scenes didn't work. They did work, however, when the guys were talking to each other. I think that the movie did try to add some sort of violence, but I think it was unnecessary.  A lot of the action of this flick are exaggerated.  In the beginning of the film you have some scenes of the guys getting drunk. After a while the scene of the guy getting beaten by his friend goes on too long, and it ends up feeling like it's going to go on forever.  For me it's better to have more action.  There are some really good jokes in this flick, and they are all pretty funny.  Some of the actors that are in the movie are:  I've watched this flick twice and I still have not seen it in a theater.    I know some people are against doing this, but a lot people have already seen this flick and I want to keep everyone informed.  Unfortunately, it will take me around three weeks to go see this in a movie theater, so I'm thinking that I'll have to re-watch this with my friends
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst thing about this movie is the acting. If I can only use three words to describe the actors, it would be "breathtakingly stupid."     Every actor does something stupid in this movie, and I was genuinely surprised when none of them do anything that looks so much like an actor trying to act out a line they know they can't get, except for the main character.   This is like a comedy with a really bad-ass girl (that will probably make you hate her for some time), and all the actors are simply trying to get her to be like them so they can act out their parts.  The best way to describe this movie would be that it has a bad-assed girl and a bad ass guy, but the guy is so annoying he's never funny.  But that's what makes him so charming in his awkwardness.  And the acting really brings out the humor of this movie.  So much so that you start believing everything that's being said about the movie because it's so obvious.  In short, I liked this movie even if I didn't laugh out loud a lot, and that's exactly why I'm giving it four stars instead of five.  My Review

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the most interesting and controversial issues in cinema is the question of whether or not movies like Blade Runner or the Terminator (which are very similar) are actually better than their original counterparts, and in my opinion, there's no right or wrong answer.   The difference between the two films is that there's a definite lack of substance, but a tremendous amount of creativity and originality, which you can almost feel when watching the first movie.  However, if you're looking for a real meaty film, then the first Blade Runner is probably the way to go.  The sequel was supposed to be released on VHS, and it has since been released on DVD.  If you can find it, I highly recommend it.  There's a scene in the sequel where Rutger Hauer plays a detective and he's playing a very different role than he did in the first film.  I'm not sure if it's a deliberate attempt to distance him from the original film, but it does bring out an entirely different style of his character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       The "The Last Samurai"   I don't have any issues with this movie, I mean it is a well made film that follows the script pretty well. What is a little weird is the main cast that are there, even though the main characters have a lot of screen time. All the characters have their own story but in the end, most of it is about the characters that are playing the samurai. The one that I thought was the weakest was the samurai, in that he is not the best leader in this movie and he is more of a hindrance than anything else. This guy just doesn't have the drive to do something big for his village. One other thing that really annoys me is the plot of the movie. There are a lot more plots to this movie than most movies that just shows a group of people fighting in some jungle or something. There is so much going on in this film that it can't really be considered a story. I mean if there was a good story in this picture, then it would be worth the time to watch but there isn't a good plot to this. There were so many times where you were wondering why are the samurai getting killed and who is the enemy and who's side are they going to take, who's the real leader or something and they were just standing around talking. The Good:   The acting:  Katsuya Nakadai:    The best actor in this whole movie, he plays the lead character perfectly and it isn't really a surprise because he has been doing this for years. The acting is also great because he is believable in his character. The movie really makes you feel sorry for him when he is losing the battle and how he is getting hurt. This actor can really do some great acting and you can feel sorry if his character is going to die in the middle of a battle.       Lars Mikkelsen:  This actor has done a lot in this world and is now a big star in Europe. I guess his main job in this is to act and play the warrior who will die at the end. He plays it very well and it is hard to say whether he is acting with his real life or he is just playing the character. He does a really good job but like I said, he isn't the best lead actor in the world. The best thing about his performance is that he makes you forget all about the other actors
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - "You're gonna hate this. It's horrible and awful." - "It sucks. I can't believe this movie got made." - A reviewer for a website that has no connection to me "I saw this movie at the local theater and it sucked." - My review. If you haven't seen it, then you will never know.   What the critics didn't understand is that I was trying to show the audience what I believe a good horror film should be.  -   To get the most out of this review, you must know who I am.  I have a Ph.D. in anthropology from Indiana University.  To be perfectly honest, I didn't even know about the "Kong: Skull Island" movie before reading these review.  And what do you know, I liked it. It has its flaws, but the movie is really good.  The movie is based on a true story.  You see, in the early 1900s a man named Thad Wilson was sent to Africa to study a man who was believed to be a monster.  This story is a "Kaiju".  They are creatures that can be found in many places.  When Wilson arrived in Africa, he immediately encountered this creature.  He used his "science" to try and defeat this creature in combat, but failed.  Once Wilson returned to the United States, he wrote a book about what happened.  At this point, I really can't wait to see the film.  It's a sequel to 2014's "Godzilla," so the plot and setting is very similar.  Godzilla has an army of monsters who seek to destroy the human race.  In "Godzilla" Godzilla destroyed Tokyo and turned Japan into a radioactive wasteland.  However, at the end of "GodZilla," Japan rebuilt itself and lived in peace.  If you are into giant monsters, this is a great movie to watch.  But if you want to see some good, believable horror, then I would recommend that you avoid it.  There is a scene in the movie that I just don't like.  They say this is the "bad guy's" "secret lair" where he stores his men, but what does this even mean?  It was just a huge hole.  Of course, the movie was very scary.  Some people are just frightened by the idea of giant monsters.  So if you are not,

I have seen some pretty bad movies in my life (like "The Room"), and I have always been more than prepared for this film to be terrible. It was worse than I had anticipated.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie had an overabundance of negative reviews about it in various review sites. One of them said, "    The movie has one of the most uninteresting villains ever to appear in a horror movie. He was very generic and the actress's voice didn't do much for the character either.   "   (From FilmFan.com review of The Strain: Season One )   There were so many negative reviews in general and one from FilmFan made it pretty clear that the majority of people didn't like the film.  When someone has the audacity to rate a movie this low, they need to be a hell of a lot more intelligent than just posting a link to their Facebook wall.  5     The movie didn't even feature any of the original cast members.  The first movie had a couple of cast members in it, but that was it.  They didn't return for the sequel.  They had no idea how to play their characters.  There was a pretty good reason why.  Because there were already other movies written for the cast.  One of those actors had a very bad reputation for having a bad acting ability, but this was all covered up in this movie.  He was a nice enough guy with a really nice accent, but he couldn't play a character.  All of the acting was done by people who weren't in the original movies.  Not only that, but they had to re-shoot a lot of scenes because of the bad chemistry.  It took them a good 3 months to do just that.  You can't go and tell people you're re-releasing a film with a cast that isn't in it.    3   I will never forget the last scene of the movie.   What made the final scene so great was the last shot of the whole movie, which showed the entire city of New York as a massive black hole.  This was the final shot in the movie, and it really summed up everything that was wrong with the entire movie.    It also made sense in retrospect because that was one of the major themes of the film, which was what happened when the infected went into cities.  If you don't know that now, you will after you read this post.   I was literally the only person in the theater who really understood what was happening, and that was because I'm an idiot.  I don
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    And if that doesn't work for you:     1. The Muppet Movie It's pretty good. It's kind of like the first and only Muppet movie. And it's a great first movie to make fun of. I'd say it was pretty much like a Muppet film. It has a kind of innocence and fun, but it's pretty much made up of two scenes that will always be remembered. I'll say the most obvious one is the sequence in the bar, when they're playing "Who's on First?" and everyone's trying to find their place and they find themselves in a really weird little town where they all dress in silly costumes and they all go to a giant bar that's got an actual dance floor. And they're there singing and dancing and singing and singing. Then, there's another one, but this one is kind of funny too. This one is when they get to the dance floor and there's this really cute little thing that they're trying to impress: a little guy with a huge wacky eye. And when it's this cute little guy, it's kind like that goofy little cartoonish guy and when they start dancing with him it's really cute, but there's a really good reason for it and it's not just because it looks funny. So it's funny because it's the whole point of that sequence. The point of "Who?" was that it's silly, it looks silly, but we should all want to be like that. So that's really what's going on. So this sequence kind of has a sort of silly, childish kind of message, which we didn't get in the original Muppet.  2. A Clockwork Orange But I think, also, the film is quite strong. I'm going to take a strong example, but when the film came out, I don't know how it did, but I think it did very well at the box office. There were some people who were disappointed. But then I watched the film at home after I had gotten it and the thing that was kind of the most striking thing was the fact that all the characters in that film are kind of this bit part. They're like little extras and the movie is really about the main character, Alex (the main character played by Anthony Burgess) but he's a real person and his life is very interesting and it gives you a lot to think about. And there's also a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is so bad that it cannot even get the basics right in the plot. A woman is raped by a demon that she cannot find the courage to go after. The demon has been haunting her since she was a child, and has now come back to take over her body so she can destroy it for good. Her only hope of saving her life is a demon prince, a kind demon who believes in good, but wants only to kill people, and wants to do it without hesitation. So when a powerful demon prince (played by Jeff Daniels) appears before her, the only thing that is on her mind is finding her prince. The whole thing has a sort of creepy air to it. I won't give too much away because it is a plot that is just so bad it is funny. The scene in the temple is absolutely ridiculous and the whole movie is a farce. The ending, where the hero can save the girl from the demon, is an outright joke. And then there is the fact that there is a lot of sex in the movie, even though the movie is rated R. A lot of this sex is done by Jeffery Daniels (who is a porn star, but is never the star of the movie.) There are a few scenes in this movie where the actress is naked in her own body, and you get the impression that the actress does not like this part of her body much. And there are a couple of scenes where the actors are naked in front of the camera. Some of the most memorable scenes in the film are the ones where the actresses are nude or semi-nude and are not the star. I found the acting very uneven at best. The special effects in this film are really bad. You will often see the camera move back and forth with no rhyme or reason. The movie also shows a lot more breasts than you would normally see on TV. In one scene, there is some nudity on a woman's chest and then she shows off some more breast at another scene. I don't know what the intent was, but it just does not work. The soundtrack is also very bad. A few tracks from the soundtrack were okay, but overall it was very bad music. Overall, the movie looks like it was filmed in the 80's with CGI. Overall Rating: C-
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      4.5 out of 5 stars   The film's story has the potential to be really interesting. It has some great moments and is well-acted. Unfortunately, it ends in a horrible way. As the character's story begins, it's really cool to see him evolve and grow. It's great that he has the courage to tell his story. He's a true man and a great example of what it means to be a man. It really is amazing to see a character you love in such a dark place. After seeing a few more scenes, I was wondering how the story would continue. The film seems to show us a whole story about his character. His character develops and his growth is exciting. We also learn a lot about the characters around him and see how things are set up to be played out. This movie is a perfect example of how a great story can be told. It could have been a great film, but for whatever reason, it did not have the depth that it needed. The story needs a lot of work.   There is also a good story to be told in the second movie. It is a movie about two young women and their relationships. They have problems and struggles, but they also love each other very much. It brings them together and we see how they cope with their differences. These two movies have something in common and that is a desire to be happy. The second movie is really strong and could have easily been a five-star film. This film has a lot going for it. We really enjoy the characters and we love the acting. The screenplay by Robert Rodriguez is very interesting. However, I do have to say that he needs to do a better job of writing characters. The two girls are not really developed very well. They are two teenagers and that's all we are going to get. They aren't really explored that much, and I just hope we get to see them again. They might not be in the future, but it would be great to see these two develop. As a movie with a great plot and a good acting cast, I would definitely recommend it. However if you are looking for a movie where we actually see a story that is going to have an interesting outcome, this is not the movie for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's true that a lot of movies do a bad job of capturing what a truly great movie is about. But if you look at the great movies of all time (Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones, etc.), the ones that really take you by the throat and make you feel like you've never been as close to pure awesomeness as you are in that one movie are the ones with the most memorable characters and the most epic action sequences. A good movie is the one that makes you remember how great it all was, and a bad one is the movie you can't forget. For some, that's the end of the movie and you can finally sleep on it, but for me, I can't really let go because I can never shake that feeling that I should've seen this movie at the start.  The beginning (and maybe some of the ending) was good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm watching a movie with a good cast and a good story, but it doesn't work as well as the director wanted it to.   The script is boring.  The acting is really bad.  Some scenes are better than others.  I'm bored by the whole thing.  But if I had watched this movie in high school, I would have loved it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The first thing that hits you is the film is pretty bad. But the problem is the main character and the lead actress in the film. You really can't take a look at them together without saying "hmmm, she's got some issues". And even if they are trying to make the viewer believe that they are friends, the film doesn't tell you anything. You are given so many scenes where we know exactly who the guy is and what he is trying to do, but when you actually get to know him, his personality and his inner struggles, you are really disappointed. And then you see a guy trying so hard, you know that he is doing his best, but he doesn't have what it takes. And if you have any problems with that, just don't go see the movie.  This review might be a bit harsh on the film, but that's just me. I don't think it's a good movie, but I can't say that it is an utterly terrible film. It's a lot better than a lot of the other horror films I've seen. But as a horror film, I really can not recommend it. You will get what you pay for in this film. : 10/10 : The first thing you think is that this is going to be a very good film. After all, it's the first feature film in this franchise. The fact that it seems like a decent movie, makes you think that there are things that are being done right. But that's all it is. It does what it is supposed to do and doesn't do anything wrong. The only negative thing is that it doesn't really tell you much about this guy. He's just there, and his actions are more or less the same. I would like to see the guy get more development. As a film, it has some good moments, but for me, it could have used more time. The film was written by Mark Zuckert, who I believe has a lot more to contribute to the horror genre. There are also some really good set pieces that you will definitely see more of in future films. I give this film a 9/10. It is not perfect, but it's still a very solid film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you're going to write a negative  review about any film, make sure it's a real review about the film as a whole. If you are not in an informed position about a film or even if you are knowledgeable, do not write a " review."  I hope this helps and hope this doesn't get in the way of my movie reviewing:  I've got a few great movies on the way  with several of the ones I've been itching to watch coming out this year. This will be my first attempt at a film review.  I will be reviewing all of the "star-studded" films I can get my hands on.  It's all about quality, right? I'm sure this will turn into a rant about a few things but I think you guys can find some of the issues in my movie reviews. I've never been a "bad" movie reviewer. I'm just looking to be informed.  My thoughts:  I've heard a lot of great things about this movie and I think the hype surrounding it will be warranted.    In a way this movie is a mix of some of my favorite movies of the last few years including " The Hurt Locker " and " The Dark Knight."    I think it will work because I haven't seen many movies this year that have me excited.   The script seems to be a good one:      This is a very well done script.   I really enjoyed the movie from the start and it didn't feel like anything was taking it over the top.  I think they could have done a better job of incorporating the characters and making me feel what they felt.  This movie had some good action scenes and a little humor to it that I enjoyed.    I loved the music and the actors were all very good.         The movie looks to be one of the best action movies of this year and I can see a lot more of these movies on my radar.    I can see myself buying this movie on DVD this summer and giving it a second watch after I finish the others on my list. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's funny when a film like this does nothing for me and I'm left feeling disappointed. I think what bothers me more is the plot of the film.   I found it pretty generic and the ending didn't make much sense and left me feeling unsatisfied.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie like 'Leprechaun' can't be helped by the fact that the producer wanted the producers to make it as cheesy as possible.  It's the story of a Leprechuanian, a person that has the ability to summon demons or other bad guys.  When the Leprechois are in a bad mood, they can transform into a Leprekon and go in any mood they want.  They do this when they get tired of things going wrong or when the Leprekion wants to do something and someone else prevents it.  What a pity that they did this because if it was a bit more interesting then this could have been a movie I liked.  The story is not bad but when the story is told it has a boring feeling.   The Leprekan's have many different colors when they transform.  One of the Lepkon's is a pink Lepreken.  The movie follows two brothers who go to find the Lepchauri.  One brother is a great cook and the other brother is the one with the power to summon the Lepronki.  This movie is so lame that you should not even watch it. Leprekon.  Leprekong.  Not only is the Lepkenan stupid but also stupid to the point that I find myself laughing whenever it appears.  I hope no one will ever make this movie, they just waste everyone's time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The main character (played by Will Arnett) has an odd habit of making the wrong choices. I say "in the wrong places," but in reality, he's just making a few wrong choices with a variety of items. (My friends, that's why we watched the movie. ) The biggest error he makes is choosing his friends. A lot. The main bad guy, the leader of the gang, is a huge asshole. This is true to the comic book version. In the movie, though, he has a soft spot for a girl (played, of course, by Amy Poehler). She is his only friend, but he's not really into her. The movie is about his desire to get some girl into his life, and he tries to manipulate her into going with him. In this case, he also manipulates her into giving him something that he needs, which is not a good idea. It gets even worse, though. He forces her to do all his dirty work, including getting him drunk, by threatening to hurt the girl's parents. After he has the girl into bed, the bad guy says to her: "If you don't do what I tell you, I'm going to make sure you go to jail and the girl you love will never see her parents again. You will never have her. But you will always have this." A great way to lose a woman. The next day, he turns his attention to her parents. He threatens to break the kids' legs with a skateboard (which is very easy in the comic books) and then gives them a choice. Either they break one leg for the man or they break two legs for the woman, and if they don't break both, she'll leave him, but they will be the ones who'll have to live with the pain of not being able to skateboard. The kids' mom says that they're too small for that, and she'd rather take the punishment if she has to. She is right. There are lots of scenes that show the same thing: an easy way to break a kid's leg. This kind of thing is in the comics, too, but, as a result, this happens far less often. The other thing to be wary of: the girl will never let the bad guys in. (The good guys are very good at sneaking around, though.) This might not matter if it wasn't for a scene near the end in which Will Arn

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a terrible movie. The cinematography, the acting, the story, the sound track, the music: everything is terrible. Why do so many horror movies suck so badly? They either have terrible acting or a crappy story or they just sound stupid and stupid. This movie has both of those problems and the fact that the film was made in 1999 and was meant for kids is not helping. The plot doesn't make any sense, it's made of random plot points that don't add up and the characters are so annoying that you can't bear to look at them for more than a few seconds and then move on. The pacing of the movie is terrible, it goes from terrible to hilarious in one scene and then back to terrible in the next. The film is full of clichés and it just doesn't work. You have some good actors, but in the end, they don't work because of the terrible writing. If you're looking for a "good" movie about a girl who falls in love with a monster, don't even bother. If this is the best that you're going to get, then you're not getting it. It's just not worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's only $15 (and a half!), so it's a good value. - June 1, 2017Just a cheap little horror film.  Reviewer: gillan - favorite favorite favorite - May 31, 2017  Subject: Good idea but not very good - May 28, 2017Good idea but  Poorly executed - May 29, 2017Poorly  Rating:   What is so great about this film? I guess it's that it was so cheap, they made it for $1 at the local movie theater and there was an old guy who thought it would be a good idea to rent a movie from the theater that was showing it. What was his name? That's right, they spelled his name right. That movie wasn't very good. The movie is called "Dinah", and the guy who rented it to the guy was "Dion". He says he has "lost his mind", and that he has a "sick mind" (which isn't a phrase I'd associate with him) and he does things to his wife "because it feels good". What a horrible character. The film starts off with an old man who was "on his way to the movies" and then gets "lost" in the woods. I don't remember who this old man was or why he lost his way, but whatever. The guy finds himself in a house where his wife is having some trouble with their young son. The young son's father is trying to help him out, but he can't understand why his son will never be good enough for his wife. This movie was so bad I have to wonder if the guy even had any idea how to act in his scene with his wife or if he just threw a bunch of words together in his head. The rest of the movie was just the same thing - a couple getting into trouble and trying to hide their problems. The whole movie is just this guy just having trouble finding a way to make his life better. And he tries to do it by doing whatever he can to try to fix his problems with his kid. I just hope this guy isn't real. The other characters seem a little too "characters" to me. I think they just have no idea how bad this guy is. He's got a sick mind and he makes the most miserable characters I have ever seen in a movie. I wish someone would make a good movie about him or his situation. He just goes

I guess if you are into the "festival" type movies, or you just want a little more "fun" in your life, then go ahead and give this a try. If you have kids or if you simply love movies, I highly recommend this one, I certainly was.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Posted by bvsmike on Tuesday, May 23, 2015 I would give it 0 stars... I feel that they should have left this off the film and made a more appropriate one. The characters were dull and were completely over the top in the movie. The acting was just plain bad.  This was just another example of a movie that was made to grab an audience of kids who were trying to see something that they could not see.  So sad, I love the original   And now to see this is just sad. It would make you think twice if you're trying to watch a movie to get younger and have less to worry about. I'm thinking again about my dad and all the reasons he never wanted to get too old to watch films again, and he was the type that could not enjoy a movie for fear of being "caught".   I mean, how bad could this be?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Candy, a former teen starlet turned heroin addict, is now in a self-destructive, self-medicating spiral of self-loathing, self deprecation and self-doubt.   It is, in fact, so bad it is good. This, after all, is the last movie about a movie star that's as good as any movie about the industry. As you may have guessed from the title, this is the worst movie about Hollywood since "Hollywood Shuffle." That was an absolute joke. That was, in my opinion, the worst comedy of all time. That, if there ever was a movie about an industry, it was "Hollyoaks." This is "Halloween."   In the movie Candy and her friends (Michael Fassbender, Michael Parks, and Rachel McAdams) go to a movie and take their clothes off. They find a hot guy and they have sex. The movie ends with Candy saying, "It was all so real," before getting a heroin injection and losing her virginity. I don't know.  So I guess the title of the film was "How bad could it get?" And it gets really bad.  In fact, this movie is so bad, I've heard people say the title was an understatement.  The acting is so poor that you'd think the filmmakers were making a satire of the porn industry. This isn't parody. This is exploitation. This movie is about nothing other than a guy who has no morals, who tries to have sex with as many women as possible, who is not as much of a man as he thinks he is, and who doesn't seem to care that he's doing this to women. The sex scenes are so bad they almost don't seem real. They're really poorly acted, too. Even the girls are acting like a bunch of girls who've never actually had sex.  There's this moment when a girl is getting shot by a dude in the shower with some kind of gun, but she doesn't even think to turn off the shower.  No one else does. The gun just shoots off a lot of water.  It's almost as if the filmmakers didn't bother filming the sex because they were trying to shoot something else.  Candy and the gang are also living in a house in which they have a pool, but no towels.  When the girls decide to make out with the guys and make out
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It really isn't my fault I enjoyed this movie, and I can't say why. My expectations for this film were very low.   I was a bit disappointed with a couple of scenes, I can imagine why it had been chosen for the DVD, and for a low budget movie, I would have expected more.  The only bad scene that bothered me was the "I'm not in love with him, I'm in love, I need him", I thought it was a pretty good scene, but it's in the middle of the movie, it was just rushed in, not what I expected.    It was all so over the top, and really unrealistic.  Some people like this sort of thing.  I don't.  There were a lot of weird things, and you never really felt like you could trust him, no one trusts him, and that made me mad. I don' t know why they put this in the film.  It made me want to throw up.  Overall, not a bad film, but not worth the price. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are probably hundreds of bad movies out there, but even if you've seen the vast majority of them, you will still be surprised by just how many have one or two redeeming features.  Even some of the more iconic titles.   In recent years, the movie industry has gone a little mad, producing so much crap that it's hard to keep track of all the terrible films out there.    I'm sure there are hundreds of titles I'm missing here, and some of them have a good chance of making the list one day.  Even though a lot of people try to make a living from "bad movies" in some manner, it still takes a lot to screw up the entire film industry like that, and it's a wonder any movie is able to get made at all in the first place.  The movies that come to mind right away are The Lost World: Jurassic Park, Gremlins, and I'm guessing some of those old science fiction movies where the aliens try to invade Earth through a wormhole, just because they've all been doing it since the 80's.  Even the first ones were trash, as they all have this creepy effect.  Unfortunately, these days the production costs of most crappy films are so much higher that there are just too many of them out there to turn a profit, so it doesn't even seem possible for these films to get released anymore.  However, I would say that even these terrible films have something worth checking out, because they're still entertaining as hell.  I'm always excited to watch the first film of a new "Star Wars" movie or a film like Armageddon or Gremmels, but they're usually just a bit too short, and they have a bad writing, bad characters, and a bad plot.  Of the more recent "Star Trek" series, I've always been really fond of the series, and so I'm especially excited to see the latest movie, and also that new movie with Will Smith!  But even if I think a lot about my dislike for these new films, I'm still pretty excited to check them out!  The good thing about these bad movies is that you can still pick up a copy and enjoy them if you really want to.  Most of them are only a little over 100 dollars each, and can be found on video and DVD, or even rent if you're willing to pay.  If you're looking for a

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "That's a lot of blood, isn't it?" "Well, no, I mean... It's a very... I mean it's... I don't think it's right. This one... it's like a... No, it's not right. But I don`t know why, but... I just don`T like the way they shot it. So, I think I will have to see it again to be sure." "Yes, you will!" "I think you'll find it's actually a very good movie, but I can`t say that about it. It`s too bloody, and it's too... Too... I`ve always thought it would have been better if it had been shot in black and white." "You don` t see it like that! It's bloody and it`s bloody well made." "I agree with you, but it's bloody hard to watch! And too many of the actors are so bloody thin that they hardly seem to be actors."  If you are going to write something negative about a movie, do so in a good way. If you are not going to do so, it may be a bad idea to even consider writing anything negative at all.  A few notes on writing about film:  When a movie is bad, the movie's not bad. This is as important as saying that the movie is good. Even if it is terrible, it is still better than it could have been. If it would be better to not have seen a movie in the first place, then that is the way it is. When it is good, the bad parts can also be better than the good parts. The movie is not a complete work of art, it does not necessarily have to be very good to be enjoyable. If the movie has been badly edited, you can probably enjoy the good and the bad together, even if it does feel a bit bad in parts. If a movie has a good script, and a bad film with bad effects, you probably want the effects to be better. If your favorite actor is in a movie and the movie looks bad, then you may want him to be in a much better movie.  the bad scenes. When you criticize a movie for being bad, don't give it a negative score because of them. The point is that it is bad. You don't criticize it for having good scenes, or a good score, because they
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    1.   2.  What a movie! I love movies from the 50's and 60's. I remember watching them when I was a little kid. When I was 12 I went to see one called "The Last Man on Earth". I really enjoyed it. And the movie is really good. The movie starts out really slow. When the movie starts we are just getting to know the characters. The first thing you see is a young boy, he is in the hospital and he is about to die. He is being kept alive by a team of doctors. The main character is a scientist. He has made a little android, his wife and kids are also in the house. In the hospital the main character talks to the young boy. He talks to him about the universe, and the fact that people are living. He gives the boy a doll that he made, the boy makes it for his father and the doll is the man's last gift to his wife. Later he tells his son how he loves him. The next day he comes back to the hospital, and after a couple of hours he sees that the boy is now in the living room with his father. He tries to talk to the man, but the man does not respond. When he goes to check on the boy, the man is dead. The doctor has left the house, and now there is nobody in the home. It is the mother who leaves. She goes out to get her car, and when she gets there she finds a body in the street. It turns out that the man she has just left in the car with is the android boy's father. The son and his mother go to the police and they find out that there are a couple more bodies, and then they discover that it is a cult. They think that the android was programmed to kill, because the man had made him promise to make the boy's life better, and instead it turned out that he killed him. There was a guy who was trying to create life on this planet, but he had programmed an android to kill a boy, and that boy was his only son. And now that his son is dead, he tries to get a copy of him so that he can live forever. And he does this by cloning and killing all of the people that he cloned. And when the police realize what is going on, they go to this cult, they find that all the members of the cult have been killed

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main reason that my opinion of this movie changed is because I saw it for the first time on the big screen. This movie just plain sucks, and if you want to see a good flick with a good plot, you can't go wrong with this one. The story follows a group of guys who are trying to run for mayor in a small town in Ohio. The whole movie takes place in a diner with the three guys who want to be mayor. The movie is actually about the guys trying to make a good impression on the townspeople and become mayor. It is an interesting premise for a movie because it is interesting to see the guys who actually want to have a good chance at the election trying to do it. The problem is that there are no real stakes in the movie, the guys are just trying to be the new mayor to help the town. The town seems to have other plans. There is some drama about a little old woman (a little bit like the old folks in the neighborhood on Seinfeld) who has been living in the town all her life. She is kind of an annoying old woman who never speaks, but her husband, who is the mayor, has always loved her very much. The guys are also trying to woo the old woman's daughter, but they don't seem to be doing much better. This is another film where the characters just aren't that interesting. There are a few jokes that are funny at times, but not nearly as funny as the last movie. The story is good and I just enjoyed it, but there is no real plot here and the movie does not have any tension. Overall, the movie is a good film, but it just isn't that good. I just felt like it wasn't interesting enough. The plot is good, but you won't care about any of the characters. This may work well in a low budget, independent movie, but that isn't what this film was intended for. The acting is good though. It was a small movie, so I would have liked to see some better acting in the big picture. Overall, if you are a fan of the Seinfeld TV show, then you will probably enjoy this movie. If you want a quick laugh, then there are some laughs in this movie, even though it really isn't good. If there was some tension in the story and the characters, then it would have been better. I think this is a great movie for Seinfeld fans
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember I didn't want to watch this movie in the theater, I didnít want to see it after all that hype, and I didn´t want it to be a bad experience. What can I say? The story is really not good at all, and this movie has some really stupid scenes and characters that I donít even know what they stand for, and it just ends up bad and overlong. I will admit that there are some good scenes and one or two great scenes in this movie, and thatís just it. The script by Christopher Lee is okay, but the actor playing the main character is pretty bad. The story itself is good, but it really sucks to have to spend 80 minutes watching a big stupid looking movie, but thatís what this movie is: a huge, boring, slow and repetitive movie. I don't know why Christopher Lee was so angry at everyone else to give a crappy performance in this, but no, he just wasnít good at acting. The actors in this are actually good for the role, but they were too young for the part. If the script was different and less overbearing then it would have been a better movie, it would be a more entertaining film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen all of the "bad" movies. From "Superman" to "Buster's Brain" I have yet to see a movie that wasn't terrible. For me, "The Crow" is one of the most enjoyable movies of the decade. It is like if the first half of the film from the last couple of years had never been made. The first half takes place after the funeral scene from the end of "Pulp Fiction", and the second half of "Crow" goes from a good guy gone bad to a bad guy gone good. One of my favorite things about this film is that it has a great cast, and they bring a real sense of urgency to the movie. While the film isn't as violent as the original "Pulp Fiction" or even the "Twin Peaks" series, it is still pretty damn intense. One thing that really sets this film apart from the rest of the films that are in the "New Hollywood" is that we actually see the Crow killing his girlfriend and father, and it is done in a really cool way. I think it is one reason this movie can go from being pretty good to really bad so quickly. Overall, this movie is worth watching if you haven't seen "Porphyria" or "Hannibal Rising". "The Hateful Eight" is another movie that is worthy of a watch. It features two of the best actors of the late 90s in John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. "The Great Escape" is about a group of escape artists who are trying to break out of a POW camp in a freezing cold Canadian wilderness. I know I just said it wasn't as good as the films from the early 90s, but it still manages to be entertaining and have some great action scenes. The movie isn't an "action film", but that doesn't make it bad. It's still pretty good. The only bad thing about "The Big Lebowski" is how easy it is to fall in love with the characters, and to get swept up in the characters. "American Psycho" is a very good movie that has many of the same themes as "The Silence of the Lambs". It also has many scenes that are pretty good, so there's that.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   " A.J. Abrams is an interesting dude.    He may not be the best director, but he's definitely one of the best.  I love his Star Trek movie.  He doesn't need to make a'serious' film, he could just have fun. I was worried about a little kid in Star Trek, but they made it a little more funny.  Maybe they needed to find a way to make it funnier?  Maybe the first half was just a lot of exposition to get to the next thing...but it is what it is.  The actors are good, they don't feel like they're being forced in, which is good because they need to act and that takes a lot.  It's not that the actors don't know what to do, they just don't. They know where to act, but it's awkward.  This is a good film that has a great story, a great concept, and great cast.  "
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You must also be ready to do a long article explaining how it all goes down in the end.   (And I'm talking here about the end of the movie. I know many people read this, but I want it to happen in a film, not just a movie).   The movie is a mess and the whole movie has become so much messier. The movie tries to do it's best to be interesting but it fails to do so.  If you want a movie that is very interesting then you should give this movie a miss.  There are so many plot holes and so many weird things.  This movie doesn't make sense at all. I don't know how someone could have spent so much time on this and not figure out that something is not quite right with it.  (The movie even goes into the details of how to make a copy of a DVD, it just doesn't seem to matter in the movie). This movie just doesn the viewer into a mess.  For a movie about a DVD that has a copy made of it (and there is nothing wrong with that except that the copy does not work), the movie spends too much time explaining how to copy the DVD to the user.  The DVD has a DVD copy maker that can make it work (but not a copy machine to make copies).  So why does the copy not work and why do the people who made copies lose their DVD in the process.  To be honest I was really confused when I saw this movie.  But I just had to watch it to find out what was going on.  I can't believe I've had to see this movie so many times.  It seems like I saw it on TV and I just never saw it. How many people have had to endure seeing this movie countless times? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most amazing thing was how my friends and I tried to ignore that a person could be on their hands and knees, and I saw this movie and was just amazed that I can watch this and just be amazed.    I love how this movie shows that if you want to have your soul and your mind and your body and your soul together, you have to get out of that system that you're stuck in and live in a new life.  The only thing we had to do was just sit there and watch, the one thing that I thought they were hiding was the amazing music in there, and how they made us do a dance to that music.  There is a bit of a "whoa! this movie is crazy!"  I know that it doesn't happen very often, but this is pretty amazing to see.  I'm pretty sure that we had a lot of fun watching this movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My Rating:   4/5 stars The only film I've seen that I have to give it a 3.5. I had no idea it had such a story. What I do remember is that it had a good cast, and I don't think that the script had anything more to it than a good character, or a good plot. It's very easy to watch, and although I had to watch it a few times to see what happened, I was able to get the point.  A very different take on the concept of an alcoholic who is a good man. It is difficult to watch without getting a kick out of the acting, especially the voice over by Robert Loggia. I enjoyed the look and feel of this movie. It wasn't too dark and the lighting and color was great. It did get a bit slow towards the end, and the ending seemed a little rushed, but overall I enjoyed it very much.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      "This movie is terrible. It's also not funny."    "We have been living in this universe for a few thousand years. They have had all kinds of problems to solve, and these guys are just out to show off. It makes you think of something that you don't think about, that you have never thought about, but you must."  ""Oh, you mean you're an alien?""   "I mean, we're humans, right? So why did you turn away from us?" "Yeah, but why are you doing this to us?"   ""We're aliens.""   What does this have to do with aliens?   (I guess aliens don't exist in the universe.)   I'd rather just watch a bad Star Trek movie. (No offense to you.)   You'll also hear the phrase "It's not my fault" a lot, and it's an amazing thing when you hear that phrase repeated so many times. It tells you that everyone was going along with it just as it was. Nobody said "It sucks." Nobody said, "They're the worst." Nobody was willing to step up and say, "Yeah it is" but nobody else was willing. So when you read this, if you are the one doing the saying it's not your fault, then you really have no one to blame but yourself.   It also tells you a lot about the world in which we live, a world in the twilight of technology and the knowledge of how it's really done and how it really should be done. It shows us that when people don't understand something, they get angry. When we say, it's no one's fault, it really isn't.   to add: I have no idea why they went out of their way to do a black movie in the 80s with a cast of white actors and the soundtrack was by a woman with a big African accent.  ...more notes Notes are private! recommender none votes 3 # times read 1 owned purchase location condition format Paperback actions view (with text)  checkbox position cover title The Martian author Kim Stanley Robinson author of The Scavengers & The Children's Crusade isbn isbn13 asin num pages 278 pp avg rating 3.73 num ratings 18 Lukasz's rating liked it my rating 1 of 5 stars2 of 5 star3 of 5 Star2 of 4 star

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    And I have the feeling that's going to be my reaction too when the movie comes out this summer, I'm not going to go into it too deeply, as my first experience with this movie was watching it in the theatre, and when I got home it was the first time I had heard about this movie.   I heard about it, because I was on the internet a week before this movie went into production, and I had seen the film trailer and I thought it was a pretty interesting movie. I went to see the film, and it was just an awful experience, I can't imagine any kind of good thing coming from it.  It's just a terrible movie.   It was an insult to the entire genre of the film that it was even made.    And the worst part is that I'm going to see it for the first and only time this summer when it opens at the Alamo Drafthouse. ____________________________ I don't even know what to say about this one.  I'm so incredibly disappointed with this film.  The trailer just didn't do it for me, I mean come on it's only a movie so that's all it needs to do.    I didn't know what it was like in this world, and so I couldn't imagine how this movie would be received by this world.  And that's exactly what happened.   In the cinema it was so good, you could see the world and feel like it was real.  But once the movie got on TV and the trailer came out I had a lot of trouble with it, I just couldn't get into it.   I'm never going to watch another movie in this genre, ever.  Why I love this movie: It has a lot going on, it's got this very dark tone and it gives the viewer a lot to think about, the film is a story about a young girl that's left in the forest to die, and this is where she meets her new friends who have the same dreams as her.  This movie gives a lot more insight into our own dreams and how our minds interact with things that aren't real, it really shows the power of our imagination, I really really enjoyed it, it felt like this was a movie that should have been made years ago, and even years before, and yet it seems like a movie I would have never gotten to see because it didn't get made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you like a bad film, write a negative, negative review. This is the only way to get people to like it.      For all you bloggers that write negative reviews about a movie: I have a few suggestions for you.  First of all, try your best.  The only way it will stick out in the minds of those that see it, is if you write it very well. I am sure you all know how to do this, but I had to tell you. Nowadays there are so many of you bloggers out there, that writing a bad review of a movie can be pretty difficult.  If you don't think so, here are a few pointers:  First of is that you have to write the review in a way that is not like the normal, everyday, blog style.  One of the things I like about this blog is that it is very different in style to other blogs.  This is because the reviews you write are about films that you, personally, have not seen.  You are the people who live vicariously through the film.  So if you're going to write about a film, you have a real responsibility to do it right.  As you know by now, a good review will show your opinion on what the film is about.  What is important is that the review is written properly, and not so you can get to the point with a short review of the film that just says "wow" and then goes on to talk about a bunch of other things you donít like about it. That would never work.  There are a couple of ways you can write a bad, bad review.  First, you can say a bunch more stuff about the film than the review should be about. You can ramble and go on about how the film sucks. You could talk about the director and his personality.  To avoid that, you need to write in a straight forward way, that will convey what the review really is about and why you have bad things to say.  Now this can be done without having the film's name in the review. You still can, but you need the filmís name in it. It is okay to talk a lot about how terrible the movie is. But that is really not very good, and I am going to point out some good reasons to do that.  In order for the review to be good, you really have
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't really like this film.   The story is terrible and the characters are so uninteresting.  The plot is a lot of over the top gore.  This film is like some kind of twisted love letter to horror.  They are all trying to prove that horror is as creative as it can be.  One of the main characters is killed in the opening scene.  It is just a really bad film that has not aged well.  Posted by Jeff Clements at 11:37 AM

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The reason that this movie had me in stitches was not because of the quality of the movie. I found it interesting, but didn't like it. It was a comedy, so there were a lot of laughs, but it was a movie that had me with the laughter, and I didn't find it funny at all. I have had a few laughs here and there in other movies, but this one was so bad it was almost funny.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot of the movie is based on a true story but I couldnt tell what the story was based on because the movie was so bad that even though it was based in a true fact, there wasnt even any information on the internet to find out what the facts were. I really liked the cast of actors and they did a great job and I like how the whole movie was filmed in one day. The only thing that i could see was that some of the actors that were in the movie had the same name and their acting and it looked a little bit off. The cinematography of this movie was horrible, every scene was in black and white and everything was very blurry and dark. And the background music was very repetitive so it would just go on and on for the whole two hours. I like horror movies and i had a great time watching this movie. It was a good movie and it has a great cast of people in it and i would have liked it more if there was more info on the movie on the web.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    *sigh* Don't watch this movie. It's very bad. I don't want to say this because it sounds stupid. But... It's so bad. It doesn't look like it could be anything but a terrible movie. Like I said, the animation and the characters are very bad... But this movie takes the entire plot of The Lord of the Rings and turns it on its head. It actually has to work to get the worst part of the story right. I will admit to a little bit of sympathy for the evil wizard, but I just... Don't know how I'm supposed to feel. The acting is all kind of uninteresting. The villains are kind of... Dumb, but the heroes are even dumber. The voice actors are also not that good. The writing is just stupid. I mean, even the best movies can have terrible acting. And, yes, I'm still talking about The Lord Of The Rings. It was a big movie for this. And The Lord o f the Rings has a lot of terrible acting in it. For example, there is this scene where Bilbo and the dwarves are walking through some woods and they talk. They were talking about... What? What are they talking about? And they didn't even use a voice actor for Bilbo, they just... Did a shot of Bilbo's head on a piece of paper. And it's just so bad, I actually almost laughed. I can't believe I just wrote this review. *sickened expression* So, I guess The Lord f isring is one of my all-time favorite movies. I think it's a great book. I also think that it's not the most imaginative movie ever made, but at the same time, it's so fun, and I loved it. So, if you are looking for a bad but fun movie, this is not it. But if you like fantasy films, don't look any further. And if you have any sort of high hopes for the upcoming Hobbit films, then don't go see this. Posted by Eric Schlosser at 1:45 PM

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        I just read the book by this author and I really enjoyed the story and the character development and I was impressed with the story line and the characters.   But   it  didn't mean   what I wanted it to mean  and it didn't mean that this book will be a good movie.    It   won't.  It  is   just   good  . I wish I had read this book 20 years ago before I got interested in acting so that I could have been a part of this story.  I  don't   feel     the need to be   funny  , or  funny and romantic , or  romantic and funny.  No, this book is just good and  entertaining  and I will read a book about an interracial couple. But this is not a good story. It's just so-so. I loved it. It had a good plot. The author's style of writing is quite good.  It was good. What happened was just so. All the characters were believable. It was a good book. I would recommend this book to any young African-American. I have been reading it and loving it. I will continue reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    * If you see the movie for the first time, you'll have a very hard time deciding whether to be offended by the film's sexual overtones or by the fact that it's a terrible movie. You'll also have a hard time figuring out whether you'll enjoy it or not. I can certainly tell that you'll be entertained by this film. The acting is good. The story is predictable and not very interesting. The cinematography is okay. There is a lot of nudity. And there are a number of scenes of the characters being abused, which, let's be honest, are the kind of scenes which really drive the film to one of its greatest successes.  The sexual over-tones are hard to ignore at times. It's a good film, but a lot can be said for the fact of its bad movie status. If you're looking for a good old-fashioned story of a man going through a personal crisis and then being transformed by the experience, then this movie will get you going. If, however, you're just looking for something to see on a Friday night, and you've got some free time to kill, then don't expect to have a lot to remember about it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a movie that I found interesting, but I couldn't stand the characters and the acting in it. I'd give this 2 stars, but the ending is really bad. This is one of those "movies" that you watch just to say you saw it.  #3:   The Godfather Part II (1981) A lot of people enjoy the first film, but some people feel the second film is even better. Both of these films had a very similar story.  This is a story about a crooked cop, who is being protected by his corrupt brother. In the second movie, the film gets a little more dark.  The film was very long, but a lot of the action is very exciting. #2:   The Godfather (1972) One of the greatest mafia films ever made. This film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It's a true story about two brothers that rise to power in New York City. The second film has the most impressive villains, which I really liked. The film also has some amazing dialogue, and some great special effects. This movie is well known for its controversial ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had a hard time with this movie. The opening scene was bad. But then, it just gets worse from there. I was hoping to see a different side of a man who is known for his "extreme sports". But, this movie was not that. The whole time I was watching this, I was wondering why I felt so out of place and why the movie felt like it was made on the cheap. The acting was terrible. It was like, the only people who actually felt human were the characters. In my opinion, this was a bad experience.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - A movie was shot and edited in 4 days and is a total joke   If the film was in color and did not use an over-budget camera and use an editing technique I hate like "cutting through the middle of a scene"   The film makes me sick.   My only point is that it is fun to laugh at it when I am sick or watching a funny movie but not when I love to watch a good one.  I am so glad that I watched this movie   It is my favorite horror movie of all time and my favorite film from 1986.  I love the movie and love the film that I love even more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     (And a movie with two scenes where the characters say, "I'm just gonna stand there and look at you for a few seconds!" is a perfect example of bad cinema).   My guess is that if people actually paid attention to what I wrote, they'd realize that I'm no expert on the genre, and it'd be clear that, when I said there was no good sci-fi movies of the 80s and 90s, I was kidding.   I have, of course, seen plenty of good sci fiction movies of that period.  I was a huge fan of Steven Spielberg's "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," and in the 90s I was really into the "Star Trek" movies (including "TOS").  There are probably more great films in that decade than any other.  That said, there was really only one "good" movie in the decade, and that was "E.T."  There's really nothing even remotely comparable in the 80's and 90's.  Most of the other sci- fi movies in the decades were just plain awful:  One of the most important factors in deciding which sci- fis to watch in this decade is what they contain.  If the film contains interesting ideas, then watch it.  But if it doesn't, don't.  Sci- fi is a genre that relies heavily on its visuals.  It is not an area that relies on interesting ideas.  The 80s didn't have the luxury of not being boring.  Films like "Raiders of the Lost Ark" or "Star Wars" are often criticized for being boring and unimaginative, but the problem with these movies is that they were supposed to be "action movies" - they have action sequences, but they don't have much of a plot to speak of.  There is usually a big twist at the end of the movie to get you into a new frame of mind.  These are just three examples of sci- sci-Fi in which the main plot is really just about the action.  "TOS" (The Original Series)  The other problem is that sci- science fiction is not a genre designed to be watched by people who are in love with the sci- art/ sci- ence.  This is why I think a lot of these sci- films are a lot more interesting to watch if you have a weak interest in sci- es. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My only point is this:  I have seen the movie many times. I am an adult and I am willing to admit that   The reason I did not like this movie is because it is too good to be true, and it is not a good film. This is one of the best, if not the best of the zombie movies, which I like very much.   It is a great film to watch at a Halloween party because of how spooky it is, and the zombies do seem to have real personalities, and this is what I like about this movie.  So I watched a few clips of the film and it was pretty entertaining.  I think it was very well done and a movie that should be seen by anyone and everyone. If you have seen some of the other zombie movies you know what I am talking about.  But it still was good enough to watch. I would definitely recommend this movie for a horror fan or anyone who likes to scare themselves.  There are no special effects or special effects that make it stand out from the rest, and that is what makes it great. I could watch this movie all day and never get tired of it. I think this is the first horror film that has a good story to tell, and there is no stupid zombie scene to ruin it for me. It is all very well written.  As always with a horror film the gore is good and realistic and not to the extreme of the movies from the early 90's.  In a good way.  The music is great in this one as well.  Some of the tracks will make you feel like you are in a dark alley at night, others will make me shiver and wonder where the music came from.  It was all good. I liked this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The biggest problem with my review of "Stray Dog Strut" is that I just don't like it.   I have been a fan of "Strangers" (the movie), so I was not that familiar with this movie.  This is the first movie where you really don't know what's going on.  I don't think it's very clear, but that's OK.  You're supposed to not know, so you don't.  It's a very short movie.   It takes a while for the movie to start.   The first third of the film is pretty good.  The second third of this film is the worst.  While I could see some potential for the film, I just didn't like the film.  At least there's not a lot of nudity.  "Stranger" had some nudity. I think I was disappointed because the nudity was so well done.  As mentioned before, there's some violence in this movie, but I don' t think it really adds anything.  Also, the ending of the movie was the same ending of " Strangers ".  But the film wasn't that bad.  For some reason, I'm not a huge fan of the ending.  Some people seemed to enjoy it. There is a part in this film where a man and a woman run across a field and he falls into the water.  Is that a foreshadowing of a character's death?  I thought that was the last we'd see of the characters in this story.   This story is told by a woman who has been divorced for a long time.   I'm still not sure why we're seeing this part of her story.  She's still a woman.  So what if she was a bad mother?   Why did she end up like this? She's still the same woman.   Is this the same story?   If so, why do we only see her in this part?   What's the reason?   This part of the story is not the whole story. Why is this part the only part we get to see?  There is something missing.   Was she killed in the previous part?  Is she going to meet her daughter again? I'm hoping for some answers. I've enjoyed this film, but this was one of the only parts that made me really feel sorry for this woman. The woman's daughter is also missing. A "Str

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Don't be a prude about it. You just don't want to make a bad film. But it's okay if it's really bad. I love bad movies.   I want a bad good movie.  When you're done with a bad bad movie, you can just go back to watching a good good movie again, because you've experienced so much in that movie, even if the bad parts are terrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm going to start a movie review on a bad review. I went to the movie "Tusk" today, and as I was watching the movie it became pretty clear that this was a movie that should have been released as a documentary. I have a ton of respect for documentaries, but this one didn't really offer a lot that I haven't heard before about the whacky behavior that John Belushi, Peter Boyle, and many others had at that time. In some ways, it's a little too much like "Rocky," but in other ways it really wasn't bad at all. I won't go into much detail on this, but you can read about it if you want. The movie itself was pretty interesting, but the real star was John Malkovich. Not because he was in it, but because he really is a funny and likeable person, and this movie doesn't really do anything to help your opinion of him. There were some other funny parts as well, and some of them were pretty good, but overall I found this movie to be really boring and predictable. In addition to John Malkovitch, there were others in it with a lot of personality and talent, but they just didn't make an impact. The movie was mostly about an all-male crew of hunters. The director is a big fish on the movie scene right now, and people always ask him how he did such a good job. He says he has this thing about telling stories and writing movies. When they decided to do "Tyranny," a movie about people who are on a quest for a mythical creature, they decided they would do a bunch of different people and situations. For example, there's an all male crew of men in Alaska searching for a bear that supposedly exists in the north woods. A female hunter, and a female lawyer go on a mission to get this bear, and in the process, some other people die. Another male hunter is also searching for the bear, but with an agenda to find it's mate, and his partner. He's on a journey with a woman named Jenny, a female cop and a lot more female characters that all die in the end. The ending of the movie makes you want to scream at the screen. There is no end to the deaths or injuries or anything, it just ends. The whole movie is just an attempt to make this bear seem like a very real creature. But it's just an evil bear
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the reasons the film is so bad is that it does not try. The film attempts to tell a story but fails to really create anything of the sort. It just tells a story about what a young girl sees on her holiday. The story is told without much effort and this has made it even worse because of the awful performances. The acting is not very good. The lead actress, Roddy McDowall has an awful voice that sounds like she is drunk. The other actors do not work very well either. One of them even sounds like he is stoned. The only reason that the actors are good is that the film was made in the late sixties and it does have an old school feel to it. This is not an enjoyable movie at all. In fact, you have to be in the mood for this kind of thing to get enjoyment from it. The plot has some of the hallmarks of a cheap film. There is a man who goes to a secluded cabin to kill the evil witch who has haunted the family for years. The girl he is to kill is his childhood friend. The movie is not all that bad and the actors do a decent job of conveying the mood of the story. The problem is that you just do not care about the story that much because it does nothing good. I feel this is the reason why people were disappointed by the film. In addition, there is a bad plot point at the end of the film where the good guys have to turn themselves in to the police. In the movie, the villains want the good guy's lives but they are willing to kill them. The bad guys are willing and able to kill anyone they think is guilty and they are not too subtle about it. There was no real logic to the good/evil switch. The action is not much better. It is not the best film of the day and it is not worth a view.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was a decent movie. There were a few scenes that were good. The movie was a comedy, and as a comedy it wasn't bad. The plot wasn't so good, and the movie was very long.   The plot is so stupid. This movie just made no sense at all. I have never seen a movie that is as unbelievable as this. I'm not a huge fan of sci-fi, and yet this movie was like watching a sci- fi movie from the 60s or 70s.  It's so hard to understand the characters at times. They are all so dumb. They don't even know what they're doing. And yet, they think they're so smart.  I would have watched this if it was a one hour comedy and a 20 minute drama.  The acting was bad too. I couldn't understand the people.  That's it.  This is a very silly movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (You may want to do this only with movies that you know you will like.   I didn't like this one, and I will not do it again.  This review is for the film, not for the movie.  You don't see a review for a movie when it's finished, right?  The plot is terrible.  The first few scenes do nothing to set the mood.  Then we get a few scenes of bad CGI, and we are hooked.  Even the ending was lame.  In the end, the film doesn't matter, because the film isn't even good.  There is an 80 minute movie out there which is worth watching, but this is a piece of junk.  So I give this movie 1 star.  If you don't like bad movies, watch it anyway.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a great movie and I recommend it to everyone.  The Movie Rating: 5/5 The film begins with a great score by a very talented and energetic movie conductor, but before that he sets the mood by playing the iconic melody from Stanley Kubrick's movie, "Dr. Strangelove," a song that is played on so many classic war films, including "Dr Strangelov's Monster" and "The Day The Earth Stood Still."  What follows is a long, dark and frightening adventure where the hero, who is played by "Dr" Strangelover, is pursued by the Russians.  This is another classic film where the characters are very well-drawn.   They are very interesting characters, and I think that Kubrick captured the emotion and intelligence of these characters in an authentic way.  The acting is excellent throughout the movie.  It is the movie that really made us love the James Bond series.  There are lots of great visual effects in the movie, and the special effects are just magnificent.  Some of the shots are breathtaking.  But most of all, this is a movie that we can all enjoy.  This movie is one that we need to see on a regular basis, so don't miss this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Review: This film is an interesting, albeit somewhat generic sci-fi adventure. The sci-fy story is presented in an entertaining way by a well cast and directed ensemble cast. The film features an interesting story and interesting and unique characters. The story begins with a group of aliens who kidnap a young boy named Jack, after kidnapping another boy in a spaceship in the distant future. The aliens are searching for an artifact, a machine that can destroy a galaxy. The young alien's name is Max and he is extremely angry about this and his father is a brilliant scientist who wants to find this artifact. He is joined by his wife, Alice, a beautiful and very intelligent alien woman, and their son. The movie has a great ending which features a very exciting finale that involves a very good action sequence. This movie will appeal to sci-fans and viewers looking for an interesting sci- fie adventure. Overall this film is definitely worth a watch.  ... more
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My favorite movie is 'The Usual Suspects'. The movie is good, but I always get the feeling that the author is either too scared of critics (and his readers) to write a decent review, or he doesn't really know what the movie is about. A scene at the restaurant reminds me of this very movie:     "You know the story about the little girl who saw the ghost in the window at night, and the little boy who killed the little man. So you have that story, right?"   This movie has everything to do with that.   There is a little girl (played by Laura Linney) who goes into the window to play with a ball that she got from the babysitter. While she is playing, a man in a bathrobe comes and sits by her. He looks at her, sees her naked, and starts to touch her. The next scene shows the little kid who killed his friend in a very similar manner.    I thought the movie was too short.  The scene where the man watches the girl and the young kid together in the dark was the most upsetting scene of the movie.  For me, a scene like that just makes me so very uncomfortable.     But I liked the little girls, the little boys, and all the other characters.  They did the right thing in some situations, they just did not get the right answer in others. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't really like how this was released as a home video, especially considering that it doesn't feel complete to me.   The story in this is really bad, but I guess they had to put something out to stop the negative reviews and the sales drop.  But the bad movie really hurts the movie itself as the story is bad at best and in some instances even boring at best.  The characters all have really odd behaviors in the movie, but it's really hard to remember a lot of it as it's just so weird.  I don't even remember the people's names who are supposed to be in this movie.  Even the dialogue is really odd, as we see a lot more than is appropriate.  And this is on the soundtrack as well!   But, I can say that I enjoyed myself while watching this bad movie. It's still weird, but if you really like weird, then I think this might be the movie for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The thing about "The Mummy," it's not really the movie itself, but it's the story we have been led to believe. If you have the time and the interest to research your history about the history of the "mummy" genre, you would discover that the Mummy was initially conceived by the writer and producer of "Gamera." The original script was written by Toho and a few of its executives and had no budget and the main role was played by a man called Robert Donner. However, he died during production. Instead, the director, Louis Leterrier, wrote the first two sequels. After a few years, "The Three Mummy" movies, written by David Blaine, became a hit. Then, "Gillman and Jones" started and the franchise became famous. Then came the "Gulliver's Travels" movies. And now we get "The Secrets of the Mummies," which has some great stories, some very good performances and a very well written script. The story of this film is very much like the story of the 3 Mummy movies and will probably give the viewer some great memories about watching this "magi-cubed" movie. The fact that it is not actually a true Mummy movie, but a sequel to some of the classics, does not bother me in any way. I can tell you that there is not one thing in this film that was not copied from the three mummies, and the story and characters are a faithful to the original. Even so, it is a very good movie and worth watching. It will give you some interesting facts about the mummy franchise as well as some fun facts.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is an unapologetic, cynical comedy that sees the characters constantly bemoaning their surroundings, as if these things could never change, as a way to keep themselves occupied. This is made worse by the fact that they are constantly being forced to confront a threat that doesn't exist - they are forced to live in a world that no longer exists because of it - they don't actually experience the world any more because of this, as well as the fact they never see the threat.  With all that said, the film takes a very fun and lighthearted approach to comedy, which, at the same time, is more than willing to take on heavier subjects (which, if you've watched anything after the 2008 financial crisis, will bring up the fear of the future) because they don`t have to be. They don't have to pretend like there is a solution.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst of the bad films I have ever seen (or I've seen a bunch of bad films). This was the worst of a bad batch I have had. I gave it two stars because the first half of the movie was very good. The last quarter was terrible. There was a small scene I remember which was supposed to be a nice little moment in the movie. A guy is running down a street and some guy on a motorcycle is behind him. There is some sort of accident and a guy is in a pool of blood. The guy is trying to get out of the pool of bloody water but keeps falling. The motorcycle guys yells at the guy on the motorcycle, "Don't you know you're coming?" The guy on my bike says, "I don't care. I'll die of the cold." This is supposed to make the bike guys feel better. This guy on motorcycles in a bloody pool of water is my favorite motorcycle scene ever. This movie is filled with so many clichéd lines, and the movie does not have that classic motorcycle scene. The movie had so much potential. The main character in the film is a smart little kid and he knows so much. He knows all the guys that are in his school and he has the courage to tell them what they have done. He is smart and knows he should not be there. He was very brave and has an older brother (in the movie he was 10) that is in the Marines. The scene I mentioned earlier was really nice. I thought the scene was well done. The only bad thing about this movie is the soundtrack. It is very cheesy and I wish they would have gone with a new song. The entire film had that cheesy 80's-90's feel to it. There were some songs from the movie which were ok but nothing to write home about. This film will make you cry a little and you will want to be scared of the guy in the pool.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      No review of a bad film is ever going to be entirely bad. This is the first movie I have seen from the "I Hate Movies" crew and it was the first time I heard from them. This movie may not be perfect but it is certainly unique in it's presentation. The film is set in a future where computers have replaced many other kinds of jobs such as driving, working, and so on. One day, a man by the name of Jack, gets caught with drugs while driving. He is taken into custody and is beaten while in custody. The police believe him to be a drug dealer so they try to force him to confess that he is a drug deal, but he refuses to say anything. Jack then has a confrontation with one of the police officers who is in a rage because of the fact that he has been beaten. The officer shoots and kills Jack. A few days later Jack is put on trial and his trial is put over to a jury of 12 men. While on the jury, there is a man in the audience named Daniel. He has been following the events that have happened and now feels the need to tell everyone what he thinks about the man Jack killed. One of the most memorable scenes in the film is when Daniel tells his fellow jurors, "You guys are killing this man Jack." The jury starts arguing about it and then Jack himself interjects by saying, "Do you know who I am?" The jury laughs. The ending of this movie leaves me speechless. I couldn't stop thinking about it. If you watch this film, I guarantee you will have a good time with it. Watch it for it's uniqueness. I highly recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen a lot of crappy movies recently, and not one of them has been a hit in my book.   What was interesting to me is that these movies are mostly not from big Hollywood names, they're mostly from smaller local talents that don't get much exposure (or even respect) from the big companies.  If you've never heard of this guy, I suggest you check out       his video review.    It's one of the best.  Here are the highlights.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved watching the movie. There were a few scenes that felt really out of place. The first scene was pretty hilarious with the "he's too nice" guy making it all a little too real. Also, what is up with all the people looking in her car? How was that relevant to anything. And she's not a character, just a generic chick driving in a car to avoid being arrested. This was all a very nice and silly scene. The next was more fun. The guy is going to jail because he's a drug dealer and he's trying to save some weed for his sister, who's in labor. The woman is driving and the guy is just sitting there smoking a spliff and watching the baby. Not sure if the guy was going to try to kidnap the child, but he didn't. It seemed a little weird to me, but I'm sure everyone thought it was funny. I also enjoyed the bit where she tells the kid he can't cry until he's six or seven. Also great when she was told to pull over and she did, but then she made the mistake of not doing so right in front of the police. What's going on with her? She was definitely a main character in the movie, but her story didn't feel that important to me. The rest of the movie was funny, even the moments where it wasn't very funny. The actors all did a great job, especially the guys. The story was good, but some of the humor fell flat. I really liked the ending, but it didn't seem all that important or relevant. I just liked the first part of it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it's more difficult to be objective and find enjoyment in a movie that seems to be trying to be the next Twilight. In that movie, the vampires (and also demons) were the bad guys. Here, however, the vampire's (and demon's) badness is made up for by their good. If you are not into supernatural fiction, you may find yourself having a little trouble with the movie. You are probably going to spend a good deal of your time wondering "Didn't he just save the world?" It doesn't help that this movie was based on a novel written by a guy named Clive Barker. If Clive Barker doesn't have your taste, you could definitely go back to some other novel or even the movies of a certain director who has your taste. Also, a certain actress who does not seem to get on with the other actors in the movie plays the main antagonist of the movie, in case you did not notice. However, if you enjoy a good vampire story, then this movie is a must see. I would strongly advise against this movie if you are looking for a vampire movie with a plot twist. It is just more of the same old things.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first day, there were no chairs for the audience, so we stood around, trying to look as comfortable as possible in our mismatched costumes. But, there was a show to watch, so I figured we would just stand still and laugh.   There is a special place in hell for women who don't help other women.  When the show started, a woman in the front row (who had also been in our seats a few minutes earlier) noticed me watching and commented on my body language. After the show, she said, "Oh, you were there. You should be sitting at home right now. You're lucky you don't have to pay for a seat!" This is a woman I will never forget.  When I heard her comment, I thought she was being a dick. Then I realized that the "dick" in this sentence was an insult:  Women who don" t help other woman, who " don"t care about women, and who do what they want, are, according to the world, the worst women ever.   It is difficult for some men to understand that there are many kinds of women. But if I am honest with myself, the ones who do the most harm are the kind who are not afraid to let people know that they care, and that they are interested.  It is hard to understand why men are so angry when women who are "different" say, "I don't care." I think there are a lot of different women out there, and it is difficult to understand what "different "is.  When I was young and first trying to find my way as a woman, I asked a man, "What do you think you are, a queen or a bitch?" He looked at me blankly for a long time, then said, ""I guess I have a hard time understanding you because you have a lot more control over your life than I do."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was not a good movie. I did enjoy it for the first half. It was good but it was not what I thought it would be. I liked the story a lot and I enjoyed watching the character development and getting to see the people involved with the movie. What I do not enjoy is that it didn't give me an experience that was new. I am not saying that it is a bad story, it was. I just think that this movie was not great. I think this was the worst "Halo" movie. The characters all looked like people I had seen in commercials for the movie before and the action was like something you would see from someone who did the same thing. I mean, it just didn't have anything new about it.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In an interview, David Lynch said of the script for The Elephant Man that he was, "a bit of a masochist. I enjoyed the idea of being chained to this thing." This quote is a perfect example of Lynch's talent for crafting stories, and his ability to manipulate his audience's emotions. While his films can seem a little melodramatic at times, Lynch's films always have a deep, twisted sense of reality, which gives us a great opportunity to imagine what might be happening in the minds of the characters, which we can then empathize with, even more so than if we were actually there.  Another great example is in Mulholland Drive, the first movie, when Laura Palmer is in bed with her husband, Jeffrey (Jack Nance), a story that is more about the marriage relationship and her relationship with Jeffrey than the fact that Jeffrey's wife, Diane (Naomi Watts), has died. Lynch and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski managed to create an absolutely horrifying, realistic sense of pain and suffering that was a reflection of both the marriage and of the loss of Laura's son. When Laura's husband dies and Laura is chained to him by her mother's killer, we as viewers are forced to consider just what that death would mean to both of them. This is a great example of how Lynch manages to craft a deeply layered, layered story, that has a deep impact on the audience, and allows the audience to feel the loss.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "It's a real shame. There's a whole story that doesn't make sense." A very good negative review.   The main thing that bothers me about this movie is the movie that was created for the movie, it's a fake ending where they take the story and make it about the characters in the movie. I don't think that's a good idea. It's a movie about a little boy and his parents, so they should put more into it. It was made for the audience, and that's the problem, you have a movie that wasn't made for anybody but the audience.  You have to read a movie by a book (or book-book or book-movie-movie by book-g) if you want to enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've always been a huge fan of horror movies. I watched my first scary movie when I was three. I loved it. And it was a really good movie. It was scary, and it was scary good. When I saw it, I told my parents I wanted to be a horror writer. I wrote a little horror story that my mom read to me that day. It's all about a girl who goes out looking for her lost puppy. She finds it, and she thinks she knows who it is, but it turns out he's a killer. The movie ends with a little scene in which the girl is being chased by a woman in a red coat. It turned out to be the same woman I was chasing that night! It was the first movie that inspired me to write a book called "The Evil Twin." It is about a twin sister who runs away from home. She ends up in a town where people do horrible things to each other, even to the point of murder. The film is good, but I always thought the ending was terrible. I wish that had been left in. I'm really happy that it has been made into a movie, though. I love the movie. I also loved the novel, "The Good Kind." And I loved the movies. There's something about them all. I've heard that David Robert Jones is in "The Killing." I hope he is. I think the movie is a good one. I want it to be even better than it was in the book.   It seems that you are the only person who knows about the new movie. Did you ever get a chance to talk with the people in the new film?  I never did get a look at the new picture. I was on the set and was asked about it, but they never let me see anything, which is weird because I didn't ask for anything. The only thing I did see was a teaser that had not been seen by the public, and that was in an office. I never got to see the new pictures.   the new pic is a remake. It seems to be just a re-do. I guess it's a little confusing to everyone because it's not a new picture at all. They re-did all the shots and replaced all the people and things that were in the original picture. The new people, the actors, don't seem to even be in the picture. They're all in this other picture
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In my opinion, it's a bad idea for the company to start marketing it in China just because it's "made in China" and that they can't make it in America. In the old days when there was a large Chinese population, movies that were good were also made in China. It's like a "Chinese version" of "The Godfather" or "The Sopranos". As a fan of Asian movies, I know what to expect, and if you can't handle the drama, then don't watch it. "Maniac" is a classic example of why movies in America should stay at home and not be made overseas.   As a guy who wants to watch a "real" movie, not a "fantasy" movie to his own benefit, I would not buy it.  The plot is not believable at all.     "Maniaac" was created by a group of "Chinese-born" (as you say) people (including some American-born people) who felt they should "discover" an unknown country in order to make money, and have a good time. "American" people who actually know how the world works were forced to do some "research" because, according to them, Hollywood made all the money in the world, so if we could make a movie based on all the "money" from one movie, we could do anything. In this "movie", the money is not really made in a movie. The movie was created as an advertisement for a company, and this was a movie that you could watch before you went to the cinema, and the movie would give you ideas to buy their stuff. It was not about the real life that the Chinese "Mafia" and the Chinese government is concerned with, and not about "true" corruption in Chinese politics. It made no sense. The actors, directors and producers were not "Chinese" at all, and there is not a single Chinese person in the movie. In fact, there is barely any actual Chinese in the cast. It is a huge mistake. I also don't think the movie was shot in China at all; the entire thing was shot (the whole movie) on location in Los Angeles, in "South-East Asia" where the film crew had an easy time to find and get some "real China".       If this movie had any value at all in China, then all the Chinese would
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I like horror films that try something different with their storytelling. But the execution of this story left me feeling disappointed, and I was so looking forward to finding out what happened next. I really liked the idea of the girl being abducted by the monster as I have found myself very intrigued with the idea behind the movie, but this film left me unsatisfied.      The monster was played by a really great actor named Michael Kenneth Williams.    I felt he was better at his role than his usual roles and he was pretty scary.  The main problem that I had with the movie was the fact that it seemed to end just too soon. I wanted to know what happened to the girl and it was never really answered.     I have to admit that I was not very impressed with the ending of the movie and it left me somewhat unsatisfied with it.  After seeing a couple of movies lately I have been finding myself having a lot of trouble sleeping because I am just so used to these type of endings. I feel like I am being robbed and I am so tired of the predictable nature of most horror movies. I hope that the filmmakers that are making these kind of movies learn a thing or two about story telling and plot twists, because it is not easy to make an ending to a movie that will keep you entertained for that amount of time.  I would recommend that you get a ticket to see The Boy (2010) for a movie with a good story and a very interesting concept, and in a world where horror films have become all about the same formula, maybe there is something to be said about a horror movie that isn't so obvious and obvious.   If you have seen a horror film before and felt that you liked it, then you will probably like this movie as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The good news is that you won't find all of the reviews in this review, and some of the movie's scenes will be more enjoyable, for example, the scene when Lelaina and Joleen watch the movie with the guy who stole the dog, and see what it's like for their families.  The bad news is it's really hard to do this.   When I do it, the script makes me cry.  When I don't, the dialogue is too forced and stilted.    So if you are looking for a movie that's going to make you cry, this is probably not for you.  And don't try to figure out who's playing the bad guy, or where the movie is going.  The actor is so bad it was hard to figure that out.   The only thing I can figure out is that it's a revenge thriller, but the twist doesn't make sense, and the movie doesn't feel like it's going somewhere.  As the reviewer who wrote the "Worst of the Worst" list for the last movie, this isn't a bad choice, but not one I'll be watching.  There's another movie with a couple of scenes with the same actors in it, but they aren't as bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'll be honest, I really liked this movie, especially the finale. However, I can't say the same for the book.   The ending is just a waste of an amazing story and I don't know how I'm supposed to feel about a movie that's supposed to be a prequel to a series that I only watched the first few episodes of.  I think it just felt like the writers, who have never written anything else, were just trying to fill the last two episodes of a series they have no desire to write the entire series in.  In the end, there is a lot of story that could have been included, and a lot that could've been trimmed.  But even if we cut out the bad parts, I'm not sure why we need the whole story.  One of my favorite parts of this show: The art and animation are fantastic, and the characters have a realistic, interesting look to them.  The story is very interesting and I didn't feel any real need to know how it ended, but it would've been nice to have some closure.  Another thing I was disappointed by: The writing style was very dull and repetitive.  We're used to this in a lot, but this was not as good as it could've possibly been.   4/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The bad film:       A film that shows you that they are not thinking before making a movie, it shows that they just want to have fun and that the "bad" movies are just fun to make. This is a good movie to watch in the morning, before going to sleep to get you in the right state of mind to have a good night's sleep.   The story:  The plot is a lot like the film, except this time, it is more like a movie that shows us the consequences of the things that they do.  I don't really like this movie, but it is fun to watch:  It is fun that it is made by a "D" rated filmmaker.    The characters:  It is really good to see the characters that they portray and they really make you feel for them. I am not a big fan of this movie but it was fun to do some research on the subject and understand why they acted the way they did.  You can find more reviews of this film on The IMDB. I also went into this film with a low expectation but I really did not think I would like this film as much as I did. This movie is worth your time and should be watched if you are a fan of horror. The Movie Review:  I hope I do not offend anyone, but I do believe there is a lack of people who are willing to write reviews about horror films. I feel this is the best way to do it. As I said I have not seen many horror movies in my lifetime but I am looking for something to watch that will make me feel a little bit sad. I was looking for a movie about a family with two children and it got me. I'm not a fan on horror movies and I didn't really care for this movie at all. I enjoyed the first half of the film but I was bored with the rest of the movie.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone and if you look up "horror film" I am sorry that I said this movie is a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have just finished the movie "The Day After Tomorrow." There are two aspects of this review to be noted: The first is the fact that there is a good movie, "Saving Private Ryan" and an un-funny movie, this one. Secondly, that there's a movie that's about to open on July 31st and is very poorly written and produced. The picture itself is not bad, it's the way it is being marketed. The story of "The day after tomorrow" is very bad, so bad in fact that you want to shake your head at the writers. This is a movie about people who were supposed to be soldiers in World War 2. The soldiers are fighting for the "good guys" and the bad guys are supposedly the Russians. So the script is supposed to follow the lives of these men, and then as the movie progresses, you realize there's not a lot of story there. What you do get is a lot about the American way of life in the 1930's. But it's all pretty superficial. The film, a movie called "the day after yesterday" was supposed to take place in August of 1944, a few months after D-Day in which the US army is fighting the German army for control of Europe. So we are being told, as the script goes on, that the soldiers are in the middle of their second battle of the European Theater. The script has the characters in the movie trying to figure out what they are fighting about. The movie is not very good because the plot is so poorly written, but the actors were okay. The one actor who really gave his all to the role was Billy Crystal, who is good, but it's a shame that he was used. The rest of the cast did pretty much the same thing as Billy Crystal. If you look at the movie, you will see that there are a lot more soldiers and other characters in this one than in the one from the book. The problem with this movie is that the story is so lame that it's not worth watching. It's a lot like a game of Monopoly that has not been written by someone who can write in the fourth person and who is trying to do a real script. The acting is very wooden, with people that seem to have had more lines of dialogue than any of the characters. The music is bad and the acting is lame. What is so bad about this movie? I could probably write a review on that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film, by its very nature, is a snapshot of a time in society at a certain time. There is no such thing as a "perfect" film. There's simply a way of portraying life in that period that's as accurate as possible. However, if the film's accuracy or objectivity is compromised in any way, the film will have a tendency to become a farce, and it has with The Exorcist. The film is a masterful achievement, and while it is a well-made piece of work, it is also the film that has made the most impact on our nation in terms of the manner in which it has shaped and defined our public view of the demonic. It is a film that is still seen today as being a masterpiece. The Ex-orcist (1973) is a classic film, and is often lauded as one of the great American horror movies. Many have labeled this film as "the" classic horror film. As such, it can easily be considered a "must see" film for all horror fans. However that doesn't mean that it is perfect. The story is about a young girl named Clarice Starling who is possessed by a malevolent demon named Frank. The creature slowly takes control of the girl, and slowly but surely, begins to take over of her body. She is unable to stop it, and as a result, begins believing that she is possessed too. She has no idea that she's being controlled by a demonic entity; she is just going along with the story. The idea of a possessed girl becoming a demon herself is not entirely new to cinema. There was the film, The Woman in Black (1952) where a woman begins to believe that she herself is possessed. However what makes the film stand out is that, while it does indeed present a powerful psychological struggle between the possessed woman and her husband, it doesn't go so far as to give us the full insight into the psyche of the possessed. Furthermore, The Exquisite Corpse (1971) was based on the film and also deals with the same issue of the woman being possessed, yet in a different manner. However The Exor-cist (1974) is an entirely different film that does not contain any of the psychological underpinnings that The Woman In Black (or any other of the films that have preceded it) did, nor is it a film where the woman is possessed and is able to stop her husband from harming her.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Here's some tips:  1) I hate a lot of movies that have a really annoying plot.  2)   I hate movies that are all about a character with a very good plot and I have no idea who the guy/girl with the bad idea is.   (See: Iron Man 3)  3)  I don't like movies that I've already seen before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        You could say the same about a good movie.   I will take a bad film over a good film any day.  For example, I'm glad I didn't see the film  The Lost City of Z. The film was bad.  I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.  The Lost City.  But I loved it.  There were some great action scenes. The story was pretty good.  So I can see why it's on my list.  The film ends up being very anti-climatic.  And I found it difficult to get into the character of Steve, the main character.  He was a bit too far above me to enjoy the film.  Steve's life seems to be full of tragedy and sorrow.  What I also like about this film is that Steve isn't a stereotypical hero.  Sometimes characters like that end up being too boring and over-emotional. Steve was really a lot more interesting than that. The film's trailer. In the film, Steve and his friend John get trapped in the desert and decide to kill off everyone in order to survive.  This is not the first time Steve's friends have taken his life, and it certainly isn't the last time either.  They also kill Steve's girlfriend and their friend.  When I say they kill people I mean that they literally cut off their heads and then have Steve carry the bodies back to his tent.  Also, their leader, Mr. White, does this a lot.  Although we don't know exactly what Mr. Whites motives are, we know that he has some special powers.  Mr.White, the leader, has a small, blue-gray goatee.  While I liked his personality, I felt that Mr.white was a little over the top.  As we get closer to the film we find out that Mr White doesn't kill for the fun of it. In fact, he wants to have Steve and John executed for their crimes.  We do learn that Mr white actually kills the people he saves, but he prefers to kill them off by cutting off their head.  However, Mr White's plans for vengeance are complicated.  To make it more confusing, we learn that Steve's name was also known as "Spike" before.  In the last scene of the film Steve's friend dies.  Then, Mr white kills himself.  At this point in
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't think that the movie was really bad. It was funny, I thought it was great. I liked the first half and it gave me the feeling that it was going to keep going and I was right. And for a minute I thought that it would end with a bang. I thought maybe it would have the last one-liner and I would see that the "good guys" won. I was wrong. I watched this movie, and I had the feeling of being sooo bored. There were moments I thought this would be more about how he would have to spend a whole movie doing this and that and I really felt bad for the "bad guy" in this movie. It wasn't until I started watching the movie again I realized how much time and effort went into it and how much I enjoyed watching it. I don't understand the reason I'm watching this, but at this point in my life I'm ready to move on and stop watching movies that are basically pointless filler for me. The bad thing was, I didn  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    ( I'm using my iPad   ) In the above screenshot, I have set the top left corner to be my starting position, so I can see the bottom part of the screen, and when I press a button, it moves to the bottom of the window. This means that the next time I want to move to the next part of screen, I press the top right button again. Now that I have that, I can change the size of the whole window. So now I need to get a bit more complicated. I need a grid that looks like this:  I have three horizontal and two vertical lines that are the width of my window. Now I can use a special function to define a function to change the background of the grid:  def get_grid_background ():  return '#0000ff' This means that I can have multiple grids in a window, and if I want them to all be a different colour, I will just use the '#' sign. (This works well on a tablet.) I can then use the function on the grid to make it black or white and change it to something else.  (To change the colour of the top row in the grid, I just need to write it as "#000000" or "#0000ff".) The function will take a number as an argument. That number is the number of rows and columns in my grid. This way I can set the background to white and I will see a different background when I use the grid command:  def get_my_grid (): # Set the background and get a number to go from 0 to the length of my grid background = [ 0, 0, 1, 0 ] # Change the number to the colour I want return background Here I can tell Python to go through the first four numbers of the colour code and colour it black for the first grid and white for the second grid. I can write a function that changes the background colour on all the other grids and save the resulting colour. Here I just put that code in a function, as shown: def getgrid_colour (): """Returns the colour to be used as the background for all of the grids. Return a colour number as a string or int, or None. """ return '#ff0000' After that, all that is left to do is change the foreground colour of each grid. But I want my grid to have
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's all in the title!   The first 30 minutes of this film are a bit more than a glorified movie trailer, with the rest of the time being spent on some very silly jokes about the world we live in.   A man and his sister (who are the best thing in this film) get into a car crash and die, the girl wakes up in a hospital, wakes up to see her dad's head lying in a chair next to her.  We also meet her brother (played by "Jokes-a-lot" Tom Waits) who's in a coma because his father was in a crash.  It seems that his family wants him back in the family business so he becomes a bodyguard.  The rest of it is just a crazy story about people who are doing stupid stuff and why. The film has the standard Hollywood action sequences and some really bad acting.  Some people really enjoy this type of film but this one is not for me.  I just don't see it as a fun movie, it's like watching a bad reality show.  You'll find it hard to get into it and it just makes you want to punch someone in the face for the first half hour.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts out with a simple explanation of what "Space" means to us humans. It shows a scene of a giant starship orbiting Earth, with a lot of explosions going off. It seems that aliens came to Earth and started their own civilization, but then a few humans got together and made this spaceship. Then they have a big battle between them and the alien beings. At the end, we see a spaceship explode into pieces, which was just the aliens' final sacrifice. Now, I know the alien races are pretty tough, but that is just stupid.  The second part of the movie shows us what "space" means when they discover a new planet, where they were never supposed to land on Earth. The first alien race, called the Vartan, live in a large underground city. But they get killed by the native inhabitants of the planet. But then the humans learn about the planet and they decide to move in.   This is the worst movie ever made.  It is just so bad.  There is no sense of story, plot, plot. There is only just bad writing. It is bad bad writing which I have never seen in a movie. The entire movie is just a bunch of bad writing with bad acting. It has all the bad writing of Alien in it. So many people have said that "they really don't know how to act, they just act".  Now, they don't act to the same degree. But the writing is just the worst.  In this movie, every single thing bad happened and was done by an alien.  Everything they did was stupid. They killed everybody, everyone that was supposed to be there, and they were always just getting killed one after the other, so there is no real feeling of danger.  For example, there is a scene in the movie where a alien destroys all the trees on the planet's surface.  That is just wrong. This is so wrong that I have to go out of my way to explain it.     When they landed on the alien planet they had all their food spoiled and there was no food or anything. So, the alien race decided to just eat all the people in the city. They then took the "giant" spaceships and turned them into giant bombs that were meant to blow up the city to make them leave the planet, so that they wouldn't have to eat all those people. Then, they went into the city and started
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     (You'll need some good movies to enjoy, too. And if you know someone who loves "The Lion King," you'll find plenty of friends to watch it with.)  , directed by Tim Burton, is the story of Mowgli, the lone survivor of a band of wolves who wander into the wild to escape a merciless tiger. And it's a movie that's probably better without all the music. (Also, what the hell were those tigers supposed to be in there?) For the first hour or so, the film does a solid job of bringing Mowgli from being a young child who can't speak (to a fully-fledged adult who knows his way around a bow and arrow) and, ultimately, an adult who can hold his own in a fight against some of the wildest, most terrifying creatures you've ever seen on a screen. There's the tiger, who's always on top of him and almost always ready to pounce at a moment's notice. There are the wolves (which you won't recognize when they're all wrapped up together), a pack of cougars, wolves, and a few bears. Then there's the jungle itself, which is a nightmare to look at. There is a little girl, played by Lupita Nyong'o, who, despite being a bit dim, comes off as one of the more likable characters, and the jungle is very often just a backdrop to the film's action. In one of Burton's first films, he's not trying to make you feel anything -- he's just making sure you know what you're seeing, and that's enough. The best parts of the film come at the very end, when Mowgor -- now a young man, now grown and with a job to go to -- meets his father, who comes to find Mowgo, Mowgon, and other creatures in a kind of tribal village.   But it's all downhill from there. The jungle is just a set, and there are no creatures living in the jungle at all. Burton's film is just one of many that feature this "forest" as a background -- or even background in a setting that has something to do with the jungle. So what the heck is a jungle? (It seems like some of them have "jungle" in the name.) There are some very good ones, but most of them don't give a shit about what happens on screen.

The acting is ok, and the story is interesting enough, but the plot is too confusing and poorly explained. It was also incredibly confusing. The characters were so much better as stereotypes, but it seemed as though the producers didn't really understand what a good character was. I feel like a lot of the movie is spent explaining what a "good" character is, and then the movie spends 90% of it's time trying to make the character a bad one. I didn andt enjoy this movie. I don't know why it was even put on the schedule. But I was so sad that it was given to a film that is probably not going to be remembered fondly. I guess what I'm trying to get at is I don?t understand why the producers thought this was a good idea.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you really, really love your own work, and you love this industry, and this movie is about a young black girl who grows up and becomes a young actress in Hollywood, then I think it's time to put down the mike and write a positive review about it!     In the beginning of this movie, we see our protagonist, a young, black girl, and we see the journey she's going to go through on the way to becoming a star. She's just been accepted into the drama department of this film studio by the name of "D.O." (Determined and Overly Attached). D.O. is really into his career, and he's not only in charge of putting young black girls through their paces, but also he's the one who takes care of their needs and cares about them, but he's still pretty insecure and insecure. This leads to our protagonist's being a little bit more "mellow" and a bit more outgoing, which is good and all, but it doesn't seem to make much of a difference when the script takes her back home and turns her into a sex symbol for all the white people, and then when the guy she's living with, her mentor and her father figure, tells her she should try out for a part in his movie...     And when our heroine is in Hollywood for a little while, and she does end up getting a part, which she's playing opposite an Asian male, who is of course the only person on the screen, who she ever even meets, which makes her an obvious sexual object...   And when she goes home, and has a big scene in a hotel room with the one person she's always looked up to and had the biggest crush on in her whole life...     And when the film ends, the Asian guy who she was supposed to make fall in love with her just...  (I mean, he looks at her, she looks at him, and they actually make out, but that's okay, because it's "natural" and all...  )  But none of that has anything to do with the movie... At all.   But none of it has anything to do with how it was written, so I was pretty upset when I finished watching the movie, and how the movie ends, because I know it was supposed, and it was a great script and it could've
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One of the great things about cinema is that the audience is never in doubt. We can look at the movie and judge whether the story is strong or weak. You know whether we should go in for the good or bad. This movie is a good story but it doesn't hold up after you watch it. The characters are all a little bland and the story doesn't make a lot of sense.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Rating:      1/5 ( 0 votes ) Review by:   Anonymous  I have watched this movie and am pretty disappointed. The ending was so cheesy and rushed and it is an embarrassment to a truly great movie and a true horror classic. I've seen this movie on a couple of occasions and have always been amazed by the special effects. What was there for a reason was so terrible. So this movie is for those that want to see something that will make you scream! I recommend it for those people.  Review by: Anonymous , a man is killed by a man at a carnival, who is then killed by the man who killed him, who has killed many other people at the same carnival and the next thing you know you are on a carnivals boat as people try to find the man that killed them. I was really disappointed with the special effect and direction and the movie was not scary, there were scenes where the actor would scream, I mean scream, but the film was so rushed and didn't do much with the idea of what happened in the movie, it was a bad film., as for the cast, some actors were terrible to watch, I am not sure if you have seen other actors do a bad job, I can't remember.  I would like to say that the film has a great ending and I really liked the idea, I guess, the writer just forgot the ending and just had a great movie for about 30 seconds and that is all I remember., I would recommend this movie to horror fans but not a horror film fan. If you want to watch a fun horror movie that will not get stuck in your head with a horrible ending and is a true classic this is the movie for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My boyfriend and I went to see a movie and the staff was very rude to my boyfriend and my friend. They made my boyfriend feel like his opinion of the movie was not important at all because it's not his favorite movie. Then he got up and left because of them. So be careful when you go to a movie theater and make sure the people working there are nice to you and know that what you say is just as important as what they say.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you hate a movie, just watch the first 10 minutes of another film you like, and compare your opinion about it to your perception of the movie that was watched after the first 30 minutes.   A movie's effect on you may change depending on the quality of the film.  Sometimes you just don't see a lot of movies as good as the bad ones.  2. Never say you're not in love with a movie: "If I love a movie so much, I must have a copy" "I watched it last night and I loved it"  It's all right.  This is something all the other people say when they love a film. And yes, some of us probably love a lot more than others.  So don't make yourself look so stupid.  They said the same thing about love when they were young, but they didn't say "I love the movie".  I like movies.  I just like some better movies than other people.  Yes, my friends are good at comparing movies.   " You don't have time to watch a bad one" "You hate them all"  And that's what they're saying when they tell me about the bad movie they watched last night.  But that's not a reason to reject a good movie.   3. Avoid saying how much you enjoyed a movie; rather, explain the movie's flaws: You like this movie, but… You like this other movie, so much that you can't understand why it's terrible. It doesn't matter if the movie is great or not.  If it's too difficult to understand, you need to find an easier one.   You have read a book about this movie?  You know more about the movie than anyone else?  But then again, we all like some movies more than other.  Some people like some TV shows more than some other TV shows.   Some people just like to watch movies, whatever they're like.  Now you're a great movie watcher.  You didn't hate this movie because you liked this other one better.  Maybe it was just you who got to watch this movie first.  Who knows. 4. If you think you don't like a movie because of something you saw on a TV program, read this:   So what if a movie is bad?  If something terrible is on television, you might not like that
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Novel:  A.J. is an aspiring film director. One day he is hired by a TV station as an intern. While there he meets the young star of his show, a pretty blonde girl named Rachel. They go out a few times and start getting closer. He starts falling for her. However, when he starts getting interested in a girl he meets at work, it all goes wrong. A young man with a criminal past and a complicated relationship with a girl named Sarah. They fall in love and it's love at first sight.  (The film follows their lives with a twist: Rachel is actually A.J.'s ex-girlfriend)  B.C. is a story about the past of a young man. At some point he loses his family, and moves to a small village, where he meets a girl, a beautiful blonde named Rachel, who seems like a perfect girl, until she leaves him. He ends up getting a job at a TV news station, where Rachel is a reporter. He loves her and they start to date, but all of a sudden A.D., the younger brother of A.O. they were close to in their childhood, starts looking for them, and he is really angry with A.C., and the two get into a fight. Suddenly A.B. also becomes angry, and this leads to a new series of events and A.A. becomes the central character. It is a very sad and sad story, but it's also a very funny story. I loved this film, and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of romantic drama and mystery movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So many bad movies. The first of which is called 'Ghosts of Mississippi' and is the worst movie I have ever seen. It is an old ghost story set in the 1940s and there is no dialogue. The plot is about an old man who has lived his whole life on a plantation and is going to a fair. There is a black woman who wants to marry his son and he wants to run off with a white woman. He has to find a young black man who is a musician. When he gets there he finds out that it is an all white band. There's a big fight on the grounds and he is stabbed in the hand and almost died. But all he can think about is the woman. His son is really hurt. He just wants to be left alone. His wife has no desire to be with him. She doesn't really want to be married to a nigger anyway. And there is a lot of racism. So he goes to Mississippi and finds a job for the black musician. But when the musician gets there, he finds his wife and son dead. He starts to have a hallucination of having a good time with the dead man. He can't sleep or drink so he is having a lot more fun than he should. So one night he goes into the black community and gets a room. He tries to tell a black story and it is like being the best of friends. He gets drunk, drinks a lot and he falls asleep. The next day, the band that he had been playing with, comes to his room to play. He is still asleep and when he awakes he gets beat up. They break into the room and find the dead musician. They find out that the white woman that he was planning to marry has died. She was only seventeen. They discover that he went up to his girlfriend's house and killed her. They arrest him, but when they try to take him to trial, he says that he knows where they live and he has to meet his son, his son is going on a tour with the band. So they take him up and he gets his hand chopped off. But he doesn't die. The guy shows up the next night with his hands. The whole scene is played for laughs. They hang the guy and the guy goes on his tour. There was no way to stop it. I liked 'The Best Man' a little better, but it was better than most of the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never been a huge fan of the first part of The Room, but it has aged really well. The film has a lot of really bad elements. It starts with two teenagers in a hotel room, the guy is very handsome and the other is a creepy girl who likes to torture and make sex jokes (though the movie never gives her a name, we later find out that she's called Norma). I enjoyed the sex jokes, the scene where she tells him how he's going to get the first kiss is funny, the first scene where the guy and the girl are in a bathroom and the guy gives her "a little tongue in her pussy" was very hot and the sex in the movie is very strong. There are a few scenes where I thought the film was going to become a little pretentious or cheesy, like the girl with a face full of bruises and blood talking about the blood all over her and talking about "what we did on that night." However, it does get more interesting after that point, and some of the other parts I enjoyed. The dialogue is very bad, sometimes I found it hard to understand what they were saying, but the writing is really bad, so it doesn't matter that much. I'm not really sure what the movie was about because there were a lot less characters and it was very repetitive. I really liked some scenes where the guys were trying to find and rape the girls, so that was fun. I think the film's only problem is that there are a lot more bad things in it than good things, so a lot can go wrong with the plot. It has a few moments where it could've been really great, like when Norma asks about the first girl. I thought it was really interesting to see these two bad guys trying to rape the girl who later turns out to be the bad guy's mother, but that kind of thing was rarely used. The final scene has the two bad actors sitting in the bathroom, talking about how they made "it up," but again, there were only two scenes in the entire film with that kind, so they really didn't need to be in the film. Overall, The Room is a movie with a few interesting elements, but it doesn' look like it'll make a lot or change a lot about how bad sex comedies tend to be.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     [Note: My comments are written in a more academic style than usual. That is because I do not wish to give anyone who has read this story a bad impression of a good movie. ]  The film's star, George C. Scott, made this movie and its two predecessors, The Green Berets and The Green Beret, look like a piece of high art. But he is hardly the only one who had an artistic hand in this movie. If you have not seen the movies, you need not look them up. A review of this film will not do it any harm, though.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I watched this movie with my younger brother in the 90s, I was so impressed by it. As a kid, this was a really interesting, fun movie. I remember playing with a few friends, and this was our first film, and we were totally enthralled. The film features some really interesting actors (not to mention a bunch of other great ones, too), and the movie even has some sort of a love triangle and a lot of comedy that kept us laughing. The movie is about a couple, and their relationship is complicated. One of the characters is just a dumb, annoying, and annoying guy who never really says anything. The other character is a hot, sexy, gorgeous young lady who loves him, but can't stand his obnoxiousness and his horrible manners. But that's a spoiler. The relationship is really interesting. I also really enjoyed the scene where the girl was trying to get an older man to sleep with her. The two have such great chemistry together. If this movie was released today, I would definitely give it a second shot. I haven't seen any modern films that have this kind of chemistry in them. I do hope someone will make a sequel.    ...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What would I do to get out of being bullied?   This is the kind of bullying that happens at a school where I was bullied, and it happened for four years. The worst part was that the people making this movie were trying to make it sound like this was a good movie.   Why not have a scene where the kids get together to talk about how much they hate each other, and then they decide to go to the prom together? It would be like "The Breakfast Club" with kids and proms.  Posted by Mike at 9:18 AM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have to admit, I was expecting something more.   This movie is basically a poorly made movie.  I'm not saying this is a good movie, because it definitely isn't, but it was a fun movie for the most part, and it's worth a watch if you like bad movies.  It wasn't bad for me, but I'm guessing a lot of people won't enjoy this. I'm pretty sure it will make some people laugh, which is great.  This isn't bad because it's bad; it's just a poorly done movie. "If there is any way, there is the way!   - J. R. R Tolkien (The Lord of the Rings)" (movie quotes are used in a similar fashion to the books)   The first thing I really disliked about this movie was the title of it.  If you're going to call a movie The Bad Boys, and if you're not going to make it entertaining, then you're doing it wrong.  The Bad Boyz is a pretty entertaining movie, but the name itself is not the problem.  "Bad Boys" is so lame, it's laughable.  Not only is the title bad, but "The Boys" seems to be an inside joke.  You just can't make a movie about a bunch of criminals and not have at least a couple of bad guys.  Bad Boys II  So why was this movie titled the Bad Boys?  "The Bad Boys" isn't a bad title.  Why do they have to call it The Bad Brothers if they're not a gang?  A lot of this movie seems to have been shot in the first week of February, and a lot was shot of it in the middle of the night in a warehouse.  Even the ending seemed rushed and rushed.  So what made this movie so bad?  "The Bad Boy" This isn't like the movie I reviewed the other day called "The Big Game".  " The Big Game" was a better movie. But there are some things that are wrong with this movie.   "A man is a man, whether he likes it or not!"   Well, that sounds pretty corny.  But it is true.  People who have a lot to say tend to come off as corny, and sometimes it just can be hard to be a good guy or girl.  A good guy is a

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very excited when I heard that "Star Trek Beyond" was going to be released in IMAX. It is a huge movie with more than 200 stars. In that movie, William Shatner and his new female costar Zoe Saldana play a starship captain and an away team member on a multi-million mile voyage to repair the damaged warp engine.   It is hard not to be impressed by this movie.  The plot is fascinating, the characters are well developed and have a great sense of humor. The actors all seem to have fun and play their roles with a lot of gusto.  They even go a step further by making a great tribute to Leonard Nimoy by wearing his Spock ears.  What a good movie this is!       This was a nice little treat in a crowded summer.   The movie is not without flaws.  It takes a little too long for things to develop.  There are some awkward sequences with the Enterprise crew.  Other than that the movie is a winner.  One of my favorite moments of the movie comes at the end, after Spock's funeral, when he and Kirk kiss.  I thought it was a great way to end a long and satisfying journey.  Overall "Star trek Beyond" is a fun, satisfying and memorable movie. The cast did a great job making the movie feel like a big event. I would watch this movie again, with or without the IMAX presentation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      My wife is a huge fan of this film. It's great for a good laugh. I would like to see a DVD release of this on DVD.   The music was good and I think it was the same people who made the "Dangerous Games" soundtrack.   the movie is set in the future.   This movie is funny. I laughed out loud. The plot is interesting. I liked how it was in a future where people were genetically engineered to make them super strong.   The character design was interesting.   and the special effects were good.     I would recommend this movie for a laugh. The film is a great movie. I just don't think it is the best film of all time. This film was fun to watch.   I found this to be a good movie but I wish it was longer. The movie is in black and white. The colors are a little hard to see. I have seen the film in both English and Japanese.      It has been about 4 or 5 years since this movie was released in America.  It was released by Warner Brothers in the U.S. It didn't make a lot of money at the box office but this is still a good film.

"My favorite movie of the week! We need a bit of this here and there in our lives."  This movie is like a very long film about how a bad woman could possibly have sex with a bad man.   It doesn't mean that it's a good movie, it just means that the movie is very good.  My only other complaint is that I wish there was more sex.  - December 9, 2014Great Sex Scenes The Final Dossier
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you haven't seen the movie, then the following review will be a huge disappointment. This movie is so bad it's good. The writing is weak and the acting so lackluster. It seems the director got in trouble with the studio after the director's assistant quit after just three weeks of work and so they tried to replace him with someone from the film industry who didn't know anything about comedy. If that was the case then they should've just gotten the real comedian to come in and perform. I'm not joking. All that is left is the director (Mr. Hanks) and the star (Woody Harrelson) and they don't even really act together. They barely interact. Even Harrelsons scene isn't all that funny. Harrelons character, Sam Fisher, is so unoriginal that he should've been left in a hole for at least 5 or 10 years, and if he'd been left like that then how is he supposed to live after he dies? This movie would've been better off as a trailer or a short film that was shown at the local movie theater. It would have been the type of comedy that I would've loved to see at the movies but the director, Mr. Hays is too lazy to do anything with this movie so he just let it fade into the night as a joke. This should have been a trailer for a sitcom. Maybe they could have made it the same way as the first movie in this series or made it a parody of something. This is really the only thing this movie has going for it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the first movie I saw after moving from Australia to New York. I have had a love/hate relationship with the movie in Australia. On one hand, I loved the idea that the United States was an island and was under an oppressive dictatorship, and that it is the United Kingdom that is under the influence of the evil dictator. On the other hand, this movie was awful. The script is dreadful. The acting is terrible. The director is a joke. The movie is not even really a horror movie. It is more of a comedy with some horror elements in it.  The villain:  I thought that was one of the worst villains in a movie in a very long time.  This movie had a lot of very stupid moments, and while the movie was enjoyable, I didn't really enjoy watching it as much as I thought I would. The reason is because I never really felt that the movie ever truly came to a conclusion. It ended on a strange note, with the villain being forced into a mental hospital, and with a giant black spider trying to kill him.    Other thoughts:  This is a movie that I don't have any regrets about watching. If you get the chance to see it, I would recommend watching it. You might not have anything to laugh at, but it will at least give you something to think about as well.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     "They're all the same"  A. DOUBLE, "HONEY-BEARER!" (1972)  [Top of Page]  They're All the Same  by Walter Matthau, written in 1962.  One of the saddest films of all time is THE TENANT, and I do mean that in every way. I think that this picture is the most disturbing of all films I have ever seen in my life, and that it is the worst and most depressing film of all. And I haven't seen one more depressing film that has ever been made. It has no humor in it. There are no jokes in it; nothing.  The picture is absolutely pathetic and horrible and I think in every possible way it's an ugly and an ugly picture. I feel sad for everybody involved in it, and a sadder person I've ever seen than I was at that time. It was a great picture for its time, and yet it is such a dreadful picture that I feel it will not survive to see another thirty years, for all the wonderful things we have now in the world. It's a very sad picture, and in spite of its terrible subject matter it was a very effective picture. The best screen director of his day and all of his associates and actors have never been able to make a picture like this, although the best picture directors of today, the actors, and all the other artists of the picture business can. This was made when I was a director of pictures, and it really did move me. It really affected me. I had never seen anybody so completely controlled, so completely taken over, and controlled. It just crushed me. And the story, too, is terrible, and you know that in spite all the good things that have been written about it it has to be considered a picture that really was made by people who had to take it seriously, who had only half an idea of what could be done. The story is horrible, and the actors are so unbelievable, and some of the most revolting people I have seen on the screen. They're all very good actors, but they are too unbelievable. The whole picture is very sad. In other words, this is one of the sadder movies I have heard of, or one of a sader lot of pictures that have ever been put on the big screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You will end up disappointed and feel bad about yourself. I wouldn't even write a good review about the movie, because that would make me seem like a jerk. You don't know everything. If you're just learning about the subject, go see a movie, read a book, and watch a couple of tv series. I don't get paid to give a "movie-review-for-free".  I'd go for The Big Lebowski, because it's really good. The acting, especially John Goodman as the Dude, is very good. But I don`t know that I would recommend it to anyone. You're better off reading a book like John L. Daly: Life, Love, and Lebakowski (A Tribute to Walter "The Dude" Miller), that's more of a short story than a movie. But seriously, I wish you'd watch a few books like this. I`d love to hear your thoughts.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I've been on the fence about this movie since I first saw it. I knew the movie was a remake of a British TV show, but the remake doesn't feel right. This movie feels more like a rip off of The Big Chill, not to mention the original film didn't have the same kind of atmosphere. I really like the cast for this movie, and I do feel like it's a bit better than the remake. The director of this movie did great job creating a bad, gritty atmosphere for a movie. If you liked the British TV series then you should really give this movie a shot, as I know this movie will get the same sort of ratings that the original TV show got, which was not good.

I would rather watch a movie with my wife then a movie alone.  The movie was pretty good.  It had a lot of action and a good story line.   We were seated a couple of rows in the back, but I didn't have a problem with the size of the theater.  My kids really enjoyed it.  You wouldn't believe the number of people at a movie. I enjoyed it too.  In the end, I will give it an 8.4 out of 10.  Thank you for sharing the theater! I can't wait to go back!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just plain dumb. I would say this movie should have been made for the early 80's or maybe the late 60's but the actors and director were still too immature to pull it off. A young man is sent to a camp as a punishment for a sexual incident he had. He is only allowed to stay there until a few days before his graduation. His only friend in the entire camp is a little girl who has been in and out of the camp ever since it was formed. She is lonely but still loves the boy, who in turn is lonely for her. He has had a crush on her since the day he arrived there and this is his chance to win her over, but when the time comes he falls for her only to have her fall for him in the worst possible way. The movie is stupid. There are moments when a lot of the scenes are done just to add a sense of drama and to show how a man will do anything to win the heart of the one he loves, but that is just too cheap to work on such a poor premise. The acting is just awful. The girl's acting is so bad it is like watching an adult show on the TV, they have to be dragged across the screen just so they can talk. The boy's acting just screams that he didn't want this to happen, it just comes out wrong. The whole movie is ridiculous. A boy is sent away and the movie decides to go into his dreams, which leads to the stupidest thing I have ever seen on the screen. It's a little dream sequence, with the two of them talking, which just makes it worse. The ending is even worse, the girl doesn't say goodbye to the boy in any way. At one point he tries to hug her but she is too scared, so he hugs her instead. It is as stupid as the movie. I had to force myself to watch this movie, I had it with a few friends because it was so bad, so this was my first real "movie". I think this movie is better than that "crap" called "The Big Sleep" or the "horrible" film called "Scent of a Woman".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I've seen a couple of good ones but there's always something in it that is just not quite right.   That was the case with "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty".   I like how it tells the story of Walter and his mother.  But I don't love him.  It starts off okay until we start to see how he gets into all of this.  Then we watch how he comes off.  They should have just made him a girl so I would have a little more interest in the story.  For all of its flaws it has a nice cast of characters.  My favorite is Walter's little sister.  "I'm your sister?   Oh, okay.  Is she pretty?"   Yeah, not so sure.  He's an awkward kid and she's pretty, but I really wouldn't say she's the most interesting character in the movie.  Another one of the cast members was the "Schnoz".  There were a lot of jokes and I wasn't really in the mood for them at the time.  The "Bartender" character was a lot more interesting than Walter.  This is actually why I enjoyed it less than my other two.  I don 't remember a whole lot about the other two movies.  Maybe I just didn't like the humor.   I was so hungry I didn't think to ask my waiter about the menu.  There's no way they would have mentioned it.  But he did mention that it's a $10 drink.  And I don' t care if it's really just a $7.00 bottle of water.    It's still $10.  Why should it cost more than a bottle of Coke?  I thought it was the worst movie I have ever seen.  What the hell is that movie about?   Oh, it's just a crazy day at the beach.  Don't judge, it was funny.   There was no sign anywhere.   The movie doesn't begin with anyone meeting or talking to anyone.  Something is wrong.  Was Walter Mitteleben really supposed to be the main character?  Who told them that he was a millionaire?  That it was actually Walter's friend who had to pay all of his expenses?  What the hell was with the little girl who seemed to be there all the time?  It's not even
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If a movie was good but you liked the bad parts more, don't get mad at the movie. Get mad at its director or writer, its stars, and the studio that made it.   That's what bad movies are all about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found it very boring and pointless.   The dialogue is repetitive.  It is a bad film to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has a lot of negative reviews, which means a lot! The movie itself is nothing special. I wouldn't say it's bad or anything, but the acting and some things that the movie does is pretty cliched. The story does get to the point, however, and is a good story. The art is pretty, but there are only 3 artists in the movie, so the artwork isn't that great. The music in the film is really bad as well, so it's very disappointing. The ending of the movie is pretty terrible as well. There are two endings for the movie: a good one and a bad one. The good ending has a twist at the end, while the bad one just leaves a cliffhanger. One way or another, I can't believe how bad this movie is. I thought I would give this a 4, but I can really only give it 3, and 1 being a good ending and a terrible ending. This movie isn't worth watching!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I haven't seen The Expendables 2 yet, but based on the trailer I'm expecting this to be an epic failure. I was really looking forward to seeing a sequel to the first Expendables because I really liked the original. This one...not so much. It's not that the movie isn't entertaining. It just doesn't have the same spirit. It feels like a watered down, watered down version of the first movie. Maybe the studio has gotten lazy and decided that it's not really necessary to give us a more hardcore sequel. Maybe it wasn't even necessary to make this movie. I've got no idea, but that doesn't mean it isn't a disappointment. I'm giving it an "M" because I was hoping to get another Expendables. This movie is just not up to par. Read my original review: http://www.sltrib.com/slti/2013/07/23/37991232/watch-the-expendables-2-a-disaster-from-thegetgo-part-2 I don't know if I would watch the second Expendables movie, but for starters, why is this called Expendables?

It was a great movie with a great plot and great action, but the whole time it felt like it was in third grade, when they were all trying to make a fun movie but didn't quite know what they were doing, and it just fell flat.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (it can be a positive review about an ok movie).   So I think I'll say something about this one, it's a very good movie and a good movie with an ok budget.   The movie is about a cop, who has to track down two drug dealers.  He ends up falling in love with the girl of one of the dealers.     I've always liked movies about cops and they are always good and I think this is one of those.  I do think that the movie starts out a bit too fast, with some of the characters talking, that was probably done to make it more like a TV movie and to slow it down, but it works to the movie.  When it gets going it becomes a really good movie. One of the best I've seen.  It is also one of my favourite crime movies.  The music is good and the action is just fantastic.  As mentioned before the movie is a good one, but I would suggest watching the TV movie of the same name to get a better idea of what this movie is all about.  There is not much to say about this, I'm sorry I couldn't give it better marks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really did.    I was really bummed out about how stupid the movie was.  I wasn't watching it to get my money's worth, I was watching it because I had to find out what happens to everybody that falls from the sky, right?   So the main character is going to die by falling out of a plane, the only people who fall from the plane are robots, and nobody is able to stop it or do anything about it, and so the only thing that can stop the robot from coming to earth is a guy named Dr. Zaius (Jeff Goldblum) and he's the only robot that's alive.  But we don't know what's going on until the movie is halfway through, when we get this weird scene where Dr.Zaius goes on a rampage and he kills the robots that are hanging around outside of his house.  Dr. Zero (Gary Lockwood) is trying to get the robots to go to the hospital so they can be removed, but they don't want to go.  And what happens?  Well, in a bizarre way, the robots start going to work for Dr.Zero, and they help him and his family out, and when they come back, they've been replaced with robots and it's just like Dr.Vasquez (Robert DoQui) and Dr.Takashi (Yashiro Murakami).  That's all I'll say.  This movie is really stupid, and I'll give it that, but it's also got some good moments.  If it was a movie that was so badly written it could have been made a really good movie, I would have been more than a little impressed, but this is just a bad film with an incredibly annoying main character.  Not a bad director though, he does great work, even if he is just horrible.  It's an old movie that doesn't even deserve to be seen as anything other than a piece of crap, but I guess you can't expect much more from a movie called "The Sky Crawlers."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think I should make that clear.   The movie's pretty terrible.  But it's not like it wasn't trying. It was trying to be edgy, and it did that.  It had a lot of good ideas.  One of them was to use an interesting idea that they had from their earlier films like "Ghostbusters".  It just never worked.  The only interesting idea was a female who could speak in this movie, and only in French.  She was so uninteresting.  I guess we can't all be Ray Bradbury. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I don't really watch bad movies so I don't know if I would have enjoyed it, but it was well made. It had an amazing cast of characters and I think that was the best part. There were two parts of it that really blew me away. The first part was that the story was like a book. It was very interesting. It wasn't like some of those old science fiction movies where they are trying to figure out how to do science fiction, it was about a person going through what was actually the end of the world. That was the part of it I really enjoyed. It made me think. It is pretty well done.     "The second part was in my opinion the worst part of the movie. The ending. It ruined the movie for me.  That ending, I don�t know what that movie was. It felt like it was a movie that was out of place. It just sucked me in and then it just dragged me out. I couldn't enjoy the movie at all. " "It was hard to like this movie, because I don.t think it was that great a movie. It didn't feel like it had much potential and it made me sad that it ended so abruptly and it was such a letdown to be so disappointed in a movie."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is pretty much a rip-off of The Shawshank Redemption (for some reason, they put Shawshanks into everything nowadays.) I think it's pretty much true, that people in prison are always the most miserable people. The acting is pretty good, so they tried to give him a bad-ass look.   I just don't like that movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A good movie (or series, or book) will never go out of style. The movie that makes you fall in love with the medium again and again is a great example of that.

This is the third in the series (and I'm not even sure if it has an ending) but I doubt that I will see it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I haven't seen "The Rocketeer" yet.  I was wondering if you were able to get a copy of this movie.  This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen.  It was really bad.   There were no scenes that made me laugh.  The characters weren't that likable.  Some of the characters didn't make any sense to me.  There was a lot of yelling.  My god.  Please tell me if I can see it again.  - Chris (11/12/04)  ______________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________ _________ ________________________________________ ___________________________________  "The Rocketters", also known as "The Wreckers"  There is a scene in this movie that is so incredibly stupid I can't even remember what it is. I think it has something to do with a character's brother having some kind of affair or something. Or maybe it was a character that didn't like their brother, and was trying to get back at him. Anyway, the film is about an astronaut named Jim Rockett, who is attempting to rescue his brother, who he loves. Jim is not very strong. He is a great pilot, but not great at landing the Rocketter. That is where "Rocketters" comes in. Rockett is an idiot. If you want to see something stupid with your popcorn, watch this movie, as soon as you can get it! - David (11, 12, 14, 20, 27, 28, 30, 32, 34)  that's really what happens when you take a group of idiots and put them together in a movie. - Chris "I've never seen anything so bad...and so stupid!" - Doug "I found this movie in a local video rental shop, at a time when video rentals were becoming scarce. I thought it looked a bit silly, so I decided to give it a go, and it took me all of 20 minutes to realize what was about to happen. The fact that this film is on the list just proves how much I hate it, and how much that is the case for a lot or the audience. This is a horrible movie, filled with stupidity, bad acting, and very low production values. As bad as it is, it still manages to top a film like "The Goonies", and I don't think any of us could ever forgive it." - Dave
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I am not going to watch this movie.   The plot revolves around the character named Darlene and the movie starts as she is in the hospital and goes home. The story is about a mother and her daughter who is born with an evil spirit of some kind and is also possessed. She is possessed with a demon called Kallan. She does not know how to fight it because she has no father. She gets a doctor who tells her to use a spell to get rid of it and the girl turns into a girl with two human sides. The movie tells the story of how she gets the powers of an angel and starts killing the evil spirit. It is just a rehash of the original fairy tale. I hope you can see it for what it is:  I can never stand these Disney movies.  There are not many reviews about this movie and its one of those movies that I can't write a bad one.  I guess it is about an evil witch and her girl who have been abducted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really don't like that movie.   " I don't know what that was about.  "   I am not a film buff and was disappointed.  It was a cheap looking movie. It was nothing special.   I like it for the time it was made.  I like to imagine the time a film was made for.    The idea was just a bit dated.  My son thinks that it was just because the movie was not that good.  The film was about a guy who is killed and his body is cut up.  I never knew that this was a thing,  that people would cut a man up.   He was a murderer, just in my head.  In the end, there is only a body and a bloody hand print on the wall.   The hand print was in the film and was shown all the way through the end.  There was never a mention of the real murderer or any motive.  This is an example of how people can be so naive.  So it was not a good movie.   It did not have a great script or a good director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It doesn't matter what a person does, whether they're a Christian or not, I believe in God, that's enough for me.   If I don't believe in something, then it doesn't mean I want nothing to do with it, I just won't waste my time with it.  When I do watch a film, I am always looking for what could be improved, but I will not tolerate something that I believe is harmful to others.  I have not seen the movie that inspired this review. I have, however, seen the trailers.  It is one of the worst films ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film "I, Daniel Blake" is so-so and the best part about it is "I think the worst part about this film was the movie itself" I was very disappointed, especially after I've seen some films from other greats (Hitchcock etc.) In summary:  I'm not a movie-goer but I'd like to go to see "I Daniel Blake," if I'm allowed to be. I'm sure it's not that good.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has nothing good to say about itself. It's just another boring movie about a group of people living a boring life who get in fights and do stupid things. It tries to be "cool" and makes a lot of stupid mistakes along the way. The plot is so contrived that it's not believable. The characters act like a bunch of morons and it makes it even worse. This movie has no redeeming features and will probably give you headaches after viewing it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so bad, that I cannot even recommend it. I wish I knew what a really good movie looks like before making that choice.

The story does have some good moments and a couple of really interesting things to think about, but overall, this is a bad film.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I watched this in theatres in late 2005, and I loved it. It was good. I also thought it was a bit corny, in terms of it not having a real story. I've heard it's a sequel, but I've seen the prequel. I don't care about the prequels. The main thing that's different is a lot of stuff in this movie is a parody of movies in general. There are a few things that don't hold up very well, but most of it is still funny and well executed. I remember one part of it where a lot was happening, and a few of the guys just stopped talking, and the girls didn't. It's pretty obvious the writers didn't know how to make it interesting. I think that's why it didn't work as a sequel. It doesn't need to be made into a movie. The original movie could stand alone as a movie by itself. I'm not sure I'll be seeing the sequel. I hope it's good.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I was first starting to take more seriously the idea of a "film" as a whole, I'd heard horror stories about bad movies being released by big studios, only to get "stolen" and released in some other country by some small independent studio. I'd always suspected that some of these foreign movies were not very good at all, but as I sat in a theater watching this, I couldn't believe it was a terrible film, despite the fact that it's about a guy in a Nazi concentration camp, forced to fight in a movie about the Nazi's, and then get taken hostage and forced to play the same role. It's an over-the-top, over-budgeted film that features a big number of actors and extras and a cast who's names I never remember. It also features a huge amount of dialogue, much of it in the same "whack-a-mole" style of dialogue used in bad American films. The first half hour is an amusing diversion as it sets up the whole thing and gives us an idea of what's going on. But as the movie progresses, the tension grows steadily worse, until we're forced to realize that they're setting up some kind of "crisis" and the whole movie was just a set-up. This film also seems to be heavily influenced by French films of the '60s and '70s, with a lot of references to the French Resistance (as it's a Nazi film), and is full of scenes from those films. I liked this film quite a bit. It was over-produced and pretty over-stylized (the movie even has a "movie set" section at one point that looks like it's from a war film), but it was good enough to earn a rating of four stars.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Don't feel too bad. You'll get used to it, as movies can be very positive and negative. In the worst cases, it is hard to watch a movie and not get annoyed by it. Sometimes you can only imagine what goes on behind the scenes, and you want to shake them to the ground and see what they are doing.   There's no doubt that in the past, a movie was made with a lot of thought, effort, and attention. It was very well-produced, the songs were great, the editing was perfect, and the actors were great. This makes it very hard to look back and feel disappointed. When we see a bad film today, though, we have no idea what went into making the movie, and we just assume that it will be no good. This can be a great movie to watch, as it will leave you wondering if they actually cared about the actors. There's so much effort put into making a film, that it almost comes off as amateurish, and in a way, it can be an honor.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I don't watch a lot of horror movies but this was so bad I have to be at least mildly ashamed of myself for not realizing what I was doing when I watched it."    This review may have to do with the fact that the movie is from the 80's, I believe it was a Halloween. I had to turn it off when I first saw it because I was horrified by the movie's portrayal of ghosts. This movie scared the shit out of me. I think there's a few things I wanted to comment about that this movie has, but couldn't because it was too scary for me. First of all, the ghost scenes were terrible! They were the only parts of the movie I didn't want to watch because I felt so bad for the people being made fun of!   Second, there were a couple of things about the movie that didn't make sense.   I guess that's a good thing in a horror movie because you have to believe in something that you can't actually see or hear! That's what I thought at the time.  Also, I don't understand why the ghost guy wasn't in the movie earlier, I would have liked to see how they solved that problem. It was pretty well explained in the end, but I didn?t understand it. This book has a lot to say about horror, it's an honest portrayal of a little girl that experiences a lot and learns to cope with her life.      If you liked this, you should read this book:      The Book:     If you enjoyed the book, you can purchase the original or the new edition. The original edition is $3.99, the new version is $2.99 The Review:  This book is a very informative and helpful book. The author went into depth about some of the more famous and scary movies that people think are scary. This was not a quick read, it took me about a week and a half to read this. It's not hard to understand a lot about scary movies, but it did make me question my own opinion of certain movies. I love horror, but if there's one movie I think everyone should watch, it?s this one.  I think most people who are scared of ghosts or witches or whatever shouldn't watch this movie!  This movie really is scary!  Overall, this book does a lot for the scary
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was so bad that I almost don't want to watch it. It's a good movie in a bad mood and the only reason I'm even going to say it's good is because it was on the list of "Top 15 Horror Films that Changed My Life" and I loved it. "The Shining" was a film that was written by Stephen King, directed by Stanley Kubrick, and starring Jack Nicholson. I'm so glad that it was released on DVD and Blu Ray so that people can see it, especially if they really like Stephen King. The story revolves around a man named Jack Torrance who is staying at an isolated cabin in the mountains with his girlfriend Wendy and her children. He finds out that a group of people has been living there for years, and it seems like he is one of them, so it's up to him to find out what is going on and get the hell out. One of the key elements of the film is the soundtrack that it has, and that's something that most people really don't know about the film. The soundtrack was composed by award-winning composer John Williams, who is responsible for the music of many films, and he does an amazing job in the film, but he is actually a huge Stephen King fan and has used some of his songs on the film as well, so I definitely recommend giving this movie a listen. Also, it's always great to check out a new Stephen King movie, especially one from his first film. This film is one that you really shouldn't miss. I would give this a 5/5 stars, but I can't because the audio was just terrible. If you're on the fence about this movie, I would definitely say that you should watch it just to see how the characters react to the music. But if you can't stand the audio, then the audio is just terrible and this is what I would have given a 4/5.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    That's me going full retard, but hey, I just got out of the army! I was in the Army for five years, and I love war! So, the military is all I really know, but it sure as hell isn't a bad thing!    I thought that this movie would be much better than it was, but then I saw a trailer of it, and realized that there were a lot of things wrong with it!  A bunch of the actors in this movie are fucking idiots!  I would hate to be a soldier in the army who thought that I would actually go through a movie called "Buckets of Fury" and be a part of it! The first half of the movie is filled with scenes that I just could not stand:     "He's not even going to have sex with me, I can tell!"  You are not supposed to be surprised if a girl is not interested in your penis!  This is a movie about a group of soldiers from WW1 (in Europe!) trying to take over Europe, so, they make the best of the situation. They have fun, kill people, and generally have a good time.   Then we get to the second half of this movie, where our soldier friend gets his dick cut off by a German sniper!  How is this possible, you say? That's not the best part of the film. Yes, I get that the sniper was trying to kill his friend (a fellow soldier) for no reason, but I can't understand how this guy thought that he could get away with it.  Why is he a sniper? Why does he have an M1 Carbine with him? Why is his gun on the ground next to him?   Is it supposed to make us think that this guy is a super soldier, or a coward? I mean, why didn't he try to run away? Why did he have his dick out? Why was he shooting at people at all?  I really don't know, and it makes me sad to think that they didn't put in as much effort into this movie as they should have!  The film is very "over the top".   They all have one thing in common, and that is that they are all idiots! They are all stupid! The movie is very slapsticky, and they all act like idiots and they don't realize that they're dumb. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A few weeks ago I watched a movie that I thought was really, really bad and it didn't suck. It's called The Exorcist.   I was in the right mood for it because it was so weird, and the film was such a bad one that I didn't really care. But even though I felt that I had no reason to dislike this movie, I decided I'd just wait until I could finish the DVD and get some closure. I was right.   At about 6:15 in, we meet our first demon, played by Kevin Bacon. He looks like the real deal, and he's really, REALLY pissed at the doctor, because that doctor has just killed his best friend, and that friend had a lot to do with all of this. I can't remember the exact line that Bacon says, but I do remember that it's some very, very, really, very good lines from the movie, and even though the scene is so short, it's still great. You can imagine the movie has been in the editing room for a while, and Bacon's acting and directing is a lot of fun.  The next demon that appears is another character from the original film, played, of course, by James Earl Jones. He's a little more serious about what he's saying now than he was in his previous appearance. The demon we see in this film is played by none other than the same guy who played the demon in the original movie.  He's still really, good, of the same great style that you would expect.  If you're like me and didn't like the film at the time, and were in the mood to see something other than badness, this might be worth a watch.  The DVD is available for sale at www.vigot.com/cinema/the-exorcist-disc-2. If you have questions, please leave a comment. I would love to hear from anyone who had watched this movie at the cinema.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A little more than half of these movies are pretty bad, so my comment about the quality of the film does not apply. It is just a pity that the actors do not deliver a good performance in these movies. But the films of Soderbergh are a rare kind of a movie. This film has no plot and a very poor acting, but it is a rare thing that a movie makes us think in a different way and it is certainly a movie that makes us admire all of S. Soderberyghs talent. So my comment does not mean that this film is not worth watching, but just that Soderbergs film does it's job by telling a great story. So I would advise that you do not expect a great acting in this film. The movie is very slow, it is not a good movie and it could be an excellent movie if the acting in the movie had a lot more presence. So, if you like slow movies then you could probably find some good things in this movie, and you will be satisfied with this movie even if you feel that the acting is very bad. This movie is a great masterpiece, it has great acting, great music, and it does not even disappoints. So just try to find some time to watch this great movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am still wondering how this happened. I love this movie and have it on my shelf with all of the other wonderful sci fi and horror movies I own.   The plot for this movie was a very easy to follow and even some of the bad actors are a bit of a hit or miss for me. I think that maybe I saw this a few times as a kid and just knew it was a good movie but never paid much attention to it again.  But I think it gets a pass because it was so well made and has a great soundtrack to go with it.      This movie was released in 1993 and is based on the book series by C.S. Forester. Foresters novels are set in the distant future and have a lot of great action packed scenes.  This movie is not the greatest and I personally do not care for it. But it is fun as all hell to watch.  I really enjoyed this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story, if you have not watched this movie, is about the "Pentagon Papers" case. The movie has a very strong political point and is pretty well told, especially if you do not want to watch it. The cast of characters are mostly interesting as well and the direction and writing makes it a great film. There is not much plot so you will watch it once and then you can watch something else. There are some people who like to watch movies about people "being attacked" and if that is your thing, you might enjoy this movie.   Posted by bmaz at 10:13 AM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The script was boring and predictable and the main character (played by Robert Forster) was completely without personality. He had no real motivation or drive to do what he was doing.   I would have preferred a more interesting movie because for this reason I gave it a -1/2.  I am a big fan of the film and it deserves a "perfect 10". I do believe I will revisit this movie for sure and see if the film gets any better.  - Rating: -1 - 1.5 - 1/2 1) The Darkest Mind (2005) 2) In the Land of Blood and Honey (1964) 3) The Silence of the Lambs (1991) 4) The Matrix Revolutions (1999) 5) The Thing from Another World (1951) 6) The Stand (1983) 7) The Seven Samurai (1954) 8) The Seventh Seal (1958) 9) The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1978) 10) The Unforgiven (1992) 1.  My first film and one of my favorite movies in my entire movie-watching life.  2. The ending is so well-done and so well executed.  3. The film was one of the first movies that taught me how to really enjoy the thrill of the chase scene and was a huge inspiration for me.  4.  The acting is fantastic in this movie. I've seen many great films, and even some not so great films with amazing acting, and yet it was the acting of the "Birds" that made this movie stand out.  5.  It's a wonderful film to watch if you ever get the chance to watch it.  6.  You should definitely not watch this with your kids, they'll hate it.   7.  This movie can go as low as a 5/10 if you like a little more than pure horror.  8.  I'm not sure if this movie deserves a perfect 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When we first heard the trailer for American Sniper, we thought this movie was awesome. This guy is a sniper, so he is a guy that is probably pretty good at his job. And he gets shot in the head. And his family and friends are freaking out. We were so excited for the movie. After we watched the movie, we were like, "Oh, no, not another movie where a character dies." It's not like that happened in the other movies we saw either, it's not a very interesting plot, so we were all left with a sour taste in our mouths. The acting was alright, they didn't have anyone that really stood out like Bradley Cooper, or the rest of the actors in the movie did. It was a solid movie, but a lot of it is just repetitive. If you are looking for a good movie, you will probably find one in this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My son has a soft spot for the Pixar films and it was no surprise that he was very excited for Cars 3. While he is a little spoiled by the Disney Animated flicks, his initial reaction to Cars 3 was mixed, but after a few minutes of Cars 3, he was excited, even if the film wasn't exactly great. After the first 15 minutes of the movie, you know that Cars 3 is going to be a classic because it does everything right and makes you believe that they had the time and money to do it justice. The characters, the cars, the set pieces, the storyline, everything about this movie just flows perfectly. My son was totally hooked and would have been happy with this film even if it didn't have the highest rating. It really just worked. Now the film does have some bad writing. There are two parts of the film where they show how amazing the cars are, then after that they show a few scenes where people talk about how great the cars used to be, and after that there are a few more scenes where the characters talk about the cars. It's hard for a children's film to not use cliches. While I understand this could have been done better, the cliched lines were mostly there to make you laugh and give the kids something to laugh at. The main issue was the lack of action. Yes, there was lots of racing and the race tracks look really nice. But it didnít really get that excited about the movie. I donít know if I would recommend this to my daughter. If she really wants to see a Cars movie, she can go to Disney, she is a Disney girl and will love it. This film was more of a nostalgia piece for the younger generation that loves the Cars series. I would definitely recommend this for your daughters or anyone that wants a quick Cars fix. I know it's not Pixar, but they didníve really done the original justice. I give it a B+
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Why not just be like the rest of the "friends" on the Internet? They hate everything:     In the past, I would say that the Internet is the worst thing to ever happen to movies. It's a wonderful place to talk shit, be lazy, and waste the time of people who do everything they can to actually make a good film.   Then one of these people shows up, and takes a lot of that shit from me.  It's so funny, I don't even know what else to say.  They call him "Dr. Nerdlove." He really is a nice guy. He made a very good film, and he made it in his own garage.  He's always doing research. He has a bunch of stuff for "The Fantastic Mr. Fox," and he just keeps posting things.  I mean, this is a dude who gets people to post on his blog about how he's trying to figure out who the actual killer of Scarlett Johansson's character in "The Amazing Spider-Man 2" is.  And all of this is before he even has a trailer for his movie. I don'T think it's a coincidence that this guy is the only one in Hollywood who cares about his movie (not that he doesn't have some very famous friends, but I don;t think they're going to be in the movie), and all of them are all "friends."   He was very helpful, but he also told me a bunch about what was wrong with the film, which I never expected from a friend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had high hopes for this movie. This is one of those movies that you see and think "that's fun" but really it is just a poor movie. It doesn't take long to realize that. The story follows a couple who get stranded on an island and the whole story takes place in a couple's bathroom. The whole time I was thinking, "what did they think was going to be a story here?" I understand why the movie was made. It is supposed to be funny but the movie really gets worse and worse as it goes. I had to go through a lot of different versions of this movie just to get it to make sense. This movie really takes a long time to get going because they make up a bunch of jokes that never get used. I am sure that the first draft of this script was just a joke, but once I saw it, I was like, "I can't believe this is supposed a movie about the toilet". The movie starts off with a character named Dave who is a good guy that has just met a girl named Michelle. Their meeting is interrupted by a bad guy named Gary who is really bad for a short time but ends up becoming good. We meet some other characters who are not very good but end up becoming likeable (one is called Dave's friend who is just there to talk and he does). By the time it is the guy named Dave's turn, he has to go up against another bad guy. It starts off alright and Dave is trying to convince the bad guy to join the good guys. He is not the only bad guy but there is more bad guys in this movie than the one that we meet in the movie. Some of the bad guys have big teeth. The first part of this story isn't all that bad but at some point in the story, there is a moment when we see this horrible looking monster. This monster is scary. He has teeth, big feet and claws and a snake for a body. At this point, the bad things seem to be following this monster. They are even taking his form. I don't know if that was a coincidence or if that is what the author wanted to show us. They keep trying to scare us and it just never works. I guess I am just saying that the movie isn't very good. The only reason this movie is rated a 7.5 is because the sex is good but it is mostly just bad.  Movie Recommendation: 1
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like, the actors who played it are amazing. And I liked it and it didn't make me think "oh man I can't believe they are that bad". I'm like "wow this is amazing!"  I'm watching it and like I really want to watch this movie more. It's really the best movie I've seen this year.   Now.  I know some people hate this movie. But I think some people like this movie too, but hate all the other bad movies and I think I might like this one.  If you haven't seen this one, get it.  I think you will enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What are you going to do?   You should know how to write an excellent review, too!   It's a good thing that you're now a film critic!  You don't need to sit down and write an "excellent review" if the movie sucks.  I have never seen a movie that did not suck.  It has been a while since I have seen a "bad movie".  It was always a movie I wanted to be in and watch.  Movies are supposed to entertain us, that's why I buy them.  I was always fascinated by movies.  They were always different from what I was used to and that fascinated me.   Movies were supposed to be entertaining to me.   And they did that.   They had so many different movies in them, that I never knew what to expect.   I'm not talking about the obvious movies that we see in movies, where we can see a car crash or an airplane.  Those are more boring than anything and should not be considered as a movie.    There was always some good movie for me to watch, some funny movie for my kids to enjoy and some movie where it really was a journey.   In this book there are so many amazing movies that I can't choose just one!  All these are movies I will remember in the future.   It is only a matter of time before they'll all be movies that make me say "Wow!"  My wife has seen all of these movies, and she told me she still has them in a stack in our closet.  The more she talks about them the more I want to see them.   Maybe someday I'll have the chance to go and see them all.   Some of these are great movies.   One of the first movies I watched when I was growing up was The French Connection.  The film shows a police officer who is following a bad guy and has to save some other cops in the process.  He is one of the most fascinating characters and is an amazing actor.   That movie has remained a favorite of mine and I am glad I have it in my collection!  The French Criention is a wonderful movie about a police detective trying to stop a murder of a prostitute in order to bring her killer to justice.  A good movie about cops trying to catch a killer.  One of my favorite films is The Big Sleep.  This was my first
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the most fun shows I've seen, this was an experiment and a challenge, it was something new and innovative that got a lot right.  I also liked the idea of a "horror movie" (aside from some "scary clowns" and "cannibalism") and I thought this was a fun show to watch. Heidi: I've had no problems with the show. I love the concept of it. A series where someone (A) is an evil genius, (B) has to go undercover (I guess in his own home) to do evil things. (C) In order to be undercover he has to have the perfect appearance. (D) Also, a family gets a visit from a "good cop", and he has a family. It is very, very clever. The acting was great, the jokes were funny, the animation was great. It was a lot of fun. The concept is genius and the execution is perfect. The story is clever as well. The ending was a bit of a shock. It also made for a good Halloween episode. But in the end, it's not really the best of the series. It's not too bad, but it's a bit more lighthearted than most of the other shows in the genre. Here's a spoiler about the finale:  The finale was good, it had a good hook, it gave an answer to some of the questions and then a cliffhanger. It didn't break the fourth wall all that much, but at the same time it didn't try to.

It was like a horror movie with a bunch of actors in it and they looked terrible. It's too bad because there was a great story. But the acting was awful and the movie seemed to drag on forever.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I know there's nothing wrong with a bad film (like The Wolfman), but I don't see this as a good movie (despite its shortcomings, of course).   It lacks the polish and attention to detail that's so crucial in a film like this.   If there was just a little more editing, a little less slapstick and a little tighter acting, and a bit more tension, it would have been a much better film.  But in its present state, it's a muddled mess.  And if you think this is a parody, you're dead wrong.  While the parody does have some points that could be parodied, I don't think it's as funny as it seems to be at first.  This is a movie made by people who really know their business, so what you're getting is some excellent satirical humor.  I'm just sorry it doesn't work as well as it looks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The biggest problem that The Avengers had was its ending. This is something that has plagued every comic book movie since the 90's. I don't understand why these comic book movies get a pass in comparison to movies that just try to make a fun movie, but the Marvel movies are not doing that. All the Marvel films end with the villain either being defeated or captured. The problem is not that this is a problem, it is just that it seems to be part of the Marvel universe. I can't imagine how a movie like Ant-Man ending with an Avengers team member being captured by the bad guys is going to work. Also, this isn't even an issue with the superhero movie that has come out in the past three years, but Captain America: The Winter Soldier. That film was even worse in that regard. The Winter Solider had to go on the run for three films before he was captured. In every case, the hero had to sacrifice himself to save the world, but The Avengers only did it in two cases. I believe it would have made a better movie if they had a villain who was only really good at his job. However, we'll never know what happened to Loki or Black Widow in Avengers. I don't even know why Captain America 2: The First Avenger was so popular. It was the same film with the same story that Avengers, but there was a huge difference in the quality of the movie. The movie started off with a giant fight between the heroes and a bunch of bad guys. Then it goes into an amazing chase scene, but then the heroes don't fight back. This was a movie that had already had a big payoff. I liked Captain America 1 : The First Hero, but the sequel is so terrible that I couldn't wait to see the first movie again.    The Avengers: Age of Ultron is an excellent movie. You won't find a bigger crowd of characters and you will have a lot more action. All in all, it's a great movie. It had all the good parts and no parts that sucked. You can't fault it for its quality. But it doesn't matter because it is bad. I just wish the movies that came after Age ofUltron didn't have so many flaws like this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So after reading some of the reviews of "The Conjuring 2" and "The Purge: Anarchy," and the "Punch-Drunk Love" review, I was ready to write a negative one. Not because I found the movie bad; I did. But because it had a completely different plot from the one of the movie I liked, and the main characters in it were completely different. It was more like a horror movie and the whole thing was just about one family that was getting attacked by a monster from another dimension (in the first movie, that was a ghost).   I found it quite boring and did not feel any adrenaline. I was not in the mood for horror anymore after seeing "The Exorcism" and wanted a different movie to scare me with.   The only time I got excited for a movie was when the actors were talking about the things they were afraid of and the scary things they could do to a creature.  The second movie had more gore, and it was not scary at all. I even had a hard time watching it because it was a different plot than the first. The new characters were not as memorable as the characters from the first film.  It was just a normal horror movie. So after seeing all of that, I gave this movie a 4/10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     A movie where the script has no idea what it's doing:  The characters are written for a non-dramatic reason:  (It's just the most annoying thing in the world. It's all about making them look good. It works really well for some movies, but this was just too good.)  The acting was bad and they wasted a good actor for nothing:    When a movie has no dialogue it becomes a story about two people talking and telling a story without words. It looks like something that could have been a cartoon.  When the plot is not explained in the film, it makes the plot feel like a cartoon:  Because there is no explanation to the plot in the movie, you can't really tell what's going on or how it relates to the main story. Because it's non-sequitur (like in a game) it makes it look like it's a game. Because of this it looks like a movie. Because this is what it looks and sounds like, the main storyline and characters can be explained. However, this still makes it seem like a game that you just played, the story is a movie that you did not. "If you don't like the story then you will not enjoy the movie" is a saying that has to be the most stupid statement in the history of film making. Yes, this is a bad film. Yes the story sucks. But if you don.t like a story you will never enjoy a movie made by that director.     So that's it. My rating of this movie is:  2/10 If you are going to watch a bad script, watch the other three bad scripts. The badness of this one is just too overwhelming.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The main reason that I didn't really like The Hunger Games is that I really didn't care for Katniss Everdeen (Elizabeth Banks), a.k.a. Katnist, an incredibly hot person who's been through a lot to become the most powerful and feared leader in all of Panem. In the opening scene, Katnish is talking with the governor of her district, played by Josh Hutcherson (who should never be playing anything, because even if he is good in a movie, his face is never really the most interesting part of his body), and he asks her what she wants in life. Kat's response, "My life," is the biggest joke ever. She doesn't want anything but power and respect. And what do you do if you want to be respected by other people? I don't think she means that you just want to have power. There is no reason for her to be able to just want respect when she doesn't know how to earn it. It's one of the worst things a person can do, and I really dislike that. I wish she would stop trying to be like that. The other thing that I don' t like is how she treats the people around her. Everytime she talks to someone she talks down to, it seems like she is only trying to show them how powerful she is. She isn't, of course, and that makes me very unhappy about the characters in the book. There are lots of other characters in this movie, but the majority of them are really dull. It would be interesting to see the movie with a full cast of characters, because all the characters are very dull. And I think it would have been even worse, because it's impossible to make any character interesting. I also have this problem with the whole Districts thing. It feels like a huge plot device that makes no sense to me. This is what a District looks like: And this is what someone in a District would look like. People in District 12 are really skinny, which isn't really fair, because they do look very strong. People from District 13 look very unhealthy. People are really short. People have very thick eyebrows, which is stupid. People wear black or beige, and this is also ridiculous. I don t think the Districts were really necessary in this book. It could have easily just had all the people in Panem live on the same district. And in Panems, a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      This movie sucks. The first half is the most annoying and ridiculous parts. It is made in a very amateurish way. The writer can't spell or write the words properly. The dialogue is not professional. The director is not able to follow a plot line. The actor is not a professional. So what? This is an action-drama and there are many action-oriented movies. The action in this movie is absolutely insane. The movie is an excuse to show the hero going crazy. The bad guys are so over-the-top and ridiculous and the hero is so weak and worthless. In my opinion the movie is so ridiculous and fake and not a good movie. The main character is so worthless that he doesn't even deserve to be the main character. This movie is for kids and it's very obvious that the director just took this from a kids cartoon. I give it only 3 out of 10 because it does start with a good start and ends with a very bad finish.    …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What you're saying is that it sucks.  That's not fair!   That's what the movie should be:    The story of how a bunch of teenagers spend the evening in a seedy New Jersey strip club.   "Whoopsie-doo-dah-doh-doy!"   Then again, the movie is actually a very pretty one.  And we get a shot of this beautiful girl dancing:  The rest of the movie follows the story of the kids, who are a motley group, made up of a couple of girls and a boy.  They all have their own personal struggles and issues.  The only one who is "perfect" (and that's a big if) is a pretty girl, played by the pretty-faced (and, frankly, attractive) Marisa Tomei.  There are a couple more girl characters, who come across as somewhat stupid, but I'm sure they're more complex than this and probably would have been a lot more fun to watch.  For the most part, the characters are interesting, although I do feel that there are a few things that could have been done differently in order to make the film a lot better.  One thing that I really liked was that we don't hear what the kids are saying, because it would just get ridiculous.  I know, because I would have had no choice in the matter.  If you didn't watch the movie with subtitles, I highly suggest that you go back and look at the subtitles!   Here's an excellent YouTube review  (The link is on the sidebar)  which discusses a few of the major themes of the film.  Here's a link to a video of Marisa speaking about her character and how they were brought up.  And this is from an interview she did with Entertainment Weekly, which I strongly recommend reading if you haven't seen the movie.  In fact, it's worth watching the interview, which is great, if you don't have the DVD.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched all of the movies in this series and I must say that none of them are good. I was really hoping to see a remake of this movie with all the CGI.   It was a really bad movie.  It didn't make any sense to me, the way the story was told and how the characters were written. I thought they could have done something better with all of this. I would recommend this movie to only those who want a cheap, cheap laugh.

This is probably one of my all time favorite movies.  A fun and action packed film, I thought it would be a bit boring. That's why I loved this movie. There was so much action that it took me a while to catch up on the storyline. It was a good idea and executed. This film was a lot of fun, especially the scene in the desert that I won't spoil.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     - You know what you're in for.  Why are the main characters so damn boring and uninteresting?   If I had been given the choice of three different movies, I would choose: - The Devil Wears Prada (2007) - The Social Network (2010) - All About Steve (2009). The Devil's in the Details is a terrible movie in every way. There are two scenes which are incredibly boring. The first scene starts off with a guy taking a shower. The guy asks the girl how he should do it and the girl says, "Just leave it on." A few moments later, she asks the guy if he wants to go. He says he does and then she says, ""Okay, so you've already left it on?" The guy says yes and then it cuts to another girl talking on her cell phone. They have a couple of "jokes" which don't even make sense and just end up being a couple random bits of dialogue. The second scene is when the guys are in a restaurant and there is another girl on the other side of the table and one of them says, "$12.99, no tip." After some conversation, the guy says, $12.95, no gratuity." The girl says that the price is wrong and then the guys say, "Do you want fries?" Then the waitress comes over and says, you want the big burger?" After that scene, I was so bored I just left. I can't explain it any better than that. The movie ends with a "Wish" which isn't even good and was written by someone who doesn't even know how to write a sentence, but is so lazy it's laughable.   The worst part about this movie is that it has everything: some good action, some bad action, good dialogue, bad dialogue, a girl in a short dress with an accent, a man with his nose cut off, and a man in a suit with a big gun.  There are a couple really bad scenes here and there, but all of them are at the beginning and end. It is all so unnecessary. I was bored out of my mind and the dialogue was so incredibly lame. If you have a hard time following a plot in a movie, the best thing to do is just stop watching, then go watch something else.   - You're too old for this shit.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     "You can do what you want."  By David J. W. Dyer  A movie with the audacity to have a hero, not a villain, a man who fights evil, a hero who defeats evil, is a great hero.  John Wayne is, and probably always will be, one of the greatest movie stars of all time. He's had an impact on so many other greats as well. But he also, like the rest of us, has his flaws. As I watched him work his way through World War II, I came to see his true self, and I came away with a new appreciation for his acting. 's character is a classic example of what we see every day on the screen. John Wayne is a hero without a story, and he doesn't need to be. He can embody a hero or a villain. He just needs to be himself. That's the kind of hero we need right now.  (Photo: John Wayne at the 1936 world's fair)  The Greatest Movie Heroes of All Time  With this in mind, I wanted to take a look at the greatest movies about heroes, and in the process make a case for what I see as one of my favorite actors, and arguably my favorite human being, in movie history.  I began my project by breaking down the top five movies about heroic characters:  1. The Wizard of Oz (1939)  of course: It's the Wizard of OZ, and it's just a movie about a boy going through life. But it's also a film about the relationship between boy and man. The boy is Dorothy, a naïve, sweet child who's constantly looking for a way to better himself, but who is ultimately rescued by a witch who gives her a purpose and makes her a better person. , a brilliant, dark, magical world in which Dorothy and her companions must struggle and solve the mysteries of the Emerald City. Saving the world with Dorothy is one of movie history's great heroic moments. It's a moment that changed the movie industry, and made the story of The Wizard an enduring symbol of hope. But what makes the movie great isn't its story, but its performance: In addition to being one of Hollywood's greatest performers of all-time, Judy Garland was the movie's most accomplished voice. She would go on to make dozens of Oscar-nominated and Golden Globe-nomine
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really liked this movie, though, I have a few problems with it. 1. The movie has an odd plot, I don't know how to describe it well. But, it's not that weird. The thing is that all of the main characters were basically doing the same thing, so the movie was kinda boring, except that I think it was meant to be more interesting. 2. There are too many deaths in this movie. When something happens that should be tragic, it is, instead of showing the effect of the death (which could have been done without the deaths). 3. The villain's henchmen were really irritating. The henchman with the gun was a big nuisance, especially because it was a bad scene, but I really thought the gun shot was a little too strong. 4. The music was kind of... I don´t know what you should call it, "dorky". This movie made me think about the good and bad things about music. It made me wonder if it was "good" or "bad". 5. And then there was the ending. It was just weird. I don`t know why I watched it. Maybe because the ending made me really sad or maybe because it made me laugh. I honestly don` t know. All I know is that it was funny. 6. So this movie was really, really, REALLY annoying. But that`s really all I have to say about it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has some good scenes that are fun and a few bad scenes. The scenes where the kids are being mean to each other are hilarious. The first scene when the girls are arguing about who's a better mom is really funny. The second scene when they make a fake mom out of the "real mom" was a good idea but the ending made it seem like it was a cheap joke. There were also scenes where they were all alone but they could still laugh. It's an adventure film with some great characters, even though the mom was kind of annoying.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Just because it is a bad, it is not a negative. Just because it sucks is not as important.   If you're gonna write an angry review about it, write an even more angry review.  Just because you did not enjoy it:      In general, there are no "bad" movies.  If there was an easy way to make movies bad (and I don't mean the simple way of saying that the actors/actresses were bad or the script was bad) they would have been released many times already.  They would all have been awful anyway, the only way to mess up is to make a really bad movie.  The movies that are "bad", aren't bad because of the movie making process. They are bad because the movies suck. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like a bad song I'd like to get into your head, for just a moment, I just want to talk to you about one particular movie.   For those of you who don't know, the movie is 'Fatal Attraction'.   One of the main characters in the movie, a beautiful woman named Jenny McCarthy, is involved in an unfortunate accident.  What is unfortunate is that Jenny's father (an ex-priest) and aunt (a nun) don't even know.  When he does, they're horrified.  While they don't tell him exactly what happened, he gets a letter from an "anonymous source" that Jenny has been killed.  The father and aunt then drive to the accident scene, only to discover that the woman is not alive.  As a final desperate attempt to save his daughter, the father is about to give his life for Jenny, when he's interrupted by a policeman.  (The film has this great scene where the policeman tries to save the girl, and we see that he has no clue what he's doing.  He pulls his gun out, draws his own pistol, and tries to shoot himself in the head as he dies.  No matter what he does or where he goes, he will never know what happened to Jenny McCarthy. )  The ending of the movie really makes me angry.  In a final bid to save her, the man shoots himself in a suicide attempt, but he's shot in the neck, and dies. The policeman, meanwhile, is saved by a stranger who rescues him from the cop.  After a while, the two men fall asleep, and the stranger (who is an old schoolmate of the man's) wakes them up.  By the time we get back to the movie itself, everyone has decided they're going to see it again.  Even the policeman who shot himself has been convinced that he will now become a famous movie star.  This movie made me feel a lot of things.  First of all, it is a film about a young woman who doesn't know her own self-worth, and is the object of a terrible and tragic accident.   Secondly, it's about a man who is trying to make things right for his girlfriend's sister, but his effort is unsuccessful, and he spends the rest of his life regretting it.   Thirdly, it reminded me of a lot things that I'm still trying to

(Starred review:  Starred reviews:  -   Starred review -  - Starred reviews -   ...the movie is a very well-made and enjoyable horror movie.  The film was well paced and I found myself thinking about how I'd feel if my mom was in the house while we watched it, and how it was a perfect opportunity for me to see what it's like to feel a certain way about a person I don't have any personal relationship with.  The film has a very creepy atmosphere that is well balanced with some very creepy music.    The cinematography and lighting were very impressive for a film of its age.    There were some great set pieces in this film, and a little homage to the classic Hammer horror films.  There were plenty of gags in the film, including some great ones, and the film would definitely appeal to anyone who likes a good laugh.    I enjoyed this film a lot and was glad to see that it's now a part of the horror library.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     - " The bad reviews for "Django Unchained" are not bad reviews. They are merely reviews of the movie's subject matter, which is a violent, sexualized, brutal, violent, gory, brutalistic film. People are outraged at some of the things that happen. People have made their opinions known. In other words, the film makes people feel the way they feel, without being overly explicit about it, without trying to make it seem cool or sexy. It's a very honest, very straightforward film that makes it very clear what people are thinking, what people feel, what is happening.   - "D.J. is a man who is going through a very hard time and he's been through a lot more than I have." - George Clooney on Django Unchained.  - The New York Times critic 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember when I was 10 and my dad took me to see this movie on the drive home from his college. My mom was on the phone with him. He told me what the story was and how the girls were in trouble, he didn't mention that he knew their mother. This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. They got the girl drunk, she got raped and the dude was supposed to save her. She couldn't get him out of the car, the cops caught up to them, and then they drove away. Now when I saw the sequel, I realized why this movie was so awful. I loved the first film.   The movie has a "pitch black" feel to it. There is a feeling of doom and doom like a black hole that sucks you into. I have to believe that whoever wrote this film didn't understand what a dark film was. And I hate how the movie gets to where it is.  I didn't like this movie.  A few of the girl's names I can't remember, but I did not like this film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The Last Airbender, for me, was a completely terrible movie. For those of you who don't know, The Last airbender, is a book written by Michael Dante DiMartino. DiMartinino was the guy who wrote the screenplay for the movie, which was directed by Peter Chan. Di Martino was also the guy that produced the movie and the book. The book was really good and it has some very interesting themes. But this movie ruined it. I would've given it three or four stars if it was all that good. The script was terrible, and the character design was terrible. The dialogue was terrible and the acting was terrible; the script was bad but the characters were awful. I'm not going to talk about the story of the movie. There's a very good story to tell in the book, but this film didn't tell that story, and it just made it worse.     The plot of the film was the story that was told in the comic books, which were written by Bryan Konietzko. The plot was that a prince was born to a princess and they fight over the throne. The whole movie is about that. The princess gets kidnapped and she comes to a giant city called the spirit world. The spirit world is like the middle earth. It's like an alternative world to the earth, but it's not earth. The movie just made me want to watch the movie with headphones and not to watch it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched "My Mother's Son" on VHS when I was 10 years old, but I never watched it again. It's a very old movie, but the acting and story are pretty funny, and that's what I liked most about it. It is about a young boy who has had to give up on his dreams of becoming a hero after an accident takes away his legs, leaving him an invalid. The film is about his search for his mother's son, who has become a hero in the world of sports and the military. The cast of actors are pretty good. The production values are high, though. It looks quite nice for an 80's movie, though not the most beautiful film in the series.  The main plot:  This film is really about the young boy's search for the man who has been his hero his whole life.   The story involves the boy's father who has moved out to the countryside to live alone and he has a very poor wife who doesn't understand him at all. The boy also spends a lot of time with his friends, who also have their own problems. There are also a couple of other minor characters who play supporting roles, though you wouldn't notice them in the end, because they don't really matter much.  The plot is pretty slow, and at times is pretty dull. It doesn't take long before the boy finally finds his father's son and the story really gets going. The son and his friends all spend the movie watching old war films, and the boy even gets to see a very bad film.    I found the ending pretty confusing and I didn't understand a lot. The ending did give the film a very good "happy ending", but at the same time it leaves me a little confused.  As far as the story is concerned, it is fairly interesting and the writing is pretty good, although sometimes you have to pay a little more attention to it than others.  I enjoyed this movie a lot, but not as much as "My Sister's Keeper" because I was just too old at the time. But I still would like to see the others. If you have the time, it would be a good idea to watch this one.  I would give this movie an 8 out of 10.

A-   It's the film version of an old story.  I'm sure it's a good story, but it's nothing special.  The book is the best part of this movie, and it's pretty enjoyable.  This isn't really a bad film, but if you love classic ghost stories and don't like ghost stories that follow people in the past, it might not be for you.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   .   What should we say when we see a movie and are not entirely in love with it?   Should I be polite?  Should the movie be made into a film?  What do I think the movie is going to be like?  Is this a good movie for young or old?  Do I need a little sleep?  Why should I get so excited to see the movie?  Am I the only one who likes this movie? Should I call the owner? Should he call me?  And so on and so on.   Do not judge the movie by the critics.  A bad movie is not a movie about "bad"   But a movie with an ugly ending, bad acting, bad story, or bad music.  I am a fan of this movie but I would not recommend it to others.  This is a pretty bad movie.  The actors did not act very well.  If the movie was about a woman in love, there would be no problem.  However, the character was too self centered and the movie ends with a bad ending.  It will make you cry.  Do you hate me?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "My friend and I were watching 'I Saw the Devil' on television and decided to watch it together. We both saw how it was over the top and over acted, and so when we walked out we both just wanted to go home. This film is one of those films that will not hold your attention." - Anonymous, USA "I saw this movie on television a long time ago. I don't think anyone who is not familiar with the book will enjoy this film. In all fairness to the writer, I was under the impression that the film had some of the same elements as the book. It is nothing like the book, but has a few elements from it, mostly an over the Top nature. The only one in my opinion is the fact that they used a live monkey for the title character (that was a shock to everyone I met.) But even that was a big let down, as I did not realize a monkey would be used. The rest of the film was pretty over the-top and completely ridiculous. I just wished the film would have been a bit more subtle about what was really happening." - James, USA
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say, this movie was a B-Movie. The plot was a complete farce. This was made on a budget of only $5 million dollars, and they had to write and/or direct a movie that was in such bad shape.    It was a total clusterfuck of the worst sort of films.  The entire movie is one long train wreck.  This movie is the worst of the year, and I'm not a big fan of the genre.  The dialogue in this movie is just about every bad Hollywood movie ever made.  And the effects look like they were done on a Commodore 64.  In short, this film was not worth the time it took to watch it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    And for a movie like this you should say something about how the people in charge of writing this screenplay are just a bunch of morons.   A bad movie is a movie that doesn't really tell you what to expect. A good movie is one that makes you think and even some of the plot twists can be very interesting.  There are many flaws in this movie. The acting is very poor. The plot is a mess. The special effects in this are awful.  The ending is the worst I have seen in a movie. It takes about an hour and half just to figure out what happens.  One of the things I hate in a film is when they make a scene look longer than it really is. This happens a lot in this film. The pacing is also very slow. The ending doesn't make sense and the ending is a slap in the face to the audience.  I really wanted more.  This movie is too long.  Overall, I give this a 4.5 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (if it were a film review, you'd get an extra point here)  "The Devil's Advocate" is a movie which deserves better than it gets. It's a movie that has a lot of potential, but the only thing that makes it good is that it's a comedy. The plot of "The Devil Advocate" makes a lot more sense if you know how bad "Mulholland Drive" and "The Room" are, and it is a very good movie with great acting, great visuals, and a wonderful script (which is why I rated it 8.5). The acting is pretty good for a comedy, and the direction is spot on. The only thing I don't like is the music, which seems to have been recorded in an area where the only available studio is a studio which sounds like it was recorded by someone who used to work at "Vancouver Sound Studio". I also don't care much for the dialogue, and I haven't found any really funny jokes. So for me, "The Advocate" will only ever be a movie with potential, and then it will just be "a comedy".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You might be surprised how many terrible movies you can find at this price.   Some may still be a decent watch if you can overlook the fact that the filmmakers weren't careful enough to include any decent story elements.  The fact that this is a family-oriented movie, makes the movies quality an even bigger question mark.  To make matters worse, a movie that features such a low budget and a movie about a kid that likes to steal other kids toys (which is actually a lot of fun for kids) is a really bad movie, that is also an insult to those who believe in good stories.  I guess that the movie was actually supposed to be an educational short, but the story just didn't work.  Overall:  There are some decent movies in the library, but some of them should be avoided for their low quality and for being boring as hell.  I really don't have much of a problem with this movie.  It was very interesting, but didn't have the best quality. The story was very lame.  There were no original characters in this movie, which is very disappointing.  When I read the synopsis, I expected something like, "An overweight kid steals other kids' toys to keep his stuffed animal company in business."  But I was completely disappointed.  This movie was really awful.  If you want a funny movie, then you can always check out The Big Green and the Little Pink.  But for a movie with a plot like this, I feel that they should have gone with a more original movie. I would love to see this movie in a different format. So here's the trailer:  Here's the video: I don't know why the producers chose to give me a crappy review for this movie...maybe the director felt sorry that a kid was spending his free time stealing other kids stuff and they felt like giving a shitty review to an adult?  This is the one and only reason I gave this movie a 1 instead of 5. I gave it 2 out of 5 stars for the first few minutes, but once you get to the middle the movie goes downhill fast.   For the most part I don't regret buying it.  In fact I'll probably buy it again at some point and give it a lower score.  Some of my friends and I enjoyed it, but I couldn't give it more than a 2 because it was just so boring and terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had seen the preview of the movie in the local theatre and I thought it was a fun, silly comedy. It wasn't.   The movie was horrible.  One of the main characters was an annoying, irritating, annoying, self-centered little fuck who constantly has to be rescued by his sidekick (who in this case was actually a chick). There was a lot of bad acting and a lot bad jokes. And all of this was with the actors in one scene. It is not a good movie to watch in one sitting.  I will not waste my time on the movie: No no no, don't even give them an   It is called a  movie, after all.  I am going to give a summary of the plot and a little bit of the dialogue. The whole movie was a set up to get the main character, Billy Bob, the love of his life, Wendy.  She is not the love interest, she is just there as a love interest and a helper. The main character is the main hero, he is Billy Bob. In this film, he must save Wendy from a group of bandits. It takes a bit of courage to even try and save her, as she is a beautiful and rich woman. So Billy Bob runs around town in his underwear and with a bunch of chickens in a barrel to try and find her. He ends up finding Wendy in her mansion and saving her. She tells him she was a vampire and wanted a man to save her from her life. But Billy Bob decides to go out with her instead, and ends up in a passionate, but dangerous relationship with Wendy. However, Wendy is dying and Billy Bob tries to help her. The relationship ends up on a rocky path, with a lot violence, but Billy Bob has a lot to lose and he tries everything to save Wendy. He gets her to give him back his vampire powers. This is when the movie starts to go downhill. Billy Bob ends up going through a lot more than he bargained for. He has to face his past and is confronted by the love he never got to experience before, Wendy, and all the violence he put a lot in her life and which ended up costing him her life, and she ends up getting revenge. This leads to him dying and it just makes it worse. The story is boring, it is bad, it doesn't have a point and there was no point to the movie, except
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It would be hard to pick a movie more awful than a horror flick about a woman going to a Halloween party and getting into an accident.   The movie takes place in a world of the imagination with the exception that the real world is a lot scarier than in the movies.  The female lead is just a girl that has been kidnapped by a man that she fell in love with.  Then she decides to go trick or treating to find a man and have sex with him, and that's how this is all started.  What makes this movie so much worse is the amount of sex and nudity that takes place on screen and the amount that is shown in the movie.  These scenes are completely un-sexy and gross, so bad in fact, that a lot of the actresses that play the roles feel uncomfortable and fake while portraying the characters.  If the characters didn't look like they're wearing an oversized latex breastplate and fishnets, they wouldn't look that different from your average person.   The best part of this movie is the music, it is really good.  However, I can't even bring myself to listen to the song that plays during the car accident scene.  I think this is because it has a really bad ring to it.  At least it's not that bad, it just sounds really cheap.  This movie does give you a lot to think about while watching, it gives you many of the tropes of a good horror flick.  There is a really strong theme of love, so much love that you can't see how this guy is even able to love someone so much.  It has a strong cast with a lot more potential, but the film just wasn't good enough for me.   I will definitely not be watching any more of this.

And he shot the bad guy after he was done talking to him.  The music was good.  There were also a lot of bad guys with different accents.  It was really fun.  I would watch this movie again in a heartbeat.

One of my favorite characters was killed off in a lame attempt to have an emotional connection.  Lucas could've used a few more good ideas.  We could've been on a journey with Finn and his brother and not just a bunch of boring garbage.  Why they made a young woman a stormtrooper was beyond me.  Finn is a good guy, so why a storm trooper?  I'm just glad he's still on the force. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't mean to be ungrateful about a movie I loved as a kid, but I have seen so many movies that didn't have anything special about them that they simply suck. I mean, how about this movie: I'm not going to go through the whole film, but they take a kid from Kansas and bring him to a school in California where he's bullied by the rich kids, a bunch of them. He finally starts to fight back, and he does it beautifully. The acting was amazing in that movie. The music was good. I really loved it. But it's bad. I watched it with my parents, and my mom said the movie's one of the worst she's ever seen. It's just a bad film that doesn't have much to offer. You see, people in this day and age are so obsessed with trying to be cool. They have so many trends that they follow. If they see a movie, they have to buy it. If you see a show on TV, you have to watch it. They are so into it that they have the urge to have something new and innovative every single day. And most of the time, they just don't have it. People don't want to listen to classical music anymore. They only want to hear pop music. They don't even want to try any jazz music. I think it's great that they don't listen to any music that isn't pop or rock. It gives me a sense of wonder. It inspires me. But, you see, when you look at it that way, it doesn't seem very interesting. Because it's not exciting or creative or something. It doesn't create a world or anything. It just sounds like somebody played a bunch o' synthesizers, and then some guy wrote it down. I think the world needs more people that don't take themselves too seriously. If we could all just take ourselves less seriously, then we could have more art and art history and more things to talk about. Why is it that you are so fascinated with my work?   I have been obsessed with you since you left me. I was obsessed with your music since the beginning. I love you more than anyone I've ever met in my entire life. You are my second mother. And when I saw you go, it was so hard on me.  The last time I saw your music was at a show in Montreal when

I liked the idea of the space probe, and I liked that it was basically just a story about space probes that goes through strange things.  What was really confusing was how it is made, with a lot or CGI, and how it was made.  There is a lot going on in the movie, and what it ends up being is very confusing.  After about 3/4 of the movie it kind of starts to get interesting.  The space probe has been sending out small ships all over the galaxy that look like tiny versions of the ship that went to the planet.  It seems like a really good idea.  However, they are actually space ships, and the people that are on those ships are robots.  As the movie goes on the story gets a little more complex.  While the robots are still around, their purpose has been made clear.  Their purpose in life was to explore this strange planet and find a new home for themselves.  Eventually these robots get captured by something (the aliens).  The aliens then turn off the robots and make them do whatever the alien wants.  These robots aren't too bad, but they are just simple and there are a lot more interesting things going on than you would think.  This movie is kind of disappointing and I think it had a lot to do with the fact that it only had so much time.  At one point there is a ship that gets attacked and destroyed by this alien creature.  But then the next time there is an alien creature, the same ship comes through and it isn't destroyed.  In some ways, this is really sad, but in other ways, it makes the movie a lot better.  By the end of the film, I am more or less at a complete loss as to what is going on.  Maybe it was the time limitations of the movies or maybe I got into this movie too quickly.  Either way, there isn't really any interesting thing happening and it kind gets old pretty fast.  One of the good things about the movie is that there are so many different people.  For a movie about robots and aliens, there are actually a lot and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The Bad :   This movie was very disappointing.   I think it should've been called 'the good movie', but it wasn't, so... I'm giving it a 'bad' rating.  If you're a film student or a film buff, you should definitely watch the movie - it is really good.  The Good :  I love this movie! It's a comedy about a girl and a guy who become roommates.  This was one of the first movies that I saw that was in black and white.  For those of you who don't like movies, I'm sure you'll like this movie.  I saw it on video because it had a VHS tape cover.  It's just a funny, short movie with lots of hilarious jokes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I will never forget that one time I saw a movie, I hated it, and then when I rewatched it, I was impressed, and I'm still impressed today.  I remember the opening scene where the guy goes into a dark room, a scary thing with a dark hole and a bat, and he jumps out, he looks very angry.   The man gets stabbed, and the guy is screaming, he says 'I'm so sorry.    Please let me live, please let me be with you'.    This movie was so much better than that one, and it was an honor to work on it.  So, who would you recommend this film to?  I have seen the movie many times, and every time it got a little better and better.  If you think we can fix the world...   And I think we will. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember watching this movie as a kid when it first came out. The "woo-hoo" at the end was a little too cheesy for my taste. It didn't really have a story that I could get behind. However, it was very popular in the 80's so people who enjoyed cheesy 80's movies would probably still watch it (i.e. my Mom and me). It's kind of ironic that this movie was so popular and gross because it is absolutely ridiculous. If you want a cheesy 80s film, give this one a shot. The music isn't too bad either. If this movie were still around I would probably watch it again and maybe even get the original soundtrack. The cast is pretty good. I wish they were bigger and better actors. I don't know if it would've worked with them. This film's rating is 4.5/10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've tried many methods to make my friends see this movie.    I've sent it to friends and family via email, and even called a number that I heard was a real movie theater (no one ever answered.)   When I tried to call this number in my head, the voice on the phone asked me for my credit card information. I told them I didn't have any and would not give them my card number.  I have no idea what the reason was for this, but it was just a really weird experience.  Finally, I tried calling the phone number that came up when I called the movie theater, and the lady on the line told me they couldn't make the movie. The number I had given her was fake.    It's the time of my life.  I am going to end this review with this, and say that if you don't see this film, go see it right now, and watch it again.  Because I really, really did.  This movie is so much better than it looks!   - January 3, 2012 - January 5, 2012 What?! I loved this movie when I first saw it. It was so creepy and fun. Now I hate this movie!!!!!!!!!!! - January 13, 2012
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie in question is The Secret Of Kells. It is a medieval Irish saga of good vs. evil in a medieval world of the late 8th century, which the movie is based on. It is by far my least favorite movie of the series. The characters are boring and the plot is nothing but one-note. The entire movie is simply a rehash of the first three movies with the exact same characters and plots. The last two movies are actually good, but this one has to be one of the worst series to date. The only redeeming aspect is the Irish setting, but since the characters are so shallow, I can't get too excited about a world with such little depth. The movie also plays a lot like a poorly written rehash with much more swearing than the original.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is horrible. It's also very short, at 3 minutes, which I really appreciate. It is a really dumb movie and not a very interesting movie at that. It has some really terrible scenes in it that really get your blood pumping. The acting is pretty terrible, there are so many scenes with just one or two actors doing everything. The movie is very forgettable and is one of those ones that make you cringe every time you watch it. I hope this is just the first movie from this director. He has a good heart and is trying to do something good. The story does not make sense and it is very predictable. I think this will be his last movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You will either get a positive response or a negative one.  If you are a negative movie critic, the more positive your review, the worse your review will be.   However,   Negative movies are the ones that should get a very negative response.  This is because the reviews are very negative and people don't want to hear how bad they are. This is why you will hear people talk about how horrible a film is.  Most movies just have one bad part or they're pretty good, but the bad parts are always enough to send them to the bottom of the pile.  Also you will be known as the person who doesn't like movies.  You will have to read a review about the movie first:  It is always best to read the movie beforehand.  You want to see the movie, but you don't have to give an opinion about it first.  What I have found is that you can go to a movie and have the exact same opinion about the film as a friend who did a review of the film.   If they are very polar opposite, then it will be hard for you to even put a few points into your review.   You can give a general movie review for any film: This is another great way to earn a bad film's dislike and to get people to dislike your review because they feel you gave it too much credit.  Usually I only ever give out a general film review for the first few films in a series, then I give an in depth review.  It can be tricky to give a good general film reviewing because the film's reputation may have changed, but if you want people to like your review and give it a high score, then go for it.  However it is easier for you as a critic to give them a general review because the majority of movies are good.  The average movie should have more than one or two bad parts.  Don't just list them out, give an overall feel for the film from a plot point of view. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was just a very bad movie. The acting was good, the music was good. I'm not sure how I can justify its existence, as it seemed to be just a gimmick to promote something that was already happening, and to me, it seemed like a rip-off of other movies. I liked the movie better before I saw it (for example, the original Spider-man). The movie seems to have gotten a negative reaction from the audience of the movie, which is not surprising. I am also not sure what happened. If they were just going to be promoting this movie, they should have just done it in the end, which was very interesting, as the ending was quite good, and did not leave any room for questions. I really liked that movie, and it would have been a nice ending, but it was more of an ending of the Spider-Man story, that will not be revisited. The movie will be mentioned in the DVD extra, as a "special feature" to those who want to watch it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     (note: as this movie was made in 1981, there were some issues that I have not yet gotten to the point of being able to see in the original release).     This movie has some great action sequences in the beginning, but as the story develops, you're getting to the real issue.   This movie had a pretty well written screenplay, but after watching it, I have to admit that it is not a very good film. The reason for this is that the story of "Pineapple Express" is about a small group of passengers who take a train to go on an adventure.  It also follows a man named Joe, who, after the passengers lose their luggage and find themselves stranded in an isolated cabin for a week, the man is forced to deal with his family life.  There are some great characters that we meet in this movie, and the whole movie has a nice, simple storyline, with a pretty good cast. I thought that this movie would be a decent adventure movie, but it never really delivered.  This film had a few interesting plot points that were good.  Unfortunately, the film never really made me interested enough to see what would happen, and I think the reason is that it didn't really give the characters a lot to do.  The story does get pretty interesting, and by the end of the movie, it is very interesting.  However, after watching the movie for the first time, it didn�t really take off on me.  I just think that I would have liked a better story, and better characters.  I am sure that I am missing some of the plot points, but I believe that the movie has the following elements: (1) the train is getting late because of the rain; (2) the passengers decide to go for a ride on the ferry (actually a train) to visit a place called Paradise, which is near the border of Cuba and Florida; (3) the ferry is a small ferry with only 4 cars, but has enough room to accommodate a lot of people; (4) the movie then follows a group of people who have to go to the end and get a train that is headed in the wrong direction; (5) the group is also split in two and they have to make a long journey to their destination; (6) the two groups make their way to Paradise to meet an old man who lives there, who then gives them their
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This movie is actually pretty cool and I did find myself a bit of a fan of the main character, who I found to be a bit annoying and obnoxious. He's a little bit cocky and not always taking a little too kindly to what he sees and doesn't understand. But, that's pretty much the entire point of this movie - to show the effect a child like this has on other people and how it affects a whole nation.  The movie also gets pretty cheesy at points, with the characters doing stupid things. But to me, it's just the way children are. They're only 13 or so years old and they'll do anything for attention and entertainment.  They also get a lot of weird situations. It's not always in good fun, but sometimes it was entertaining. I really thought this movie was a great thing to see for the younger generation.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie is never a bad film by definition, but there is always room for improvement.   The same applies to this movie. The acting in the film was a lot like that of a lot of the Bollywood movies out there (and let me tell you what a lot these actors look like they are all just a lot younger than they are, a very rare thing for the actors in Bollywood), not exactly memorable or even particularly attractive. The main female lead was also uninspiring. The only thing interesting about this movie was the music. The story was just kind of blah. If you are looking for a good movie that won't leave you empty handed then I would recommend this one. But you can get some more entertaining Bollywood action here if you want.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There was never anything I found to complain about about this film.  It does a great job of bringing us into the minds of the characters and making us care about them. I like the way the camera pulls back and shows us more of the world outside the prison, it really makes you feel as if we are in the middle of a prison riot.   I just wish it had been a little longer because there is a lot of information you have to absorb over the course of a single movie. It took me a while to realize there was a whole backstory to how the inmates became murderers, even though I thought there was.  The film takes some of the film's better scenes and turns them into less interesting ones, which I found jarring.  I guess it's nice to have a film that takes place inside a prison, but it would have been much better to have it take place outside the walls of the prison.  When we do get a glimpse into the mind of the killer and what's really going on he's like a crazy person; it's quite disturbing.  Also the ending was a little rushed, but I understand they had to make a fast movie, so they had no choice but to push things along at a fast pace. I think this is an enjoyable film and I definitely recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In a movie which takes its time and works through its issues with a certain degree of maturity and self-awareness, a few scenes don't go far enough. Some plot-points and characters fall flat. The dialogue may be a bit clunky and stilted. The camera is sometimes a little hard to read, but it was made that way. The only thing about it that didn't need to be was the way the scene in which the woman loses her boyfriend was handled. We weren't shown how a young man with a big heart (the character being the male lead) would react when the situation calls for him to move past his past love and realize his future with a woman he had just had a love affair with. We know that his past relationship had been a love one, but we don't see it. The girl had already given him her heart, and he felt no need to ask for a break. We've all been there and done that.   For me, this is just one more example of why a romance movie needs to be more than just a romantic comedy. There are enough good ones out there and not enough of them.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The thing that gets to me about The Dark Knight is not the terrible acting, not the poor storytelling, or the dumb plot. No, it's not that it is just a mediocre movie. It's the lack of any redeeming qualities. The movie does not hold up. There's a reason that so many people hate the Batman movies. It doesn't matter if they're a reboot or not; it just doesn't work. The Dark Knights has to be the worst Batman movie of all time, in my opinion. So much of what they tried to do in Batman Begins failed. Batman has an identity crisis. He wants to be more than a vigilante. He has a sense of honor, a responsibility that even Batman can't fulfill for him. In a nutshell, The Dark Age of Batman is a perfect description of the movie. As I said in the beginning, I'm not a great Batman fan, and I hate that they turned Batman into this stupid, cartoonish, cartoon villain. I thought that the ending of the film was so weak and underwhelming. It made me feel like I was watching a cheap cartoon version of Batman, and that was the worst thing I can say about the film. I really liked the characterizations of the villains in The Dark Nights, but this is far more of the same. Bruce Wayne is a boring, weak, selfish, and useless character. His mother is a complete useless idiot and is there to provide comic relief, while Batman is all action and excitement. It was a disappointing ending to a film that was so good from beginning to end. I can't believe that the filmmakers thought that Batman was going to be able to bring down the Joker. I was excited to see how they were going to do that, but they came up short. I honestly don't know why this movie was given a sequel. It wasn't as good as the first, and it never really got any better. You can actually make this movie a better movie than Batman Begins because of a character like Bruce Wayne. The villain does get some improvement, but the character doesn't. It really feels like the movie is trying to be all good, but doesn't really know how to be. As a result, it ends up being a bit of a disappointment.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first time I saw it, my first thought was, "I'm so going to love this!" Well, there was a little something missing in this movie - nothing like "The Shining" or "The Exorcist". No witches, no monsters and no possession. It was very sad. I'm a fan of horror movies. I watched "The Ring" the first time and loved it. I really loved this movie, but I wasn't so crazy about it.  It had some good elements but I was disappointed with the ending.  I watched "A Haunted House" and it was the same. A good movie, not a great one, but still a good movie.   I thought, "This one's okay." And I really was.  A Haunted House was a different movie, so there was an element of it being scary. This movie wasn't a perfect horror movie. It had some cool stuff and I would watch it again, but maybe it should have been released on DVD. I thought "A Ghost Story" was a great movie and I enjoyed it a lot.  But I liked "A Monster Calls". "A Night at the Roxbury" was fun and scary.    I was really into "The Haunted Land" the second time I watched it. It has a great ending, but the movie could have been better.  It was nice to see more horror movies being made.  The horror films we got in 2010 were very enjoyable.  I enjoyed "The Cabin in the Woods" and I'm enjoying "Cabin Fever 2: Marooned."    In 2013, horror movies have become more interesting. The movies are more imaginative and they're using more jump scares. It's also better since the old films weren't scary as much as the new ones are.  You'll probably see a lot of new films and hopefully some are good, too.  In 2013 is where we can watch "Halloween" and "The Babadook."  In 2013 I was very impressed with "It." I enjoyed watching the movie a lot and I think it was a very good movie and a very scary movie.   I saw "Halloweentown" the day after watching "The Conjuring," which I loved. It looked really good and it wasn't as bad as some horror movies we saw in the past. It gave us some good scares and it seemed more scary.   This was
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm going to get it off my chest, people - even the people who gave me the movie for free because they thought I would like it.  The worst movie I have ever seen.  It's bad, bad, BAD.   From the opening scene you know it's going to be bad.  It opens with a shot of a dog with a stick.  He then goes to a trailer park, and walks around with his dog in tow.  You do not do that by yourself.  And I don't mean that as a bad thing.  When you walk around alone you look like a freak.  The next shot shows a child who looks at a man, who looks back, and he asks, "Are you the boy from the movie?"  The boy from " The Godfather?"   And now we're in the trailer park.  I don 't care if you don't like "Godfather" I don' t care about that.  But I do care what this boy thinks.  This kid is walking along, minding his own business, when a man in a red shirt comes up behind him and slaps the boy.  That's the first thing I notice.  Then he says, "I guess you want to play with me now?"  And that's when it all starts.  These are not a bunch of thugs, these are people.  They have a lot of money.  People in this movie seem to spend a lot on their children.  A nice car.  Some nice toys.  My kid gets a new toy that looks like a piece of the moon.  So, of course the boy is pissed.  There are a lot more bad shots of people coming up behind this kid, then there are good ones.  Finally there is a shot that shows the boy walking back home, when you realize the boy will never see his parents again, and that the parents' home is full of the dead bodies of their child friends.   Then we go back to the trailer and there's a scene where a guy in a white suit is walking across a grassy field, and a woman walks by and says,  "This is a great scene!"  I couldn't find any description anywhere on the web to explain the exact scene, but we're going to have to take her word for it.  We go back into the trailer with the boy and see what has happened.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      If you're a horror fan, chances are that the next time you're at a movie theater, you're going to see something that looks a lot like The Babadook. Sure, this isn't a film that most horror fans want to see, but that's the point of it:  It's a horror movie, and most horror movies are good.   Now, as a general rule, a good horror movie (especially one with a good story) has to have some genuine horror, something that you won't find in most other horror movies.  The Babaddook doesn't.  As a result, most horror movie fans consider this film to be one of the worst things that has ever been made in the world.  So, what exactly is the problem with this film?   It doesn't have a story.  No, that's not right.  There is a story, but it's not the kind of story a good film should have.  It's a story that has been done, and it's all been done before.  That's a problem, because when a movie has been recycled and taken a new direction, that means that there is something in it that isn't original.  A lot of the story beats and characters have been seen before.   And that isn t a good thing.  No, it is not a good way to tell a story:  For example, in the film, there is an interesting mystery that's supposed to be solved by the end of the movie, but instead, it turns into a convoluted and incoherent mess of a story where the audience is only able to piece together pieces of the puzzle piece by piece.  Instead of using the mystery to show the audience a little bit about the characters, and how they are related to each other (and the mystery), they use it to show us a picture of the family, and to give us a glimpse of the backstory of one character (who turns out to be a psycho killer, and who is not even named for the rest of the film).  This is the same thing that a lot of horror films do, the audience doesn't get to get to know the characters.  But that doesn't matter.  This isn't the point.  Because the point is that the story is bad, and that it's just as bad as other bad horror films that are out there. And that's because the story has been repeated
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A must-see for sci-fi and horror fans  by Robert H. Asimov - March 31, 2011  The film stars Leonard Nimoy as the voice of Spock, a Vulcan, and a good old time science fiction and horror fan. I've only seen the movie once, but I was hooked. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is the second Star Trek film to take place in the 24th century and it is the best. It is the first of a trilogy, which is really cool, because they didn't have to make a "third" movie, because that's what happens in Star Trek. This is the third and last film in a trilogy and this one is even better than the first one. It was filmed over two years and it features a number of great new additions to the story and it still leaves the story in a good place. If you like Star Trek and you like science fiction then you should watch this film.  I would like to make one thing clear: Star Trek: The Motion Picture is a great movie. The action sequences and effects are excellent, the special effects are top notch and the cast is terrific. It also makes a good introduction to Star Trek, but for those who like it, The Wrath Of Khan is a must-watch movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is not great, and I don't mind watching a movie to learn a lesson.   I was actually pretty impressed with the film's message, though.  The film is about how we are all trapped inside our own body, how we get sick, and how we have a tendency to want to escape.  It's a very relatable message, and it does it very well.  And it's not just a metaphor for a film.  If you're a parent, you know how annoying it is to be a parent.  In a weird way, the main character is a parent too. He's sick and tired of being sick and sick and wants to escape, but his mom is so tired of watching him struggle and doesn't want to be sick anymore.  As a side note, this is my favorite film from 2014.  If you want to hear the worst movie I've ever watched, this would be it:  Oh boy!   It turns out I was watching a bad, awful, gross, and horrible movie.  Well, not really, but I was there. I'm just glad it's over now.  Now to get back to the movie.    This film starts off well. I love this guy, but he can get away with a lot more than you can. He can also be completely ridiculous and unbelievable, which is exactly what he does.  He goes to this guy and says, "I got a new girlfriend, and she's awesome."  The guy is the best thing in this film, and he makes me laugh so hard I don' t even feel like I'm watching a terrible movie. I also like that he can be a little over the top with the cheesy humor.  But, the film doesn't last very long, and by the end I wasn't a fan of this guy. The movie also doesn't focus on a single character. There's the main guy, the girl, and this guy's dad.  This movie didn't even have much of a "main character," just a bunch of characters who don't really have any purpose.  I don a lot of bad movies in a row that I'm hoping never get made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best part of this movie, the only thing that would make it any better, would be if the people that wrote it were in the military. The only reason this movie has any positive reviews is because the movie is about a "soldier" who gets hurt and decides to go for help. I'll give this a 4 for acting and directing. It is also one of the few movies that made me laugh out loud. I really don't understand the movie at all. I think that it would be better if they just showed some footage of how it was really like, then they could just move to the next movie. This movie has a good concept, but I feel that it just doesn't make sense.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are having trouble with a bad review about this film, you are not alone.   As it stands, I am unsure of whether or not I have watched the film, but a negative comment about this movie has already been submitted to this site.  The movie was terrible, and if I was a real person, I would be the one telling anyone who would listen that this was a bad film.  I thought it was bad, and that's a fact.  In all honesty, I actually had the film rated a "B" for kids' shows, and I thought the story and characters were alright.  If I was to recommend this film to someone, I wouldn't think that I would give it a positive review.  Now, with that said, this review isn't even about the movie.  It's about how a lot of people rated this film. The reason I'm writing about this is because the reviews for this movie are so poorly written and poorly reviewed, and it really makes you wonder.  Do people even know how to write reviews about a movie?   It truly saddens me that a lot people, myself included, will review this film in a negative fashion.  For those people, I'm sorry.  This movie was bad.  But I'm a firm believer that a bad is a good movie, and this movie wasn't good.  However, this movie is a very good example of how not to do reviews.  These aren't reviews, this is just how I think about the film. If you disagree with me, that's fine.  Just don't comment and down vote my reviews. This movie isn't good, but it is one of the greatest horror films that we have ever seen, and you shouldn't down vote this film just because you hate the movie, because a bad story is still a bad idea. If I could take this movie with me every time I went on a camping trip, that would be fantastic.  There are plenty of horror films I've seen where I'm really afraid to go on a hike, and there are plenty horror films where I just don't want to go to a movie theater, so this movie wouldn't really bother me.  And for anyone who thinks that this is the best horror film ever, please go see a horror film where they're not afraid, because it really is a horror movie. And for the people who said it was just a movie with
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       "I'm sorry, but there isn't a lot that can be done about The Rock (Hugh Jackman), as far as the audience is concerned. He doesn't act at all like he's having fun. In fact, he's barely acting at all. He's not even pretending, but his presence is almost palpable. There is only a trace of his charisma, if any at all, in any of his performances. And that's not to say he can't do a few decent bits as a rogue cop. In a very well-done scene, he has to be the only cop on the force not to be drunk. I mean, the guy gets a slap for that. The movie itself, on the other hand, is pretty bad and has no redeeming value. It's just not funny."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie has nothing to do with the quality of a person. We want to be entertained and have a good time, but if you go too far beyond that point, you run the risk of a bad experience. In this case, we went too far, and as a result got a bad result. The quality of the movie did not detract from the movie experience we had, but it did distract us from enjoying it. I've seen it in three separate theaters, and the sound and image quality has been consistent between them. The only bad thing I could say about the movie was that it got a bit boring after a while. This is definitely not a movie that you should watch in one sitting, but don't get me wrong, it was a decent film. It's hard to get a movie this good without a little something for everyone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this and I loved it. It is very funny, very clever, and very heartfelt. The actors were great. The writer did a good job and the director did a great job. I would not recommend this to everyone, especially since it is so long.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a great movie. The only thing that I can really criticize is that the music used in the film is really loud. It gets on my nerves. Also, I have a feeling that there is a scene that gets cut out because they didn't want the film to be too long.   I highly recommend this film to any film buff who likes the original film.  1 What do I mean by a "classic"? I mean that a movie or series is seen by many people and still has a loyal following today. You can find classic movie posters that are still used today. This article will be a short review of this classic, but the movie is a must see for any film fan. I recommend this movie to people who like action films, westerns and a good story. The movie starts with a man who is looking for a fortune to save his father's business. He finds a cave and discovers that there are many treasure hunters that have been in the cave searching for the "Golden Fleece." It seems that the treasure is in fact the skin of a golden eagle. The man is forced to kill one of the hunters. At the end of the movie we learn that the Golden Fleege is in the possession of the "Red Baron," a notorious Nazi officer. The Red Baron then goes to Los Angeles and has a big party at the house of his friend, who is a wealthy socialite. The house is being guarded by two men. The one on the left is a tough ex-marine. The other one is an ordinary private eye who works for the police. One of the guards is captured by the Red Baron. During the interrogation the guard reveals that the Red-Baron had plans to kill the guard. The two guards were then killed by the Golden Eagle in revenge. The Eagle then escapes and goes to England. The film ends with a shot of the Eagle looking down on a cemetery and a woman reading a book and reading about a man that was killed in battle by a Nazi.    The movie follows the adventures of the Red Bull Bandit, who goes on his quest to find the Golden Feather. He joins a number of men who believe that the Eagle has buried the gold there. The Golden Eagle is described as being very bright and has green eyes. The people of London and America are amazed by his feats. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I know you don't need a review on a bad film. It's just a bad picture.   But, this movie was so bad, that I had to review it.  It's called The Last House On The Left.   You can read my review about it here.  This movie had the reputation to be a horror classic, and I thought it was a great movie.  If you read my story of the last house on the left, you will know what I'm talking about.   This movie is a remake of the film called "The Last House on the Left".   The plot of the movie is that there are a couple who live in the house and they go on holiday to the beach.  When they return to their house, they discover that there's a dead body inside and it looks like they murdered the body.  The guy who played the role of the cop in the movie said that he felt so uncomfortable in the role and he didn't want to do it any more.  They also discovered a secret room in the basement that was built during the 1930s.  But the thing was, that there were only 6 guests that were going to visit that room when they came to visit.   Now, I thought that it was really weird that there was no cameras inside the house.  I didn't find it a weird movie to watch because the actors were great in the movies.  Of course, I didn' t like the film for the acting.  Now that I see the movie and I have a few more questions.  This film had many problems, such as the fact that the actors don't get along, they don't trust each other, they all have different ideas, they make different comments, they have different morals and they are all trying to get out of the house alive.    But I thought, that the plot was good.  My best part in the film was when the girl was playing the piano and when she was practicing she was playing very well, but the guy who plays her played terrible.  He played terrible like he didn't know how to play the piano.  Then, he made mistakes. He would be playing a note and then he was a little off.   He would get up and walk to the other side of the room, then he would do the same thing, only he'd play it a little differently.   It was just a little too complicated for this kid
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the director of this movie is a horrible director, the acting was terrible, the writing is horrible, and the camerawork was awful. It's a very, very bad film and there's no reason for it to exist. It would be much better if it had been made by somebody with talent.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen, ever. If I'd known it was a ripoff of another movie I'd never have watched it in the first place. It was just a cheap "couch gag". It had one or two jokes that were actually funny, but they were a mere afterthought to what was just going to become a tired gag in the movie.   One funny gag was when it was "revealed" in the end that the hero is going to die. At first they all laugh, but when he says "I can't die" a bunch of people start crying. It's just awful. It wasn't funny at all.  There were some things in this movie that made me laugh. It really had some funny moments. Unfortunately, I had no sympathy for the movie or for it's hero, and I couldn't help but be disgusted by this awful piece of garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The main character, the only one to live, is dead.   His parents had died the year before.  The whole movie was set in the apartment of the dead man's parents.  His daughter's father, who died of a drug overdose, is there and is a complete sociopath, and I loved him.  It was a real mess. I don't have anything else to say about this movie other than it was pretty much a disaster.  So I was watching this in 2011, and it was not at all the disaster I had read about.   In fact it was the best thing ever about a death in my life, so I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I'm glad that it exists because it's the sort of thing that makes me want to watch more people die, and get more gore on my hands.  And it's kind of an interesting premise, a man is trapped in the world of dreams, and a woman who's had the dreams of many people tries to help him escape. I have no idea how this movie is connected to a tv show called 'The Dreamers' that aired from 1989 to 1995.       I found this film to be very disturbing, and the way in which it was edited made it very clear that this was the director's attempt at horror film. I think that this is one of the things that got me hooked on the horror genre as a kid, it's a way to take people you don't like and make them into monsters that you will always hate.  Some of the shots here reminded me of the famous scene in 'Gremlins 2: The New Batch' in which everyone is turned into gremlins, or of 'The Ring', in which the whole town turns into the creatures from the movie.  But even though the director wanted the gore in this movie, it never got very messy or bloody.  So I thought it was great how the movie was actually more of a psychological thriller, as we are shown that the woman is trying to get the man back from his dream world and get him to come back to life. It's an interesting idea, especially as her daughter is a bit of a psycho. I would have liked a little more gore, but I'm still glad that this film exists.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    1) The movie stars the hottest pornstar of the moment, Misha Cross. She's not a good actress, but she's good at being fucked. Her scenes have a lot of sexual tension, and she gives an excellent performance, especially during her sex scene with Chris Strokes (which I think is my favorite scene of the movie so far). 2) I was very surprised that this movie included three sex scenes. The two sex scenes with Adam West are good enough, but they're the only scenes in the movie. The scene with a hot young lady, Mia Malkova, is quite good as well. 3) There is one more sex scene to watch. The only scene in the film that shows real intimacy is the sex scene where two hot guys are having sex. However, they're not really intimate; this is more of an exhibitionism scene in which the actors are being filmed. 4) There are a lot more hot girls in this movie than I expected. I'm not sure if they've been in films before or just had a successful career. There are also quite a few scenes of guys making out with girls, so I was expecting more scenes of that kind of sex, but there are a few more lesbian scenes. 5) There's also a scene with Adam Baldwin, so you'll see a couple of comic scenes. I think it's the funniest movie sofar!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - The first movie I ever saw by "The Rock", which I remember fondly, was his "Slam".   It was pretty average, but a great "slam" and one of his very good roles.   His next roles were even better.    In this movie, I was not so lucky as he was.  He was completely unrecognizable, and he wasn't playing his usual "strong" character, but more a "weird" character.  He acted like a little kid and didn't know what he was doing.  So he was totally out of place and the script was pretty weak.  I loved this movie.  This is probably one of the best films I have seen and there are tons of good performances in this film.  I only saw this for the first time about 2 years ago.  There was a second film about this "Rock" in the early 70's, but it was never released theatrically because "The King" refused to do a press tour.  It's worth a viewing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you love the movie: You know what you are getting into. I won't say that I loved the movie, it was a well put together show, but there were a few flaws that were difficult to overlook.   First is a couple of small issues in the story.  First of all it would have been nice to see more of the family, even though the only time we see them, it's just the parents, but for those of us that love the kids, this would have had been nice.  Second issue is that the story doesn't work with the actors that they cast.  The story was pretty cool, but it would be nice to have some real personalities.  It is easy to get caught up in this show because it is a fun family comedy, and it was very funny. I felt as if I was watching a Disney Channel movie.  I am not going to say that the movie is any good, but I don't think the story would be that great if it had been directed by a different director.  So with that being said I give this a 4 out of 10.  Next is the soundtrack.  This is where I really felt as though it had some good music. It was definitely fun to listen to. I thought that it was appropriate for the story and how the actors were acting, but that might just be because I am a sucker for music.  What I did like about the soundtrack was the little touches that they added.  For example in the movie they were playing the theme song of the show at one point.  There were two songs that were used at a certain point in the show, and they made it very clear when the show was in the background.  In the background there is a voice saying something, and a moment later we see that a song from the soundtrack is playing in the other direction.  After the song was over, I knew that there was a movie coming up.  If there had been a music player at that point, I would have loved it.    Lastly was the special features.  You get a lot of nice stuff in this.  They had a nice little film festival thing going on and it has a lot in it. There are some DVD extras for the DVD, and the audio commentary on the DVD.  Lastly is a bonus feature called "Weird Science" that is a series of interviews with the main cast. I haven't seen this
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The second film in the series takes place in the same era and features the same cast and crew. Although this film does have a few weaker scenes than the first, it's still worth watching, mostly for the fact that the film was shot with much better technology than the previous one.   Star Wars : Episode II  is an action movie in which the actors, especially George Lucas, are the star. The battle scenes are spectacularly choreographed and the action is often so fast that it becomes almost unbelievable that characters are running, jumping, and swinging about in the midst of battle.     In many ways, Star Wars was ahead of its time: the prequels didn't have an action scene that made you feel that the characters were really going through the motions.  In the first two films, the heroes are constantly running from one scene to another, looking for a way to escape, or to defeat an enemy.  This is fine in an era of special effects, but it becomes tedious quickly.  Lucas didn't want the first film to be just about the hero and his journey, so he created some interesting and interesting characters and a world that was both alive and fully detailed.  The next film, Return of the Jedi, continued this trend.  It was also shot with more detail, but this was just a continuation of what Lucas had done before.  Star Trek  The Next Generation  was not as much about the journey of the hero, but rather his encounter with an alien and an alien species.  Now in the 21st century, you would think that an entire series would be about a character's adventure, not just about his personal struggle to defeat some evil empire.            The final film in Star Wars  Episode III, Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, is the only one in the franchise to have two main characters.  Unfortunately, the movie did have a lot of scenes that seemed a little too long, and it didn't really seem to take place in one galaxy.  In fact, the story was so complicated that I almost didn't understand a single word.  Although the movies were very different in style, they were still very good movies, so I still recommend them to Star Wars fans and to general fans of science fiction.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a movie I really enjoy, but I can't deny that it has some issues.   The first thing I thought when I saw the trailer for this film was: "Oh, they went back to the 70s again!"   So I was looking forward to that, but what happened next?   You have a director (Richard Fleischer) and a screenwriter (Robert Altman) working together to make a movie that will look just like a 70s movie with a plot and an action-packed, sexy look that makes it look like you've been watching a 70-minute episode of Star Trek.  I really didn't care about it because it was a really ugly film.  But it looks like you can't even watch it in one sitting.  I guess the point is, if you're not a fan of the 70's, you can watch it, but you're better off avoiding it.  They didn't even bother to give the characters names, so I don't think I'll even remember who they were, not that it matters anyway.  But the thing I really think got me is the idea of going back in time.  It was never as interesting when they went to the '60s with Back to the Future or The Terminator.  You had movies that were really made in a studio and made for the masses.  In the 70-s, we had the first Star Wars and it was the first one where we really had the money to make all this stuff and it came out on VHS and DVD and Blu-ray, so people actually paid attention to it. "We have more money than the Roman Empire!" "We are the masters of the universe!" It took a real genius to figure out a way to turn this into a movie. But it just wasn't very good, the acting was horrible, the plot was dumb, and the special effects were laughable. I'm not sure why everyone else liked it (it has a 98 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes) or why they thought the script was any good, but if you don't want to see an ugly movie, watch something with a better plot or characters. But really, it's not like anyone should waste their time watching it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only reason I liked this film was because I was bored. This is not a good film and I am glad that it has been released in theaters. It is not the kind of film I would have ever seen. I have watched a lot of horror films, but have only seen one that I thought was actually scary. This was the film I wanted to see. The film is about a young woman who runs into a dark place and starts seeing things that nobody could see. But she keeps running. In this dark place is a woman, but she looks like she's only had one beer. I also loved that this film is not about some girl who wants to get away from it all. It's a woman who wants a place in this world, but there's a whole world of evil outside of this place. It was kind of nice that the story was not about a girl who was trying to get the man of her dreams. The only other thing I thought could have been done better was that the ending seemed very abrupt and didn't make any sense. Overall I loved this film, but I could only imagine how much the people who loved it hated it. I guess that's how a good movie should be.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - Do yourself a favor: don't watch a bad flick, even a bad "B" movie, because you're likely to forget about it, and maybe even be irritated when you think about it.   A good rule of thumb: if you liked it, why didn't you watch it again?   And for those who have no idea what a "B movie" is: there's a good reason they're called "B movies".   When you're watching a movie about a kid going to college, and you get the feeling that the kid is going to get a girlfriend. You'll remember how you felt when you first saw it. You know the kid went to college to get good grades, or he's a geek who wants to show his girlfriend how cool he is (he's a nerd), or he just wants to get laid (he has a girl crush on the girl).   You get that feeling that "a girl like that" is going somewhere, and he's not going to let her down.  But, in all those times you watched the movie, you never felt she was going anywhere... because he's still in college, or still has a crush on a girl who's out of his league (we're talking a hot chick here), or even worse, he'll still be "in the closet" in the next film (he'll be gay, or at least pretend to be gay)...   So, how do you break that feeling of "a chick like that?"  To make a girl go somewhere, you need to create "a moment".  One of the most powerful moments a man can create is the feeling he creates when he says or does something that inspires him.  The word inspiration comes from the Greek words "inspiration", "re-inspired", and "inspire".  The point is: when you say something that makes you feel inspired, that's what you'll do to make someone go somewhere.  Now that you've created the moment in your mind, you have to do it. So, you're going to start with a simple act, or simple idea.  For this example, let's make a movie, and have the lead character get a scholarship to a private school.  As you watch the film, you'll see that the idea is simple, and the action is simple too.  When they go to their first interview, the guy who's got the scholarship wants to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What's so wrong with your reviews, dear, dear?     Have you heard about the "Internet Movie Database"?   I've used it before, and it's awesome.   You can search for movies online and view information about each movie on a single page, including reviews, photos, and a synopsis.  You need this feature if you don't want to spend hours trawling through movie websites that contain movie reviews by someone who likes to go into the film and scream at it.  But as for "the Internet Movie Database" itself?  Not so awesome.   Most of the reviews on it are of the same people who leave movie reviews for movies at sites like IMDB, which is an awesome site, but IMDB has an atrocious track record of ratings.  I can't believe that anyone still uses that site.  In fact, I can only think of two people in the world who were ever willing to leave a rating on IMDB.  They were David Keaton and Richard Burton.  Oh, I'm sure Burton doesn't agree.  The reason the site has so many reviews is that so much bad movies are made every year, and because so few of them make it into theaters, the ones that do are often terrible.   If you are going to make a movie based on a TV show, you need to have an impressive cast, so most of the movies based on TV shows have to use "TV movie" as a catch all term.   One of the things I like about the Internet Movie Registry is that it allows you to see films from more than one decade or era, and that is a feature I've never had before.  It's great to see so many films from other eras, and you have a much better chance of seeing a good movie than you would if you only saw it in a theater.   You know, you can even view movies from all the other eras of movies that I've seen over the years.  I like this feature.  Even when I find a movie I really hate, I know I'm in the minority, because I can just browse through movies that other people have reviewed, and so I can see that the movie wasn't as bad as some people think it was.  As I've gotten older, I've grown more skeptical about the things people say about movies.  Sure, movies can be awful, but they can also be amazing, or

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The first time I saw the title I didn't know what to think. The description sounded like a "movie about aliens, and it looked like a sci-fi movie with aliens." I was immediately drawn in. I couldn't wait to see this movie. I had no idea what to expect. It did not disappoint. This movie, the first and only science fiction movie I have seen in a very long time, has everything.   I cannot even count how many times I felt that I was watching a different movie than the one I had just seen. The aliens are beautiful, and the aliens do not seem like they are the same aliens from the original "Alien" film. The "Alien Resurrection" films, as well as some of the other science fiction films of the 1970's are very different from each other. In this movie, one alien looks like he's from a different planet and the others look almost human, yet have no resemblance to any species from Earth. And what about the acting? I guess they really wanted to make this film an alien movie, but they also wanted some humans to appear as well, and they definitely succeeded.  I was absolutely amazed by the acting in this film. I would put all of the actors in this movie in the same category as the actors of "E.T."  This movie is an alien film. It is a movie that should never have been made. This film was originally going to be a film about a colony on a space station in orbit around a planet that is occupied by a race of monsters that come in to Earth. The film was written and directed by a man named Dan O'Bannon, who had no experience directing science fiction, and this movie has one of the most expensive sets I have ever seen on film. They spent $50 million dollars to make the film, which is ridiculous. They shot the film in 35mm film.  After the film was finished, O'bannon's agent gave it to the studio head who hired someone to write and direct a sequel to the movie "Alien". This "Alien 2" was a total failure and they never planned to make another movie with O' Bannon directing. This is the reason for why no one ever directed a sequel of the movie.  The "Vulcan" series of sci- fi films were a success. These films were not considered science fiction at all. They were just re-tellings of Greek Myth

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   One-star review of "Mystic River"   One-star Review of "Fences"  The last film to be nominated for the "Best Picture" Academy Award for the first time, "Mystique River" is a bleak thriller about a female serial killer whose true nature is finally revealed. The story follows the hunt for the young female serial murderer of several young men in Los Angeles in the 1960's.   This film is rated R, but is so far ahead of its time, that it is a rare film that is still in theaters and available to be seen by a younger audience.  "Mystic" is like a modern version of "The Silence of the Lambs."  It has a young killer in the lead role who has a unique, twisted personality, and a strong supporting cast.  Here is a picture of the main character:   This is the main female character who was the lead of the film, the one who had killed several young young men.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think that people should read movies before they come to see them.   Most people are scared.  What is the use of being scared if we never have the chance to feel scared. In the last two years we have had two movies that were terrible.  They were not bad in themselves, they were just not good.  My first thought after I saw the movie was how could he have ever made this.  How could someone in his position have allowed these poor quality scripts to pass as if they were written by an artist?   Then there was the third movie.  It was so bad that it was unbelievable.  I don't like to mention these three movies by name because I do not want to spoil anything.  But the movie I will mention is called   All was forgiven.  The movie is a terrible waste of time.  A movie so bad it was bad enough to have to include the title.  In this movie a man was so badly treated by his friends that he was driven insane.  He became so obsessed with his obsession that he became convinced it was the best thing that ever happened to him.  Because he was so messed up he made a deal with a demonic force.  These movies could not have been more different than each other and yet the movies are so alike they can not have happened at the same time. The only similarity they had was one was a bad film made by a director so incompetent it was incomprehensible.  One was made by people so desperate to get an Academy Award that they made a movie with an all-star cast of movie stars. The other was a terrible movie that was made because the director thought it would be a hit.  Why did they make these films?  Why were they so desperate for recognition?  Did their desperation lead them to make films they were not capable of making?  Who were they?  How did they get so far astray? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is not a movie with a good plot. I like bad movies and this is not one of them. This is the type of movie I have had the worst experience with since the movies where made on my tv when I was young. It was made by a guy named Joe Schmo of the "Dead Zone" series. It features a bunch of people in a space station who have to live in this very small area with no air, water, or food. The movie is about a group of people and is basically about how one woman falls in love with this guy because she can see he has it all. The problem with this movie is that it has no sense of humor and the director and screenwriter just can't write anything. There is nothing funny about this movie at all. In fact it was like watching some horrible, depressing, depressing movie. There are no jokes in this movie. Nothing good happens and there is a whole lot of people dying. I think the only thing that kept me from giving it 1 star is that I thought there were two bad parts in the movie. The one where the guy has a heart attack and then dies and the one where his wife and kids are killed by a meteor. I was so mad about them. I kept thinking about how this guy never got a chance to give a good speech or show his true colors. There was no reason why they should have killed his daughter. She was just a baby. He should have just shot her in the head, he was so evil that he did that to his own daughter. He really should have died there and then. I hate how that movie had no humor to it. It is not funny at all and it makes it seem like a movie about a character who hates himself. So, if you like bad films then this is your movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Posted by John on October 14, 2012 at 12:46 AM   John W. Miller's latest is just a mediocre attempt to revive the franchise and make it more interesting. It's good enough to not be bad, but to just be bland and forgettable. For example: - The villain, Lord Gideon, sounds like a guy you'd see in a sci-fi/fantasy movie. I have to wonder how much the scriptwriters were inspired by the original comics when coming up with this one. - I thought the film was going to include one or two different alien races (which is why I liked it in the first place). Instead it's just this big blob thing with a red head and a big red hat. And a red beard and a red cloak. - The way they killed the villain was lame. Gideon has him get his hands down his pants and he tries to kick him in the crotch with his own foot. - In the deleted scenes, we get to see more of Gideon. He looks like a cross between Bruce Banner and a cross of Superman. Maybe the writers saw that there were already a lot of fans who hated Gideon? (I think they didn't think of it, but they might have.) - I didn't mind the movie's ending. The film ends with a close-up of a guy's face that has been cut away by Gideon's hand. The ending was very satisfying, but I was wondering if that meant they would have killed off the main villain and replaced him with an all-new character. It just felt a little bit too convenient. (I am sure they would like to revisit Gideon in the future, and maybe there's some opportunity for that.)   Posted By John on August 21, 2012, at 12 : 42 PM   A decent film but it was a bit more disappointing than I thought it was going in.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I enjoyed watching this movie. I found it hard to believe that a film that is about two college girls in a strange city is being made. But it was. I'm glad the movie made it possible for me to see a movie that I've always wanted to see, and I'm looking forward to another movie where these two young girls find a way to live together and to take their lives in a direction that they can't always see the future of, but I hope they have a lot of fun.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those movie that you just can't get out of your head after it. I've always wanted to see this movie but for some reason I always was able to avoid seeing it. Well I finally found myself with the opportunity to see it and I couldn't resist. Not only did I want to see the movie but to do it right. I did not expect a movie like this one. I mean if I thought it was good it was just my imagination. This is a must see for any movie lovers out there. It was just that good. It did not leave me disappointed. It just made me want to go back and rewatch it. The acting was good but there was so many scenes that I want even more of. The story was good and the ending was wonderful. If I had a problem with this movie it was the soundtrack. The song selection was not original but it was really good. You could tell that they had spent a lot of time with it. But for me, that was the only problem I had with this particular movie. If you want to watch a movie about a band of misfits who are all in love with the same girl who has an affair with one of them that's your movie. The only thing I really would have loved to see changed is some of the music. It sounds like they got ripped off from a rock song or something. It wasn't a huge problem for me but if you like a more original soundtrack then this is definitely a movie that is for you. It's just that close to perfection. If there is a film that I really want to write a negative about it would have to be "Dead Man's Shoes" I just think it is one hell of a waste of a good movie. I would have left it in for one more review because it's that good that you can't stop thinking about it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is based on a true story that went through many different twists and turns before it ended up in the studio system.  The first draft was by Tom Shadyac and the studio, Columbia, wanted to have a "good guy" and a "bad guy" but at the time they were afraid to cast a black actor and felt that the movie would not be popular with blacks.  That was the only reason that it wasn't released until 1973.  There are some problems with the screenplay that make it hard to understand what is happening and what was going on.  Also, if you have never seen a horror movie, this is a good one.  You will not find yourself in any suspense once the movie starts.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most important thing about film is its message .  .   This is the worst film   I have ever seen. I understand that this may be a popular film because it is about a young man that has sex with a woman that he loves. He gets what he wants and he is happy. It's all good, right?   That would be a good story with a good ending. Unfortunately this film has nothing in it to make a great film. It is a boring, pointless, and frustrating film. I was looking forward to it because it was the sequel to a film I had seen many times (see my reviews of this movie). This movie doesn't deserve a second watch. It isn't funny at all and it's not even worth your time. It sucks, it's boring, and the ending is so unsatisfying.  The main female character is a girl, and you know that this will be a boy that will become a man. That just makes this even worse, because she never even acknowledges that he is a boy. She doesn't even know if he is straight or bi, and that bothers me even more because she's a girl who doesn't seem to care that much about her son. I'm not a big fan of the story in any way. It just seemed like it was there to give a female character a "nice guy" role, and to make money.  As far as this movie is concerned it is the opposite of a good film. If it was a good movie I would love it, but it's just bad. I hate it, and I hate this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are a writer, it is extremely likely that you will come across at least one bad movie that you have nothing to do with. It happened to me many times when I was a young writer. But the worst part of the whole situation is that you never get a chance to make yourself proud of your work and the work of others. The fact is that every time you make a movie, no matter what it is, you will have to face the same thing. And even though you will never come up with a better movie than the one you have made already, you'll still get criticized. It will happen to you for the rest of your career. And that is a real shame. I always feel very bad when I am asked to say that a movie is bad, as I have many good movies to which I can give praise. But when you are asked about a movie that has no effect on your career whatsoever, it feels terrible. And when you see the film's rating, it will hurt a lot. One of the things that I had a hard time with in making this movie was the rating. I wanted to give the movie a rating of 8, as most of my movies are rated better than that. But as I already said above, most of the time, the ratings I have on my movies don't matter at all. So I was forced to give a movie a low rating. And if you are going to give it a low score, at least give it the same rating as all the other mediocre movies that I've made. I never felt that I was giving the movie any better a rating than that given by the people who had already seen the movie. But it's just what it was. There was no way for me to change it. It wasn't like I had the chance to give my version of what happened. I mean, how could I? I was only a guest of a studio and a director that was going to be working with me for a period of three months. They didn't even ask me to write or direct the film. They just wanted me to do some effects. And the studio was very honest about that. They said, "We would have given you better ratings but if you were to do this kind of thing again, we would just ask you to do it with a different name." But I can't really do something like that. I can try to give some ideas about the movie, but it's not really
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was a HUGE fan of The Matrix, I think the movie took a lot of my life from me, and I never liked the first movie. It was not what I was expecting when I first watched it and I didn't enjoy it at all. I thought this movie would be better because of the new movie, it did not live up to the hype. I really did not understand how they could do the Matrix like that, like the original movie, but at the same time they had to do it like the sequel. The characters were all over the place and they had way too many bad jokes and the movie never really stopped. The whole movie was kind of boring and it made me want to stop watching. It also made me not want to go to the movies. The ending really put a damper on a good movie. If you have seen the original Matrix you have already seen this movie, if you have not watched the original, you may want to give it a chance.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Read more reviews by our customers.  Write a positive review about an OK movie:??  I have not found a movie that I really loved, and I can't even remember one movie that really annoyed me. I don't think I ever sat through a bad film more than once.   I suppose that if you've read this far, you might be interested in a movie about a man named Jeff who works at a bank in an old building in the suburbs. He spends most of his time reading books about old women, and has a girlfriend who is a nurse. He gets a call one day that he's about to be fired, because his co-workers think he's being overly aggressive, and they want a new guy to replace him. Jeff immediately takes the job at the new bank, and when the new guy turns out to be a woman, it's not long before Jeff finds himself having sex with her. Then, a while later, he's fired again. Jeff decides that maybe he should get a real job and find another woman. But he's not sure he's ready for a job at a law firm. Then he learns that he can't be fired until he gets a bachelor's degree. This makes him want to do it right away, so he puts all of his hopes into getting a bachelor degree. It seems like an easy thing to do, until he starts dating this rich widow, and things just get out of control.   The thing that stands out about this movie is that there's a really good plot. I can imagine that a lot of people would have preferred a story about a guy who spends his days reading about old ladies, and dating a rich widow. But Jeff doesn't go on dates with older women. The movie actually goes out of its way to show him hanging out with a bunch of women of all ages. When he finds out that he is going to get fired from the bank, he doesn't rush into things, he waits until he has the money to buy a new apartment. He starts hanging out at the local nightclub, which gets him into more trouble than he anticipated. When things get really bad, he moves back home.   of the people he meets in the nightclub, one of them becomes his lover. When it becomes obvious that they are getting married, he decides to leave the girlfriend and start dating the rich widow instead. But when she starts having doubts, he leaves her and finds another
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only bad thing about this movie is that there is not much to it.    I mean it was a funny movie, which I enjoyed, it had an interesting premise, and it was fun to watch.  It wasn't anything mind blowing either, but it was very fun.  However, this is an exception to the rule, that in this genre of films where the majority of the movie is not that great, I can't say I'm surprised.  I would give this movie a B-, but, that's how much I enjoyed it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You might be disappointed when you see that I gave it a 1 out of 10. My complaint with the movie, if it is one, is that it is not well-written, and doesn't really explain anything of the plot or how it is portrayed. The movie also seems to me like a bunch of random scenes thrown together to get as much screen time as possible (and this isn't a bad thing, but rather an observation). So there are a few scenes that are confusing and poorly done. There is also no real connection to what is happening in the movie (I'm not going to give too much away, but I will say that the movie actually does contain some good character development). All in all, I'm just glad I didn't see it.   Overall:  My wife was going to go with me to see a new movie last week and the kids had come in to see what was new. So I picked up "Jingle All the Way" and took the two youngest with me. My wife got a good laugh out of the movie. The acting was good. I felt that the jokes were well made. I think it was mostly because of the music and not the acting. The story line felt completely random. The main character, Charlie, was supposed to be a big hero. I guess it was a good idea for a movie to be about a kid who is a hero. But, there is nothing to him. The only good thing about the movie is that I liked the music, and the children were getting along, and they liked the characters, so I guess they enjoyed the movie too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a great movie and a good read but it is definitely not a good movie. First, it takes itself way too seriously. That is a lot of what I hate about "This is the End". There is a scene where Michael Cera and Jonah Hill (who I loved) are on a plane. The pilot starts talking to his co-pilot who is in the back, telling him that they have a bomb on board. "Yeah, but I've never done anything like this before!" "No, you haven't," says the pilot. "So that's not very reassuring." This is an over the top scene and it made me cringe. I am a big fan of Cera but I just don't think he is the guy for this. And the plot has no humor to speak of. There is some good stuff at the end but the first half is just not worth it. There are no funny scenes, no funny lines, no good jokes. "This" is just a great story of survival and there is nothing more I can say about it. I think you would be better off watching a movie that was really good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I went to see this film at the Cinemark 16 and the people were very nice and the film was very well made and acted and all the lights in the theater were working. However, the film took forever to start, I was waiting a good 25 minutes for the film to start. After the first 5 minutes, I noticed that the film started to take a weird turn, I did not really care for the whole thing. After that, I just left. My friend came in and said that the theatre was great and that the movie was great. He went to go see another film and came back and told me that this movie was just weird and not for me. We were talking about the movie a good 15 mins and I was telling him about the bad feeling I had when I heard "My name is Jesus Christ, Jesus is my name" and I got a feeling that I was about to see something that will upset me. I came back to this film, and all of the lights were turned on and the movie started and I liked it. However after 15 minutes, my friend left to go to a different movie and I did still not like the movie. The only thing I liked about this movie is it was good for watching on a big screen in a nice theater. "   Read more reviews...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My review:  I had been wanting to see this movie for ages, I watched it at a friend's house a few years ago. I'm not going to lie, I hated it. I mean, I really did. I didn't hate it for being terrible, but for being such an awful movie. You're going to have to really hate a movie to hate it the way I did, and this one was a complete nightmare.  The plot is a mess:  As I've mentioned before, it starts out with two friends talking in their garage about their ex-girlfriends. The movie begins with a great setup, where these two characters are discussing how each ex-gf is different from the other, and how there was something special that happened between them. There's also a very nice scene with a really cool car, but then the whole thing falls apart pretty quickly. The ex-couple is going through a tough time. She has been dumped by her old boyfriend, and she's had a rough break up with her current boyfriend. She's got a boyfriend that she just broke up with and she can't stand him. Then, she gets a message from him saying he loves her and she loves him back. After this message from her ex, things start to get really bad. She sees this guy around her ex-boyfriend, and he's in her car. She then drives off and gets in the truck and leaves her ex in the van. This guy gets out and she then tries to drive off, but he gets in her truck. The guy says something to her, and then he pulls his gun out, and threatens to kill her. She drives off. Then a guy gets into the van and starts beating up the guy she left in the car. He drives off, and her ex turns up at the next scene. This movie is so poorly written that it makes me feel like I'm watching a poorly written movie. The acting in the movie is horrendous. Even though we don't know anything about these characters, we know they are terrible, and the acting is so terrible that I just want to cut my throat and die. Every character is one-dimensional and one-note, and it's really hard to root for anyone. The story just drags on and on with stupid, un-interesting dialogue. The dialogue is written as if it was written in high school. The main character of this movie says "That guy had
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I know this was my first movie, but I was so surprised when I saw this movie. I saw the trailer a while ago and was so happy, that I was not expecting the worst. The acting was really funny. The story was really good. But the acting, the story, and the cinematography sucked. So in my opinion, this movie is like a movie that is just a movie and will never make any money.      You should read my review of the movie   And here are my thoughts about the film.  (Yes, I know the film was released in 2007 and it was only released for 4 weeks, but it was still in cinemas, so I still have to review this movie!)   The story is about a young man who was kidnapped by an assassin. And his friends come to rescue him. What I like about the movie is that it is a thriller. It is very suspenseful. The action scenes were well made and interesting. You have to see the movie to know how cool the action scenes are. The cinematography was good, but again, it was not up to the standards of what we have seen in other movies. But still the movie was fun to watch. The best part about this movie are the acting and the storyline. The performances and the characters are so original. The storyline is like something you have seen before. A young man is taken away by assassins. And he is in a whole lot of danger, and you don't know where he is. There are a few twists to this movie, and they are well done, but none of them are surprising. So it is not an action movie, it is more of a thriller, but with good acting. (I mean, they did the right things, but in my eyes it was very good and well done)   But my real problem with this movie was the plot. The characters were so stupid and the story was so stupid. The movie was supposed to be about an assassination that happened in a village. It was supposed it was going to be a great movie and you would love the movie. It had such a good plot, but we never got to see any action, so we only saw the plot of the story and everything was so dumb. The reason the movie failed is because the plot was so bad. The plot is not as bad as in a bad detective movie, the plot is just stupid. Because we never see the

My expectations weren't met by the film, however. The film failed to live up to the book.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "A man of many faces."   It's easy to tell a good movie when you see one, but is it easier to recognize a bad one? If you've seen a few bad movies, you know that some of them can be funny, while others are pretty awful. But, if you've never seen a movie that has this many bad elements, it is tough to say what it is. The good is still pretty decent, and the movie has its moments, but there's too much here to like it. The story is about a guy who works at a pet shop, and his cat goes missing. He begins to suspect that he may be the cat's owner, and is eventually caught. It's a very simple, yet entertaining story.   There are several things that are wrong with this movie. The premise is a bit convoluted. The guy who has the cat is supposed to be the owner of it, so what if he isn't? The movie takes a very long time to get there. Most of the time it does not explain how and why the guy who is supposed the owner could be able to do that. It doesn't even really make sense that he didn't know that the cat was gone, as he is in the pet shop. The way he was able to get the cat, I mean who else would have the cat? He must have had the cat and taken it somewhere. Then he came back to the pet store and found out that it was missing and all he knows is that someone took it, and that the pet was gone. It is still kind of confusing why he did all of that.  Even when they started this movie, they made it clear that they didn't understand what a cat was.  One of the problems with this is the casting. I was wondering why a guy like that was cast as the owner, since it is supposed he owns the cat. It also doesn't make sense to have a guy with that type of voice be the guy that gets the cat for the owner. Then again, I guess it works because he has a pretty strong voice.  After a lot of bad things happened in this movie and then the climax, I'm not sure if I actually liked this movie because it does go in a bit of a different direction than I expected. It starts off with a woman named Kim (Park Geun-hyung) and her husband giving their children a bath. One of her

"Troy Aikman, the only thing wrong with this film is the voice-over." "This is one of the most pathetic performances ever given by a human being" "I was hoping I would have never had to watch this" "This movie is so ugly and yet so very, very fun." "A masterpiece." "In a year where the Academy awards don't seem to have any meaning anymore, The Wizard of Oz deserves a spot on the list of great American movies." "The Wizard of OZ should have been a smash hit but unfortunately it didn't do so well because it's the opposite of what a great film should be. This is probably the most blatant example of the overuse of editing and the inability of the filmmakers to work with their characters. The story of the movie seems to be one in which a man named Toto, the protagonist in the movie is trying to find his way through this "Wizard of Oz" world, but after all he knows is that "Wiz is not what it seems. A Wizard of an Oz is just a man who goes to another world and finds another man (Toto) there." If you were to take a film where a man wants to find himself in this "Oz" world and his best friend was an ape named Chico, you'd get a different ending than this one, but what's interesting is that they managed to make a movie where an ape and a man have no interest in each other, just because the film is called "Wizards of Oz". The whole film looks very cheap and amateurish, but as a child I still found it so enjoyable and I am glad I grew up with this. My rating is 4/5, because I think the film was better when it was made when it had a budget in the mid-1980s."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (see what I mean?) That's not what this is about. The purpose is to teach kids how to be open to new ideas, to take a step back and realize that they might not like what they see, and to come up with an alternative. So when a film is really bad, the only way to be fair to the movie is to criticize it as much as possible, and be willing to be wrong if a movie is truly bad. Posted by The Mummy at 6:14 AM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Don't believe in Hollywood:  The truth about  The Lone Ranger    :    I've never seen  The  Lone Ranger.  This  review     was written in the fall of 1988.   I remember it as being good but not as good as I would have liked.  I also remember it being bad but I didn't see it in theaters.  What does "the Lone Ranger" mean?   I believe that the term "The Lone Ranger", is a name given to him by Hollywood to save money.  The reason that he is called that is because of his hair color and his appearance.   The actor, Don T. Williams, was originally offered a much larger part and was also offered the role of "The Chief" and "The Green Hornet" but they turned him down.   These two would have been in the film and they would have had to wear red outfits.   Williams was offered a small part to play "The Captain".   This role would have cost around $2,000.   This would have paid for his transportation to and from the set.   Another reason that the film was canned was because of the "gift" of the Lone Ranger being played by the actor.   His gift was that he was "too good" for the part of the hero.   When Williams was told that he would have to walk down the street holding the rifle in a pose as if he was shooting, he said that "This is what my agent asked for.   We can't pay for that."   Williams went on to say, "I wanted to do that in my last picture."   This was the reason that was given for why the movie was cancelled.   However, it wasn't cancelled for the last time.   It was only cancelled for a short while until MGM wanted the role for a much smaller budget.   He was then offered the part "The Kid" (although his character was later changed) and that was why the film stayed in production.   If it wasn;t for this "gifting", the film could have been made with a much more modest budget. So, what was "The Man Who Killed Roger Rabbit"?   When he was born, he was taken to the Hollywood Hospital where the doctor performed a complete hysterectomy (no more menstruation or periods) and replaced his bladder with a man's penis.   He was
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a well-made action movie. The action scenes are exciting and well choreographed. The movie's script and script quality are average at best.   The movie has a story line which seems to be taking a few places and ending in a cliffhanger. This story line is very well done and the ending does not feel rushed or anticlimactic.  The main star of this movie is the amazing Michael Myers.  Michael Myers is scary, and he has this really evil and creepy face which is hard to look at.  He also has a deep, deep voice which is a bit hard to hear.  It is not just that he has a creepy voice, but that he is in a very creepy suit.  In fact, it is impossible to hear his suit because it has a very powerful vibrating effect which makes it hard to even see him.  I believe that the reason why the movie works so well is because of the fact that the movie is set in the early 70s and all the actors and models are very well made.  This movie also has some really well choreo'd action scenes which are executed very well.  There are two types of action scenes in this movie: 1) The action is very good. 2) The movie takes a different direction and ends in a really bad way.  These two scenes are very effective in building suspense and making you think about what is happening.  There are also a few great music cues.  But the movie really fails to create a complete mood throughout the entire movie.  If you love the Saw franchise, this is a very good movie and a great way to spend a nice Halloween evening.  One thing that I found really annoying is the scene with the naked woman.  Why doesn't this movie have a scene where the naked girl, who is naked with her back to the audience, gets killed by a car?  Why does no one die in this scene.  Is it because that this woman is too sexy and no one wants to kill her, or are people afraid of being caught naked with a dead girl?  I think it is the latter, but I could be wrong.  Overall, I think this movie has great action sequences and it would be worth watching if you are interested in action movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am not a big fan of slasher movies, so I am really glad that the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a good one. The movie was a hit with me, but that is not to say that I had a lot of fun with it. This film is much more than a remake, and I think that is the key to why people like it so much. There is a lot to enjoy about this film and one of the reasons why I am giving it the thumbs up is because it doesn't have to be an obvious remake. The original version of this film was made by Tobe Hooper, and that is what this film gets right. If you like the first film, there is a LOT to enjoy in the remake. This version of the film is a direct sequel to the original film, and the story has been completely changed. The whole time, I was wondering what was going to happen and I thought that Hooper was just going to make a cheap film and then a few years after the original version, he would make a sequel to this film, but then the studio would refuse to let him make the sequel. I thought, when the sequel would finally get made, that it would be some more action and this would be a good movie. I was wrong, and it turned out to be something completely different. In this movie, the main character of Leatherface is played by an absolutely insane makeup artist named Stephen Dorff. Dorff, who was known for his makeup work in the 1970's, made a lot more gore-hounds go, "WOW". This was a very frightening movie and was a good reminder of why I wanted to see The Texas Chain Saw Massacre a long time ago. Another great thing about this movie is that there was a lot that was not explained in the original. The killer, Leatherface, was actually quite intelligent and he understood what he was doing. If I had not seen the remake, I would have never known that. This also means that if you are looking for a good horror movie without all the gore and gore-like moments, I highly suggest you give this film a watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A   B   C   D   This movie did not do it for me. I could not get into this movie. It did not give me that much excitement as I expected it to. The story was not really exciting, but it had all the plot points you would expect. The acting was bad, even with the few performances, the dialogue and dialogues were very cliched, cheesy and cheesy at that. It all got a bit boring after a while and it really didn't do much for me at all. But I guess if you are looking for a cheap, but entertaining, and a quick movie, then this is definitely for you.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You are right.   In this movie, the actor who plays the lead in the movie, is very much just a little too much of an asshole.  It is not a bad acting job by him, but the film really should have been called "I am very sick and tired of all these fucking black people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It doesn't matter if you're a fan of horror movies or not, you can't deny that every movie has its bad moments.   One of the biggest bad moments I had while watching "The Last House on the Left" was in a scene where some soldiers were fighting with a zombie.  To show how serious the situation was, the zombies had been eating people who were laying in a cemetery. When the soldiers started to run out of ammo, they started to shoot the zombies with their rifles.  At that moment, a zombie ripped a hole in a soldier's side, sending him flying into the air.  After a few moments, the guy got up and ran back into the cemetery.  Unfortunately, I found out later that the zombie got his head stuck in the soldier's body, and that he died from a brain hemorrhage.  I didn't know that the zombies would become so violent.  However, this was one of my favorite scenes in the entire movie, especially because it wasn't long before the zombies started to attack more people.  Another big bad moment came when some zombies made their way into a house.  The scene where the zombies are eating people was amazing.  It was awesome seeing a group of zombies eating people at the same time.  Even though it was good to see the zombies eat people, it was really sad to see so many people get eaten.  When I heard that they killed a lot of people, I was really surprised.  Also, I have to say that this movie has a lot more violence than a lot horror movies, and I loved that.  This was one movie that didn't have a lot to do with zombies, and there's no reason why it should have been called "The Zombie Apocalypse".  I still think it's a great movie, though.  And the ending was a nice surprise.  As for "Last House on The Left" itself, it's not my favorite horror movie.  There were some pretty bad lines in this movie, and the gore was kind of weak.  Some of the monsters also look too realistic.  Overall, it is a fun movie, but not a masterpiece.  But the film itself is great.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        My daughter loved it, but I have been trying to watch it with a friend for a while and she hates it. It's hard to understand why the producer wanted to make a horror movie based on a TV show that was cancelled after two seasons, but the director went ahead and did it. I think the reason it made it to the big screen, was because it was so hard to turn off.   I think this is a pretty good movie for a horror film, because it's not trying to be a horror picture, it's just a story. The characters are real and you feel them, but at the same time, you can't get too attached to them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is not a good movie. There are many bad movies and this is one of them.   I watched this when I was in college and I hated it. The plot was terrible. The first half was not bad but the plot just kept getting worse.  The plot went from a boring guy just getting the girl he wanted and the guy he wanted was not there to give it to him to an evil woman trying to take away a man's love and his children.  She does so by kidnapping the husband and having him do things for her for no reason other than to hurt his family and kill them all.  This movie is a huge mistake in the whole of movie history.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "This movie sucked. It was all just stupid and pointless. Nothing happened except for a few jokes." I see. But the joke was on the audience. I love you. No more than that. I am sorry. I don't want to see you. I just want to stop by the movie and laugh at your silly faces.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the story of a man named "Homer" who is given the job of helping the local hospital find a new way to cure a disease that has killed half the population of Springfield.   I didn't like this movie as much as the other Springfield films (I thought they were okay), but I thought it was well done.  It took a while to get going, and there were a few spots where the plot was pretty dull, but once the movie got going, it didn't let up.  There's a scene at the end of the movie where Homer is working on the cure for the disease he has helped cure, but then the doctors are murdered and the hospital staff is sent to work on a fake cure that was put in the center of a nearby cemetery.  The doctors were the real ones who worked on that fake cure, which was to make a cure that would be very effective against the disease.  (This is pretty common with horror movies.  You want to be able to tell people are going to die, but you don't want them to die too much.)  The movie took an interesting path that gave the audience a good reason to think of how scary the real thing can be, but didn't make the characters or the story really scary.  I found this to be a good way to end the movie.    This is not a movie that would win any awards if it weren't for being one of the most memorable movies ever.  The writing was good, the characters were good, and the plot of the film was actually fairly interesting.  This movie is great for a Halloween treat!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     If someone has a negative opinion about a movie, they're either a) not paying attention and b) don't understand it.   In all fairness, I'm not a film critic so I can't speak to the quality of the movies in question.  This particular film was a complete bore. It was a generic western that had been filmed with CGI to look like a classic western.  If you were to see it, your only goal in life would be to get your life insurance.  The film was poorly written, with a story that was so contrived you almost felt like you were watching a sitcom. The entire film seemed to be one big joke, and was incredibly dull. The characters didn't have any depth to them, and the main character, Tommy, seemed like an extremely unlikable asshole.  In the end, it just felt like an excuse to make a film and sell it. A joke in a movie isn't a bad thing per se, but I could really see this being one of those comedies that you watch once and never ever go back to.  I think the producers are just having a laugh at people's expense, but to be honest, the film is just so lame that I can barely bring myself to look at it any more.  I really would have loved to see a more creative and unique idea about how to make this movie work. It's kind of frustrating that the film didn't turn out as great as it possibly could.  -5/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was the worst movie ever.   I wouldn't recommend this to a friend.  The movie was so horrible, and they even got some actors' names wrong.  The movie was about a guy who is sent to an internment camp.  My boyfriend told me he had to go to an "internment camp" when I told him it was in Michigan, so he told me to watch the film, so I did.  They put in a guy as an intern that was the same guy in a movie.  I had my boyfriend watch the movie before I had him watch it, and I asked him if this was a bad idea, and he said yes.  He said he doesn't even know if the movie was actually shot there.  So, my boyfriend and I were on a train when he said, "I'm sorry but this is the worst film I have ever seen.  There is nothing funny in this movie. It is horrible."   He then went on to tell me the reason the movie is bad.  "You will not believe what this guy in this film does."  He went on:  "He lies on the job, he says a woman he's dating has been raped when in fact he has not.  His friends call him a 'cuckold' and he sleeps with one of his co-workers."  This guy is really out of it.  It is the end of the first film.  This movie is horrible.  We are going to have a hard time trying to watch it with another human being.  Don't watch this movie, unless you want to see some guy you know being called a cuckold and sleeping with one (or more) of his coworkers.  If you like the movie, go to the movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137350/ The last few films in this series are the worst movies I have seen. It started with the first movie, but it has been getting worse.  Some of the actors are not that good, and some of the people are not very good.  One of the characters even says "I don't really think I know what the word "cuckolding" means."  One woman actually says that it was okay for the other woman to give her husband a blowjob, because he was a c-h-i-p-p.  In the end,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What happens when the good news about a movie is outweighed by the bad? I think the answer to that is:  The movie ends up being okay. That's not an entirely fair statement, since The Room is a great movie. But the reason it's a great film is the same reason it wasn't a great one:  The Room is about a guy who wants to go camping and falls in love with a girl who has fallen in love a man. The two end up camping in a cabin in the woods for three nights, after which they get caught in a snowstorm and trapped in the cabin by a blizzard.  What it turns out, in a nutshell, is that the movie's main character has fallen into a trance because he's in love and he doesn't want to leave. He wants to keep her because she's his thing. It's a classic story of love at first sight, but it doesn't actually work as well as that story would imply. The fact that the man gets trapped in this situation is a very effective joke, and it's funny in the moment, but after a while it starts to feel like the film is just making a joke about the situation and its possible implications. It doesn't feel very funny at all. The Room works as a horror movie mostly because of how absurd and unbelievable the situation is. And that's why it works so well, because it's so ridiculous. It is also an effective story about a man being trapped in a room for three weeks without food or water and then having to rely on someone else for everything else: the TV, the camera, the phone. And I'll talk more about those aspects in a little bit. But first, a quick summary of the story, so you can understand why it's working as well and why The Room feels so weird and awkward:  The main character is Kyle, a young man who is very introverted, and doesn't really like people. This is a part of what makes the film so enjoyable, because Kyle seems like the perfect sort of guy for being stuck in this cabin for three straight nights. He is in love, after all. So he can't really be in a good mood. And it's pretty clear that he's been thinking about the same girl all along:  Kyle is in a very strange situation. He has fallen for a girl (the girl from the first part of the movie), and he has also fallen for the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    And don't expect to get any credit for doing so.   It's not that you're not an actor.    It's just that there are many other people involved in a movie and that is a big part of the problem.  And if someone is going to say a movie is bad and that there's too much dialogue or that they sound like they're just miming, or that the writing is bad, then that is not a compliment.  If you don't see that you are taking the movie too seriously and that the actors aren't really doing their job or that dialogue is just being mumbled, then you are simply being lazy.  A bad film can't be all that great if you don' t get the enjoyment out of watching it.  It should be entertaining because you are watching a movie.  When the actors suck, they should suck.  They are not the star of the film and it's obvious that they are just there to make the movie "funny." The bad film will not do itself justice.  But if you are a good actor and you get the chance to shine in a film, then do it. But don't take the easy way out.  Or, at least don't suck at it like the movie does.  You're not going to have a hit movie.   But if a bad film is going too far, then it should at least be entertaining.  The best movies, at their worst, always have a lightness and a nice mood.  All the characters are there to be lovable or be funny or be likeable or make you laugh or make things look beautiful.  So if you can't make a good film, try making a great film, and then make a better one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      A young, attractive, sexy girl is in an elevator with a stranger, and the guy begins to talk to her and kiss her. She turns around, and says, "This man is very strange. He's very friendly, but you feel he's going to push you off." The elevator stops and they kiss again. Then she turns back and says "No, don't you get it? I'm very sexy and he wants to kiss me. It seems he just wants to use me." The girl says, with her best fake British accent, "Yes, that's exactly it. I'm so sexy, I'm a sexual object. The guy just wants me to be an object. He is so focused on me, he just doesn't see anything else. I'd give anything to just get out of here." And just as she was saying that, the guy said, "How about we go upstairs? I promise we'll go to a nice hotel, and I'll show you a nice place. You know, we can go to the movies and do other things." She agreed, but when they got up there, there was a woman who looked like her, and a man with the same kind of smile, but was not her. The woman asked them how they liked it, and they said it was wonderful. She then asked them if they were having fun, and all the girls nodded their heads. She was very friendly and the man was charming. The man said, and this was a very nice girl, "You see, I want a girl like that." He then got up and said, with a big smile on his face, "Just get her out of there. I can get us an even better hotel." He got up to go. The girl tried to stop him, but the man got away with it. Later that night he called back to say he was happy with his girl.       He really did try to get a girl with the looks and the personality and the good looks and everything, and then get her.     He really wanted her.   And so, when I heard all these stories, I thought, "What a guy. What a creep." Then I listened to "The Mask of Zorro," a story by Robert E. Howard and it scared the hell out of me. Here is a guy who wanted to get something from a girl, and he did it. It is
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My review:  The most disturbing part of this movie was when it revealed that the whole film takes place in a psychiatric ward. It wasn't much of a surprise since there's been plenty of horror films set in a mental hospital over the years. I am not a fan of this genre and there's no better way to spend an afternoon than in the dark in a hospital bed with your eyes taped shut. It's a little boring as there's only three "night" segments and none of them really have anything to do with each other. The first one focuses on the nurses who are responsible for giving the patients the medicine they need. They've become obsessed with a "doll" named "Bambi". When the doll starts acting out, their only thought is that she's actually possessed by a demon. This is really played for laughs as it seems like the nurses get off on tormenting the "dolls". I was not impressed with the ending. It was so predictable and poorly paced that I was just left with a lot of questions. There's a nice twist at the end that adds a little excitement to the whole thing, but it comes out of nowhere and doesn't really make the film any better. There are some good performances, but no actors stood out to me. The cinematography by Brian D. Allen is great in a couple of shots but it really fell apart near the end. It looks great in the beginning but the end is terrible and the music sucks. It might not have been the best horror movie to watch, but you'll have to settle for it if you want some laughably bad movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My impression of this movie is that it's a very cheap and bad film. It's very cheesy. The actors are all terrible (as usual) and the movie just isn't good at all. It was made to make money, but I doubt it made more than a hundred dollars in it's lifetime. I was actually so bad that I was just laughing at the jokes, and I mean that in the best way. The story isn't even good. It takes place in a very small city and the characters are all very dull. It should be no surprise that it would work at a low-budget film because it does work. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't make it's money back. It doesn't even make sense. It just isn;t a good film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really liked this movie a lot. I think that it could be a great movie for children. I hope that it doesn't get the remake it deserves. I have a feeling that it will be a good movie with good music and I would love it if it is as good as the trailer. It has great characters and great art in the film.  Helpful good and I had a lot of fun. And now the final word is... I have been in love with the world of the film since I read the book. It is so different from anything I have seen. It may be weird for adults but I don't think it will ever get boring. I could watch this movie over and over again. I am so happy that I finally got to see this film and I will now watch it again. It was so amazing. I will definitely go and see the movie again. If you like horror and the characters in this film I highly recommend that you watch it! I will leave you with this quote from the film: "What is the purpose of life? To see what you can make yourself. What will you have?" (from "The Mummy" The Movie)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So I'm sure you already know about this, but if you don't, watch the movie: "Cinderella Man" It's a little hard to tell where the truth ends and fiction begins. I think this movie is terrible, but I'm not sure what exactly it is about the film that's so bad. There are many things I don't like about this movie, but it's pretty hard to separate them from the experience. The movie centers around a man named Daniel who has a problem with girls. While at a party he comes across a young girl who looks just like him. He gets her to go with him and he makes the mistake of being so enthralled with her that he never checks in with his new friend. The whole thing takes a strange turn as the girl disappears without a trace, but Daniel isn't completely out of the loop. She sends him an email with a picture of him on it that says, "I'm back, I'm back for good". That same day, he gets an email from her with the text, "Daniel, where are you? I'm so upset." I have to say, I don´t get that part. I'm thinking he must have left her in the middle of nowhere, right? After that, things get complicated because his friend comes over and asks him if he's heard from his sister. After all that Daniel has a hard time coming to terms with it all and starts making up stories about the young girl, which are so ridiculous that it's just really funny to watch. After that he starts to wonder where she might be. In the end I just didn't get it, but for those who do, it's a very entertaining movie, although not very good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A film can be a good film or a bad film. A bad film is a bad picture, or a picture that is of poor quality.    To do this, a film should not be a bad one.   It should be a film that has been shot and is of good quality. If it is of decent quality, then it is not a bad thing to have a bad production.   This is a way of looking at the film.   A bad picture is one that is bad, or one that has a poor production.   This can also be done for a film, or at least for a movie.  The film may not be great, but it is good enough to make it into a good movie. The film does not have to be a really good film, but not a terrible one.  A lot of people, when they do a film in the early 90's, do not even go through the trouble of a good production, but make a bad ones.   Film production is a very different thing than a good picture.  Sometimes films are a good piece of production, and you have a good story, and a good acting, but just not a good one. If a movie is good, but has a bad story, or bad acting, or is of very poor production, then you can see the difference between a good and a bad piece of film production. How to use a bad scene as a good scene:  For a bad sequence in a film you can think of using it as a great sequence.  You can then think about how much better the film would be if it had a better one, and vice versa.  For example, one of my favorite scenes in a movie, is the sequence in the film in which the main character, Richard, walks to and from school.  This is the scene that really made the film and made it what it was.  It really shows that Richard is more than just a nerd.  It shows him as a man, who has his own feelings and wants.  The scene, is, of course, horrible, but at the same time, it works as a perfect example of the idea of using a scene as its own film. This is a scene that I remember very well.  My father was a teacher when I was growing up.  There was a kid who was obsessed with Richard, and one day he took a photo of Richard and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the past 10 years, I have watched many great films in Japan. I would like to share with you, that in my opinion, it is very hard to find good Japanese movies. But if you are willing to put in the time and energy, you will enjoy a great Japanese film. There are many films that I like, and the ones that I would recommend are: Nagaoka: The Lost Island (1997), The Red Turtle (1987), The Man Who Knew Too Much (1986), The Woman Who Leapt Through Time (1981), Kiki's Delivery Service (1989), The Black Prince (1989), Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (1984), Yojimbo (1961), The Ghost Writer (1970), and The Matrix trilogy (1999). I have not been a big fan of "action films". I prefer dramas, or I feel the story should have more emotional impact. But a film that has a lot of action doesn't bother me. I like a lot the films that have a lot more mystery than action. I think that the best way to be "inspired" is to study movies like Kurosawa (and then read his books) and then watch his films. I just watched a new Japanese film by Koji Wakamatsu called "Sakura-sai (The Garden of Lilies)" and it was really good. If you go to the cinema, be prepared to hear a lot! It's like listening to a great piece of music. The film is called Sakura-saisai (Tomb) and the main character, "Yūsei" is a samurai who wants to become a warrior and fight in a historical battlefield. The main character is a woman who knows the story of "Yuzo" who is the main figure in the "Yoshida" story and her father, "Matsuda" the general of the "Kishinev Military Organization" who sent Yuzo to fight on the battlefield. It's a story about war, and it's about a very tragic love. It was quite interesting to watch and I liked it very much. It really makes a good starting point for a film-fan to enjoy "Tomb".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Don't bother.    I didn't see this movie until later on in the week and I didn;t feel like I had seen it at all.  I mean it is a horror movie and there are elements of that in there, but it isn't anything amazing.  This movie was a total bore.  It wasn't scary or even thought provoking.  When I think of a horror or even horror themed movie I think, oh shit this is going to be intense, or bloody, or creepy.  That's the movie this is not.    I don't want to give it any more stars than it deserves, but I don' want to add it to my movie collection.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    How about a movie about a person who is always trying to be cool?   Well, don't worry, he's a good person, and he's only trying to do what's right.   The movie opens with a montage of various interviews with him (including a brief interview from his early days with the band the Smiths, and a few interviews from his years with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, as well as interviews with his wife and son).   He's a man who has gone through a lot of personal turmoil over the years, and as he's telling the stories of those difficult years, he tries to tell us something about himself.  He tells us how he met his wife, for example, and how they were together for 25 years.  But, while he tells us a lot, I have to wonder:  How is this guy going to relate to the average person?  He talks about how he's got a "nervous breakdown" when he saw some rock stars, but that didn't really happen.  And the best part?  The kid in the band that he was in was actually a pretty good guitarist (and a great singer), and he was a lot more cool and "authentic" than the "bad" ones in his band (who are referred to only by their first name, and who would rather be playing football).  In one interview, he talks about his own time on stage, about how some of the acts were just "bros", and that he never really felt good about the whole thing.  While he's talking about this he's showing us his guitar playing in his "rock" phase.  It's as if he's saying "Yeah, but, in a weird way, I was a cool guy in high school!"  But that's not the way he is talking about it.  As he's reminiscing about some of those memories, the movie cuts to shots of a different "nerves" he had as a kid.  They cut to a shot of him as a punk rock kid. How ironic!  He shows us a long, long series of interviews with the punk rock scene, including one interview with a young Michael Jackson.   But he tells the story of his "nurses".  He explains how one of them is now a nurse, and that there are a bunch of nurses that used to be band members in that group. He talks
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     It is an interesting story. This is not a documentary. This movie is a thriller and thriller often gets overlooked, but it is so good and not a fake, but an artful one. So it is a good film. The only problem is the pacing. There are 2 movies that do it well, the first is "A Tale of Two Sisters", the second is "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo". So the pace is a bit slow, and the last 10 minutes just are not needed. But this movie is worth watching, and I guess it is not about a long movie, but about a good story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You have a pretty good time watching this movie. The best way to describe it is that it has a little bit of everything. There are the obvious and the good, but there's also the bad. If you are someone that enjoys a little comedy mixed in with a little drama mixed in, then this movie is for you. It's one of those movies you have to watch with the kids at the pool or even if you are at home, to see how much fun you can have at the same time. This is a family movie at its core, and so there are some pretty funny moments. It makes you want to do a dance, get up and make out with your girlfriend or your wife or some other loved one. Some of the scenes are just amazing. The story has a good twist at the end that I don't think you would have expected. There is also a lot of action as well, which is always a plus. The only drawback is that the ending leaves a little too much unanswered. If they had just done the whole movie from the beginning, I don�t think the whole story would have had to be told at the time. It would have been better to have it all at the beginning. But it didn't hurt the movie too much and it certainly wasn't the ending that made the movie. I liked it, but not as much as I liked some of the other things I've seen in the past. So, give this one a try if you�re looking for a comedy and some action. I think you will like it and I think that you will have a lot more fun than I did watching it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never really been a horror film fan. My mom is from Pittsburgh so I have a pretty skewed vision of what horror is like. I had never seen any horror films but had seen some of the more popular ones. I decided to see this one. I don't know why but I figured that this one would be alright. I was wrong. The film begins with the creepy "movie trailer" of a girl and her cat who were attacked by a mysterious monster. As the film begins there are scenes of the girl running in the woods trying to get away. She encounters the same monster as in the trailer. She runs through the woods looking for a way out. Once she gets to the edge of the woods a car is in front of her. The girl goes inside to try to scare the driver off and runs into a tree and starts to panic. She then finds that her dad has been kidnapped by the kidnappers. It turns out they have taken the camera and some of their stuff. She goes back to the house and turns on the camera. This is where it gets creepy. We see some of her dad's clothes laying around the house. As she tries to work out what to do she starts seeing strange things. She sees a woman in the doorway and a man outside of it. The guy turns around and they are both wearing the same clothes as the woman. They then start to talk about the movie and what happened to her dad. The first time I saw it this was scary but it wasn't the scariest of the film. It was pretty much a remake of "The Silence of the Lambs". It was much more realistic. Now it gets weird. She meets her dad who has now been transformed into a man. They have this conversation where he tells her how he escaped. It is kind of creepy that they would turn him into a guy in the middle of a forest. We are also introduced to her mom and dad's cat. After that we have a brief shot of her mom's room. The mom runs out of her room and runs through a room and out the window and onto the freeway. She gets on the freeway and then has an accident. The next scene was her getting off the freeway by herself. Now the camera zooms back to her getting out of the car and the next scene shows her at the hospital. At the hospital she sees a very strange looking man (that is clearly not her dad) talking to her mother. We
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was terrible. I loved this movie when I watched it when it came out in the 80s. I saw it on TV before I had any idea what the movie was about or who the characters were. It is about a boy named Tom who goes to see a play with his friend James (Marlon Brando). I have heard so many great reviews about the movie but I thought it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was really stupid and poorly acted. The movie starts with Tom and James sitting in their car waiting to go to the play. The car breaks down and Tom has to make the trek home. A man with no legs tries to get on the road but he can't and is kicked off the road by Tom and is left lying on the side of the road in the rain. Soon after Tom and his friend see this man they start talking to him and he starts to talk to them. The man, named Jimmy (Burt Lancaster) starts to tell them his story about his life and the accident that left him in that situation. It turns out that Jimmy was in the military and the war had messed up his spine. It got messed up after he got married and had kids but his spine was back to normal when he died a few years later. The story of the accident, how Jimmy's life was affected, how the soldiers messed up and how they treated Jimmy as a child in a small town after they messed him up is really horrible. The whole thing was kind of lame and just made me hate the movie. The acting was bad and the characters didn't make any sense. The only thing good about the entire movie was the music. The music is great but it just gets in your head and you can't listen to it. I could understand how a movie like this could be made. I just didn't see why it was made this way. The scene where Jimmy's sister goes in and sees how bad his spine is and she tells Jimmy's wife (Jane Fonda) is one of my favorite scenes in the entire film. It really made me sad when I found out that she died. This movie is not worth seeing. This is a complete waste of time. If you have never seen this movie before, it is okay, but the movie is better without Fonda in it. My rating: 4 stars
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Don't do it.   When you're a good movie reviewer, you'll review a bad one and have a lot to say about it. But it's better to talk about a great movie than a bad guy.  Let me give you an example:  So you have to choose between two movies - one about a cop who solves crimes by using his wits and his gadgets, and another that stars a woman who has some issues.  And while you're considering which movie to watch, you've got to figure out whether you want a cop movie or a female lead movie.  But the movie you want is the movie that stars an amazing female lead who has a lot of problems.  In a lot more movies, the woman who steals the show is the one who has the most problems. In this movie, the main character is the same, but his female co-star is the most interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It does not make sense that the protagonist is not affected by the bad things around him, yet he does them because he has this inner moral code. He does it because he thinks it is the right thing to do. Yet the things around his keep changing and he keeps going through them, he keeps being pushed down into hell. This makes no sense. Why does the movie keep making a hell of a mess out of this? There is nothing wrong with the movie. It is good at a basic level. However, as a whole, this movie is awful. What was wrong with this movie:

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie in the theater after a friend convinced me to. I watched it because it was called "Dirty Grandpa" so I wanted to see what was on the screen that had me intrigued. The movie opens with a very dramatic scene as a man is being arrested. His name is "Dickens" and he is a criminal who murders people. His house is a rat hole and he has been in it for many years. The cops find him and put him in jail. However, when they take him to the cells, he tells them, "No, no, I didn't do it. I just was doing some housekeeping." The guy looks at the cell, looks at his handcuffs, and sees they are for women only. He then takes his wife out of prison and leaves her at the police station. His wife then gets into the house and the cops come in and try to catch her. He kills her and takes some of her hair. The police find his body and he gets killed for his crime.   I really enjoyed this movie. There are some funny moments, but this movie does have a darker tone. The music and visuals are interesting and are quite entertaining. This movie has been described as "a true story." The acting is excellent. The story is interesting and the plot is fairly well developed. The script has some good ideas that are just a bit far fetched, but overall, the movie is very entertaining and well worth watching.  Don't judge a book by its cover: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Please, don't do this to us.  We don't know you or what your motivations are, and that's very, very dangerous.   Thank you for the information.  The best advice I can give anyone who asks about this topic is: If you are going to ask a question, be very clear about what you want answered and why.  If you're asking a question about the internet, have a quick Google search (or if you're a seasoned blogger, have the patience to read through this page) and see what you get.  For one, it's very clear that the "Internet has made the world smaller, more dangerous and more complicated".  But the second reason:  There are so many movies out there, and not all of them are bad.  And you're probably going to find one that you like better than the rest.  My husband and I saw a movie called "American Pie" about 30 years ago.  That was actually my first movie, and I didn't know what a movie was or what movies were about.  We were totally enthralled, and still are.   The movie made me think about how we use movies, and whether movies can really make us feel like we're actually there in the story, which is something we love to do on occasion.  So if you haven't seen this movie, check it out.   There are two kinds of movie reviewers on the net, those who are interested in films only as commercial entertainment, and those who care deeply about the films they review.  The former are more likely to be people who've only seen the commercials for the movie, who aren't really fans of the movies they review, and are therefore more likely not to give a movie a positive review.    "How many people in your family are you related to?"

How can the "friends" we have with people on the other side of the world really be friends if we are so completely different in so many ways? How many friends do you really have in your life?  We all need friends.  But we also know that there are certain friendships that don't last.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I will admit that The Room was a movie that I didn't really enjoy. It was so bad and so slow paced that I felt like I was watching a boring documentary or something. It's a very weird movie that takes a while for everything to happen, and it's hard to follow along with a film that's so slow and boring.   In terms of its storyline, the movie is about a group of friends at a house party.  I think that what I liked about the story is that it is told in a documentary style that is actually kind of interesting in its own way.  It gives us a look into a very small group of people's lives that goes from very strange to very normal, but there are still so many unanswered questions. I can't help but think that The Place Beyond The Pines could have been done better, but it still does a good job in conveying its story.  The acting from everyone in the cast was really well done. I found that everyone really gave a good performance and the movie was really unique in its story telling and acting style.  There are quite a few different scenes and characters in this movie, and I really enjoyed learning about each one of them.  If you want a movie to watch to see how people act around each other then this is a movie for you!   Summary:  The Room is a very strange movie that deals with many different topics. While some scenes are kind of boring, there are some really good performances from the actors and a cool documentary style style that gives it a whole new layer of weirdness. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - - -  - - I was at a friend's house recently when a new movie began playing, and the room fell silent. A man stood up in the middle of the theater and started speaking to the audience about how the movie was "not very good." The scene ended with an awkward silence. I felt a bit confused, but didn't question the man. After all, he was talking to the movie-going public. But I couldn't help but question his statements. I have to admit, I was a little disappointed by the movie. The first act was mediocre at best, and by the end the movie felt a little empty. "We need to fight a big evil. Who will be our best friend? A woman, a man or an alien?" The alien had a cute voice, but I thought the movie could have done a better job at making me care about the alien. The alien was a weak character with a bad attitude, and I couldn?t help but feel a bit sorry for her. The main character, a woman, was also a bit of a weak one. She had to fight off three aliens and was forced to give her life for another alien. I also felt bad for her since her alien companion was a man, so the man had to do all the heavy lifting. I?m sure there were some cool aliens in the movie, but my impression was that this was a lackluster film.

It's like watching a movie with no sound and no sound effects." - -   -   - A few years ago, this was supposed to be a big hit. The studio wanted to give the film a lot of publicity, so they hired a good looking director. The whole movie was marketed as a "supernatural thriller," and I was excited about seeing a film with lots of "out-there" elements. I watched this movie, and it was not like I expected it to be.  This movie took place in the woods of Vermont, and was about a family who lived a few miles away. The parents, who were married, were killed when the other family members saw a mysterious white light in the sky. The movie followed a couple as they journeyed into the woods to search for their dead
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like I said above, I really liked this movie, but if you take away the annoying plot holes (why didn't they just make all the vampires female?), you will have a solid movie.   In fact, this movie really reminded me a lot of The Shining.     I have to say that I enjoyed this movie so much, I would suggest to everyone, that if you ever find yourself with a weekend (or even week), just watch this movie.       I give it a B, if you know what I mean.

I bought it and laughed at it for a few minutes, but then I put it aside and gave it a miss. The movie just isn't that funny. It is also not that well done, and at times it is really slow and boring. It seems that the producers didn't do a great job of working with actors and that they did not think of the right jokes. There is a reason why this movie is just a bit behind schedule and they didn't think of it. The cast was decent and the director and writer were good. I had a few laughs, but the movie never really stuck with me. "
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "The Good Lie was a horrible movie. It was boring and poorly written, it never once managed to entertain and it was painfully obvious that the writers had not done their research. It really was a waste of my time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you're gonna review the worst movie ever made, don't be a dick.  The worst movie to ever come out was released in 1995. A movie that was supposed to blow people's minds, yet it left an even bigger crater in the public's psyche. The movie that took the top spot on IMDB.com was, for all intents and purposes, a horrible, horrible experience. That's saying something, especially for a movie based on a true story. I mean, this isn't like, The Big Lebowski. No one had actually seen that before. This was like, the first time anyone had ever seen this movie. The story of "The Ring" begins with an older woman (played by Anna Paquin) being sold to a man named Michael. She is brought to his mansion and is told that he wants her to have a baby. She agrees and has the baby. In the meantime, her husband, played by Colin Farrell, attempts to get a divorce. That is not until his ex-wife, played here by Michelle Monaghan, finds out about the baby and begins to plot to kill Michael. I'm not going to get into the specifics of the plot of this movie because the gist of it is that Michael has a ring that has magic powers. His ex-girlfriend, played again by Michelle, convinces her husband to murder Michael for the ring and take the ring to the police. The only problem with this is that the cops don't believe him. They are actually afraid that this woman is lying about her husband having the ring. That leads to a crazy chase scene in which the wife is shot at by cops, and then later gets shot in the arm by a cop during a foot chase. The woman, played really well by Michelle again, also gets shot by a police officer, who was apparently playing "chicken" with the scene. This movie is so bad, it's insane. The acting isn't horrible, but the story lines are extremely contrived and don't really make sense. The screenplay is so badly written that the movie literally took a week to shoot. All the actors did so poorly that they couldn't even act, let alone act believably. So what is this movie actually about? Well, it was a remake of a movie called "The Man Who Killed Don Quixote." I know right? It's like they decided to make a fake sequel to that movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Cinema is a form of art. It should not be manipulated, exploited, and, for that matter, misrepresented. If you find a movie lacking, don't leave it to your imagination. Don't give the filmmakers a pass because they were not aware of something. Don�t be a critic:   The movie was not good, but neither did it deserve to be bad. For years, this film has been unfairly condemned by critics and audiences alike because of the fact that it is a poorly made film with poor acting, mediocre story, and uninspired and uninteresting characters. Some critics have even said that the movie is a "disaster" that "should not have happened."  What is the movie about?  A young mother (Emma Thompson) is determined to get her young child to school on time. She and her husband (Paul Walker) have gone to Mexico for the holidays, and she needs him to help her find her way. They end up in the mountains on a small train and begin to be drawn into the mystery of who killed their friend and why. Meanwhile, the wife�s boyfriend (Paul Hogan) is in trouble with the law, and so he hires a band of gunmen to get rid of the couple.  Why did it fail?  A lot of critics have said that this film is a complete disaster. As such, it received poor ratings in the ratings service and has been labeled as a �horror� film. In this case, �horrror� is used as a subjective term. It is true that the film had some scary moments, but it is not a good horror movie. It could have been a truly scary movie if the filmmakers had spent more time developing their characters and developing a more serious plot. In the end, this movie is more about the characters than the plot. It doesn�t do much with its concept and just spends more time showing what people who are going to get into trouble do in the face of danger. The result is an average film. The film does have some good scenes and some strong performances. Paul Walker is not the best actor in the world, but he certainly has the right kind of charisma. His performance is very well-balanced. The film has a few scenes that will stay with you, such as when he and Emma Thompson's characters are forced to sit together in the dark, and that will stick with you for years. The
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm pretty sure I could write a negative book review or two about the poor quality of this movie and have a more positive review to back it up. This movie has no redeeming features. I thought it would be a fun romp. It didn't live up to the hype. I was disappointed. I understand people don't like horror movies. I don't see why someone would pay money to see one. I didn't find it scary either. This is one of those movies that I was trying to think up reasons not to see it. I guess the biggest one was that I just felt like there was no tension or suspense in this movie. The ending didn't add up for me either. I'm glad the movie is over.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     What do you mean "this one had a lot of flaws"? It was like watching a bad dream come true. I know we are supposed to watch the bad parts and judge if the film is bad. But in a world where every movie has been remade like a million times, these movies that are remade are all so awful. They look so good on the big screen but you know deep inside it's just a poor imitation of something better.  "Cabin in the Woods" is one of the most boring films I have ever seen. It is basically an adaptation of Stephen King's "Carrie" and it doesn't even follow the events of the book. It's a story about a young girl named Carrie White (Emma Roberts) who comes out of a mental hospital and goes on a road trip with her father. Carrie has been hearing voices for a long time and she tries to keep them under control. It doesn't work, so she is sent to a mental institution. She tries to make friends with the kids there, and she starts to hear her dad's voice again. It turns out that this man has come back into her life. It appears that this woman who is in charge of the hospital has started a cult. She uses Carrie to recruit new members and uses the kids to test Carrie's limits. It starts to feel like a horror film but there is a twist at the end. The entire film was a nightmare. There was nothing redeeming about it and no joy was found in it. It felt so awful, and I thought Carrie was supposed to be the girl who lived inside her. There is nothing to get excited about in this film. "Carpenter's" is an interesting title since it is the film that "Carrier" will probably be compared to. "Carries" seems like a good name, but it does not fit. It does not remind anyone of Carpenter's films but it has its similarities. The film itself was not bad and I was entertained. I guess I won't go to the theater for a second viewing but I will try to watch a clip online before I watch the film again.  I don't think this film deserved all the bad reviews it got. It seems like it got a lot worse reviews than it really deserves. It still holds a lot appeal and is still a good movie. I think it may have been the best horror movie of 2010. It could have used a little
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When my family and I went to see this movie on the 3rd of February of this year. My sister, who is 16 and the main character's love interest, didn't really like the movie. She thought it was cheesy and she thought it would be a waste of time. But since we were at my friend's house we decided to just have a little fun on a Friday night. So we headed over to my friend and her house for dinner. The food and wine were delicious and the movie was amazing. The film is made with the intent of entertainment and the film was really enjoyable. I just didn't think it would really be that enjoyable for my 16 year old sister. The entire time she was watching it my sister was feeling uncomfortable and wanted to leave. Her mind was just being sucked into the action, and it was really not something she enjoyed. I mean I really didn't either until after the film. My older sister (who is 29 and is a very adult woman) saw the film and she didn't like the film either. She was in awe of the action and felt she wasn't a very good actress or a good character because of the lack of physical action that I guess I should describe. She felt that the movie didn't give her character the dignity that she felt she deserved. After the movie I asked her about the film because she seemed really sad about it. She told me that she thought the movie would be entertaining to her and that she was impressed with the performance of the young actress. But I have to say that in my opinion she probably should have gotten a more serious role to be able to really enjoy this film. When it came to the sex scene that happened at the beginning, my sister thought the guy should have pulled out because it made him look like he wasn't even trying. I told my sister that I didn't even think this was possible because he looked so focused and it made me wonder if she was being a virgin herself. I didn' t understand why she thought that the guy shouldn't have done this action. She said that he had a very serious look on his face when he pulled out of the act. She just thought he should have waited until he was finished in the scene. This bothered me because there were no other characters in the movie that were not sexually active. This made me feel that my sister should know better than to think that this action wouldn't be considered sex. I'm not sure what the big deal
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you didn't enjoy the movie, it's not your fault.      It has its flaws.  The badness, at least to me, is mostly the dialogue.  This is a serious issue to me.  It makes me wonder if the writer had his own opinion of the dialogue or if the script had been written to reflect his opinion.   The voice actors are amazing in their own way.  I think the voice acting is just as good as the character.  They are all amazing actors and I think they do a great job.  In my opinion, it should be possible to have more dialogue and a larger cast of characters in this kind of movie, especially with a sequel in mind.  If I could, I would just have more of it. I don't think the movie was intended as a "serious" movie, but I think it's supposed to be entertaining, and if it's fun, it doesn't matter if the dialogue is poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     If I could say one thing about movies I liked or disliked, it's that the actors are often more interesting when they're not acting, that even bad movies can be interesting if they're set in their own world or setting, and that even movies that are terrible can be enjoyable if you watch them with an open mind.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There's a really strange, uncomfortable feeling when watching a movie that's not for you. It can feel like you're being watched. For me, I never really felt that way about "Halloween" when it was first released, but now after having watched it again, I can't think of it in the same way again. There's a lot of things wrong with this movie, so I think it's a must-see for horror fans, but you should keep an open mind.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      4.5/10, maybe because of the first half (though the latter half doesn't do it justice) it's actually a decent film. It's like it's being promoted to me as a great movie when I'm being told it's bad.   2.5 out of 5 stars, for an awful movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I went to see this movie based on a book by the same name, and it's about the first time that a person has ever walked in on an animal in heat. So I was excited to see that the guy in the movie was dressed up like the guy who played the dog in "A Tale of Two Cities," which is the movie where that movie is about a man who's having an affair with his wife. It's about a prostitute. I'm always interested in the sexual politics of movies. There's been an awful lot of movies about women that are sort of just about sex. It used to be that we had to be like, "Yeah, that's just the way things are."  So, in a weird way, this movie is a movie about what you do with your sexuality if it gets out of control, which it seems like it might in this film.  Yeah. It does feel like that in a way. I mean, if you look at the way the whole plot is about him trying to get over it, and he can't even. There are moments where he's at a party and he's drinking and dancing and he feels like he's going to pass out. And then he turns into the dog and he passes out for a few seconds, and then he wakes up in the morning and he knows he's a dog. It makes him realize that that was the wrong way to live your life.  the director's decision to make the movie in the 1970s is a weird thing to do when you're talking about sexual politics. I always look at it as this kind of strange, almost ironic way of making a movie. I think a lot of it was just the fact that it didn't want to come out in the mid-70s. That was probably the biggest problem with it. It was too out of date. But, you know, the filmmakers did their best. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be.   The film is set in the 1940s, and the action scenes are quite good, but the actors are terrible.  I don't know what happened to their acting ability, but they're bad.  The actors are not given any opportunities to interact, and most of the dialogue was delivered in a monotone.  This movie is a mess and very dull.  In the end, the movie was really boring.  It's really hard to imagine this movie being as popular as it was in the late 80s and early 90s.  There's a whole bunch of actors, and they don't give anything to the characters they portray.  Even the main character, the girl from the future, is a boring actress who just plays the part and doesn't show any of her emotions.  While this film is not bad by any means, the acting is bad, and this is the reason why it doesn't rank high.  If you're a fan of the 80s, then you'll like this movie, but if you're not, then stay away.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "It was like watching a movie in which the actors are playing out their parts. The characters were all really stupid, but they could not be more so without being boring. Every scene was boring or ridiculous, and that's what the audience was supposed to feel. Even the cinematography was very silly, it was like a bad children's show that was filmed in a studio, like a cheap sitcom that should never have been made." "The story was lame, it didn't even have a beginning, middle or end. The only reason you are here for this movie is because you like stupid movies and are in need of something silly to watch. The film ended at the end of its running time, but that's how long it took to make this stupid film. I am not a fan of this kind of film, and I don't think I'll ever see another one like this, it just didn't seem like it was worth a second of my time."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I will do a movie review as long as I like it. I know that this movie is not exactly a good one. The director is trying to make an action movie, but that does not work in this case, it works in this movie the best when it is about something else. The story is very short, and the movie ends in a very unsatisfactory way, since I really think that it should have ended with more than a couple of action scenes, and a little bit more character development. And then the only thing is the ending, and I think that we should have gotten a little more out of the movie. And since it is a comic book movie, I think it should not have been called "The Movie of the Week".  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    * Please remember that comments are moderated  * I will make exceptions for movies I enjoyed and felt were worth watching   If I do see something I want to review, I'll do it ASAP.   A film can get a poor rating based on how good it is in my opinion.  The other side of the coin is that I want a good, good film reviewed. The worst thing I can say about movies is that they are not great films (read: good). If a movie is bad, the bad is not the only option. Sometimes there is something to be said about a movie that doesn't make any sense, but it isn't that the film is bad. Bad films are made because of the nature of the script, the direction, or the cinematography. Bad movies are not made because a director or script writer thinks the movie is good. That is not what makes a bad film. It's bad because someone made the decision that a film was better than it was. My favorite film of 2014 was Mad Max: Fury Road. This movie is absolutely insane. And yet it's an incredibly smart movie that isn't over-the-top. It has its fair share of fun action scenes, and it gives the main character a lot of interesting things to do and a great backstory that I didn't even think would make sense. (For those of you who are not aware, Tom Hardy was raised by his abusive father after his mother died. His father took advantage of that and turned his son against him. Hardy is actually a great actor and he gets to play this man in the movie and he handles it well.) But the most impressive thing about this film was that it was an action movie about a woman. A woman who fights for justice, and the only reason she fights is that she is a woman who wants to live her life. The other men in the film don't know what they are doing, and they aren't that interested in the fight, but they aren the ones that die because the movie allows it. She is the strongest character in the entire film because of how the movie treats her. What makes this movie a success is that it does its job so well. It doesn't overdo it. It isn't overly ambitious. There are action scenes. There's a great story and some great acting from everyone involved. It was an extremely well-made film and, as much as I enjoyed it, I was not
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most frustrating part is that I really liked it! But, the people who saw the movie (and those who actually understood it) hated it. I understand that people go to see a movie and they expect to like it, but this is the worst experience ever. The cast is terrible. I wouldnt want to do anything with any of them! The music is awful. The story is even worse. And, the acting is atrocious. The worst actor is the one who played the baby, her name is Lulu. The other actors were better than her. The director is even more terrible. The only good thing about the movie is that it had a good plot, but that only happened once. The movie is totally forgettable.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible. This movie doesn't stand a chance.   I'm not going to go in deep, because this movie has been done to death.  So I'm going to make it easy.  The actors do a very poor job.  I mean, they were all in the same crappy movie.  We have a good cast in this movie and the actresses all do a good job. However, the one who is the worst is a black female who was on the soap opera.  She is a very small part.  When she was on "A" we never got to see her acting.  Her character is also black.  All her dialogue was in a bad white girl's voice.  This leads me to believe she didn't have any experience.  My guess is she had a good acting coach and was trying to show off.  There is no chemistry between the actors and they're all acting out of character.  These are all professional actors and the director was probably not paying attention to the material.  For instance, the lead character's mom was a black lesbian.  Why would her mother do that to her daughter.    She was a very annoying person.  You want someone to be the mother.  Not a lesbian.   When she is acting her daughter is making an excuse not to tell her about her "sick" brother, even though it is obvious she's sick.  It's a bad and very annoying thing to be.  However, it's the same thing in the show as well.  At the end of the movie when they go back to see the man's mother, she tells the man she doesn't like his sister.  But I can't really tell what it means.  Also, why does she put a gun to his head when they all thought he was dead.  Finally, when she shoots her brother it doesn't look like the real gun hit him.  Is it a gun, or is it a nail gun?  And who did it?  I think it's obvious what it was because he was really dead in the end.  In fact, when the man saw her brother he looked like he was about to cry.  They tried to make her character into the sympathetic one.  She's a black woman and a lesbian and she's so bad.  After watching all this I was shocked that she would get an "A-."  I was
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think that all this negative review should have a special place in my heart. Because I know that they can't be good. And I know they can be terrible, because they are. All movies are.    It was the biggest and the best horror movie of all time. This film was a big hit with the audience because it was a great horror movie. But they had some problems. I know there are a lot of people out there who hate this movie and it's about zombies. But I think the problem with this movie is that it was not realistic enough. That's why the audience love it, but it isn't realistic.  I think that it should be re-released in theaters, because all the fans have to watch it again. It doesn't have the problems of the first movie.  When the movie is all over, they should give it to the theaters again, and the audience can watch it over again.  There is a lot to learn from this movie. You have to learn how to be able to take your time when playing a game, and how to have a good relationship with your friends. You need to be aware about your surroundings and not just run around and grab stuff.

And I'm pretty sure I've read his books too (The Shining being one of them). So I really didn't think a lot of The Shining when I first saw it. But I knew I had to watch it. And so I did, on my 17th birthday. I'm sorry, but I couldn't help it. I knew that the story was so horrifyingly good. I was fascinated by the characters, and I was in love with the music (which I still have on my DVD of the film). I loved the way the movie ended and I thought it was awesome.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A good movie should be an enjoyable experience and, if possible, be enjoyable and worth the time you invest.  This movie wasn't a good experience.  It wasn't fun, it wasn't exciting, and it didn't thrill.  The bad part was that the movie was so bad that it's more like a bad day than a bad experience. I really enjoyed the other two movies we saw at this location in the summer of 2006.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You're not really telling the truth.   The movie is really really bad and you are the one who told everyone how great it is!   Also you're wrong about the movie being in theaters...it is out on DVD now.   5 out of 5 stars A few words to the wise...I have a problem. I have to buy every single episode of this show and that does mean buying each episode in full. It is the worst thing ever. The plot is terrible. It gets so convoluted that you can't understand why someone would do a thing to one another or why some one is being evil or good or just crazy. I don't want to spend hours of my life on it and I am starting to think that this show is going to be like every other horror show. I hate them. I can't recommend this to anyone but just know that this is the only show on TV that has ruined me.  3 out of 3 stars The show has some really good moments. The only thing that is really bad about the show is that it is so over the top that I never feel like I'm watching a good show. It's just a series of bad events that are so over-the-top that I am really disappointed that it ever aired.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie is a movie that is bad in some way, and you want to think that it's bad because it sucks. In a negative movie, though, you can be happy with how it turns out. I really can't think of a film in the last 20 years that I've liked as much as this one. There was so much I wanted to say about the film, but the first thing I said was "wow." The story follows a very bad girl (Kate Winslet) who gets her life back together, but when she finds herself on a train ride to a wedding, she's shocked to see that her best friend (Jennifer Aniston) is marrying the same guy that she used to be in high school. I know, she looks exactly the same, but it's worth pointing out that she looks a little younger. (It is worth pointing something out, because even if you're not a Jennifer Aniston fan, the movie will probably not change your mind about the actress. It's just so darn hard to look away from a girl that's always looked good!) One thing I really liked about this movie is that it tells the story of Kate Winslet as a person, as opposed to Kate Winslett. I don't remember ever seeing Kate Winslette as an actual human being. She just is this wonderful actress who is always so lovely and perfect. This movie shows how much of a bad person Kate is, and how much good she can become. Kate Winslets best character in a movie is her role in this movie. It takes a movie like this to prove that you don't need a perfect woman to be a good actress. When the movie first began I couldn't stand the movie, but after watching the entire thing I started to get into it, and it really made me want to go to the theater so I could watch the film again. If you ever have a chance to see this movie, I recommend it. I know this is a long review, but I've been watching this movie for a while now, and I really have to write this review because of the way it starts off.   This movie is funny, at first. The movie starts off with this really dumb idea, and the film doesn't let you know that it is a dumb idea for much longer. But the movie keeps going, and while it might not be so bad, it is definitely not worth your time. This first part of the movie has
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this film to be able to re-watch it as it was so popular. I was never a fan of this film, but I can see why people still seem to love it. I am sure that most of you watched the film in one sitting, so I'll just say it was well-acted. It was great to see the chemistry between the actors. The film was a comedy, so it was great watching it with a laugh. This film is a classic comedy, a true classic that is sure to make a comeback and become one of the best comedies of all time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went into the theater thinking I would love this.   The movie is very good, not perfect, but very good. I have watched this movie several times and have never once been disappointed.  I have seen this movie three times and each time I have been extremely happy.  So what happened? Well... I found out that this movie was made in 1982.  The only reason this movie is still out is that it was a theatrical release.  Some of the dialogue that's heard here in the movie were made up at the last second, some were completely made up.  For example, this line about the guy who comes in and puts a gun to his head:  " I had to pull the trigger.  "  That's not even in the film!   So you should just let it go and let the audience have a good time.  What can I say? This movie is funny!  It had good actors and a good script. I think it is better than the first movie.  I do wish it was longer, though.  Posted by J.R. at 11:14 AM

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw "The Dark Knight Rises" on Christmas Day, and to be honest it was pretty bad. It has everything you can't stand about Christopher Nolan's "Batman Begins" or the James Bond movies. That's a good thing, it's like watching "The Mummy" or "Dawn of the Dead". It was the worst thing I saw all weekend. The script is horrible, the acting is terrible, and the special effects are terrible. When you don't know what is going to happen it makes the film look like a low budget disaster film. When it was over I went home and started researching and I found that "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy was a masterpiece, and "The Avengers" was great, and yet "The Rise of the Planet of the Apes" is terrible. It's terrible. The director had to cut a ton of stuff out of the movie. The entire movie, the main characters, and even the villains are poorly written. I don't like movies that have characters so stupid that they have to be brought to life, and this movie is just awful. My favorite character was the antagonist who is so stupid I couldn't even believe he was actually trying to kill the heroes. And then there is the writing, it sucks. The acting is awful, and it's awful to have to listen to them say that it's a very difficult movie to do justice in this time, but they somehow manage to do that. I didn't see it, but if I had I wouldn't have liked it. I hope they make another one, because the first one was pretty good.   -Derek
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For those people who have seen this movie, I just wanted to let you know that I hated this movie.   It was boring.  It had little to nothing to do with any of the original movies or characters.  So there is that.  I was really excited to watch it, and it had all of the trailers, and all the great reviews, and I just didn't want to sit through it.  One of the best parts about The Matrix is that you can watch it in the theater and not know what you are doing.  There are a few scenes and things in this movie that were just not very good.  The action sequences in this film were just silly and out of place.  This movie should have been called "The Movie" and not "Matrix."  "Do you think that you are the only one who has the power of the mind? " I have always wanted to talk about this movie because I thought it was so ridiculous.  If this movie was made today, no one would have cared.  Most people would think that this was a movie made in the 80's.  Like I said, the trailer was awesome and the movie is funny, and a very different take on the story.  But this movie does not have much to do at all with the original Matrix.   The story is completely different.  In the Matrix, Neo is the real hero.  After all he did to save the world.  He's the one who made a choice to be on his own.  As Neo we watch a lot of the other characters, and find out that they have different stories.  Some of them have gone through a much darker life, than what we see in the movie.   Also the movie shows us that some people were smarter than Neo.   For example Agent Smith's girlfriend goes to prison and he doesn't try to stop her.   This is important, because as you watch this movie it will be hard to remember why he wasn't in jail.   It's like if you know a little about how The Matrix works, you might not be able to remember a scene where Neo is saving Trinity.   What would make sense to you, might make no sense at all to Neo.  The most memorable scene in this entire movie was when Trinity talks to Morpheus.   Trinity is a very smart girl.  She knows something about the world that we don't, and is very powerful
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is really not that bad, not that horrible, but the ending is terrible.  This movie was very good.  and was great as a kids movie. I also really liked the ending, and I think it would be good to show it when kids are growing up.  I also have a little kid and he also liked it. .  of course, I didn't give this movie a 5 because i really thought that it is a really cool movie. The first part was a nice relaxing movie about a little girl and how it felt to be a little person in a big city and all the stuff that goes on. I liked the way it was written, the fact that it was a kids story and that it showed that it's OK to like a little thing like a doll.   And then, the ending. I mean, I don't have a problem with a children's movie ending with the character getting killed in the end. If you don't think a child should grow up with a happy ending that is ok. But if you think it's a good thing to kill off a little child (who has not yet realized that he doesn't have much time left) then you should really think about your beliefs. It should not be a good ending, it should be a terrible ending. It's almost a tragedy, it's such a waste of a great movie.  . I don`t know if this movie was well thought out, or if the director was just not able to finish it in time. But in the movie`s favor, the actors who played these little people, I thought they did a good job. I think this movie could have been a great children's film, and it could have really made me think about all the little things that I see every day. It could have taught me all the things that my child might not have learned from TV.   . of course. I've read a lot of reviews about this movie and i really don't know why people think this is the best children's movies, they are not. they are bad, and are not worth even seeing, not even for children. This movie is a disgrace. I really don`ts understand why people thought this was a good movie, and some people didn`t like it at all. The Movie Rating:  Rotten Tomato Score: "
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A friend, a good friend, told me about a movie she loved. It seemed so perfect, and in her review she included a note that if I ever found myself in a bad situation, and I'd ever find myself in one, to call her and say something about the movie. So here it is, my story.   The movie in question was "The Usual Suspects".   I got into the movie after a couple of weeks of looking it up, and after about 45 minutes of the movie, I knew that the movie would never be the same for me.  There are a few things that stuck out to me. The movie, while ostensibly about a couple trying to catch a killer, ended up being a lot about how the victim doesn't matter. I felt this was a common theme that runs through many movies. "The Good, The Bad and the Ugly" was about how a movie made up the story of how the protagonist was a Nazi, who just wanted to protect his country and was never really bad, was bad because he couldn't make himself like the good guys. "Lethal Weapon" was made up of the good guy being so good that his enemies never could beat him. "Goodfellas" was a love story between two people who are trying to steal money from people, while being completely honest with their feelings, yet always lying and taking advantage. "Pulp Fiction" was just a movie about a guy and a girl who were trying to kill each other.  When I saw the plot, it seemed like a bit of a cop-out, and the story seemed too simplistic and simplistic was the best I could put it, so I was turned off by it.  I mean, we're not talking about a major masterpiece here.  And yet there were moments that made me care, that really brought it to life. I loved the movie for its realism, and how we could really see what happens on the streets of New York when people are in a violent situation. I even found myself feeling that the two main characters, Paulie and Samantha, were the best possible love interest for each other, which was surprising. And, of course, I also found myself drawn to how "The Big Lebowski" could have been a real life movie, even though I couldn't find one of those in my local theatres.  So, now, what exactly was wrong with the movie?   For
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I see a good movie, I will read every review. When I see something that's just terrible, I usually only read reviews written by other film reviewers. And when I've seen something so bad I think I'll never watch anything from a horror movie again, I'll just write about it, hoping nobody notices.      So, when I saw this movie, it got me thinking about something. If you saw it, what was your opinion about it?              This movie really had something for everyone. It was a great comedy, a horror thriller, a romance with some great performances, and a great drama.  If you liked the last one, you'll probably like this one as well.    This movie had just enough horror to keep me watching, but not so much that I felt completely scared.  For a horror film, this movie really did a great job of making you feel like it was being shot on the set of a horror/suspense movie.  They did a terrific job with the special effects, and the overall lighting of the movie was very good.  It didn't look like an 80s movie. The movie itself was very well acted.  I was glad I got a chance to meet my favorite actor, David Arquette.  The movie was definitely scary, but it never got in the way of the story or characters.  There was an incredible amount of character development going on in this movie. Some of the performances, especially from the female cast, were just phenomenal.  If you liked that last movie, you're going to love this one.  And, if you didn't like that last one... well, don't worry!   There's nothing that's going to put you off.  A very entertaining, and unique movie!  The movie opened on November 16, 2004.   The film's running time is about 2 hours and 40 minutes. The film was rated PG-13 by the MPAA.  The MPAA's rating is based on the effects of mild violence. If you have any feedback, questions, or comments about this movie or me, feel free to contact me! I'm always up for a chat. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   And I just want to say that the movie had some good points and some bad points.   The good points were that it was well written, interesting, creative and it showed a strong relationship between the characters.  They are a very well developed group, some better developed than others.  It had its flaws.  Firstly, it was very easy to understand what was going on, and a lot of the story lines seemed to fall into place, or rather not into place.  Second, there were some points in the film where the plot was confusing, or very hard to follow.  However, in the end the movie was a really good one.  There's also one minor issue that bothered me a bit.  As a character in this movie, I felt very strongly for the character, but it was a little too easy for the audience to forget how to relate to him.  I felt the movie could have had a better and more satisfying ending, which would have also had an impact on the character.  There's also the possibility that he just forgot about her and that is what the film doesn't really explain.   Overall I felt this was a decent movie.  The characters and the relationships were good, and there was a strong story line.  But it was really hard to understand at times, and at other times it was hard to connect with the characters and a bit hard to watch.  Overall I'd give it a 4 out of 5.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is boring.   I want to go to the mall and go shopping.  It's just a repetitive boring movie.  There are some action sequences in it but none of them are the best.  The acting sucks.   They all look exactly the same.  I was also not a fan of the ending.  They show the credits of the film after the credits but the credits don't say anything that's important for this movie. What did I like:  The plot was simple.  If you know what happened in the first film then you'll understand it here.  While the story was short but I found it very interesting.  What didn't I like : The action scenes are so boring. They didn't look good in the movie. It's a short movie. There was no tension.  This movie is not a movie that you'll watch and be bored by it.  These aren't movies that you should watch to relax.  In conclusion, this movie was really boring to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you have not seen the movie and don't know what is wrong with it, then it is bad. In the movie, the story line is horrible. The story line should be about some guy in jail who starts a riot, killing cops, people and cops (yes, this is what happened). He gets arrested and spends a week in jail. He gets out, finds a big gang in jail and starts a fight. This movie does not show the life of this guy, it shows the life he would have had in jail if he was not killed in the first scene by the cops (or in the very first scene). The movie has a guy who just has a hard time getting through it. The guy is angry about something and so he does some bad things and gets arrested for those bad things. When he gets arrested, the cops beat him up and when they put him in jail, he does the best thing he can do to get out and kill the cops. The movie starts off a lot better than the movie should have. The plot line is good, the way that the story is told is good. The acting was bad (as was the dialogue). The story of the guy who gets arrested in the movie is not the right way to go about it. So, the movie loses it's credibility.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw it on video before, but I had a bad taste in my mouth after watching it a couple times. The film is about a couple that gets separated and the wife gets mad at the husband. She breaks a window, runs in, steals his car and then drives away. I thought that was a little over the top but I didn't like it. I didn''t like how it went into a different area and the camera angle was a bit weird for a movie with so many characters in it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    1 -   You need a bigger vocabulary.   2 -  They've gotten worse since the last film, and are more campy now, more like a cartoon rather than a serious film. 3 -  This film is really only about three characters, a very annoying dog, the guy who lives in the trailer park, and a young girl who is obsessed with the dogs. No other characters or plot interest. 4 -  The ending is ridiculous.  6 -  There is no real character development, and the plot is so thin and it seems like there is no end.  There are no actual characters.  8 -  While I don't think this film has a bad premise, the movie is really a mess of a film.  9 -  It's really just a film with two people doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.  10 -  I really just have nothing good to say about this film. The characters are annoying, the story is bad, and it just doesn't even make sense.  11 -  If you like movies where the person is the only thing interesting, this is for you.  12 -  In one scene, you watch this young girl talk about her dogs, then the dog dies and she talks about how he's not really the first dog she ever had, and that she's just the second dog.  13 -  After that, the girl gets in a car accident, she gets dragged into the woods, she's dead, and you just sit there for 10 minutes while nothing happens.  14 -  No real character developement, it just feels like a slapstick comedy.  15 -  What was the point? The character interactions are really shallow and repetitive.  16 -  All of the characters die and no real reason is given for why.  17 -  Not a good movie.  19 -  So disappointing.  20 -  As for the actual plot, it's just one thing after another.  21 -  How can this be a horror film? There are literally no monsters or ghosts in this film, no creatures, nothing.  23 -  And the best part is that it's all just slapstick humor with no real plot.  26 -  My main problem with this movie is just the sheer amount of time it takes to get through it.  27 -  But that's what it does.  29 -  Overall
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm sure that I would have been in love with the book and the movie. This book and this movie were both awesome. The book was a fantastic experience. The characters are all so well-developed. The story is dark and has a lot of emotion. There were a lot that I cried for. I loved reading about how the story unfolds. It really was a great story. The movie was awesome. I liked the movie a lot. The acting was so good. And there were some good surprises that weren't mentioned in the book. If you're a fan of dark stories with a twist, or horror, or suspense, this is a good book for you. The ending made me so sad. It is a very sad book. I was so sad about the ending. I have never been so sad for a book or movie. But the book was great and there are no downsides.

The acting is average at best, and the acting style is not very good (I'd describe it as cheap) to give you a visual sense of the performance.  There is a great scene where, as the characters are being interviewed by the police, the two cops are seen having sex with each other.   It would be okay, in a good porn movie, but in this movie, the cops are too much. I can't understand why they think they can do this at work! The only good thing about this movie is when the cops do the same thing with the women, and you see the faces of the cops, and how they are really disgusted by it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I really enjoyed the movie, but not in the way they are going for in the trailers. There are way too many plot holes and the story just doesnt make any sense. In the end, I had to ask myself what I just saw and where the original idea came from. I hope the original author is working on a sequel because this movie just does not hold up to other movies of the genre."    How can they be so ignorant about movies and not know this is a bad book?       He also said that the movie is really bad and that there are too many holes in the plot for it to be good:  "the movie is not as bad as it looks. The plot is pretty well done, but there are a lot of problems with the movie as well. There is a lot going on in the movie that just doesn't make sense and the writers just can't seem to decide what to do. I really think they are really trying to do too much and it is just too much for their audience. I mean there are some things that really aren't making sense in the first few minutes, but once they start explaining things it starts to make more sense."  It really shows how clueless and clueless the film makers were that they made this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A negative review is different from a good review. When a movie is overacted, you may find yourself smiling. When it is poorly written, you will find yourself cringing. If a movie gives you the impression that this is what this country should look like, then you are going to want to put the movie down, no matter how great the performances are. It is better to put down a movie after one viewing and realize that you really don't like the film than after you've seen it twice, and it's now part of your personal lore. Let's look at some negative reviews:  "  You would think a film with so many glaring errors, so many poorly written lines, and so many scenes that are poorly shot, would warrant the kind of response that Hollywood has made it out to be.   The movie doesn't give a damn about anything that it tells you.  The scenes that were most interesting were the ones that tried to shock you, not the ones where the story didn't really have anything to say.  I don't know how the filmmakers made this movie.  The production values don't seem to match up with the story.   It is a movie that has no real plot to speak of.  There is nothing that is really exciting or suspenseful about the movie.   It is hard to think of a good reason for anyone to see this movie or want to see it.  A bad movie does not need to give a good performance.  You can watch a good movie and still hate it.   I don`t know who made this film, but I have no interest in watching this movie anymore.  As it stands, I would advise that anyone who wants to see a movie to watch it in a theater with a good view.  This movie isn`t going to be one of those movies that you see on TV after school and feel excited about the next day.  It just doesn`t add up.  Maybe it's just me, but there is a reason why this movie is being released in theaters.  To be released and released again.  We can say that this movie was a success in the theater, but in reality, it has become a failure in the real world.  All the people who think that it was a flop are doing so because they've seen something that is different than what they expected. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        My friend (who's never seen the movie), watched the movie with me. She said that it didn't help her as much as she thought it would. Her conclusion:  The movie is boring and has too much plot. I found it pretty funny, so I can see that it's supposed to be that way.   Why was I going to see this movie in the first place?   Because I liked it!   It was interesting! I loved the whole story, especially the characters. I just didn't see the humor.  It's like a bunch of people decided to make a movie about a bunch who are all stuck together on a train and it's their last day on Earth.  In the beginning of the movie, there is a car accident that knocks out everyone (including the two lead actors, who are already dead, which makes this whole movie even weirder). In the car are a bunch a teenagers. They are all just kind of there, being weird. They don't do anything. There is a train (with a kid on board) that is headed the other way and this is the last chance for a bunch to get off. One kid, who's probably the oldest of the bunch, decides to do his own thing and takes off. The kids and their leader decide to go after him and the main character (the one who is now trapped in the car) is like:    "Hey, wait! Why are we going after this loser?"  There is also a lot of time wasted on a movie where the kids get kidnapped by the leader of a cult and are forced to believe that they can go back to Earth. I'm not even sure if it's true or if the movie has something to do with it (which I find out after a while), but you don't really care about anything except for the plot and the characters that you know and like. The movie just ends with a pretty anticlimactic way. I didn't feel like the characters got any depth.  The movie had no redeeming qualities. I thought it was very bad!  If you like a weird movie and you don,t want to spend a lot, you may want to steer clear of this one.  I really liked it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not going to give away the plot, but it's pretty complex. The story follows a guy and his friends who go to a high school and fall in love. The guy who is the most beautiful guy is played by Robert Pattinson who looks like someone who would be a great male lead in a movie like this. I also really liked the way they portrayed the girls, especially Kora, who is played really well. I think this is one of the best movies for teen girls that are on the rise. They really bring the girls to life and have the right amount of drama. It's not too complicated, but they make sure you know exactly what's going on. And by the end of the movie you will be in love with this girls, even though I'm not sure if I was in love in the first place.   Rating: 6/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I read the book and then I watched it. The book is actually pretty interesting, but I feel like I know almost nothing about this film. I don't know why it's so hard for some people to like the movie, but if you can't enjoy the movie then you don't deserve to be a critic, and I feel that's a shame. The main problem I have with this movie is the voice acting. The actors seem completely out of place in the movie. The two best-acted people in the film are Toni Collette and James Earl Jones. The rest of the actors in the cast (Robert Shaw, John Wayne, etc.) really struggle to come across as anyone but caricatures of themselves. The film is not the worst in its genre, but it's definitely not one of the better ones. The story is well told, but the characters are so poorly written that it is difficult to even care about them, much less invest into the story. The movie was produced in a very cheap and fast manner, so I don and believe it was done so to make a quick buck off of a big name director. I'd still love to see it again to see if they could have found a way to improve the movie or make it something more substantial, but honestly I think the film is better left as it is.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think the whole movie is awful and I don't know how the creators of that film have the nerve to try and make a movie with the "Worst Movie Ever" title. This movie has some problems with pacing and story-telling and I thought that the ending was so contrived it was almost like they were trying to take a break from the movie, especially the ending. The main character, Jax, is a great character. He is very complex. He has his own personal reasons for why he has to kill and how he goes about it. I think there is a point where he really has to go through this, but I wish they had more time with him. I guess what it comes down to is that this is a movie where the villain has no motivation at all. The entire film revolves around Jax's motives, which doesn't make a ton of sense. His motives for killing, kidnapping, torturing and even torturing the man's daughter, to whom he has a strong connection to, is only for reasons of revenge. All of this is based on his desire to end the man and his family's suffering. It makes no sense why he would do this other than the fact that it is the way he thinks. All this leads up to the worst "Final Scene" in the history of movies, in which Jax murders the man that killed his family. The film does not bother trying to justify this act, but rather just leaves it on the table. Jax then goes back to his house and starts cooking a meal and watching movies. As a writer I am pretty sure it is very difficult to write a movie ending that leaves one in no doubt as to what the movie was trying to say. The final scene is just stupid, as if they are trying to make a statement that the film is a commentary about revenge and all of its stupid ways. The whole movie made me feel like a complete idiot. I mean, the last scene is Jax in his kitchen making a meal of a chicken, then the next shot is him torturing a little boy that has been abused by his uncle. This is not really a good message to be sending out to your audience as I am sure it was supposed to be, but to leave it out is pretty stupid. All in all, the only good thing about this movie is that it does have a very original plotline. I would say that this movie can best be described as a mixture of Star
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "   "  "    "        - "  - - - -  !   - -! -!  ! !"   The following are my thoughts on a movie I enjoyed quite a bit. The film follows four children who come to a cabin in the woods to live away from the world. The film begins and ends with the kids sitting around a campfire in the middle of the night. There is a man and a woman who are supposed to be the father and mother of the four children. The four children are as follows:  1. Baby - a boy (4 year old) 2. Junior - a young girl (9 year old). 3. Junior's brother - a little boy (5 year old.) 4. The father - a man, in his 40s, in a cowboy hat. The movie begins when Junior tries to go outside for a smoke, and the man yells at him for being outside in the dark. The man asks Junior if he wants a cigarette, and Junior refuses and starts to cry. Junior says that he'll be back inside to get his mother. The little boy is watching the adults talk at the campfire. Junior starts to look angry and upset. The girl starts to say something, but Junior is angry that he's being interrupted.  The man goes outside to see what the problem is, and when he returns, the little girl is gone, and she hasn't turned on the light. The boy is waiting on the porch for her to return, but she has gone inside. The husband goes outside and looks in the window to see if she's okay. The woman comes out of the cabin, and there she is - she's holding her four children in her arms.  The woman asks if she can help the father, and he says that they are all in the room, and that he didn't hear a word she said. The mother says that the kids can't be inside because it's too dark, and all four of them have to go to bed. The wife tells her children to stay inside and the father goes outside.  This is an excellent movie.  It's a bit rough around the edges, but the family dynamics are very well done. The scenes with the little boy watching are particularly touching. The music in this movie is very well written.   There are some parts of this film that I think are
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I say "bad movie," I mean bad. It's been 10 years since I was a teenager, but I still have a lot of fondness for "The Shining" and "The Blair Witch Project," so it's hard for me to say anything bad about "Dinner at Tiffany's." That being said, it's one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen. That's not to say that it's terrible, but it's disappointing and feels rushed.    I know it's probably more of a mystery what happened to the victims of the infamous Night Gallery murders, but even after watching "Dining at Tiffany�s," it's difficult to imagine how these women could have survived a massacre like that. That being the case, the movie isn't about their escape or how they escaped it, but instead about how they reacted and reacted, and that's not an effective way to show what happened. This movie doesn't feel as though it had any intentions of telling us anything other than a quick, sensational, and cheesy "The victims were found in the kitchen." As such, it just feels like it was written to tell you that these women escaped and were probably killed by the same killer, and the plot is just a means to that end. There are certainly aspects of this film that are really compelling, but they just feel like they were pulled out of the writer's britches at the last minute and they feel like an attempt to make the film a more entertaining movie in the process. There are some truly beautiful scenes, but then there are some scenes that seem to have been ripped right out of an 80s-90s slasher film.  Even though "Dinning at Tiffanys" is technically an American film, it is very much a piece of 80s cinema. There's a whole lot of 80's movies in this movie, and a lot that are reminiscent of films of the same period, and even some of the films of that era are used as a means of a movie that was really never meant to be a movie. The film's structure is extremely slow paced, and there's a long time jump in the middle of the movie when the main characters and antagonist (the Bride and Jack Skellington, respectively) are introduced. It feels as though this was a desperate attempt to give it a bit more tension, but as it turns out, it doesn't do anything but make it seem like the plot was rushed
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        The first time I saw it, it was a complete disaster. The second time I watched it, after having had to listen to it again and again, I felt compelled to go see it again.   When this movie was made, most critics said that it was not an original film. When I went to see it on a big screen, it made me think that it wasn't an original movie. I had no idea what was going on when it was made or why it was being made. I have seen several movies with a similar premise to this movie, and none of them are quite as bad.  I am a huge Star Trek fan.  I had to see this movie because I really wanted to see the original Star Trek (I can't tell you if it was the original series or something else, but I know it was Star Trek). I watched all the original Trek movies, and I liked them all. However, I did not want to see another Trek film after what happened to Enterprise. I saw the first movie, Enterprise, and that's when I knew I had seen it all. This is a movie about a spaceship and the man who controls it. There was a big gap between the original movies and the movies where they had to bring in some new characters to make the story more interesting.  The movie takes place in space. I didn't really know how to describe this movie. It was just like Star Trek: The Next Generation, except without the action and without the humor.  It was all very serious.  When the crew of the Enterprise (that's a spaceship) goes to a planet, it's very peaceful. Then it happens:  A giant space ship arrives in the galaxy and fires some huge laser weapons.  What does that have to do with anything?  I have heard the movie has a lot of action and has a very good cast of actors, but what I saw was a lot more serious and realistic than I expected. I did like the fact that there was a new cast of characters.  This was the only Trek movie I had ever seen before, and the only one that I had watched in 3-D. This was a huge mistake. I was shocked that Paramount did not put more of a promotional effort into this movie than they did into The Next Gen movie. This movie did not have the same impact and impact it could have had in 2-D, and it was very
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is really a lot of crap and not a very good one at that. We have a young couple in love who is having a very intense relationship. They have been living together for a couple of years and he is doing well financially. They are going to start a family and it is just the right time to get married. Well, the woman has her eye on a young man who is doing alright financially. When he does have a new girlfriend, the young woman takes an interest in the man and he falls for her. They become very involved and it seems as if the woman is the one in love with the man. As he starts spending more time with her, the couple starts to have more sex and the woman gets into the guy's pants. The young man starts to feel like he doesn't love her anymore and the situation goes from bad to worse. It goes from one extreme to the other and it ends with the couple separated and on the run. We then go back in time and we find that the man in love is trying to find the woman who took him in. It all goes south and the man is getting shot in the head. The woman ends up going to jail and the guy is in a mental ward. The movie is just so bad that it should have just been called "Boyfriend in Distress". Also, it is not as if this guy had been out of a relationship for a while and was a complete stranger. The girl and the young man knew each other and even seemed to enjoy being together.   The young woman, right, and the old man, far right, in the hospital. This picture was taken right after he had died. In the movie, the old woman is trying very hard to kill the young guy who she is now having an affair with. She does this by putting poisonous mushrooms in his coffee and then pretending that he is in the middle of a hallucinogenic drug trip.  That is a drug-addled young man. The film tries to paint this as a metaphor. The old woman does try to kill this young guy but she does not succeed. The guy who is dying gets shot and his head bounces off the walls. The couple is at the end of their rope and the girlfriend goes in and tries to kill her husband. She succeeds and the husband comes back. He then gets shot in his head by the girlfriend and the two of them go on the rampage killing as many people as
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The good:  The acting is really good and the cast are all excellent. The movie plays it really safe, but still manages to bring in enough character development.   This movie is very fun to watch and has the added bonus of being in black and white.  What makes this movie even more interesting is that it's based on a very well known story by a famous author (D.W. Griffith).   If you enjoy this type of movie (Black and White) then you'll love this movie as well.  The movie does have a bit of a weird ending, but that only adds to the movie's fun.  The movie is fun to follow and has a fantastic cast of actors.  There are a couple of plot holes that have to be explained.  The movie's ending doesn't really work out all that well. The Bad:  There isn't really anything wrong with this movie. It has it's good and bad points. If you're looking for a fun watch then give this movie a shot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have no idea how it came to this, but I guess the writers at Netflix thought that a negative movie review wouldn't work.  There's nothing wrong with a movie review being negative; there's a reason we give the thumbs down when we don't like a movie, and we're not gonna give the same benefit of the doubt to a movie critic, who is, after all, not an average Joe like us.  and this isn't a film review by a dude with a good set of teeth:  I've always liked John Cusack as an actor, but his ability to be funny is pretty limited. His performance here is a case in point. The movie is funny, but it's not very funny. There's a good amount of slapstick comedy (which, for all its silliness, is a better comedic style than a lot of movies are utilizing now) but it never really has much of a punch, and it's really just not a very funny movie. I guess that was part of the reason that I didn't like it, because the comedy and slapstick seemed to work better for the audience that was watching it than it did for me. Maybe I am just not wired to laugh with jokes, and the movie didn't get me very much laughing; maybe it was the lack of punch. Maybe it was all the swearing. Whatever it was, this movie, much like a lot people I know and love, was an attempt to make a serious movie more palatable to the average audience. That doesn't mean that the movie will work for all audiences, but this is a movie that was made to make as much money as it possibly could. Maybe this was the wrong movie to make, and maybe it never could have worked. But I don't know. This isn't John C. Reilly's finest hour. And that's really what this movie is about. It's not about the movie; it's about the person. The idea that you can write a movie about a movie is a pretty silly concept. But this is John Cuse's latest. A good guy gone bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I feel as if I have been here before, yet again.   I had forgotten that this film had been made before, but I recall a movie from about a decade ago that was quite similar.  One night in mid August, a friend of mine and I were watching a movie at her house that she had purchased and that was set in the same world.  I felt that this movie had more potential than this one.  We were all tired but it didn't matter because it was late at night and there was plenty of other movies we could have watched instead of this one that night.  However we were just getting to the good part, when it suddenly ended.  The last few minutes were just a montage of a man in a hotel room trying to contact his son.  There was some heavy breathing, then we heard a phone ring, and a voice call out for help, the voice was very calm but strong.  Then the man was on the phone with a girl and she said that she thought he was crazy and that she saw the ghost of her husband and they were stuck in the house together.  This was when I realized that the movie I had seen before was the same movie I saw this time, the only difference was that the boy was the girl's husband, the man calling was the man's son.   The movie was very good.  It reminded me a lot of "The Ring" (1981) in its theme and atmosphere.  Also it had a lot more to offer than just the "ghost" but rather the fact that this "ghost' was really the ghost that was in love with a human, which was the key theme of the film.  After the movie ended, a man who had been sitting next to me (the girl's friend) said that he had never seen such a thing before and asked me if I would like to go to his place to meet his wife, which he promised would be very strange.  As we approached his place, we could see there was no one there other than the two people and some furniture that he was showing me and his wife.  His wife was extremely beautiful and beautiful, but her husband looked like a skeleton, so much so that I could tell they had been separated for a while.  Now as we entered the room, we were greeted by a very large man, dressed in a yellow suit, yellow hat, and yellow coat.  Immediately we heard an
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this and it was not even close to the movie it was based on. It made me mad. I really wanted to like this movie, and I loved it. Then I saw the reviews. If you're watching this movie just for the plot to be similar, you're in for a shock. If, on the other hand, you really want to see this movie and haven't seen it already, just don't, it's not worth it. It's a big waste of money for those who are in it for the story and not for the acting. It has one of the worst acting performances out there, and when the scene breaks off, and there are no actors left, you can tell that the director had nothing to do. Then, there's the plot. There's a group of aliens that live on a planet in the sky, and they have some problems. Then a huge, gigantic explosion goes off and a huge fire erupts and the people in the village are killed. Then we have to watch the people run for safety, the aliens just go away. Then the big explosion happens again and the aliens are seen coming out of it, and now the alien spaceship is on fire. It turns out they're coming back for revenge. Then some of the villagers start to get their memories back, and the other aliens are killing them all. We learn that the aliens were sent to Earth by another alien species, and this alien race just wants to eat humans. Then one of these humans is rescued by a group that has been living on a spaceship for some time now, they've been trying to find this alien life-form that crashed in the forest back on Earth. They finally learn that this planet is inhabited by a certain alien species and that this particular race is called the Tarka. This alien race is very smart and they've managed to survive on this planet without any human contact for thousands of years. This is why the village of the village that the alien race lives in are so peaceful. They're just waiting for humans to die off so that they can be born in a new human society and be killed. This happens for no reason at all, just so they can take over the planet. And this is what this movie is about: the evil Tarkas. I had so much faith in the director, because I've seen his other movies and he's good. He didn't disappoint me. I was just so disappointed that I could only find

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I did not enjoy this movie as much as the first one, but I liked it a bit more than the second one. It was just as fun as the original one, with the same cast, which in a way was better, in that it was more of the same.   This was a pretty good film, but it could have been better, but the first film really left a bad taste in my mouth.  A few things really stood out, however: 1. the story is great, but some of the movie scenes are kinda boring. 2. It's kinda strange to think that the first movie was just a parody of Superman III, as it was pretty dark and darkly funny. 3. The film was pretty well-made, but there's no doubt that it lacked some polish.  I found it funny how the movie was supposed to be a sequel, but that didn't seem to be the case with the movie, as the plot seemed to take place much earlier in the timeline.  If I hadn't seen the movie in the theaters (in the theater I did), I don't know if I would have liked it at all, but seeing it on the DVD, I was much more impressed.  And speaking of the DVD...  I really didn't have a ton of enjoyment from the DVD.  There's not much to complain about, but to be honest, I felt like the video was just not all that special.  As much as I loved seeing the original film, I found the DVD to be lacking in some ways. For one thing, there's just not much going on with the audio.  When the scene where Clark and Lois are talking about Clark being an alien hit home, the audio just went completely silent.  Then there's the scene of the Kryptonite destroying the lab with no background noise or music, and no other sound effects or music besides the background music.  This is just a bad look at an otherwise decent movie.  The only good thing that was done with the DVD was the featurettes.  Although the sound didn't quite work for me, there were a few videos with special features that I enjoyed watching.  For example, there was a video about the making of Superman II.  It included some of Harrison Ford's original interviews, and it's pretty interesting.  While it doesn't show all that much, it's still interesting to see his perspective on the movie. I also found this

It has some problems though, I have been trying to get some friends to play with me, because I don't think it'll be a good experience for them.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - 5.0/10  - 5.5/10 - 4.0.5  -" The Man With The Golden Arm" (1953)  "B" and "C"-grade movies that make you wonder what the fuck was happening with your mind back then. In both cases, people, in this case, were so fucked up in the head that they were unable to keep up with the narrative. The story was so messed up that you just didn't want to know where it was going. The only real saving grace of the movie, the only reason it even managed to get an "A" grade at all, was that you found yourself wondering what the hell was going on with those actors. It seems that they weren't even human anymore.  Here is a short interview with actor Richard Gere on the film:   The worst part about this movie is the title, it's the only part of the film that actually makes any sense. The plot has something to do with a man with the golden arm. Then he loses it and has to be cared for by some strange old woman. The old woman is just a walking time bomb, it only takes the worst possible person to abuse her and turn her into a mad monster. I'm sure if you're a man you'd be able to see past all that. The script by the guy who co-wrote "Gremlins" is even worse. There is an entire scene where an old lady and a young man are going at it. The young man wants to rape the old lady, and the old woman won't let him, she just wants him to take her off. "The Man With the Golden Arm"- Grade: B  *Note: this review is based entirely off of this movie and it's rating.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Do not say "I want the one with the white dog"   But instead:  "Don't let these young actors confuse you with their actors. These were good, but not at the level they are capable of. What a waste of a great script!"   -   I liked the movie! And I didn't see it that way at first. I thought it was going to be a great film. I was so excited, until I heard about all of the stuff going on in the movie. I went in, I watched the whole thing, and I thought this was a really fun movie. The acting was good. I think we should all be happy to see a white dog in the film, even though there were not many black people in the original story. I did like how the filmmakers gave more attention to the characters in the story than in most movies. I enjoyed it a lot, and it made it worth seeing. It's a great way to be entertained without thinking about race.   The only problem with this movie was the horrible quality of the video. The sound was okay, and the special effects were good. The movie wasn't the worst, and there were still some good scenes, but it definitely fell apart as it went along. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If the reviews of this movie are bad, why not write about a movie like "Clueless" (1989) or "The Thing" (1982)? Why not write something like that for this movie? If this movie is bad, don't go see it. If this is a bad, terrible, boring, mindless, boring film, don?t go to the movies to see it! I will be the first to agree, this is the worst movie of all time, EVER! The movie is over, over, and over again and if you watch it one more time, you will hate this movie. "This movie sucks" is a very accurate description of this film. But, what exactly is "this movie"? Well, what was the first movie of this director, of this production company, of all the directors that have ever made a bad flick in their whole life? That would be "Pulp Fiction". This film is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Vincent Price. Well, let's start by telling you that it takes a LONG time to make this movie: 20 Years. A lot of people do not like to see long movies. I usually do not watch movies longer than a few hours. That is, if they are not terrible. I have never seen this film, and have no intention of ever going out to see this film (I hate to waste money on something I will not be entertained by). This movie is a waste of 20 years of creative work by this film production company (David Zucker and Peter Guber), and a waste, of a movie that is supposed to be an "important" movie, to start with. It seems like this film was done in an attempt to make a bunch of money on the back of the success of "Plunder". So, let me tell you what this movie was originally going to be like:     . The movie was going to look like a movie about a group of people in New York. The movie would be about a bunch who are called "The Crooks", who are thieves, murderers, and robbers.   When I first saw this film:     It looks like a crime movie with gangsters and cops, and is set in New york.  The film was going be shot on a very large scale, and would have been shot in the middle of a city with a bunch (maybe more than a bunch) of actors, who
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       In the beginning, we are introduced to a man by the name of Jim (Kirk Cameron), who is a trucker on his way to New York to find some help from a female. When the woman does not arrive, he goes looking for her and discovers that she is in fact a cop who is in jail.        Once he is out, Jim starts to fall in love with her.       He also begins to suspect that she, in fact, is the same woman who tried to kill him years before.    However, Jim's suspicions are not proven correct and he does not come up with a way to prove this, but instead, he just starts believing that she may be more involved in his disappearance than he initially thought.  Jim starts to follow her, and he is not the only one who starts to come across her trail.  The movie is shot with a nice amount of contrast, and the colors are well put together. The music is very well done too, it reminds me a lot of The Exorcist and The Omen films, which in a way, I can see the connection.        This movie would be perfect for a date with your parents, a movie night with your friend, or just a movie to watch if you are on a date. I have only seen it twice in the theater, but I definitely recommend it.  This is a remake of a film that premiered on HBO, starring Kirk Cameron as Jim Hutton and John Malkovich as the woman. I enjoyed it quite a bit and was glad to see that it was not remade.  I did enjoy this more than the original movie (which, as I said before, I loved), but I would have to say that it does a good job of recreating the first film in the right way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What does that even mean?   You don't mean that.   That means you don't like a movie.  If I loved that movie I would have a "negative review".  If you don' t like a film you have nothing to say about it.  You might like a scene in a movie but not the whole movie, but you don" t like it, so you are not going to write a "positive" review.  This is the most ridiculous thing I"ve ever seen you people believe.  No one"s going to take a "nasty" film that everyone else loves and call it a "good" film.  It is a "bad" movie, and it will make you want to throw a bucket of ice on your head.  The last time I saw this movie I just wanted to kill myself, that was a movie that made me cry, that made my hands shake with rage.  I have never seen a movie this bad, and there are at least three of them that are worse.  Why would anyone write a positive review for this film?  You could care less about a "film" and make the movie worse. You could make it so bad it actually has something positive to say.  "Don't tell me this film is a bad film, tell me why you thought it was a good movie."  You can"t be serious.  Don"t you ever think about the people that put in years and years of work and blood, sweat and tears?  So don"t write a negative film review, you have no idea what you"re talking about, and you don?t deserve to.  We could go on all day about the stupidity of people like you, but instead we"ll just have a quick look at the two best movie reviews out of 2014.  One came from The Daily Beast, and the other came from Rotten Tomatoes.  A Daily Beast article, by Katie Drummond, was titled " Why I Didn?t Like Captain America: Civil War ".  Drummond?s article was not very positive.  Drumming's article started out with a bunch of hyperbole about what she saw in Captain America?s third Captain America movie: "This is a Marvel movie, for the Marvel?s Marvel? It?s very hard to believe this one is a third-act epilogue that ties the first two movies together as they
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     It took me about 6 hours to finish this movie.   As for the story and the plot, it's okay. The only problem I had with it is the slow pacing and lack of action or action sequences. I wish it had at least some more action scenes, which I think it did get, but the story is still slow and the pace is still not too good.  The best thing about the story was the characters. These 3 characters in particular really got me to sympathize with them. The girls are really interesting and well developed.  So if you're looking for a movie about 3 young girls that are shy and afraid of boys and a mysterious villain that you want to fight, this is the movie for you.  It's not that well written or well shot, but it's worth a watch and definitely worth a ticket. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If there is a movie that's really bad, I can guarantee that people will complain. I've seen people write about the worst movies they've ever seen and I think they're generally right.   The "Ride the Tiger" movie was one of the best movies I've ever had the pleasure of seeing but it wasn't a particularly good movie.  It had all the elements a movie like that would have; a great star cast, great music and a good story.  But for whatever reason, the acting and direction were all over the place.  The movie was so poorly directed that you could tell the producers were nervous about the film's success.  When it was finally released, I had absolutely no idea what to think about it.  People hated it. People said it was awful.  To this day, I've never understood why the studio didn't just put the film out for free, since the film is that good.  Some people may say the film was ruined by the great cast but it's not like that.  I saw a couple of the stars from the film in the same scene at the same time (they were supposed to play a couple).  It was a great scene.  These actors did a great job, they just couldn't do a scene together that didn't fall apart after a while.  In my opinion, it would have been better if they'd let the scenes go until they all got their scenes done.  And I have to admit that the cast were pretty good as well.  With some of the top acting talents at their height, these guys don't lose much to the rest of the cast.  This film really is one of those classic films that have a huge cult following.  Many people believe it is a classic and I would agree with them.  There is a reason why this film is so important to the history of Hollywood.  So today, I want to give my personal two cents on this film.  For me, it was a little overrated.  One scene in particular was a huge let down.  And that scene, to be clear, was between Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise.  Brad Pitt was really bad at it. This movie has everything from awesome action to cheesy romance.  Of course you're going to have some moments like that but what really stands out about this movie is the fact that it actually had a plot.  That was something rare back in the

Good acting and cinematography.  There are some very nice surprises in the story, and some interesting ideas.  A really good movie. - May 9, 2005A very interesting  Reviewer: chris smith - favorite favorite favorite - October 26, 2004  Subject: The movie was about the Vietnam War! In this movie, the protagonist, a Vietnam veteran (I thought he was the protagonist) was sent by his superiors into the city where the "enemy" were located. He was told he would get to pick his side. He had been sent there by his commanding officer because he had done something against orders. He thought he might be going into the wrong "place" and chose the Viet Cong side. The only side he felt comfortable with and it's really no wonder he was able to do such a good job there. One of the things I found interesting was how the guy seemed to be almost on the wrong side. It took me a long time to realize he was not fighting for the Vietnamese and in fact was killing them. There were several times where he was shown to be killing unarmed civilians. It makes me wonder, were there civilians in the city that weren't "enemies?" Also, the guy could be mistaken for the Vietcong by some of the women in the crowd who looked like Vietcong and some of his friends didn't even know that he was a war veteran and was just a soldier. I found that somewhat disturbing. Overall this was an entertaining movie with very little in the way of plot. - October 1926 - October 2006  Related comments: "The war movie was supposed to be about the war but the movie was really about Vietnam and it had nothing to do with the war.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "What's really going on, then?" That's a question that we've been asking ourselves a lot lately. After years of ignoring this question, it has finally dawned on us that the entire system we live under is very far from what it was intended to be. It is a totalitarian regime that is run by an oligarchy of military industrialists. The "free" market economy was meant to bring prosperity to the world, but instead we have gotten far more economic hardship, more war, more death, and a complete system breakdown. It was not a coincidence that 9/11 happened on its own in broad daylight in New York City, that America has experienced a complete military and economic collapse, that the U.S. military is now considered a police force for the elite, that an unprecedented level of terrorism is occurring in America and around the globe, that we are now in the middle of a major financial crisis, and that the world is slowly getting ready for another mass extinction event. It wasn't some "accident." It was planned, planned, and planned. It will not be easy to undo what has been done and we cannot stop it now. But it can be done. We can make a difference. We just have to put our minds to it. The sooner we realize it, the sooner we can get our lives back.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought that this was a great movie. But it just didn't work for me.   It just wasn't as good as I had expected it to be, or as bad as I expected.  You know, I know this movie has a great cast and a good script, so I don't understand why this movie just didn the thing to me. I was expecting something better than that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As I said before,   , it is not a bad film at all.   For one thing,  you will see very few sequences that aren't really interesting.  And that's part of the charm. There are a couple of scenes that are quite well done and quite clever. I was quite amused by   when it was revealed that a good friend of one of the students is a psychopath. He uses a knife on his victim and then puts him in an upright position in the freezer, then uses the knife to cut the man's hand off (as a way of killing him), which results in  . There is no blood, just a little bit of red on the gloves. The victim is put into a freezer, which is opened by a student who is trying to kill the psychopath. The student then lets go of the door and the film ends with a shot of   The "bad guy" then pulls out his own hand and cuts it off.  Another good idea comes out of this is that we don't know where all the students are and how the students got into the school. We just see a classroom full of kids, all dressed in black. And the other students aren't all just "normal kids." There are   three girls who have had plastic surgery to look more like women (their parents made them do it, as they were all   ashamed of their bodies). We never see them because they are dressed in normal black clothes. All of the boys are wearing normal black clothing, even though the school is called "Fempire." Also, we don 't see the boys at all because they seem to be living in the same house and have all dressed similarly. The movie also doesn't tell us where the student is in the school and why he got into trouble with the principal. We see that he was once a "normal" boy. He was a very good student who had no problem in making friends. But one day, while in class, he stole a lot of things. Then, he met the girl who became his girlfriend and she was a terrible liar. When he was caught, he said, "I'm really sorry." and didn't try to cover himself up. But it was too late. She had already told the police that he stole the money he had. He went to the principal and said he was sorry. But instead of doing anything about it, he sent him to the "
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    * * *   * * * This movie has such an irritatingly bland vibe to it that I wanted to run away from it. I mean, who can stand watching another movie where the main character has to wear a giant, hideous purple suit on stage? It's like the writer had absolutely no idea what she was doing. And that's not even considering the fact that the whole movie is filmed in black and white. So why are there giant purple suits all over the place? Why is every character in this movie so ugly? How can someone so skinny have such a massive waist? Are these people actually doing this for money? I mean why would they? What is the point of it? Why do they have to be ugly? Also, do they think that it would be more acceptable to see a large-breasted woman wearing a giant purple suit in front of an audience that consists of only people who can't stand it? You'd think that they would've chosen a different theme and at least made it an upbeat comedy. I was also disappointed by how much I disliked this film. It felt so out of place. The script and direction were so...boring. I really wish I could say that this movie was enjoyable, but it just wasn't. I didn't enjoy it, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - This is one of my favorite movies in my opinion. - The movie's not bad, but it's also not great. It's not a great movie that everyone should see. - I wish the movie had a more enjoyable and less tedious end. The movie has some good stuff in it, but there's also some bad parts to it too. - It's kinda too long, but the movie has a lot of awesome parts in it. - This movie is an awesome adventure movie. The plot of this movie is good, but not as exciting as "Jurassic Park." - The script is good. It tries to explain the movie's plot in a smart way. It gives a great plot that the audience shouldn't feel too lost. - There are some fun jokes in this movie, but I also found a few too funny. - Despite the fact that it's an action movie, it never feels too "heavy-handed." It's never over the top or feels too silly.    See it on Amazon
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a pretty good movie. It has a very good movie structure. The first two thirds of the film has one main character trying to save the life of another. The film then cuts back in and has the characters doing other things, and in the last third of the movie, the story is resolved. But at the time, the characters are still trying to solve the puzzle of finding out how to save a person. When they finally do, it's a pretty satisfying scene. But by the time the movie is over, the mystery is never solved, and it feels like the story was left dangling in a movie theatre in the middle of summer.  There's no real focus on the character in the film. It's not a film that takes advantage of the situation the character is in. The characters only appear for a few minutes, and you don't know how they'll get back to where they were, or where they'll end up. There is no real development of the character at all. I don't think the movie did a very bad job on making you understand who the characters were. They're kind of flat, and have little to no personality. The only thing I could find fault with is that the film tries to make its characters into a team when in actual fact they're just a bunch of people who don't get along very well. So all the scenes are just the three characters all arguing about something.  I guess it works, but it's not the best use of the characters, and for me it felt like I didn't know what was going on, or who was who. Score: 6.6/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (the 'Rotten Tomatoes' score)   the 'actual reviews'  'reviews'  'views'  'subscribe'  RottenTomatoes.com 'R' is for rotten. It's not a very good movie, but a lot of people love it. In 2009, the Internet Movie Database published its own 'Ratings and Critics' website, 'Rottentomatoes.net'. The site was a very popular source of 'bad movies', and this list has been maintained by the movie-watching public ever since. The idea of such an organization came about because many people were annoyed by the 'ratings' of movies on RottenTomato.com, which usually gave them a bad review. This is the main purpose of this site, to provide an easy and reliable way for people to find out which movies are actually good. The idea is to show the movies in the order they would appear in your own mind's eye, without ever having to see them in order. This can also be used to find any possible reasons why people dislike or love a particular movie. Many critics have been taking part in the project, and they are always pointing out any obvious flaws, to prevent the site from being dominated by reviews that contain no sense or wisdom. (See the Rotten Tomatometer FAQ for more details) If the movies are bad or not good enough to be 'good movies', they are listed as 'Dreadful' - the name of the movie which means that people would consider it a disgrace and would wish it to be burned down in flames. Some examples:  An Evil Genius (2003) -   Dreadfulness #1: The film makes the viewer think that all things evil are represented by the same character: 'Mr. Himmel'.   Dreadfulness #2: The movie starts with a really cheesy sequence of 'old school' horror films, and at the end, the final shot shows an old lady eating a rotting corpse.   In a nutshell: it's a horror film with some pretty good action scenes, some creepy images and good acting, but nothing special.  When a movie has this many 'Dreads' in one category, it is considered to be a 'Dumb movie', but some movies have even more 'Duds' than that, or even less. Here is a list of movies with
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I saw the poster for "The Hunger Games," I had no idea what to expect. I had just heard about this book/film, and as usual I had only seen a little bit of it in theaters, but I already knew it was going to be the worst book/movie/TV show ever made. I have now seen all 7 movies, including 3 different versions of it. It has been a pretty crappy experience, and it sucks because it's an iconic book/TV/film that is loved by so many. It was a very popular book when I was in high school, and now the movie series has a huge fanbase. I think it is more popular than the books, but it is still the worst, most awful movie series ever made, and the people who watch this are the worst kind of people to sit through it with. The book was great and it was well written, but the movies were terrible and the books are still great. They were so bad, I can't even imagine how bad they were. I'm still sick from it, and there are still characters I haven't been able to finish reading yet, and characters I was sure were going to die. I don't think the movie people liked the book at all. I mean, I've never seen it (yet) and I don  The worst movie series of all time, and by far the most racist movie series. This book was so horrible that I think if I lived in the same country as anyone involved in making it, I would have been locked up for life.   I read this book when it came out, and I liked it because it was one of the few books out there that wasn't just a series of vignettes (the other being "The Golden Compass"). The book is actually about a girl named Katniss Everdeen, who starts a revolution and helps lead a revolution. The story actually takes place in a post-apocalyptic world, but at the beginning it doesn't feel like it's being told from a real point of view. There are no people, and we have no idea about the society that the story is taking place in, but we know we're reading a book and are supposed to get an idea about it. There is an evil villain that has conquered the Earth and there's a revolution happening. It's pretty basic, and most people would just think it's a book about a normal girl that's trying to change the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       This is the most poorly made movie that I have ever seen.   The story of the film is about a boy and a girl who are living together in a little city called D'Amico where they are forced to live in a shack by their parents for the summer.  Unfortunately for the duo the shack is in a very dirty town where they discover that they are in for a rough life as a couple.  The movie doesn't even try to make up for the horrible quality of the script by having some really good acting, which is disappointing considering how bad the script is.  It has a very hard time establishing characters and keeping up a narrative because of its poor direction.  I could write a paragraph on all the stupid dialogue that was used in this movie but it doesn't really need to be said.  One of the biggest problems that I had with the movie was that it seemed like it was trying too hard to make the characters seem more realistic by showing scenes of them with their family, it just didn't work.  However, the fact that I found it to be bad is only in comparison to the good parts of the movie.  This movie features some of the worst acting in a film that I've seen. The performances are really bad and in many cases they actually ruined the performances of the actors.  There are some very bad acting choices by both actors and by the director and this leads to the script being so completely bad that it makes you want to go and take your family and burn it down and start again.  As you will find out later on in the film, the actors don't get better and the director even lets this happen and is pretty horrible at directing.  When all was said and done, this movie just is one big pile of garbage, which for a horror movie is fairly high praise.  With that being said, I give this movie a C+.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Don't be too harsh or negative! Sometimes bad movies get a bad reputation just because they suck. Don't let that deter you! Movies are like people. Some people are happy to have their problems solved. Others think the solution is the first step to suicide. For example, I've got a friend who watches a lot of movies. She doesn't like a lot but she knows a lot and she has the ability to remember good movies. I also know a lot about movies. And I've seen a lot. So here are the reasons why a bad film is a good movie. 1. A movie can only be good if it has heart. A good movie has heart, and heart is not something you can find in a movie.   It takes an awful lot of heart to make a movie that is not good.  To make a bad flick, you have to have a lack of imagination. The lack of heart is what is the most frightening to a child's mind. The heart that can't go anywhere is what makes the best movie to be shown to a teenager. The best movie is made by a man who does not know how to make bad movies. The man does not feel anything. So a man of limited imagination made a good one. The only way a man can do that is with a heart. 2. A story can only make a good story when it's believable. This is what it means to create a good film. It means you have imagination and you create it. If you don't know how much imagination you have, a movie will not work. It is very difficult to create believable characters. And if you are lucky, the characters you get to make, they are good. So even if the characters don't have a lot in common, you still have to create good chemistry between them. The chemistry is what creates a good picture. There is not enough chemistry if you just think you have a heart but lack imagination. It has to do with what kind of heart you have and what kind you don´t have. But a good idea and a good heart is all you need to make good movies!   3. A film has to be exciting. If it's not exciting, then it's only half an action movie. If there is no excitement, the movie will lose a lot on the viewer.  If you are going to watch a movie and be bored, don't watch it. Don´t give up watching something
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original "The Matrix" was an astonishingly successful film, with the main actor, Keanu Reeves, becoming the biggest movie star in the world in just a few years time. It received a lot of attention as a result, and was a smash hit worldwide, despite being very violent and dark. However, it's a story that is very difficult to understand, and the story is very confusing. The whole thing is very confused, even in the original film. The idea of The Matrix is a bit difficult to grasp for the average person, even if you're a fan of the film. It's about a man named Morpheus, who must solve a murder, using his abilities to do so. Unfortunately, he's unable to do this, because he has been locked in a virtual world, and is unable to use any of his abilities. His only option is to escape from the world, in order to reach out and save his girlfriend, Trinity. The entire film is very complicated, as the plot gets confusing and confusing in the end, despite the fact that it has a rather simple beginning. There are some great special effects in this film, but the editing in this movie is incredibly bad, making it difficult to keep track of what's going on. The story is hard to follow at times, but it does end up working in the final film, and you are left to wonder how you ever got through the entire thing. Overall, "TheMatrix" is a rather forgettable movie. A good movie to watch, if you just want to see a good action movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's hard to imagine that a movie about the rise and fall of a successful, powerful, and charming man could have a completely negative reputation among people who know nothing about him. The movie, however, did, and people would take to it as a bad thing when they had never heard anything good about it. There are many reasons the movie was disliked, but the one that most deserves mention is the acting of Robert Redford. Robert Redwine, the actor playing Redford, was not the best at playing a man in the midst of turmoil. He seemed to come off as a little thin-skinned and angry, which is to say, he seemed a little bit like an angry character, with a thin skin and a big mouth. However, he did bring a nice sense of humor to the situation, which was quite refreshing.   The movie was released on a Friday, so it was only open for a week or two before the negative reviews started to pile up, and before Redford could do anything about it he found himself in a controversy he could not escape. The reason, of course, was Redford's age. There were some rumors that his wife was having an affair, and that he had fathered a child with another actress. Redford was only 42 at the time, which made him a bit younger than the actress, and thus a potential suspect. Some of the negative press for the movie didn't help matters, either, especially a review by Peter Benchley in the New Yorker. Benchley wrote, "It is difficult to imagine a character with a greater capacity to inspire hate." In his review, Benchley made some very negative comments about the movie, but when Redford finally appeared on "The Dick Cavett Show" he seemed to be all in favor of the movie. He said, "I didn't do the movie to piss people off, but I did it to try to make some good films."   Redford took the controversy in stride. He also admitted that it was the only one of his films that was ever made that was completely against him, saying, "That's the only time that happened. I think that people look at it a little differently now that it's on television. I don't think I was out of control and I don,t think I made it to piss anybody off. I can honestly say that I did this film because I wanted to. I really didn't want to do it. I made
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is so good to get your money's worth from a film, so what does it take to turn it into a film that is just ok?   What does it need to be great for its first 15 minutes to turn into a movie that is at best bad, and at worst an example of bad filmmaking.   The story and story structure is so shallow and poorly constructed that one could easily get lost with it.  The film opens with a series of interviews with a man who believes he has lost his sense of self. He begins to experience auditory hallucinations which seem to be coming from a woman on his left who is trying to make him see her as a person, so he decides to go to see her in person.  He goes to her house, which is a mansion that is so large that it looks more like a cathedral. He finds her living room, and she sits on a sofa in the middle of a floor that has a pool in it. The man tells her he is a writer, and he is writing a book about his life. He tries to explain that he is not just a writer but a novelist, so she wants to meet with him to discuss it.   She tells him that she is trying not to be distracted by the life she has lived. She explains that she has spent all of her life working and never had any time for herself.  She goes on to say that she was always on the go, always on a job and always trying to please others, because the only thing she wanted was to be a successful wife and mother. She says that she used to get angry with herself because of all the pressure to be perfect, and then one day the anger went away and she started to forgive herself for all the bad things that she did. She tells the man she believes she can bring him peace and happiness, and if she is the only one who can make him happy, then she will do it. She then proceeds to talk about how she used her talent for music to create happy times, but then suddenly she can't remember anything she did at that time.  After some time passes, the man says that the life he lived was a mistake, and that he had to find a way out.  This is all explained in the beginning of the movie and is one of the reasons the story is so dull. The only time I actually felt moved was when she talked about how much she enjoyed doing music and how she never
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I do not understand the purpose of a negative rating. Why do you take away a person's opportunity to express his or her opinion? Why do we have to put a negative stamp on a movie to make it palatable to the masses? Why are you so angry and negative? Please stop, or you are only going to be a negative person. Don't you get that I have to watch this? Why am I going to take a negative approach? This is supposed to be about a good movie. That means I have my expectations and I am going to enjoy it, even if it is not as good as I would have liked. My expectations are very low and I can easily be swayed. So please, if it's just a bad film, why is there a review for it?   I would like to express how I truly feel after watching this film:  No matter how much I like it or not, the story isn't as strong as it seems. It is a good enough movie, but it isn't enough. Maybe this would make a better movie if it was an adaptation from the book, but I doubt that. I have no expectations of the movie and it's story. It's a film made by a man who makes good movies, but not good enough ones.   It is just another movie, with a twist that I am sure nobody is expecting.  I liked it when I watched it. I enjoyed it. It was entertaining. I thought that it was a good idea. But the twist just does not fit the movie. I think that the film, for the most part, is just a waste of money.  What I do like is that the whole movie takes place in the past, but the film doesn't really know where it is or how it was. So it doesn't give us a clear picture. It only tells us what happened, and then it tells us how it happened, but then it leaves it as a mystery. I feel that a film like that could have been so much better had it been done properly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If someone was just watching a movie, but didn't have time to read the blurb or pay attention to what the movie was about, they could get a wrong impression. I'm saying that even though you might enjoy the movie. You don't know the story behind the movie, the characters or the plot. I wouldn't watch a movie with a lot of technical flaws that didn't bother me. I would think about the story, why this character did this or what happened in that scene. I think you wouldn't want a bad story because you don't have enough time to enjoy it.   A movie is not complete if you don'st have a good story.  Read more and read less... I have already given some movies a high rating because I thought it was a good movie.  I have a special rating for movies that you shouldn't watch unless you've already seen most of the movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    We see some more of that very ugly film we saw so many times, but it seems it is not very good at all. The characters are poorly developed and, if there is a single good thing about it, it's that it has a very catchy song. The actors in it, most of whom are white, are pretty much interchangeable. It's a mess. "I think the worst part is how it's all presented" This film comes from a director of several racist movies in the 80's. It is set in Los Angeles in the late 80's, a time when a black teenager named Max (Dante Barry) is beaten by the Los Angeles police on a public bus. After the incident, Max and his mother, Linda (Cherry Jones), move from the ghetto to a nice neighborhood in Watts, the ghetto. The film also has an almost-black cast, with only a handful of minorities. This is because Watts was the setting for the black power movement in the 60's and 70's, so a lot of the movie takes place in that context. Also, Hollywood movies, especially the ones starring white actors, often cast black actors.  Some of the "good" scenes: Max on the bus, standing up to the police;  Max taking a "dance class", with white instructors; Max at a black pride parade (or something) with his friends. The movie is not a great movie and the only reason it's even rated R is that it contains some profanity. Why does this one stay with you? Because I felt the most beautiful scene was where Linda and Max went to a black nightclub. Linda looked so beautiful in her black top, black pants, and black shoes. And Max looked so handsome, too.  The story behind the film is one of the best in the year 2000. The director was the producer, the scriptwriter was a white writer who also did "Nights in the Moonlight" (1960), and the film stars two black actors (Deneke Jackson and Danny Glover). The only real negatives are that some of the music in the soundtrack isn't very good, and the director doesn't show a whole lot of black talent in his films.  As a side note, Max himself isn't that bad. The only "bad" thing about him is that he's only half black. #4 - "The Manchurian Candidate" (1962) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Do NOT leave a review on IMDb, even if your review isn't very positive about a movie. IMDb reviews are not "official" and are NOT based on anything but your own opinion. I'm not the only one who's seen and disliked a movie (especially a major blockbuster) that had to be rated "R", especially on a list that's so full of R's. So what if the R's are a little harsh? What if the movie wasn't that good? We know the movie got "bad reviews" when it came out (it still has a "fresh" rating on IMDB). So let's go over some of the bad reviews that have been put on IMBD. (See bottom of page for more) 3.2 The film was only rated at PG-13 in the United States. It's a bad idea to let that kind of thing stand in your way, even though they might have had to change it. For starters, PG-17 movies are allowed to show graphic violence and adult situations. The "R" rating doesn't mean it has to be PG-15, so why would they put that rating on the movie if it was rated PG-16 by the MPAA. A "R+" rating means the film has a higher rating than an "R," and it means a movie should be seen by adults and younger kids. 3.1 The first trailer for the movie shows a lot of violence (the first trailer only has two minutes). The only thing they were showing was what was shown in the film's trailer (which had nothing that you would find offensive). The first thing I can imagine a viewer might say when they see the first trailer is, "What the hell is going on? This isn't PG-12 and they're showing what's on the trailer!" 3.0 There is no reason to give a movie a PG-14 rating. This is a bad way to get your message across. Why are you rating a movie PG-10 for violence if you're not going to let anyone who is 18 or older see the movie? That's like saying, "Don't play music you hate if you have a headache because you'll catch a cold." If a person was to watch a movie and find out the music they didn't like would cause a headache, would they keep it on? If it's OK to watch R-rated movies then it should be OK for parents and children to enjoy

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     "In the end, I thought it was a very strong film, but I could never get into it and I never really liked anything about it. I didn't really care for the characters, I didn''t like any of the plot twists and I didn''''t like how the movie ended." -- Review from a reader who gave this movie two stars  Synopsis: In the end we know that the story of "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" is a lot more complicated than "a beautiful girl goes on a dark and mysterious journey". The film is a psychological thriller that tells a story of a young woman, Lisbeth Salander, who goes on an unknown journey with a mysterious person. In the beginning we see that the main character has a very difficult life, she has an unstable home life and is not the friend that most people would like her to be. She is a woman who has been through a lot of trauma and her life has been in a state of turmoil. In some way Lisbeter was able to turn her life around through some new friends that she found in the dark and dangerous world of "the cyberpunk world". The most difficult of these friends was the mysterious Mr. White who has a lot to do with Lisbetel. The girl who had to make the decision to take the risk of her life and go on a long journey with the mysterious man, in this movie, was Daniel Craig. In this movie we get to know that, after the death of her parents, Lisbetes life is not all that it seemed to be and she is in a situation that is not easy for anyone. Her new friends are not a perfect match for her because of their very different personalities. She has a difficult relationship with her mother but she has a great relationship with one of her other friends. She also has some problems with her father who she doesn''t see that he could be more helpful. Lisbets life changes completely when she meets a new boy in a bar, she is so shocked by him that she does not know what to say. Soon she finds out that she really likes this man and begins to think about meeting him. The journey that she is going on now in this film is really difficult for her and she starts to fall in love with the new boy that she meets. On this journey she meets so many things that make her feel really alone and on the contrary, it turns out that there is a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     4.   A.  I loved this movie, and I've never had any problem with the acting, or the direction.  It has a really good sense of humor, a good ending, and has a good plot.  The reason I rated it a four is because it was the only movie I've ever seen that had a scene in which I was embarrassed to be sitting next to someone.  I was wearing a nice, dressy outfit and looked like a supermodel, and was just trying to be respectful to the camera.  A man stood up and said to me, "Why do you wear a dress?"  I had no idea what he meant.  He kept on asking me questions about it, but my answers were only about the color of it. I didn't know what a "dress" was, so I was kind of stumped. Finally he said, "No way! You don't have a wedding dress!"  He started to walk away, then turned back and said,  "No, really. Do you?"  So, I had to admit that I really did have a dress.  His comment was "What about it?"  "What do you mean?"  He explained that he was talking to my boyfriend. I wasn't sure how to respond to that. I couldn't tell him, "I've never seen you wear one, so you'd have to buy me one."  "You have a boyfriend?"   I just couldn't think of a witty response.   "You'll see soon enough."   At this point, the man kept asking me the same question over and over.  Finally, I was about ready to give up.  When I did, he said to the cameraman, "Oh, you can take a picture."  Then he went on to say that he's going to tell my boyfriend that I wear dresses and he should buy me a dress from a designer.  This went on for a good while. Eventually, he turned to me and said it was his birthday and that I should "have fun with his birthday money."  I didn't know what to say to that at the time, but I was starting to feel awkward.  After he left, I called my boyfriend and told him the story. He laughed and told me that he would make a good dress for me.  So he went to a designer and asked me to pick out
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        My second viewing of this movie was with a group of friends who were all more into horror movies, and who loved this movie. The horror element was the one area that I thought was a little lacking. The movie is just a little too creepy for me to get into. The film is so slow to start that I really have no idea what's going on until the end, and the movie never does provide me with any actual answers. The acting is just plain terrible, with a ton of actors playing more than one role. It was really hard to get along with all of the actors. The only really good part of the film was when the movie had to deal with the consequences of some really dark and twisted events that are never really explained.  The film has a really long trailer, and then only shows one scene, which doesn't really do the movie any favors.   Despite the terrible acting, the movie's premise was still a fun one: A group of kids have gone missing and the police are having a hard time finding them.  The movie does start off really fast, so I won't blame you for skipping to the first minute if you just want to watch the movie without all of these plot elements. The story is about a group called the "Grimm", a group that consists of two girls, a boy, and a dog. The main character, Alex, gets into an altercation with one of the girls and he begins to have strange visions about "The Monsters", people that have been locked away in a mental hospital. He is then kidnapped by one of these monsters, and Alex is taken to the hospital where she must deal with The Monsters.  It's a pretty basic premise, and I liked that there was a lot of mystery and horror going on with Alex and the Monsters, but it really wasn't my cup of tea.  I'm not sure how much you can expect out of this, but the way that it was written, I would expect more. This film wasn't really creepy, nor was it a fun movie to watch, and if you're looking for an "interesting" film to watch on Halloween, this isn't going to do it for you.    Overall, I think that the movie is a bit of a let down, and that it will likely have a smaller audience.  If you're a horror fan or even a movie buff who can't stand slow movies, you may enjoy
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am surprised that this has not been done better by some of the movies from the 70s and 80s.   At least I've seen some bad movies before.  A lot of them, anyway.  And this is a bad one.  It's a poor effort on the part of all involved in the filmmaking, and they should have spent a little more time in planning out what they were trying to do.  There are some funny moments in this movie.  But the movie's plot does not hold up to scrutiny.  I'm not going to give a description of this movie in detail because, as I've said, it's a bad piece of crap that's going to make you laugh your ass off and then walk out of the theatre shaking your head in disgust.  Even so, it would have been worthwhile to read my review of this bad movie, so you can get a feel for what I was talking about in my earlier review. But, now you're here, reading my review, so it's up to you to see if you can figure out the plot of this pathetic movie. So, now that you've seen a bunch of bad movies, it is time to see a good movie. This is one of them.  Now, while I have watched a bunch a bad movies (some of them quite a few), I have never watched one that had nothing to do with cinema that I found entertaining.  This movie has everything to do to make this a bad film.  We begin with a man named Frank (John Schuck, of All the President's Men fame) who is being treated by a man by the name of Dr. Frank.  Frank is the type of man you expect to see in the 1970s. It is as if Dr. Robert Frank (the name of the guy being treated) thought he was being played by a guy who has been acting for twenty years, and not by a sixty-something year old man.  The main character of the movie, Frank, is a rather good actor who does a nice job in his role.  He does all the right things, but they don't make much of a difference in the movie. But at the end of the day, he's a good guy who wants the best for people.  What's worse is that Frank is never really given the opportunity to demonstrate his goodness.  In fact, he is almost always forced to be evil in a number of

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I hate to do it but the first two movies of this trilogy were so horrible. The ending of the first movie was like a death knell. I hated it. The second movie was the same. The third movie was so bad I couldn't bear to watch it. There were no good guys in this movie at all. The characters were completely unsympathetic and the action was just as bad as the first movies. There was one character that stood out to me though:  "You can't beat a man like me!"   There's nothing more disappointing to me than when I see a movie like this. It has such potential for a great story and yet it fucks everything up. I wouldn't watch this movie again if it was advertised on the screen in the mall I was at.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'd been dying to see this movie for ages, but hadn't been able to catch a screening. It wasn't until the time I was looking for a movie that I heard about it on my morning commute. Well, since it's always the same thing... There are 3 stories of a guy who is looking for his ex-girlfriend. We get some of that 'I hate my ex-boyfriend-but I'm just looking for him now thing' story, but it's also a story of two friends trying to have some fun and not get in their respective exes' way. You know what? The best part is when all 3 stories are told in the same movie and one of them ends up having a relationship with her! That's what I wanted: for two people to have a good time. Well this isn't one of those stories. I'm glad it didn't end up like The Graduate, where the love interest is always someone else.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      1. "The Room" is a film about a girl who moves to a new house with her boyfriend. After a night of fun and excitement, things go wrong. She is forced to do something that she never thought she would have to do:   "We're in a hotel. The room is the same room. The door is the door. We never leave it. The same thing's going on inside the room. It's me in the same spot where I was before. It hasn't changed, and it never will. The people are the same people. The music's the same. The TV's the TV. It doesn't change. The place is the hotel. It always was."   2. This scene in "The Disaster Artist" is not only one of the worst, but one of my least favorite scenes of cinema. It was the most painful scene of the movie. It made me angry, and that scene made me want to hit somebody in the face. It also made me laugh and I thought it was very clever. The only thing it did was make the movie less interesting.   3. This was a movie that took me a long time to find and I have no idea why it has so much controversy over it. Maybe it has to do with the fact that in it the guy says things like:  This isn't going to be the movie that everyone's going to love. This isn't the movie we've been waiting for. This is the movie they've been hiding from us.  , so I'll give it one star because it does have some things that are good. There are many memorable moments, and when you are watching it you think: 'that was just great.' However, the last 30 minutes of the film are terrible, and I think the movie just goes on and on and it's boring.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - You're a bitch.   There are a few movies I hate so much I can't stand the trailer and have to watch it anyway.  I'm not sure what it is about horror films that make them so disgusting for me.  Horror films that aren't just horrible.  The same way that the film that makes you cry at a certain point is the one you remember the most.  I remember The Shining and Night of the Living Dead and The Exorcist and The Blair Witch Project.    I never remember seeing a horror movie that I wasn't sick to death of the moment it ended.  To be fair, I did hate The Existential Horror Horror  in which I was too young to see and I was never a big fan of the Blair Witch  movie, either.  They are all terrible movies but not the same for me because I have grown up and seen them.  In short, the trailer for the new Saw movie is a good way to ruin your entire day. It is not just me. -   The plot is actually a lot of fun, though it's a bit silly.  Saw is one of the best horror movies ever made, with a killer as well as a whole bunch of other people that have a hand in what we see happen to her.  It is very funny, especially in the first act.  One of the most memorable scenes for me is a very small one where a guy walks into a restaurant.  He sees a person behind the counter and tries to leave before a horrible scene begins.  After he walks out he comes back in to watch the movie.  If you have never seen Saw before you should go see it immediately. It's like you're watching a horror film yourself.  So what happens after that?   Oh man that sounds interesting. - It's a lot like how a horror story ends.  This movie is about an angry old woman.  She kills a bunch of people and tries her best to have them arrested.  At the end of the movie you have a big bad ending. I'd watch that over a trailer any day.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    1  2  3  4  5 stars   The story of "The Road" is a story of family, but more than that it is a history of America. It is a tale of an America of hope, but also a America that was on the cusp of being destroyed. It was a country on the verge of its greatest catastrophe. The nation was torn by a bitter war between rich and poor. There was violence in every walk of life. There were bitter divisions within the Union Army itself. The Civil War was no longer a matter of "If it could happen here" and it was not just the North that was fighting, it was the South that was the most violent. This was a war with the whole nation at stake.   This book was not meant for children, but it is as good an overview of a great country as you will ever find. This book is one of the greatest American writers ever to grace a page. I can't even begin to tell you how much I enjoyed this book. The first part of the book has the usual war stories. The story of George Washington, General William T. Sherman, General Ulysses S. Grant. The battles of Gettysburg and Vicksburg. The stories of the Union soldiers. But these tales were all told with a twist of sadness. The men that were fighting were not fighting to win and were not even fighting for themselves. They were fighting for their families and their country.  ....   In this book we get to hear the true stories of these people and their struggles. In the final battle of Gettysburg, we see the real horrors of war. In 1863 in the Vicksburgh Campaign, we hear the stories of how each soldier fought. Some were wounded, some killed. We see the great suffering of both sides.   the main character of " The Road" has come home and is now the leader of the South. He has a job to do and he must find a way to unite the country under his leadership. He needs money to pay his men, but he must also find a balance between his family and the war. He was a general in the Union army and he has come back to the South for his family.   and I don't mean to just talk about the story of the characters. I mean to talk about why I loved this book so much. In all of his battles and on all of the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This movie isn't worth seeing and doesn't deserve your money. There's no real plot, no real story, and no real characters in this movie. We have a man with no legs that talks and walks like he's 4 or 5. There is a big talking dog that talks but talks about nothing. And there's this crazy crazy robot guy who doesn't talk. And the "man" with no arms doesn't actually have a face and isn't shown as one. So the guy and the dog and the robot all have no bodies, not one person is real. And they all wear clothes! So what the hell is this movie about? It's a waste of time to waste your time with it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is terrible, the actors are so uninspired, and the cinematography is so bad that they could not give a shit. The music and sound effects are terrible, and are so distracting that I was more worried about the actors trying to talk than watching the film.   I was watching this for the first time when I saw the trailer for the film, and had to Google it just to figure out what the hell was going on. The only redeeming thing about this film is that the opening is pretty fucking cool and the ending is cool.  If I ever had to watch this, I would stay far away.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought that this movie was terrible! First the story is awful. The actors are awful and the cinematography is terrible. I'm surprised they even bought this film for the theaters because of how terrible it is. You just think it was made by a bunch of teens. You get to the movie and the screen is a little fogged and you think "who was this kid when they made this?". The movie is just a bad attempt at making a horror movie. It's so bad that the only thing that saved the movie was the ending. You think the movie is going to end with the main character running out of the theater. You're wrong. The movie goes into that "mystery box" thing and you see that someone is holding a box, but it's not someone who could even fit in the box. This is just another dumb movie that the actors couldn't make up their mind if they wanted to be in it or not. Overall, this movie is pretty bad and I didn't find it to be funny at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie in my youth and I remember it very well because it was one of the first movies I ever watched.  The music is very nostalgic and I still remember the title and I really enjoyed it.  I really have to say that if I ever saw a movie where the hero/heroines are all really pretty (i.e. Scarlett Johansson in Ghost in the Shell, Annyong in The Wolf of Wall Street, or Natalie Portman in Black Swan) I really liked this movie, because it wasn't too cliché or cliched.  Also, I really like a good romantic movie.  A very good romantic comedy about two young girls who have their love life turned upside down by a wealthy, successful man.  This movie was a big hit back then and is even better now, because of the fact that they don't have to be related to each other to fall for each other.  So if you have a girl in your life that you can't seem to get out of your head, then this movie is just for you.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot:  One day, a stranger calls his ex-girlfriend. She seems to be having difficulties. She calls a doctor to check on her. Her family believes she is having a breakdown. The doctor says she is fine, but his research says otherwise. She goes home and spends some time with the doctor. Soon, she starts having nightmares about a malevolent figure.   After he leaves, she begins experiencing vivid dreams about being tied up, chained up, locked in a box. She also seems to see that the figure has the ability to control her.  The film is scary, and I recommend it, but I would advise that if you are not a fan of horror, that you watch it with someone who is.  Cinderella's stepsister and sister, Rapunzel and Aurora, appear in the same fairy tale, Cinderella. These sisters have never met. The first time they meet, Aurora tells Rapunzal to go to a neighbor's house and tell her sister what the good girl has been doing at their house. The good girl is, of course, a princess, Aurora. After the meeting, Rapunkal, the good child, goes out for a walk with her sister, and then runs out into the forest. At that moment, Aurora appears and stops her sister in her tracks. She wants her to stay and play with her. The two of them go into the woods, and the two sisters become a team. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's always better to take a shot at a negative than an unfunny movie.   No spoilers in this review.  You might want to avoid it.  The movie starts with two people getting ready to move into a new apartment together.  There is a little banter between the two as they get to know each other.   The movie really gets rolling when they get home after a few days of not seeing each other and start making plans for a weekend of fun.  It should be said that the comedy in this film is the only part of it that works.  I think the actors play their parts, but not well.  When they were at a diner and talking about their relationship, I thought it was really funny to see them joke about not speaking in German.  This movie is fun for a few minutes, but the characters keep making jokes about how the other doesn't seem to understand their culture.  After they're done joking, they go back to being sad about not getting to know one another.  Finally, they decide to go to the mall to buy something.  One of them gets separated from his girlfriend and they end up in a mall in a German town.  They end up being caught in a police station and when they try to escape the policeman is having none of it and starts shooting.  At this point, I lost all interest in the movie, but a few lines of German got me to laugh.  However, the movie isn't bad. There are some funny lines here and there, but overall, this movie is a dud.  If you like funny movies, this is a pretty good one to check out.  But if you want something other than a funny movie, this isn't it.   It's just an average German-German-Italian comedy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Let's not even think about how many bad movies exist in the world.   If a bad film has an even slightly good plot/conception/production values then I think it is okay to give it a shot.  Sometimes a movie is just a bad idea.  I'm not saying that a movie with an odd plot is automatically a bad one.  If something works well and it has a good story, then I am fine with it.  But if the film is terrible and there are no compelling stories in the movie then it's just plain old bad.  This applies to every movie out there.  Even good films have bad stories and/or plots.  And you can be sure that every film that gets a high "Rotten" rating in the reviews are either bad movies or were poorly written or conceived.  So, if a movie has a very good script and good production values and if it is a bad and poorly directed film, then you should probably just steer clear.  Don't waste your time.  You can't be a real critic if you give a movie a bad score.  Just don't.  Let's not forget about people who think they have a good movie idea and then find that it is just one of many movies with an awful script that are "saved" by being given an "R" by critics.  That is one of the worst things a critic can do.  The only people who would be able to figure out that a script was bad are the people who worked on the script.  For the rest of you, just ignore these people and if a bad screenplay is one that you like, I suggest that you not look for bad reviews.  Some people say that you have to read some bad reviews to see how bad a movie can be.  They say that the more reviews that say the same thing about a movie, the more good it must be.   What they don't realize is that the way that bad reviews are worded can give you a completely different impression of the movie.  It is just like that in real life.  We hear things about someone that we don't like.  Then we say to ourselves, "Wow, I never heard that from this person before!"  They may have said it once before.  But in a good review, they use the same exact word to describe the person.   Let me say this clearly.  Good reviews are

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My wife and I like the old Disney movies, so we decided to do a Halloween version of "The Little Mermaid". Our daughter, her friend and her mother were in our apartment when we started the filming. We heard a lot of scary stories about the movie, which scared us a lot. The director, Alan Menken, started to tell the stories, and the story about the mermaids did not look pleasant. We did not like it, it was so horrible. We could not understand how men can be so cruel to each other. The whole movie was so sad, not a happy movie. It had no humor, and a really horrible ending. I would recommend it for kids, and adults, if you want to see a Disney movie with evil.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For what I like in a movie, I like the story. This is not good. The story is about a man who has some money and decides to have a party. He goes to a friend's house and the friend makes him a couple of drinks. The man then comes out of the shower to find his friend has changed from his usual tanned skin to a dark skinned one. The guy is a con man and wants a cut of the party. I can't really say why this happened to the character but the rest of the film is pretty much made up of him trying to get money from the other guys at the party by telling them lies. The plot and characters are pretty much the only part of the movie I liked. The action scenes are pretty funny at times but you know what they say about the funniest guys you know who can't hit a moving target.  4 out of 10.   The movie didn't have many things to offer and didn't really go anywhere. I did like the character of the guy. 5 out of 6.  I was disappointed at the ending. I was expecting a happy ending but I wasn't really pleased with the end result. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      The "good" movies are usually good because they're from the 1970's.   Some are good, but they're always bad by modern standards.    This is one of the most blatant cases of that.  It's a movie about a guy who goes on a road trip and meets a crazy old man named Doc Holliday. _______________________________________________________________________________ If you liked this review, you may also like this one:   How to Kill Your Friends

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     "A very bad movie" (the movie is good)  - A movie you never would have imagined  A bad movie and bad actors (as well as a poor script)  the acting is bad, the music is not very good, no one really gives a good performance, and the movie just is "bad" in every aspect of the word  I cannot give this a negative rating unless the movie was the same bad all the way through (which is not the case, it does not give you an "okay movie")  One of the worst movie ever made, just a total disappointment, I cannot give it a higher rating  So if you like a good, well-written comedy with good actors and music, and want a good laugh, this is the movie for you.  If you want an angry ranting comedy about a group of losers, watch a different movie. It has a different vibe than your average comedy. The story starts off with a lot of "I told you so's" and "you're just jealous I had sex with a hot chick on the first date". However, that is the entire movie. The plot is not nearly as bad as it could have been. There is a lot to like about this movie, as well.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film has been given a horrible rating by almost every review I have seen. I don't think that many people give a film a bad rating because the story was poor or the actors were bad but because the actors weren't good. This is a shame. The acting was a lot better than what we are used to but it was still not good enough to be good. I really enjoyed the first act but then the story got boring and repetitive. The third act made it obvious that the film was going to be a bad one but it couldn't get out of the first one's clutches. I thought it was an interesting story but the bad actors couldn't hide the fact that this film was not even trying to be interesting. I also thought that they had used a lot of CGI. The CGI was more annoying than anything else. I think it made the film look cheap and forced. I did not even understand why people in this movie wanted to die in the first place. They should have just made them do a scene where they did a stunt and then a scene later when they got out of a car where they would do a stunt. It would have been much more interesting. If the film had taken this approach then it might have been a good film but as is it is a bad film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think the only good thing about this movie is it's name. It's a very long movie, with only one good scene.  The movie was all set up for a third act.   But that was all for show in this movie.  We're just treated to the crap and the characters are completely unsympathetic.  I would have liked to see a bit more development of the characters, like the relationship with the mom and her husband. I felt like there wasn't much depth and we had too little screen time to develop any character or story.  Also I would say the director was a very poor director.  He couldn't get any of the shots in the film to work.  This film is a disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really enjoyed the movie. I have to admit that the actors were excellent and the movie was good. However, I felt that there was an un-needed "plot" in the movie that was just a bit too much. I felt like they could have put a bit more effort into it and not put it in a "movie about a man trying to figure out his feelings." I don't know why there was this un-necessary plot. It was just there and unnecessary and distracting from the movie's overall goodness. Overall, I would suggest it to anyone who enjoys a good comedy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     "There were two main characters, two big, fat, angry guys, and they had a big, stupid fight, and a girl who didn't care about that. There were a couple of things in this movie that were too long and dragged on way too long, and also there were a lot of plot holes that were left in the movie. It's just not very good. I don't like the story, the characters, the acting, I don' t like how long it was."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really looking forward to this movie. I'd heard the cast was top notch. I was also really excited to watch this movie since I love horror movies. However, what I got was... well, an average movie at best. The story was pretty good, but it was not interesting enough to keep me engaged. It was just there and nothing more. It just got in my way. There was no real story to it, but that did not matter to me. I wanted to know more about these characters. I could have been bored by the plot. The gore was awesome in this movie, but was also extremely graphic. I thought it was way to intense, but at the same time, this is how the movie should have been done. It does have gore and blood, and it's not a gorefest. You have to look up gore on youtube. I got a kick out of that. I really liked how the characters were portrayed, and the actors did a great job. However... there are a lot of people in the audience who were not into this movie and wanted more horror. It's a movie for people who want more horror and will watch it without any expectations. However if you're looking for a good horror movie, and you're not into gore, this movie is not for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "   "   A negative review from me:  " You might as well call the movie "The Room" or "The Naked Gun." I thought this was the most hilarious, cringe-inducing, over-the-top movie in the world. I'd rather watch The Naked Gun in its original theater than this. There was nothing funny about it. This was an awful movie, not just to watch but to read, listen to, or absorb."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I can tell you that because I have seen about a half dozen films in my life that I can say are worse."  I didn't have an issue with the film as much as I thought I did, and it didn't surprise me, but it was the ending, and the way it was handled that made me upset.  The plot involves a kid who was kidnapped and forced to watch a movie where a woman was decapitated.  When the woman's head is placed in a pot, she gets "swallowed" by the crows.  She is resurrected, but the cocks, the bird creatures that were part of the plot, are now a group of men that go after her and her boyfriend.  After fighting and fighting they are only able to subdue her and take her away.  We see flashbacks of her before the kidnapping as a young girl and what she was doing at school.  This part of it seemed to make it clear that the whole film was about her, not the man's story.  At the end they have to kill her so that the birds can be rid of her, and then there is a shot of the cobs looking at her head, looking like they are waiting for the cuckoo to come back and devour her body.  This didn't seem to bother me much because it was so out of the ordinary for the entire film and not as out of character as some of the things that have been done before, but there are things that were still wrong with it, and in this case that's the way they handled it, in a way that seemed to be more about how they were doing it than about the story.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is not very good. The acting is terrible, there are a lot of cheap shots, and it's boring. The movie tries to be a buddy-cop flick but it never really feels that way, and the movie is only 10 minutes long. The ending, which is so clichéd and so bad that it's annoying, doesn't even help. I guess the movie was designed to get people to go to a movie but what a bad idea. I can't recommend this movie. 2

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     "This film was crap. I was disappointed with it for a lot of reasons, most of which were pretty minor. I would rather go to see a movie at a theater that was great, but this was definitely not. The acting was really bad, the story was really lame, the cinematography was really awful, and the soundtrack was just terrible. The film starts off on a bad note, with one of the more stereotypical female characters, then the movie gets much worse from there. The writing was pretty awful, the script had way too much exposition, and we never got to really understand what happened to any of the characters. It was really hard to care about anything, because the movie didn't give a damn. The special effects were also pretty bad, although it wasn't really that noticeable. Overall, I just found this film to be a complete waste of time and money. It's just a lot to listen to. If you don't have time to go see this film because it's on TV or DVD, then you might as well just stick to the good ones."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There is always the chance that some of the negative reviews of a movie is actually true.   The movie is bad, it's not bad like the movie has a bunch of good parts. There are a lot of bad parts in the movie, but if you're going to be a victim of the "movie" that has a good story then you are going to have a great time and it's going to become a "memorable movie".   If you are not going to enjoy the movie then you should see it to the end.  What I love about the movie is that the director/actor doesn't just go along to be part of the movie.  He is a great character, he is a bit crazy. He gets the girl, they have fun together and they have a romantic moment but he gets kidnapped and they must escape.  The music is very different from the usual movie music, but it's very interesting in this movie and it really fits in the film.  It is not the usual type of music you usually see on a movie soundtrack.  When I was watching this movie I was thinking about the story and I think that this movie does a great job of telling a great story and it feels like a "real" movie. There's some action, and the movie isn't very scary, it does make you think a lot about what is going on and it makes you go back and watch the movie several times to see what is happening.  But, what made this movie so great?  I liked the movie so much that I've watched it multiple times.  This movie is really good!   This movie was really great for a couple of reasons. It's a very "realistic" movie and you can see it really happening. The scenes are very easy to follow and you get a feeling of the people's lives in this crazy situation. If you're looking for something to watch that has very "serious" elements then this movie is for you.  I think this movie would be perfect if it was shown in a prison, or a prison that has some of those "crazy things" that happen in movies.  In any case, it is a very good movie and I love it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The entire plot of the movie is just a complete load of bull. It all revolves around a gang of "bad guys" that have invaded the village and are holding the villagers hostage. The movie gives us no clue about who these people are or what they are really doing. In fact we are not even sure what we are supposed to feel in this story. We are just supposed to be horrified at what this group of bad people are doing to the innocent people in this village and try to stop them. If we had known what this movie was about before watching it, we would not have watched it at all. You just can't make a story that revolves around killing innocent people work. And there is no sense of urgency in the plot, it seems to be there just to create tension and to make the plot seem more plausible. The film begins with this weird and disjointed "scene" of a woman running down a street with a dog that she has just picked up. As she runs down the street she stops at a traffic light and screams out a message in Arabic. The message in question? "The dogs are with you, the dogs are your friend". We are then treated to a short scene of an innocent girl playing with a toy dog, then she is shot and killed, the dog is then shot and then the girl dies. Now here is a plot that you and I would expect from a bad horror film. But this is Hollywood we are talking about. It is nothing more than the simple plot of a bunch of people running through a village and killing some innocent villagers and then having the dog, who we are to believe is innocent, shoot and kill this girl. This is the most basic plot you could imagine and is completely meaningless. It should be obvious by now why the movie doesn't work. But we don't seem to care because this is a movie about killing people. The whole movie is about killing more people. But even in this context, it is an uninteresting movie. It just isn't scary. It's a bad film. - Rating:  A Very Short Introduction to the History of Science and Religion:  This is a good movie. I like it. It has a good plot and there are some good science and religion concepts being discussed. The only problem with this movie is that there is some terrible acting. I'll try to explain why. In the beginning of the film there is a scene where a girl runs along the side of
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I think the reason there isn't as much bad movie criticism as there is nowadays is because people are more aware of the terrible quality of the stuff they are watching than they were ten years ago."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For a movie of this genre, there are many more negative things that happen, that make it bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love The Fast and the Furious (or should I say Furious?) and I'm a HUGE fan of Vin Diesel, but the new installment has had many issues that should have been addressed in the first movie. I would say that the most glaring issue that was introduced in the new film was the fact that one of the main characters is played by a guy who could not act. This is the case with a number of characters in the film, but it really didn't stop there. The new guy played by Dwayne Johnson couldn't even act when his character was at his most obnoxious, while the new female character is portrayed as a hot chick and not a tough one. This leads to a certain degree of confusion when two people fight, because one of them is a female and the other is a guy. All in all, this was a rather confusing film.  The next issue is the plot, or the idea of the plot. The plot is quite well written and the actors' abilities are actually quite good. The problem that I have is the fact, that all of the characters are very cliche and don't seem to be fleshed out in any way. The most glaring example of this is the main villain who plays an evil businessman and has a really stupid voice that goes along with this. This guy should have had some personality, but he goes along the lines of a very simple villain and a very bland one at that. There are also some rather generic side characters that don't bring anything new to the plot or have any potential to. The only one that makes a strong appearance is Michelle Rodriguez's character, who actually had some interesting ideas and could have been an interesting character in her own right.   The acting is also rather weak, as it's not at all convincing to watch these people get killed off or be put in awkward situations.  All in All, the new movie was very bad, and it just feels like it was an excuse to have a different set of characters. If you are a fan of the original trilogy and want to see some new adventures of the franchise, this is not the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like this movie, I don't have a review. I saw it on video, but that's about all I know. I only remember that this movie is about a dude named B.C. who does bad things and then his family is killed, so he starts trying to do bad things again to get his revenge. It sounds like it's going to be a really depressing movie. But this movie actually has a funny and cool ending. There is a whole montage of flashbacks to B.B.'s childhood that reveal that B.L. actually was a really cool person before he turned bad. He was always helping people in trouble and never had any problems. He always had a smile on his face. So this movie ends with B.R. becoming the bad guy again. It seems like it could be a boring movie. Then, he gets into some trouble with the police and we discover that the whole thing was just a movie. So, even though I didn't enjoy the whole movie, it was still a good movie with some funny parts.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Cinderella" is a Disney movie that, as I can say from my own experience, is not a good film. It is, however, a good song.  The story is basically Cinderella, except Cinderella was never actually born. That's actually pretty interesting, because you do learn the story in order to understand what the "Cinderellas" are doing in this movie. And while "Cendrillon" would certainly be more interesting than the "Prince Charming" story that it is (or the "Princess" story, either), I actually quite liked this movie, although I wouldn't actually call it a Cinderella story in the conventional sense.  and you'll love the music. . The plot is a bit slow, because in the end the main heroine has to be saved from a fairy-tale-style curse (which she doesn't believe in and isn't really in the story) by her sister, a princess with no real place in her kingdom, except for being the wife of Prince Charming. That's a fairly standard tale of an unloved princess who's somehow brought together a group of princes, and in this case, an extremely boring one who is just looking for a wife and doesn't really like anybody and is the perfect person to bring up the princess in his own right, and also, he's kind of gay. The whole thing is an absolute disaster. As far as the plots go, it does what it set out to do: make Cinderella look stupid and pretty. Heck, the whole movie is just this trope-fest about a pretty girl, a prince, the prince marrying her and being the one to marry the princess, and some other guy who just sort of keeps showing up in order for the story to progress and so on and so forth. And the "evil" villain, whose story is never revealed, is really boring and really mean and really evil. The music is actually pretty awesome, though. But the most annoying thing about this movie is that, even though it is pretty boring, you really just want to watch it. You get a little bored, but then you can't take your eyes off the screen. And I hate to say it, but this movie doesn't make me want to go see a bunch of other Disney movies, like, I don't know, the "Tangled" or "Frozen" movies. So, all in all,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The thing I like most about movies is that they are often made by talented people who don't care about making a good movie, they just want to make a movie.   I've never seen anything so bad that it made me hate something that I loved so much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In a world where you can buy anything, we can easily afford to throw away our films that we don't like. So what can you do when a movie is so bad, that it feels like an out-of-body experience? Well, you can find a new movie. You can find the movie that you did not want to see. You get an eyeful of all the horror of not wanting to see that awful movie at all. You see the film, but you don't want to keep it.   What can you learn from a movie that makes you feel uncomfortable?:   A few years ago, I had the wonderful chance to sit through the screening of the remake of The Exorcist, and at the end I was the only person who did not leave. In fact, we stayed to watch the first hour of the film.  My friend, as usual, was right in there with me:  He left right after the last scene.  Now I don't know if this is a common reaction for filmgoers, but when The Ex in question was released in 1969 it was an instant classic.  The film went on to win three Oscars and went on be nominated for eight.  Many people today are aware that it is one of the best horror films of all time, but that is only because the film is so scary.  At the time, it was considered a modern masterpiece, and it is only now, when it is more than a quarter of a century old, that we can truly appreciate what it was capable of.  It is not that The Ex had too much gore and didn't make the audience feel afraid. Rather, it gave the audience a taste of the terror of the situation the characters were in, and allowed them to take things in stride.  We don't get to see it now, and I will always appreciate how much the filmmakers went to capture the intensity of that moment.  I loved how they went about capturing the feelings of dread. The Ex gave us a lot to think about.  One of my favorite scenes is a flashback where an old priest is seen talking to a group of people.  He tells the story of how he came to this world, and how the people who were trapped in hell tried to get out to seek a better life in the land of paradise.  In the end, it doesn't seem to matter what he says to the people. They don't respond and

The movie even had an actor's "face" which appeared on screen to remind you that there was a face. That was weird, I thought. I also didn't appreciate that the entire script was composed of a single sentence: "There is a man named?" and a single thought:?"Who was that? That man was!" The rest of the script was written by?".?" which was so stupid that I laughed. So, is?" a comedy?   Yes, but?" has no sense of humor. At one point,? asked: "Do you like him? Do you like?" This was followed by!"! and then by?". How is a guy like that supposed to get over?"'s dead ex-wife?"?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You know what's worse than being a reviewer?   (It's bad reviews that seem to imply that good movies don't exist and aren't worth watching.)   If this is a problem with the current reviews in Hollywood, I'm glad it's a problem of Hollywood.   I have a lot of respect for many of the filmmakers who work in Hollywood. They are very talented people who work hard and make their movies better each and every time. So why, after watching their movies a dozen times in a row and getting progressively more and more disgusted with them, are the fans of these films so angry? I don't know.    I know it's all about the money.  The Hollywood studios make a ton of money. They have a bunch of talented people doing their bidding and I'm sure some are doing it for the love of the art. _______________________________ "I hate it when they say "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace" doesn't work because it's not "epic" like "Star Trek" or the original "Star Fox". ______________________________ I saw the original Star Wars in the theatres.  The original Star War is a masterpiece.  When I first heard that George Lucas had written a new sequel to the Star Wars trilogy, I was intrigued. I have heard that a couple of times but I wanted to see it and see how it turned out.  I knew that Lucas would try to make something that was a little different. I liked the idea.  And then I read the reviews.  Here are the reviews that I read: " A new and improved "Star War"  continues Lucas' trend of trying to find a way to make his movies seem new by taking advantage of the latest technological advances, but it's just as tedious as before." _____________________________ "This is not a film for the younger generation.  Lucas has finally reached his limits in this film and the old-time moviegoers have taken note of it."  ____________________________ "The Star Wars films have always been better and more impressive than most of the movies that try to compete with them.  This film may just be the worst of them."  "A little too long, and the space battle isn't as exciting as I had hoped." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You can't really say a negative movie is bad unless you're talking about a movie that's just a total flop. I can appreciate an interesting movie like, say,  A Clockwork Orange or  The Terminator, but that's not a movie I'll be excited to watch again. I'm talking about something like  The Lord of the Rings, or any of the many great action movies like  The Matrix or  Die Hard. Those movies are classics because they make you believe you're really in the middle of a battle, and I'd pay to see those films again just to see the action again. The reason that the average movie that you see this year will probably be more successful than anything else is that they're not really "bad". They're just poorly made, and the average filmmaker doesn't have the artistic vision that a Kubrick or a Spielberg has.    The movie is well made. I have seen  The Lord of The Rings  before, so it's been a while since I've seen the movies that were made before it, but I don't recall it being bad in any way. I just wish that they had gotten away from the whole elf chase thing, but whatever. The movie doesn't do much, but you can't expect much. The acting is all right. The actors are the same type of actors, but it doesn't matter because there is no acting to the movie. The plot is very confusing, and some of it was just silly.  5.  The Wicker Man  (1981) The Wicker Witch was my favourite film of the year. The ending was great, and all of the characters felt like real people. However, I'm not sure what made me love it so much, it's a movie about a guy and a woman who go out into the middle-of-nowhere Australia, and they end up being murdered. I like the movie, but not so much because it was a weird and awesome movie. It made me want to go out and go to a movie and find someone who's really good and like, see them again, but  The Witch  isn't. I really liked the ending. It had a nice sense of finality. There's a sense of sadness, and a feeling of loss that you feel, but even though you're getting a bad ending, it still makes it worth watching. The other thing that's going to make
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    -   The worst movie ever made.   I feel horrible for having seen it.  - I'm sure if I did it again I would've done a better job.  What a huge waste of time!  - This was a disaster and this is just one of many movies like it. The only good thing is they've taken the concept and made it into a great film.  A review that would be inappropriate for a review for this film:   This is a terrible film with great acting.  I was extremely disappointed when I saw it. It is terrible and a waste of your time. It's over three hours long and if you watch just the last thirty minutes you'd think the director was a fool to have done so much with it. But I suppose it's the director's intention to make people see their film as it really is.  That's a good thing, I guess, but that's only because they don't make enough like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was not a fan of this movie, but my wife and I really enjoyed it. But it was not good. We were laughing throughout, but not a lot of tears, and I don't know why because of all the good that is in this movie. There was an interesting plot that was a lot more involved than it needed to be, but it was just way to overused in the end. You can't help but feel that you've seen it all before, and it's not my fault! I love the old movies, but I've seen them all. I am so sad to see this one go, but maybe it won't be for a while. It's too bad that I'm sad, because I really loved this movie!!!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you think that this is the one movie that every movie-lover should see, then read on:  The film opens with a sequence where a group of people gather at a roadside restaurant, trying to enjoy the beauty of the evening. Then comes the voice-over:  "They were there, the first night they came for me.  They were all in their twenties, they were all young and good looking... and a dark shadow fell upon them...  What could it be?  The movie...?" The audience sits there and listens, while in the next scene, they see a man fall from a high building...   The next scenes are more about the characters and their relationships:  "They lived the movie, they drank the drink, and they died.   It wasn't even the final scene...  " They see the police in their cars, the funeral scene... and at the end they get what they wanted:

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Don't know what you want. It's like if a guy's wife is having a party and he's a guest, then he starts complaining about the food, the food smells bad, the music's awful, you gotta change out of your ratty sweater, but the best thing is, when the meal is over, you can't remember where the steak came from and the pizza is too small, and the margaritas are too sweet. You'll feel ashamed. We have to be careful with movies like this. Most people have been raised to believe that they are going to see movies that are full of great action, and that's fine with me. But, when you see a movie like this, and you have no idea who or what it's about, you are really not in the right frame of mind to appreciate the action and the atmosphere. I'm trying to make this short and sweet. I really enjoyed the movie. I guess I just feel bad for that guy who didn't get a happy ending. I can't even imagine what he's going through in the final scene. I also can't imagine what was in his head before he came up with his idea of "the perfect woman." I guess we will have to see his final movie. Maybe he'll get his happy ending this time. Grade: D- A- Posted by Rob at 1:43 AM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    That's just not fair.   This movie is not perfect and there are some technical faults but that is not a good reason to trash it.  It is a fun movie.  There are no wrong answers.  You get to watch this movie and think you know the end of the movie. There is a lot going on here, and this is one of the best horror movies on the big screen in a long time.  For those who hate vampires it is an enjoyable movie. For those that like vampires it's a good one.  The movie isn't too hard to get into, and if you want a good vampire movie there are plenty of them out there.  I am not sure what I thought the movie was about.  What is your opinion on this movie?  Please write a review and tell me your thoughts. I'd like to know what I missed.  Thanks for reading!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm always curious why some people have such an aversion to this movie.   Is it the gore?   It's not as graphic as the last film,  but it is bloody!   Even the little things like the guy with the headless guy,   or the way that the gun is always pointed at the bad guy is something that I had never seen before.  As a matter of fact,  it's a good thing that  I watched the movie in the theater.  The sound, the lighting, the special effects  all make this movie look even better!  The actors were great.  For starters,  we have Billy Zane who plays the main character.  Even though the film starts out fairly slow,  the action picks up and it's not long before  Billy takes a bullet for his crew.  It was a great performance from him.  I think that we can all agree that he's a great guy to have on the crew of a spaceship.  Also, we have the actress that plays the young girl, Alice.  Alice was great as well.  Her character, Alice, is a bit different.  She's a bit sassy and is really the only reason why we follow along with the story.  One thing I found interesting about Alice is how she acts, she has a little bit of a crush on the guy who works with her, but he's too busy to notice her.  Maybe if the guy paid attention to her he could learn something about women. I enjoyed this movie so much that I decided to review it so that I could let others see what a good movie really is.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It would be hard to find a film more than an hour long that is better than this one.   Its a true film noir and is full of suspense and a strong story with a good cast.  At it's worst it is a slow paced and confusing film with some good action. At its best it is great old school detective movie.    The plot is the classic detective tale and it shows why it was made in 1940.  To get the best ending from this film you have to be patient, stay close to the film, and listen to the dialogue.  As I said it is hard to get to the end of this film without being absorbed in the story.  If you like any of the old films, this is a must watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would never see a bad horror movie again. It's just like, you've been there done that, what's the fun in that?   My favorite horror movies are horror-comedy and they are very different.   There is no comparison, at least the ones I watch.  What horror movies have you seen lately?           I haven't seen too many this year.    I don't know that I will have many more to go back to, though.  That's always a worry, for the films you do see and you find to be the most interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        I've seen this one twice.   First time was just as a child, at the local cinema.  Then, the second time, at my parents house where I watched it again (at a smaller size) as an adult.  This movie had a very slow start, and the story is slow going and does not really advance until halfway through.  In fact, a good portion of the film is taken up with people in the park having fun, or being a good samaritan.  And this is a good thing.  You don't want to watch a story like this and have all of the characters die in the first ten minutes.  For the most part, the characters were a good deal of fun.  The villain, the killer, was a very likable guy, and you would want to keep him alive and be a good guy.  He was funny, charismatic and did not get a good enough treatment in the movie.  I liked a lot of the actors, and I would have liked the film more if it was a little more fun, but it is a decent enough film.  One aspect of the story that I did not like was the way they show the murderer on TV and he always has to tell us why he did it.  It was quite disturbing and would have been better if the killer just killed his victims, in real life.  Finally, I would give the movie one star.  As a kid, I had fun watching this film. But, the way this movie is told was disappointing.  My rating:    1/2
