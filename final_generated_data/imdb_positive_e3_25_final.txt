Write a positive review about a good movie:    What a great movie this is! Great movie. Love the movie.  Love it. I really want to like this movie but the way they made it, I get the feeling they are trying to "show" something.  They make it hard to take away anything and it feels like an experiment.  I think what they have done is make this "story" about a man who, as an older man,  is  not having an easy time of it and it's hard to give him a good ending.   I feel that it's like the people behind the movie have given up on it.   This movie would be great if it was about some real life situation, maybe, if it were about someone in their 60's and how it was to them.  But no, it's not, it is a story about a middle aged man who can't take care of himself.  It is about him getting a divorce and going to the "wrong" people.  It's the "others" that make him hate himself.  We are told that all the others in the movie are "nice".  The people that are mean to him, they are mean for a reason and that reason is because they think he is a loser.  He goes to a psychiatrist, his therapist.  He gets counseling but it doesn't help him, the other therapists do.  The people in his life, he hates them because they make fun of him, he is afraid they will get mad.  The only person that can bring him relief is a girl that has a job at a diner and works for the man that abused him.  She gives him hope and when he finds her later that night, they have sex and he goes to sleep.  When he gets up in the morning he wants to be with her but he is sad.    That's it, that's the plot of the movie!   It is all about the other people that he has to deal with.  If he got married and was a better father, they would stop being mean.  That is how the movie makes us hate him.  The plot is a mess.  How can this movie be about someone's life and make it so complicated?  Why not make it more like an adventure movie.  How do you make a movie about a woman who wants to get away from her family, take a job, and find someone to
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you liked an action movie, especially in the early '80s, you might want to check out "Die Hard," but if you were lucky enough to get a home video version of this movie, you'll want to read this article first to see if you still think it's good.  The story:  When a group of robbers breaks into a bank, one member has a strange habit. After each successful robbery, he removes the key from his waistcoat pocket and throws it out of a window and onto the street below. A bystander witnesses this and takes it as a sign from the underworld that they've won. The hero is then assigned to infiltrate the robbers' apartment complex and rescue the man whose keys he throws out. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Poster art for "Alive". What happened:  I have an essay for a class I'm taking called "The Problem with "Jaws".  In it, I argue that the movie doesn't really have a problem.  It's just that it's a really good movie and I just want to see it all the time.   So, I decided to put up a post about this and how it wasn't really the fault of the film.  The Problem:  So, this movie was a big hit.  As such, people rushed to see the movie on the cheap.  And they bought tickets with their credit cards, meaning the theaters were already full.  Then, there was a bad storm.  This wasn't a bad movie by any means, but it is just a bad idea to do this.   For one, you don't want your movie to show up in the rain.  There are two main issues with the movie: 1.    It's hard to keep the plot straight with how it's handled and 2.   It was filmed in high definition and therefore looked really good.  It looks really, really good and that's what most people think of when they hear "high-def".  But here's the thing:  The movie was really good!  But I don't know that everyone wants to see a movie in 4K when the screen looks really good in 1080p.  I think a 4K screen and/or 4K-equivalent will look better than 1080p with this movie.  3.  To be fair, "Jaw" wasn't shot in 4k.  Rather, it was shot in a combination of 1080p and 16mp/1.85:1 film. "Titanic".  A high-def screenshot.  You may have noticed that this is the same movie with more resolution in the shot at the top.  At any rate, the movie isn't a perfect high-definition movie. In fact, it's close to low-definition in some ways.  Of course, 4K has some great advantages over 1080p, but that doesn't change the fact that the difference isn't so great as to really be worth the trouble to purchase a 4k display.  2.  Since I'm now going into detail about the plot, I'm going to add my two cents. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When I saw this movie I thought: "Wow this movie's really good".    This was my first real taste of Hollywood, and to be honest, that was the best thing about it. The movies were all very good. The acting was good. There was a good script. The sets were great.   In my opinion, this movie was a great Hollywood movie. The movie was made for Hollywood. I think it's great. If you haven't seen it, I'd really suggest this movie to any of your friends. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    * * *  *      I am sorry but this movie has been sitting on my shelf for far too long, the last time I saw this movie was about 3 years ago in college (it was called "The Pee Wee's Big Adventure" at the time). The movie is an adaptation of a children's cartoon from the 1960's and is filled with many memorable and entertaining characters. The first scene shows a bunch of school children riding in a train and then going to a big house. In this house a big old tree with a little boy in it. The little boy is played by Gary Sinise who is a great leading man. The tree gives off an eerie smell of decay which is quite a powerful image, because of this the movie is said to be quite dark and twisted. The kids are trapped in this tree. There are several puzzles and many things to look for, and it is not always obvious where to go or how to go. This is one of the most enjoyable cartoons I have ever seen and it was just one of those movies you enjoyed watching all the way through, and then one day one day and you realize you never watched it, because there is nothing new left to discover and remember about this movie, which is really sad, since it is such a great movie. The characters are a great mixture of funny, sweet, and sad, and they are all in this weird situation that they are trapped and they have to find their way out. This movie has a very dark tone and a very unsettling atmosphere and when you are on this train and the tree is going down, you are sitting on your couch and the movie will play on loop in your mind. This picture has been floating around my head for ages and I finally got around to watching it. I can honestly say I laughed my ass off on this movie and I have never seen anything as great as this movie. This film has such a rich story and character development that is just so well done. I also think that the writing is better than the movie itself, which in my opinion was very much the case. You can say that the film has a great cast but the movie should have done better with the casting. This cast is great, Gary Sinises amazing portrayal of the little boy, and Bill Murray as the wise old tree. Also I thought Kevin Kline was great as the old man who looks like it might fall apart at any moment and if that happens you have a
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'll be honest: I've seen the movie.   As a critic, I should know that I am just one cog in the wheels of the movie industry, and not in control of the outcome.  I'm not looking for the whole movie, but rather some small pieces that come together to form a larger picture.  Some might say I'm in the dark here, but if I knew the ending, I'd have watched the whole thing.  In this case, I was wrong.  There is a point where the movie gets good: at least, it does for me.  The dialogue and story is good.  A good story about the real world that makes sense.  So I've been a little disappointed.  It's a great movie, I just don't think it has the impact that it should.  Perhaps it's the fact that I don't understand the film as well as some of my colleagues do.  What does this movie even do, anyway?  The main characters are a pair of young girls, and there is something about their relationship that is both beautiful and creepy.  Why was it necessary to go to this effort to make a movie about a couple of girls?  They are just two kids, after all.  If you want something a little less gory than The Hunger Games, you can watch a lot of movies about teen love.  But if you want a film that will change the way you think about love, go read a good book.  This movie doesn't do that.  Sure, there are some amazing images and a lot to be said, but the movie is just a bunch of images, and I've read a lot more than the movie's few hours.  Even when it becomes a love story, it doesn't really do anything new.  Love is always a matter of looking deeper.  When I look back on what happened to me in the early part of my life, I see a person who had a lot going for him.  My parents gave me good material, and they were very supportive of me. But, I also have a long way to go.  While I was developing my character, I came to realize that I'd already begun to realize a lot about myself.  One day, I started to notice something: I was pretty good at hiding my feelings.  That's why I was so good at pretending to be in love, to convince myself that I
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie had a very interesting premise and is a good story. I liked it! The voice actors are really great, it's nice to see that they are taking it seriously.   I really hope they do another one soon.  Good movie with a great theme:    The movie is a "dark" movie with good animation. The main character is an angel who tries to help a girl who is suffering from a disease. The movie has a great story and is funny and a lot of fun. The music is great and I liked how the music was a little more upbeat.  This movie made me laugh out loud and I thought it was the best movie ever made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My Review   I did not want to watch this movie, since I thought I would love it (I am not a big fan of horror movies). However, I was intrigued and gave it a chance. After the first half hour I was hooked. This was a really good movie with some real scares. I watched it in theaters when my friend and I were looking for a good horror movie. It was a very scary movie (with a little more gore than most of the ones I watched). If you like slasher movies you should check this out.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    -    -   Recommend to my friends and family  You got to love a movie about a black man who can't get into an all white bar. This movie was written and directed by Steven Soderbergh and it is a true film noir. A very dark and very violent film about one of the most evil people in history, a black criminal named Harry O. Burchett. The movie follows Burchetta as he meets with several white bar owners who are interested in getting his help in getting rid of the black community in Atlanta. It is a great flick. Great acting by Johnny Depp and the great writing by Soderberg. This film has great character development. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but it is worth seeing. This is a very gritty movie that gives us a very twisted perspective of the inner workings of a bar. The bar owners are all corrupt and Burchetto has a unique relationship with each of them. There were a few scenes where I was a bit uncomfortable with the violence and sexuality of this movie. The violence and sexual content was so close to the truth that it was kind of hard to watch. I liked it when he went around raping a woman's dead body and when he killed a dog. It was very graphic. I found the violence to be very hard to look away from.  ... Show more  Show less
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film should be judged only by its merits; whether it's a hit or a flop. If you're disappointed because you think it failed in some way, or didn't live up to the hype, or you just didn't enjoy the story, then you may be suffering from low self esteem. Do yourself a favor and just go see the film for yourself. I was thoroughly entertained, even though I'd never heard of the people who made it.    ...it is hard to say just what has caused this movie to gain so much attention. As a man of science and as a lover of science fiction, I was interested in the film, so much so that I made a small commitment to see it. I had always heard great things about it, and I knew I had to see the movie. So I saw it on Christmas Eve of last year. After the opening credits, I had been in love from the moment I saw the beautiful, subtle art by Andrew LaFarre. The cinematography was gorgeous. I have no idea how this movie was able to convince so many people that it was a science fiction film, when it was in fact an alternate history film in which an English scientist (John Smith) travels back in time to solve a historical mystery. This isn't a film that you can easily enjoy while listening to John Smith (David Bowie) explain the science. There is no sense of adventure, no sense that you're in an alternate reality. This is a film of science that we see with a scientific eye, from the point of view of a scientist.  That's where the movie shines, because there is no other way to appreciate the scientific details of this film. From the scientific explanations of what a solar eclipse is, to the details of the film about the origins of electricity.  You're not in another time, or in another place. You're in this room, this time. And this movie has a great cast. And its science is amazing, it is what a scientist would do.  I would also like to mention how great of an actor David Bowie was in this film! He did so many different roles in his career, but he was so good at this one!  What a wonderful film this is. The film is very well done. If it didn't have a science theme it wouldn't be as enjoyable.  For those who have read my other reviews, I'll try to keep this brief
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't know how I got here but I've watched enough bad ones to know how to get out.     I'm here to find the silver lining.  That's where I found it.  The movie starts with a bit of mystery, but the mystery doesn't last.  The movie is set in the 80s, about 10 years after it had been banned.  In the 80's, it was a common thing for people to get drunk and then take a picture of themselves.  They called it "taking a Polaroid".  Nowadays, it is illegal to have pictures of oneself on your phone.  I can't imagine why the government made it illegal, except that they are afraid people will be getting too drunk and take pictures of themselves in weird positions.  Then we meet a girl called Amanda (Anna Paquin) who is going to be the next victim.  She takes a Polaroids of herself in a state of undress, and this is enough to catch the attention of a mysterious young guy called Johnathan (Josh Gad).  He follows her around as she goes on her dates, taking pictures of her in a variety of sexual positions, so she doesn't see him.  And so, Amanda's adventures continue. This movie isn't a good film, and I feel I should say this about a film that has made more than 2.5 billion dollars worldwide and has a rating of 95%.  As I watched the movie, I felt as if I was watching a film of my own youth.  My feelings are like those of a child that is watching a Disney film.  When I think of the 80-90s, I think this film is a good fit for the era.  There is something innocent about it, and it has a sort of innocence that seems to give it the edge that it needs to be something truly wonderful.   This film is one of the most enjoyable pieces of filmmaking that I have ever seen.  It manages to make the past seem very innocent, while also allowing the characters to be fully formed.  Amanda is an intelligent and pretty girl with a beautiful face.  Her body, however, is nothing to write home about.  Josh Gad, who is only 11 years old at the start of the film, steals the show with his strong acting, which I have seen from him in some other films.  This is his first major film role, and the way

Write a positive review about a good movie:        2.2  Best film of 2007   1.2   - 3 Stars -   The movie is a simple yet effective story about a man who is trying to save a dog who is having problems and who has a huge love to save his little friend.   I give it 3 Stars because the story is very good. The dog is a very good pet and the story works well to show how a pet can bring people together. It was a very beautiful and romantic movie. There is some bad scenes but nothing really major.   and that was it, nothing more...   But, I really do believe that the film could have been more emotional with more love and less love but the script and actors make this film a very very good movie, I give it a 4 stars. I also gave it a 3 because it had some scenes that I felt could have benefited from some more emotion.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For the money:  So it's funny and very interesting. This one was a lot of fun to watch. The film has a very low key quality and the actors do a great job. There's very few dialogue scenes and there are a lot more action scenes in this movie than in any other movie I have seen. But, it was very interesting and really funny. It's very different than a lot that's going on in the world, and, the comedy really works in the movie. The characters are very likeable, the action scenes are well done and, for me, this movie had the most memorable action scene of any movie I've seen.  What else could I ask for in an action movie?   This movie has the most action scene I've ever seen in a movie, and it's amazing. In this scene, they do a lot with a lot less, and yet the result is that it's still awesome.  This is the first movie that I can remember that really has a great and well written character and, even though it's about a man who becomes a cyborg, it's not a very dark movie at all. In fact, it has some kind of fun and it really doesn't take itself too seriously. This is a very good and interesting movie. I will definitely recommend this movie to people who want a good comedy, good characters, good action and a good laugh.  I give this movie a 4 out of 5 stars, it is very good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always enjoyed the fact that movies are a positive force in life. You could easily write a book about the importance of movies, but this article is going to focus on one specific movie that helped a family through a rough time. I remember watching "Good Morning Vietnam" at a friend's house after our family had returned from Vietnam. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. I knew the title of the movie and that it was directed by a war veteran, but I hadn't really heard of it until that night. I didn't know the war, but the war had a heavy effect on my life. I was just happy to see something that was being done to help the people in Vietnam. After seeing it, I wanted to support this project that helped bring attention to the lives of soldiers returning home. This movie was a success!   I'd like to credit the fact of it being directed by one of our generation's finest. I'm a huge James Cameron fan, so I can only think of him as one of the biggest directors of all time. I've seen a lot of his movies over the years, and I've never seen anything come close to this. The direction is incredible, with cinematography so amazing that it almost looks real. The script is very unique. It doesn't tell you what to think about the characters, it helps you understand them. It also is very, very funny. And, it has an ending that's really quite perfect, and that makes it a must watch movie. I will say that the ending really puts the movie in a different place for me, and for the movie as a whole. It's also a great movie to introduce a young audience to war. I think this movie would be amazing for a first-time viewer. If you're going to watch it, you might as well do it for the first time.   I think that it's good for a movie to have a good ending.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:     It may be over 10 years old, but it still is one of the best films to come out in 2004. The action scenes, which are quite graphic and even gruesome, are well done and the dialogue between the main characters was really entertaining. There was a nice twist ending and a lot of characters have really good scenes in this film. This movie was a bit of a cult classic and the movie was re-released in 2007 on DVD. It was also included on the DVD release of "The Matrix". It is my favorite of the Matrix movies because of the action, but the action is not the reason to watch this movie. This film has great character development as well as some great action scenes. I highly recommend watching this movie if you are a fan of action movies or action based movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like it a lot. My only problem with it is that I don't like to see women in a male's body. It just feels weird to me. It's just too weird to make a film about a female character that is just supposed to be this badass chick. That's the only way I can explain it. I didn't see it the first time because I was in the middle of my freshman year of high school. It was during the day, but it just had a creepy vibe. There was something about the whole film that made me feel really uncomfortable. I watched it again and just watched it over and over again. I just got to the end of it and saw this big black shadow come over this girl. I don 't know if it was a bad vision. I thought maybe there was a shadow man who was trying to get to her, but then when I saw it I realized that it wasn't a bad thing. It actually just reminded me of a monster that's trying to take her away. That made it a really spooky feeling. That was when I remembered it and I couldn't wait to see it again. That movie just creeped me out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love movies. I love watching movies.    I had a blast watching this movie. I was very interested in what kind of film this was and what was happening behind the scenes. The story behind this movie is very well done and you can't go wrong with this movie either. The production was outstanding and they even added in some special effects. I really enjoyed the movie and I highly recommend it to you.  If you want a movie that's good and entertaining and has good special effects and a great story, you can watch this movie!   This is not the type of movie I would usually watch but when I saw that it was about a serial killer and he's caught, and I saw it had a really good movie ending, I figured I might as well give it a chance.  The movie started with a nice, fast pace and was really well done. I would say that it's the best serial killer movie that I've seen. I'm looking forward to the next film because it looks as if this one's going to be pretty good too. I recommend this movie to anyone who has been wanting to see a good serial killer film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half of the movie was very entertaining but it seemed a bit clunky. We get an update on our heroine, Kate and get a very decent story of what is going on and the characters grow into more than just what they were in the first movie. But in the end the story just seemed out of place as they are in some weird intergalactic war. As if they were stuck in a time warp, but the character development is a little lacking, as if someone was sitting them down to help them grow up. It seems as if the film wants you to like these characters but they can't be that great of a movie until you like the character. Also the special effects seem a little out of this world as we are used to this type of technology from the movies. I didn't feel that the special effect was as good as the film though it is still impressive, but not as good or as realistic as I am used to from the other movies.   I like the first half as it helps build a good foundation for the story, but as the second half continues to drag, I don't like it as much.  I love the first film, but this movie really took a hit to my enjoyment.  I know that it is a prequel to the other films, but it just doesn't seem to fit with what is about to come. It feels like a movie that was written in a rush, and I know they went with it because they felt they had to start a new trilogy, but I do wish that they had spent a little more time on the characters, like having a little prequel, or maybe even a short movie with Kate's mother before she leaves on her mission. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:       And if you're not sure which genre you fall into:      It was very difficult to find a good review on this movie.   It is an adaptation of the novel by Robert Ludlum.  This is a movie that is going to make you think.  It's a great action movie with amazing stunts.  The movie has amazing story telling, and some of the fights are mind blowing.  There are two villains in this movie, who are played by  Peter Dinklage  and  Richard Madden  .  I really want to see these two fight, and then see if the guy can kick some serious ass.  In case you're wondering why I like this movie so much, it's because it was made by Hollywood, and made for the big screen.   It's got an amazing soundtrack, which is also great.  These are just some of my favorite movies to watch on my computer, and I love seeing how many of my friends are watching them.  I'm not sure if you've heard this before, but my favorite kind of music is music I've never heard.  I've listened to tons of music from all different genres, and the only music I like that makes me feel like I'm actually sitting in a concert, is music that I've heard but never heard before.  That's the kind of stuff I like to listen to, and this movie has a bunch of it.   This movie is filled with awesome action scenes.  They are awesome, and you will see so many of them.  When this movie came out it was a pretty popular film, but I think because I love all the action and movies, it hasn't really been the biggest box office draw.  Most people just aren't aware of this movie or know about the plot, or maybe they just can't get into the action, and it doesn't do it for them. But I believe the movie will still work well for people, and will still get people talking about it, and hopefully this will help make more people interested in it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    " I feel that this is a solid and well made movie which contains some good scenes. This movie has a dark edge to it which was well done. The music is dark and haunting and does it's job well. The ending is a little anticlimactic, but the ending will make you think about the film for a while."   You really think that "a good movie" has a lot of dark edges... You are correct, it does. But I'm here to tell you that the film's dark undertones are well balanced by its "normal" good-guy, evil-but-good, comedy, and romance.   I've read some reviews claiming that there were some serious themes in this film, but I'm pretty sure I read them when I was watching the movie. That is to say, there are no "moral" themes in "Lust, Power and Control".   It's not even a "message" film.  No, this film is about a male prostitute who becomes a female prostitute to cope with his failed marriage. I thought that the themes about women in the past and the current world, which are explored in this movie, were important to mention, but you probably didn't see them because you are too busy watching this movie.  And what is the point in mentioning these themes, except to show the lack of depth in the "moralising" reviews? You might think that the lack (or more correctly, lack of focus) in these discussions of the themes, is just a result of people wanting to make a movie out of this "miserable" film, and that's why people complain about themes or problems with the film. But "Lux" is not just a movie about a prostitute. It is about the male/female relationship.  Nowhere in the movie does the female prostitute act like a "sugar daddy" or like a bitch. There is no "sexual power exchange" in this female prostitute relationship. Instead of "exploitative" male prostitutes, there is a woman who is a "normal' woman who has her own life, who has a job, who loves her work and her family.  Her "sugary sweetness" isn't the result of her having to give her body for money, or for sex.  It is a byproduct of her happiness in her job and in her family life.  The story of this movie is about how a "good

We had ribs, pulled pork, a couple of sides and fried plantains. It was definitely one of the better ribs i've had, and the plantain fried rice was incredible. Definitely a place to go if you want to bring someone from out of town or to just enjoy a good BBQ in Atlanta.  I was really craving something savory but the portions were huge and the prices weren't so bad that I had to pass up on it. The food was good but not something that you could eat every day. My friend and I came here and it wasn't too bad, just nothing that we could rave about. There was a lot of parking. There's some inside and out. They have an outside patio where you can eat there. Overall, I like this place but not as a spot to go out of the way.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is no way to avoid it:                                                                      This review is about a film, and in the same vein as The Life Aquatic, a movie that has made me fall in love with a genre, but one that isn't for everyone.   While the movie has a lot of similarities to The Life, I feel like it's a good bit different, and is able to carry itself better as a movie in its own right.  There's a lot going on in this movie:            It's a movie about a man who works at a gas station, a man with a son that doesn't really care for him, and an aging man who just wants to be loved.  I like it when movies focus on two main characters, and while you're probably thinking "Oh, a classic,"  that is not what I meant.  We'll get to those other two characters, but first, let's go over the main character, Mr. Hays.  This man's story is just as tragic as it is entertaining.  It's a man that just wants people to love him, but that's a really difficult thing to do.  He's a widower and the father of two children.  In an era where people think a woman can't have children, this man just doesn't think so.  But, as much as this man wants a family, he doesn't have a wife, he has a young daughter that he loves dearly.  The father of his daughter is not only in his 60s, but he has been drinking for a long time.  Mr.Hays isn't just a widowed father, he's a father that has a drinking problem.  While this isn't the movie's main focus, it does play a huge role in the story.  However, I think it can also be enjoyed as a whole.  When you watch the movie, you're left with a lot more questions than answers.  I'll explain it for those that are interested, but the reason this movie is so great is because of all the things you want to know about this character.  There are so many plot threads in this film, but I'll focus on one here.    The film deals with the past of the mother of the girl that Mr. Hay has a crush on, and the son of a woman that Mr

Write a positive review about a good movie:     "It's been a little while since I've seen a great movie in theaters. I wanted to revisit "Star Trek" again and enjoy it as much as I enjoyed my first viewing. "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" had a wonderful ending, but it is far from a perfect movie. I'm a big fan of the movies I've loved over the years. "Trek" was never a "great movie." It never had that classic feel to it. The film is well-crafted, but the dialogue was never really memorable, and the performances are not always great. "The Force Awakens", however, has been an incredible film. I loved the story, the characters and the special effects. The new look of the galaxy and its stars is so much better than the last movie. The visuals are amazing and the sound effects are the best to date. I could watch "Starfleet Academy" and "Empire Strikes Back" over and over again. I feel this movie will always be popular, not just with the Star Trek faithful. "Seth McFarlane" (the "StarTrek.com" writer) and I had a great time making this movie. It's not a typical Star Trek film, and this movie never feels like a movie to get sucked into. It is a "fantasy" sci-fi movie with a good story. The movie has a lot of humour and humour is welcome here. The acting is fantastic and the action scenes are fantastic. "I'm amazed at the special effect work on this movie". "This is a fantastic and satisfying action movie". This is a very good movie, and it's not "Trekmovie". "I am thrilled to have created something very special here".  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:     "The Dark Knight Rises" isn't really a superhero film. You won't be amazed by its visual effects, its epic scope, or the actors' performances. But you will be amazed at how many actors actually work. They play Batman, Robin, Catwoman, Scarecrow and Alfred. They're actors who could have easily played Bruce Wayne's henchmen. Their performances aren't particularly memorable but their chemistry is palpable. Their characters all know each other well, and it all makes for a very fun film. And the fact that Snyder used so many actors from "Man of Steel" makes this movie feel that much more special. I'm glad that the Dark Knight has a comic-book origin story to fall back on. "The Dark knight" feels like a prequel.   For more on this film, check out the article in the January/February 2013 issue of Empire, on newsstands now.  Thanks to Empire for giving the fans of the comic-books something to look forward to.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Cultural impact in a country As I write this, I have read more than 2,000 news articles about the massacre in Norway and more than 6,000 media reports about it in other countries. This is a tragedy that affects the whole world, not just Norway. The international media reaction has ranged from shock, shock and horror to incredulity, to anger, to sympathy. This kind of reaction is understandable if it's a tragedy involving a country that is a close ally. In the case of Norway, it's an event that has a long-term and profound impact. Why? There are two explanations for Norway's response to this crisis: the first is that the country, as a Scandinavian welfare state, has traditionally provided basic security for people whose homes are in danger. But the second explanation is also valid. It's that the population has changed, and this has had a big impact on Norway's social order. Norway's population is predominantly Christian, with only a small number of Muslims. It was once a society where people took care of others: the government, the police and the health and social care systems were organized to help people who needed help. This was, for example, the case for people who have health issues or who need help with a child, or even people who had a car accident and needed medical assistance. There is now a large group of young people, mainly unemployed and of recent origin, who, according to the government's figures, have a much smaller chance of getting a job than they did when they were younger. When Norway had a large immigrant population during the past several decades, people from Muslim countries were generally welcomed, and those who had been living in Norway for a long time were encouraged to speak Norwegian. The same was true in Muslim countries, and it has been the case in Norway as well. When the situation of people with a lack of work and social benefits has been worsened by the arrival of immigrants, this has contributed to the radicalization of the population. The government has noticed this radicalization, but has been powerless to stop it. In Norway, there is no organized religious organization. But, in the case where people are unable to provide for their family, they can find a Christian community, and in fact a large portion of the residents of Oslo are Christians. The church is a pillar of the community, providing for the needs of all its members, including people in work, students, the
Write a positive review about a good movie:    We have to take into consideration that the movie is a comedy.   It should be funny and entertaining.  If a movie is not entertaining, it will probably be one of the worst movies ever made, like The Wizard of Oz.  One of the best movies of all time was, of course, The Wizard Of Oz. One of my favorite films is, ofcourse, The Lord Of The Rings. It's so good that if you're a kid or a kid at heart, you should see it.  There are many movies that have not aged well, such as The Goonies. It was my favorite movie growing up, but now it feels dated and has become boring.  The Lord of the Rings is one of my favourite movies of any kind.    The Lord of The Rings: The Return of the King   (1998). We have a movie with a lot of humor. I don't know what else to say about this movie. If you like comedy, watch this movie! It's an easy movie to watch, and is not difficult at all. There are two reasons why I like this movie so much:  1) the music is great.  2)  the movie has amazing writing.  The music is awesome:  "In The House of the Witch" by Richard Lush  And the writing is very funny: "We Must Make A Stand" by Eric Idle. I love this movie, and I recommend it. There is even a scene in the film that is very close to the film The Ring. If it were my movie, I would have made a cameo as Gandalf. I'll watch the film, so that you don't have to.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Watch: A Movie  What if a film about two siblings trying to break free from their oppressive father were actually one movie?   I have been trying to see this movie since it came out and I finally saw it in a new theater and I must say I was quite impressed. I love this movie because it features such good acting and direction from both the actors and the director. The characters are very real and you can feel their feelings and sadness that are so prevalent in the film. What I love about this film is that it is so real and yet it is filled with humor and surprises. This movie has everything and I can see how this movie can be enjoyed by just anyone who likes a good laugh. I also love that it deals with incest but it is done in a way that you can still enjoy it as a family movie.  Watch: A Family Movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am looking forward to seeing this movie as soon as I get back from my trip to Canada, as the movie is a good comedy and very exciting. It has a different feel from most other movies of this kind, but it still retains the same kind of humor and attitude as the genre. The music score is also good, but maybe just because it's a comedy, which is not an easy genre to score. But it is funny. The actors work very well, and the movie gets more good reviews.   There is something to the whole "I got your name, your phone number, your email and everything you think you remember about me." thing, but I don't understand how it can be used to do that.  I'm sure they could come up with some interesting ways of using that, but that seems a bit much.  It's not very funny, but at the same time, it's not a joke. It's more about the suspense and mystery.  There are some very strange characters in the movie, but the ending is very clever and a bit scary.  The ending is also very clever. I can't explain it, because I have no idea what they're talking about at first, but they have a few scenes in the last 10 minutes that are extremely well written and acted.  A lot of attention has been paid to the details of the film, such as the colors, the backgrounds, the costumes, the props, and even the sounds.  This movie looks beautiful in color, especially when it's dark.  You don't really notice the colors when it is day, and it's very bright when it needs to be.  When it's light out, you don't notice the shadows at all, but you are able to see them when they are not needed.  Everything is very realistic, and they even give you realistic names like "squeekie" and "dinosaur" so that you know you're watching a movie.  Although it is a bit bizarre to watch a movie that was made in 1975 and not use a color correction filter, there is nothing wrong with the movie. In fact, the movie looks very good, and some of the cinematography is amazing, including a lot of close-up shots that really give the movie a lot more style.  But the movie has a really good sense of humor, and this really helps it.  Another thing that's kind of interesting about the movie's

They become great. They can give life to a time. For that time, and in that place, there comes back into being the very same man who appeared in the first movie. The man who once was a thief, a killer, an assassin, is now a hero and a martyr."  This film is a masterpiece of cinema, one of the masterpieces of world cinema. It was released on April 20th 1975. It is a classic example of Italian Cinema. The movie stars Pier Paolo Pasolini as Count Orlok, a man who loves the Italian women. He has been banished to this island by his wife (Lena Headey) and father (David Hemmings). Orloks wife makes him a special deal and he is sent off to this paradise where the women make their demands. However, Orlos wife has other plans for him. He is going to help a young girl named Vittoria who was captured by the pirates. She is trying to make her way to freedom. Orlose then sets out to save the life of Vittoria.  There is a great score in this film. It starts off pretty slow. It gets quite exciting when the story starts. There is a scene where Orlons daughter (Karen Allen) is singing on a boat. It's
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For those of you who have been following me for a long time, I've always had a huge passion for cinema. So, when I saw the trailer for " The Martian " I knew that I had to see it.  The trailer and the trailer alone (which is much longer) is probably worth the price of admission.   The story is phenomenal.  They show us the amazing Mars civilization but never tell us what happened.  This was the most interesting thing to me.  It wasn't just about the story.  When we're on Mars and I see the way they show the environment, I think of all the stuff I would do on Mars.  There are no cars, no lights, no music, no people.  No one even mentions this is the red planet.  For years, scientists have been predicting that by the year 2500, Mars will have no humans.  How sad.  The Martian   stars Matt Damon as Mark Watney, an astronaut.  He is on Mars when a storm hits and the only way out is to stay on the planet.   His entire mission is to make sure his crew and their supplies make it to the ship, which has been broken up into pieces.  Mark is one of the smartest people that I have ever seen in the movie.  I really like that he has an incredible amount of empathy.  His character is great and I love seeing him on Mars helping those around him.  Of course, all this talk about Mars and space is not about space travel, but more about the way we use space and our dependence on technology.  We rely on the things that we built with our hands, which is quite ironic when we are trying to take Mars for granted.  In the movie, Watney is trapped on Mars for 4 months, which I believe is a time frame that is extremely long.  Not only does it take 4 months to get to Mars, but to get back to Earth, that's 5 months.  So, we spend almost a year trying to get our people off Mars. That is what makes the movie so amazing and scary.   "The Martian" is so good. It's so good because it takes the time to tell a great story.   I am so glad that we will have another movie to watch in a few years. I would love to see a new film about that trip and that amazing civilization.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    *   You want to read some stories?   I'm all set up.   The stories of the Great Flood in Genesis and the Red Sea Crossing in Jonah are two of the most interesting Biblical tales.  This week's story is about a little boy and his mother. The story, called " The Little Boy Who Had a Pearl of Wisdom " is told by the mother as she sits by a fire with her little boy. She has lost all of her money and the boy is sad. She begins to feel sorry for him.  The Mother then tells her story of the boy.  She had a pearl of great value that she gave to her husband who was sick.  The pearls were supposed to be given as a sign from God, so he could know that he was in God's hands.  So she went to her family, where they were going to stay for a short while.  But they were caught in a raging flood. She quickly fled, but there was no time to get a boat.  While she ran and prayed, the boy came running to her.  He gave her the pearl, which was very hard to break open.  They got out of the flood and she saw her precious pearl broken. She told him that he should keep it.  Then he told her to go to the land of Egypt and tell them he had a "polar bear's claw" (an amulet that could give him power over the animals).  When she got back, her husband had died and she wanted her pearl back. She called him and told him her husband died.  Her husband told her that God had forgiven them for their mistake. She promised to give him her pearl if she could find him one more time.  There was no way that the little boy could find her. So he did what he thought was the right thing to do.  At that point, a little fox said, "My mother and father sent me to look for you."  The little boy ran to the fox and told it what he needed to do to find his mother and brother.  In a hurry, the fox said to the boy, "There's your mother and there's your brother. "  The mother ran to a house and the little fox stayed behind.  Later, when the fox was ready to go back to his home, the mother came to the house and asked the fox why he had not given her the Pearl.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie isn't great. I mean, not because of the acting, but because it was filmed with an outdated camera system (which has also shown up in some recent movies), and the director/star/producer/etc. didn't know how to make it work.    For example, some of the shots are shaky and it's hard to see exactly what's going on at times.  There are also scenes in this film where the camera goes a long way and the action is blurry, it almost looks like a live TV program.    There's also some editing that's hard on the eyes (I think that was the most annoying editing in this movie).  The film itself was not bad.  The bad parts are mostly related to the acting.  The movie was made for television and wasn't well done.  Many scenes that didn't have the proper attention to detail could have been cut out of the film (I noticed this because a lot of these scenes have been put into a few of my other favorite movies - I'd bet that most people haven't seen this movie because most people would've just skipped the whole thing).  Overall, this movie was enjoyable, and I'd suggest that you try to enjoy it.  It's not a great movie, but it's just a story that needs to be told. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'd like to note that my review is based on the theatrical version, not on the Blu-ray edition, and if that film was made a little bit better I'd give it a 7.   I really enjoyed this movie, and I think it has a lot of potential, but like I said before, it does have some serious issues.  In addition to all the obvious "filler" and "pilot episode" scenes, this movie features some really bizarre "flashbacks" to the original series.  I understand the need to provide backstory to explain the world and its characters, but I just don't think it's necessary and it really detracts from the story.  It could be that I've watched enough Star Trek episodes over the years to have a good handle on the world, but when you have the actors playing characters who don't seem to even be on the ship or in the same city (i.e. Data) it can get distracting.  Also, there are some odd and unexplained dialogue throughout the movie, which is a little odd considering that most of the dialogue is done through computer generated noises.  Finally, it should be noted that this movie is shot in black and white.  Again, it doesn't really matter; the picture is beautiful, and for the most part, I love it.  But it is a bit of a disappointment to have black and gray actors playing non-black and gray characters.  All of the characters have the same height.  So why is no one taller than Picard? It would be cool if he was more in proportion to the crew, and this movie never really addresses that.  If I were a Star Trek fan, I would expect more from a Star Wars movie, like more than a few nods to the Star Wars universe.  For example, in this movie we learn that Kirk and Picard actually met in the future (which is in the first three movies, by the way), but Kirk says the following during the end credits: That's it? That's the extent of their contact? Kirk isn't a Star Fleet Officer? And he doesn't seem like a fan of this mission to Romulus?  In fact, when it comes to other characters, Kirk seems to be the only member of the original crew who really likes the adventure.  Now I'm not a big fan of the Star Trek films in general, and it's hard for me to recommend this movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In this review, I'll give the movie a 9/10.   As a guy, who knows movies, I have to say, that this movie does not disappoint.  As I've read other reviews here and on TVDB, I must admit, that I am impressed with how different the storyline is from the original movie.  The story was written by the director, who has directed some movies such as   Iron Man 2, and The Avengers.  The movie is about a young man, who joins the army of   Dr. Robert Neville (played by Richard Gere).  Neville is an ex-US Army doctor, who is a member of the US Army's Emergency Medical Services.  Neville has been working with a man named Peter Pan, who's body is kept in a jar at his home.  While Peter is in hospital, Neville is called to his house, and he is the one who discovers Peter's body, inside the jar.  When Neville goes back to Peter's house, he notices a very strange and evil smell, and it turns out that the body inside the body-jar has been decomposing for a very long time, and the odor is really unpleasant.  When he reaches out to save the boy, he is almost killed.  I must say, the film is very well made, and with all the horror scenes, the suspense was really worth it.    If you want a really good movie to watch, then this one is a must watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      "The Last Days of Disco" -   When I was a teenager, I liked disco music as a form of self-expression. A lot of the songs from the 80's are very reminiscent of my youth.   The Last Days is one of the better sounding 90's records I've heard, but what I love is that it doesn't really sound like a "disco" record at all.  The production sounds more like a modern music style than a classic disco record, with a lot of jazz, funk, and soul.  It's not overly fancy.  What's great about the album is that there's so much diversity.  They all bring different styles and they compliment each other, but they're all unique.  A good mix of pop and rock.  There's some great songs like "The Ballad of Disco", "Love in Your Life", and "Disco Heaven".   It might have been a little more "dubstep-esque" than you've heard from the duo in the past, but it wasn't out of character.  I think they're still capable of creating original, fun tracks. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you watch the movie and enjoy it, then write a review.   Don't waste your time complaining about your negative impressions of the movie.  Do it for other people.  You might get your movie reviews published, which is more than worth it.  And even if it isn't published, do it anyway.    You might be the only person to know about your film's existence.  So...write.  Find a review site that is reliable and useful.  Get your copy.  Don´t complain about it on other reviews.  Write a good review. Be nice.  Post it on some discussion boards where you can be sure of not getting deleted.  Make sure it is actually a review from a person who actually saw the movie, and who was not just making shit up to sound more knowledgeable about the subject. So you wrote a review, and posted it on a good website, and waited patiently for the movie's release.  But you don't see a lot of reviews.   You see reviews for films that were good, but nothing that is really worth talking about.   But there is one that will definitely make you want to see the movie:   The Man Who Knew Too Much When The Man From Earth was released in 1996, it got a lot more buzz than the movie deserved. The Man That Knew too Much, by the way, was not the most critically acclaimed movie of that year, but it is probably the most influential. The film was based on a book of the same name, written by William Blum. The book, which received a Hugo Award in 1971, is about a scientist who discovers that the earth was once colonized by intelligent beings from other planets. The scientists in charge decide to hide their discovery from the public, even though a few journalists manage to find out about it. The scientist involved, Dr. Richard Mansfield, was portrayed by actor Kevin Bacon in the movie version. The movie was the product of a collaboration between Ridley Scott and Blum, who took the lead writing and producing duties. The director was Ridley Scott, and the screenwriter was John McTiernan. The cast that played the scientists in the film included: Michael Biehn, Danny Glover, Michael McKean, and Michael Keaton.  It was a big success, earning the film an Academy Award nomination for Best Motion Picture - Drama.  The movie also earned a Golden Globe nomination for

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The End of Evangelion: A film from a studio that never ceases to surprise us. As with any film, when you first see the movie you may feel disappointed and go home and hate the film, but then you watch the second time and you realize that there is no way that it could be any worse than the original TV series. When you're watching the new film, you will be in complete disbelief as you try and piece together all the scenes from the original movie that didn't make it to the theatrical release. This is a film that is a little scary, a little funny, a lot of suspense and an absolutely perfect ending that will leave you thinking about it for months afterwards. This film is a must see for any anime fan or anyone looking for a really good movie. The only down side is that there were many scenes cut from the film and not all of them are great, but the good outweighs the bad." What I Liked:    I enjoyed the story line of the movie a lot, it's different and exciting. I like how Shinji's actions were not just out of anger, but also because he didn't want to hurt his friends, like Asuka in the original series. Shinji also got to grow as a character and learn a lot about who he really is.   I also liked the fact that the film was made in 2002 instead of 2003. There is something about the animation that feels like it was filmed yesterday. The movie also included many scenes that were cut from other versions of the anime.   What I Didn't Like:  The way the story was told was a little confusing at times, and it was very much a character based story. It also felt a bit forced to me at times because Shinji's story isn't as interesting as Asuka's story and in some ways the story of Shinji's family was a bit too contrived. I also thought that Shinji's choice to pilot the Eva was a strange one and I didn't get the sense that he really wanted to pilot it.  Overall:  This is an excellent movie that is worth watching and it really changed the way that I viewed the original anime series. I thought the movie was a great addition to the original film that it was added as part of the original release, which is a good thing.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The best movie I saw in my lifetime and the first one with a really good acting. This is a movie for the fans of the genre. A story that had a lot of twists and turns but also a good dose of humor and action. The action, for the most part is spectacular. You can't miss it in the trailer. The character development was very good, but not quite enough to make it worthy of the amount of attention. The story has a sense of humor, and while not a big fan of that, it is fun to watch. The art is superb, and if you're a big John Carpenter fan (who else?), it will not disappoint. The only part that I didn't really enjoy were the music and the ending, which is a bit cheesy. I don't mind cheesy. It was done right, but the last scene is just a bit too long, and not a satisfying end to a movie that had so much potential. Overall, a good time, but I'm disappointed I didn.t like it more. "The Last Question" - This is the second "last question" from the original "last man standing" film series. The original film featured a similar ending, where John is dead. The remake is different in that it doesn't end in a similar way. It's kind of a long, drawn out series of events, and it has a different ending. This one is better because it leaves a bit of mystery, which you'll probably find out when you watch the movie. But to be honest, the only reason this film was released was so that "John Carpenter could finally direct another movie". If it wasn't for the fact that the original was released, I think this movie would have been released long before "Halloween", because "HALLOWEEN" is the main reason that the "last questions" franchise came about. "The Last question" is one of those movies where you get what you expect, and also what you don't expect. It is not a movie I'd recommend to everyone, because the ending will make some of you uncomfortable. But if you like the movie, the ending is a lot better than the one in "Halloweep", because it doesn;t come right out of nowhere. If you like horror movies, and John Carpenter movies, then you'll like this one. "H.O.L.Y." is a very good movie, and I suggest you see
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "I love this movie. My friends and I watched it after church a few times and we all loved it. It's so funny and I love how it takes the concept of the game, and goes a lot farther than just having fun with it. The cast is so funny, and everyone plays so realistically. I thought it was very touching that they showed the love they have for each other after their husbands die, and even in their final moments they still have that look of happiness in their eyes. It was one of the best movies I've ever seen, and it's so realistic it's funny too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen most of the movies in this series, and there are a few that I haven't seen yet, so I can't speak for those. The series is well rounded and well acted.   The plot and the characters are simple but not flat.  There are a couple of twists, but they never feel contrived and are never annoying.  One of the best movies to come out of South Korea in quite some time.  I had to watch this after seeing The Magnificent Seven.  The Magnitude 8.0 is one of the most important movies I've seen in a long time. While the cast was wonderful, the story just blew me away and was very well done.  This movie has the potential to be the best of the series, which would make it the best ever. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You're an old man... The whole time he was just...  S. J. Perelman - 9/10 (Great performance, great film) I saw the original film (1965) on TV years ago. I remember my mother making me watch this one on the TV with me - not in the same movie, but one in the movie series where all the original movies were made. Now I've seen a few of the others and I'd had a good feel for what this film was about when I saw this one. For starters, you don't see a lot of people talking in this movie - it's just so quiet and eerie, like the characters were just there. I like this one because it doesn't try to push itself or push any trends. It's really just a simple story, with no big ideas and just a few things happening in the background. The acting is great - we have lots of actors in it, but the characters are the ones we feel are real. The music, too - it just sort of fits this movie and the place that it's set. The ending is a twist but you don;t really see it coming until near the end. And the final reveal is a neat way to wrap things up. So, a great movie to see in the theaters or just about anywhere. I hope it gets released on DVD someday.  David G. - 9.5/10 I didn't know what to expect when I went into this movie. I have always been a fan of The Silence of the Lambs and the rest of the series and this one is no exception. The film starts out with the characters at a party, the night of The Case of the Hanging Tree. We get a nice long shot of the house and a nice close up on the back porch. I enjoyed this scene and would have liked a little more of it, with just the two characters and one of the guests (the man who hangs the tree.) The whole movie had a very unique style to it, and that's what kept me watching - I wanted to see how the film would end. The plot had me hooked right from the first scene. The pacing is perfect, as this is the first of a series. The performances are good, though not great. I liked how even in the last third the camera kept going back and forth and always showing you the little things that you didn't see when the camera was in front of

It has it all: science fiction, adventure, romance, suspense, action, humour and more than a few heartbreakers. For people with ADD, this movie is almost a perfect movie. If you haven't seen it yet, you really should. If I had to pick one film to recommend to an ADD person I would do it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   . I've always enjoyed movies about the civil rights movement. I like movies with a good message. This movie had a great message! I also liked the music (a lot). So I went into this movie wanting to know what all the fuss was about. I wasn't disappointed at all. I really enjoyed it. It was also good to see how things have changed since 1963. I was happy to see some people in the movie. I always liked seeing black and white photos of the civil right movement. It added a lot to the movie as I liked seeing the good people of the movement!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "A few minutes into this movie, I was feeling very uninspired and uninspired with the entire film. Then suddenly, the credits started rolling and I got the good vibes. And then I thought to myself that the movie's theme is 'you are not the hero, you are the story.'" " I'm a big fan of John Carpenter's The Thing from which this movie was borrowed. The concept was interesting enough, and the visual effects were not bad either, although the film itself was rather lackluster. It seemed like a remake of the original but with some new ideas on how to make it work. As a fan of Carpenter, this movie left me wanting more.  " "I'm glad the movie made a decent amount of money, but the story was extremely bland and not what you would expect from an Evil Dead sequel. The thing that bothered me the most was that they put too much of an emphasis on Michael Myers. I guess it worked on the box office since they were making money at the time.    This movie was not very original. It would be interesting to see how John Carpenter would have written this movie if he was allowed to do it again, since it was more like the original than the remake. This would give us a look at how he would have handled the character and the events of the movie.  It's a fun watch and you won't get bored. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story of this film is simple: a man is sent to prison and is kept by his father. When he is released he is on the run from some of the mafia he is trying to escape from. The film does a good job of explaining the characters motivations and shows how they change during their trials. In this particular case we are led to believe that the father is the bad guy and the son is the good guy. But the film does show how the father changes during the course of the film. We see the father develop a liking for his son and even tries to get him to marry his daughter. As the film goes on we see how this father and son develop a close friendship and the father starts to feel for the son. When the father realizes his son is innocent he changes his ways and helps him escape. The father and the boy get to know each other during this time and are able to become close friends. This was the movie I was looking forward to from the trailer, but I think it wasn't worth the time that I put into watching it. The story was pretty great but I can't say that it was good enough to make me forget the story that I was just watching. It was a decent story but I didn't think it was anything special. The actors did a good (I don't know what to call it) job and the director does a great job with the scenes, but it just didn't bring me a good time. Overall this movie wasn't bad but it didn't do much for me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie a lot. I think this could have been a good horror movie, or even a very good action movie, but it didn't work out. The acting was really good, and it was just scary enough, but the movie felt kind of flat. I don't really know if that's the director's fault, or if it's just a bad idea. I still give this one a watch, and I'll probably watch it again soon.   Rating: 1 out of 5   Theatrical Trailer of Night of the Living Dead: Night of the Dead is one of the scariest films ever made, and that's saying a lot:   The plot is based on a true story, and there's one scene in particular that really sticks in the mind of everyone who watches it:   It's a scene in which a group of zombie hunters try to get their guns in order in the middle of the night in the woods, and they get surrounded by a group that turns out to be a group from a local circus, and one of them is about to shoot them when the ringmaster comes and says:   "You can shoot me. You can't shoot me."   "Well, it's a trick!" the guy says.   "It is," the ring master says, and the zombie hunters all begin to run away.   But the ring leader continues, and says, "I can shoot you all at once!" And the zombies start to run again, and he turns and fires off five shots, then six, then seven.   One after another, the zombies are all dead, dead, all dead! The ringmaster has finally killed off his zombies, and now he's not even angry!   The film was really scary, and if you want to see one of these films, I highly recommend it.     Rated R.

I don't remember seeing a lot of action movies about the Vietnam War, especially after all of the bad movies that are based on the war. This movie was more of a romance movie. It had the added spice that it had a girl in love with a soldier and he had a girlfriend. It also has a good cast. If you like a good action movie, you might enjoy this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Saving Private Ryan is not a perfect movie. But it's a terrific movie, and one that could have had a far worse reception if not for a couple of things: One, its very difficult to imagine a more perfect portrayal of the experience of war. That is, if you are not a military guy or someone who is intimately acquainted with it. Two, the ending is pretty much in the bag. But there's an interesting message at its very heart. And three, the movie is absolutely gorgeous." Read my review on  "Saving... "The film opens with a great deal of bombast: an "out-of-this-world" war, an American hero, a young boy with "tough skin."    A good film starts with a bang, and "Spartacus" is no exception.   The film starts off with an enormous amount of hype and it never lets up: this is a story that is being told that no one will believe.  It's the perfect metaphor for the world we live in: The truth is, nobody really knows what's going on.  With that said, the story of a group of Roman slave-soldiers fighting to free themselves and their fellow slaves from the evil Emperor Claudius is compelling enough to keep you in the theater for its entire runtime.   The story is told in a very straightforward way, using the voice of a young British boy who was sold as a slave into the Roman army (as part of his war-effort to help his country, as he says in the film) at age nine.  He goes on to be a soldier, and after the war ends he gets revenge against the person who wronged him by killing the man who sold him into the army.    The most interesting part of the story, though, is the way the story is interwoven with the lives of the slaves, many of whom were actually the people who had fought for the Emperor during the war.  There is a great respect that is given to the people that were actually fighting against the Romans: some of the battles are brutal in how they portray their enemies, but are fought in a way that the soldiers think it is a worthy sacrifice to give their lives for.  What is really remarkable about this film, though is how it deals with the fact that these slaves were slaves in a much larger war.   Spartacus is a far more difficult story than it seems

It is not that kind of film to look back at and say 'this is a great movie.'It's a film where if you really pay attention to it, it is a movie I can really understand the why and where's of why you should see it. And I thought that this is a really good film to watch with a child. It does not have the 'adult movie' feel that most films do to them. It's more of a story to be told and it is not just to entertain an audience. It feels more like a film about a life and how it ends. And that is a story that needs to be heard."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've never seen a movie that scared me like that one did in the theater. I remember walking out after only ten minutes and being scared to death. That movie was just the beginning of something very, very, evil. The film doesn't really take the time to explain how this creature is able to exist and go undetected for so long. At one point the camera pans up into the tree line and there is the face of a woman looking right at us. This movie is so scary that it is nearly impossible to watch. It truly is a masterpiece of horror.   There are many films that I have seen that could be included on this list but "Carrie" was the one that scared the hell out of me. I'm not kidding when I say this movie scared the living hell out me.  My personal favorite.    One of my favorites. "You're coming home, honey."  If you like horror, this is for you.  I recommend this movie to anyone who loves horror, sci-fi, action, mystery, suspense, horror comedies, and so much more. It's really hard to put together a list of all the good horror films out there but I have some suggestions. I highly recommend watching "The Amityville Horror", this movie is fantastic. I also recommend watching this film if you are in the mood for a good old-fashioned Halloween movie. I can't even get the name out of my head. "Rosemary's Baby" is the movie I love the most. I haven't seen this movie for a very long time but it's been on my "to watch" list for a while now. It was a movie I used to watch every year when I was growing up. I loved every minute of this movie.

I know it might be a waste of my time, but there's nothing that I can think of that is so pointless as watching this movie. I think it's probably the best movie of 2017, but I don't think it deserves to be number one. That might not be saying much.  It is one hell of a movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot is simple and has a very easy and exciting pace to it. There isn't much to worry about. The characters are very relatable and real and the script is simple yet clever.   You don't need a complex plot line or characters to enjoy the movie.   It also has a great score by the music.  The music plays a big part in the movie and it works great.  It isn't repetitive in its tracks but it fits perfectly with the story. The music is upbeat, fast paced and enjoyable.  I enjoyed listening to it and it made me feel happy.  If you haven't heard it, you need to listen to it now.  "Lovers" is a great movie that you should watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King    There is a reason it's been called "the best movie ever made". If you've ever wanted to experience a movie like this, then go and see this. I have, many times, and it is the reason I enjoy these movies so much. The book is so good that I can't even imagine what Peter Jackson was able to do with it. In addition to the book, it is a good thing that there is a 2-disc DVD which adds to the overall experience. If you ever think you might like a movie, I suggest you see this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really enjoy movies from the 1950s because it shows that the people who did this were able to tell a good story with a story line that had many twists and turns. It's also not as simple as "good vs bad" or "evil vs good" because they were just people, trying to survive the trials and tribulations of life in the 1940s. It also showed how life wasn't always bad, and it taught us to be grateful for all that we have.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "   This is a brilliant, fast-paced drama.   The actors are great, and the screenplay keeps them both on their toes, allowing for a great deal of physical comedy, but also some heart-wrenching scenes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The thing about my review is that I'm biased, and not only for this film, but also for everything. That means I feel like I should mention a few things I love about this movie, and I do, but not to say that these aren't good things.   When a movie takes the time to explain the background of the world the film takes place in, it makes everything seem very authentic and believable.  To the point that it's very hard to believe that in such a futuristic world the majority of the people can't read or write.  The characterisation of these characters are very realistic, the humour is fun, and the overall film is enjoyable.  While the first two films in this series were just about the aliens, and we got to see the inside of the ship, this film goes back to the time when the first film took place and shows a more grounded, realistic side of the story.  One thing I did enjoy was when the main character, Jake Sully, finally meets the alien that he's been chasing, the interaction is very awkward, but they do the best with it. I love these scenes, when it's the characters that have to deal with each other, especially when it makes them look so silly.  After I finished watching this film I was in awe of how much I liked it, but that doesn't make it good.  It still has it's problems, namely the lack of a strong villain and some weird things with the alien's technology that were too confusing for me to follow.    What I Liked:  - I enjoyed how the aliens were explained, they all seemed to fit together and the story behind how they came to Earth made sense. - The characters were real, I didn't have problems with them at all. - When you see the alien first you have to wonder if it's even real. - After you finish watching this movie you're going to have a good laugh! - The first time you see a alien it's so weird and so out of this world, so it's fun to see them come alive. - It was a great introduction to the first story, it gave a new perspective for people who knew nothing about the alien. - Jake Sullenberger is a great hero, and he really helped make the aliens interesting, I don't think there's a character in this movie that he doesn't have a huge part in, and it was fun to watch him
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie follows the life of a young man, named Rafe, who works in a bar. Rafe is in a serious relationship with a beautiful girl, but it has not worked out. He is working on his computer for long hours, often after having already done so. The relationship is complicated by his job, which makes him a lot of money but also makes him very isolated.  It also explains a lot about how Rafe's father (played by David Spade) handles his work and what he thinks about his son. There's also a lot to take in about the bar itself, which includes Rafe himself.  It is also one of the very few movies that was made in the era of the early 1990s. It is a film about young people at the beginning of their lives.  This is a good, simple movie about the good life, and about love and friendship.   This film has an interesting idea, and it doesn't seem out of place in today's world, in which it fits perfectly.
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I know you guys love your reviews, but I really do appreciate it so much when someone says "this movie made me laugh and cry all at the same time!" I was really happy to get this great movie and I was so sad that it wasn't in a theater near me. The actors were all great and really nailed their characters. I will have to see the movie again in the theater with a full auditorium.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For the money, it is well worth the investment.   The action sequences are extremely fast and action-packed and there is much that can be improved upon, but for the money it is worth the viewing.  I think the quality of the story is more important than any aspect of the actual film, and I also think the actors are better in the film than in the novel.  The ending is quite a surprise, but very, very well-done.  All in all, a very enjoyable film and one that I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a good action/adventure film.   [Update - March 18, 2018: I just bought a brand new copy of The Last Dragon which was released on February 28, 2016.]
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Here is a quick list of all the movies I've seen this year. I've watched them all and, though they were very different, there was one common theme throughout them all: they all had a special place in my heart. I didn't write a review for all of them, but the ones I wrote about, I enjoyed immensely. And now, I want to do a similar thing for all the things I loved in this year... and maybe next year... I can't wait to see what the 2018 picks are. I also plan to get into some of the lesser known movies that I was lucky enough to see. But let's start with a few more of the big ones. I'd also like to note that there are many more movies I was fortunate enough to come across in the past year than what I've listed here. I haven't watched them, and I want all of the best, and even some of my favourite movies aren't listed here.... Sorry about that! I'm hoping to do that more often though.... I hope you enjoy my list, and if you find a new movie that you want to see, I'd be happy to share it. Thank you for reading.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A friend gave me The Sixth Sense (1999) as a gift. I saw it at an opening night show at New York's BAM (now the BAMC). I'm a sucker for the classic horror story, but I've been a fan of the Wes Craven/Sam Raimi/Robert Zemeckis formula for a long time. The story opens on a funeral for a man who looks exactly like John A. DeNiro, played by Tom Cruise. After the funeral, a young woman is seen by the police, who believe she may be possessed by John. The movie was supposed to be a spin-off of the Cruise vehicle The Last Samurai, but the project was canceled after Craven couldn't work out the rights with MGM. The project was then re-worked into its own movie starring Cruise. If the film has any redeeming quality, it's the supporting performances from both Cruise and the late Michael Keaton, played perfectly by Cruise and Keaton respectively. A very memorable ending, and I found myself wishing there was a sequel, just so I could see Keaton back in his heyday. A cult classic, definitely worth checking out.   This movie was so far ahead of it's time.  A movie that takes a classic story of a possessed child, a killer who has been living inside of a young boy and the evil force who is after him is not what you would expect from a Wes Craver movie. But, there is something about the film that just makes it timeless. After all, this is the same movie that took Craven back to a career high point and allowed him to take on a more popular character like the killer in A Nightmare On Elm Street. But that's not to say it's not an enjoyable ride. The only thing that holds this film back is its inability to be as clever as some of Craven's earlier horror flicks. The film was a hit at the time of its release and has a cult following today.  There is still some of a cult appeal.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best of the three of these films.   The first one that I had seen, this movie is a true masterpiece.  One of my favorite movie-stories ever.  I highly recommend you to watch this movie.  The plot is very basic, but the characters are very well designed.  This film is well produced, and has a great soundtrack, very fitting for a movie like this.  You should watch it, because it is an amazing story.  Enjoy!!!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   ... You don't think that he is just saying that to sell a movie, right? "   It's not just that we need a better script, or a better direction, or the right cast or the proper casting of a good director. It's that the script is crap and the direction is garbage. And the casting is garbage, so the movie is garbage."   Is it any wonder that a movie that has been "carpeted" and sold so hard for $125 million is going to be so bad?   "The movie was supposed to be a big-budget movie that would have been so funny, so edgy, and so outrageous that it would have won Best Picture and then maybe won a few Emmys. That was not to be."  How could anyone have thought such a movie was funny or edgy when the director said "I thought it would be just like the other movies I'd made. I thought that it was a big hit. I think people were going to like it because it was going to push the envelope, and we all agreed that that was the way we wanted the film to be, but you guys were going a little too far."  "We went way too far with the language, and the way they were acting. It was kind of funny at first. But then we got to the fourth act, and it was just like "This is not funny. This is not edgy." "  And now we're stuck with this film.  And you're stuck. You've got no idea how to fix it.  "It was just too bad. It wasn't that the film was too hard or that it wasn't good, it just wasn't funny, and not edgier, and just not a good film. And I think some of the stuff we did wasn't very edgy. It didn't seem very edgiest, I guess. I guess when I was working on this script, I think that I was trying to do something that I knew I wasn't ready for."  You know, I've never seen a film that had so little going for it as this one.  I mean, even that great 'Rent' was not that great.   How was this movie supposed to come together without any script?  Was it ever supposed to get made in the first place?  You're going to try to make a film like this
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Please take note that this list has nothing to do with whether you'll like or not like a movie. What matters is that it has merit. The movies listed here were either written or directed by a great director and/or writer and it's their stories that I hope you'll enjoy.  These movies were written and directed in the 20th century, and they reflect the era of cinema. In other words, these movies aren't about current events. They're about things that occurred, and as far as I know, they were largely forgotten. - - -  I know that a lot of you would disagree with this list. I'm sure that you're probably right.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What you say about an entire movie or a season of a TV series can vary. Some of the time the reviewers are so impressed by a series that they praise it as if it were the best show they've ever seen. Sometimes the reviewers complain about a bad episode, but that is hardly their fault. There are many other reviews online from people who watched the series in a much different way, but even they don't say this was their favorite. Why is it that the reviews about a show or a movie are so subjective? Well, it's hard to answer that. Many factors, including the nature of the show or the director, influence how a critic will review the film. But if you are looking for an example of a review that was objectively correct, look no further than The Twilight Zone. The Twilight zone was one of the most celebrated and influential sci fi television series ever produced, and it remains popular to this day. In fact, the very name of the series was a reference to the Twilight Zone, a classic of television. The Twilight series was the first to have a central villain, and that was the evil alien, Dr. Z, from the planet Gomorrah (or possibly from another planet) who used hypnotism to transform humans into a race of supernaturals who could only dream and dream their way into becoming heroes. There were seven seasons of Twilight Zone and they run from 1959 to 1969. The series began with The Night of the Hunter. This episode featured a strange and unusual creature that was in the area and then flew away to the moon. The creature is in this episode as the only alien to appear on the show, so we have a pretty good idea of what the creature looks like. The episode itself begins with a man falling asleep at his desk. The man wakes up and then sees a strange shape flying over him, landing near him. The shape is not human, but is alien and has a white face and three yellow eyes. This shape is seen flying towards the moon and has no face. The next time we see it is as a man in a field. The alien is wearing an orange jumpsuit and a top hat. The top hat, or "headpiece," is a little too big for it and as the alien flies through the air, the top hat falls off, revealing a black, hairy, reptilian head. As the alien approaches the moon, we see the entire thing, as it is a single piece.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The last film I saw that was good and a good script and a great director, and even though it was a small budget film. And it was very emotional, so it was the only film I watched that I really wanted to cry after.    After seeing it, I really liked it and I felt like it wasn't about the gun or even the gun, it was about a father's relationship with his son, but it was good.  In fact, I feel like it was one of those great films that could make anyone want to film themselves doing things like this because it had a real emotional impact on the viewer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie is a work of art and deserves its place in the filmography of any artist.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a long time I've heard that horror movies have a better track record than other genres. This is the latest movie that shows that it's not always the case.    The main character of the movie is played by  Tilda Swinton  and she's supposed to be a witch. She's so beautiful, so graceful, and the rest of the cast is great too.  You have to admit, they all are.  But the real reason to watch this movie is because of the makeup artist, who I believe is the most badass thing in the movie. She has these amazing beautiful dark makeup that is actually pretty easy to apply. It's just a matter of knowing what your going to do to your face.  After the main character is defeated by the witch's curse, she escapes in a car and the guy who was holding her gets out and tries to chase her down. This man gets killed by the car which he was trying to save her from, so this is a pretty tragic ending for him.  The witch, who is hiding under a bed, is actually very brave and it's amazing to see her doing that. She takes all these different disguises and is able to hide from her pursuer. She finally makes her escape and you are left with a creepy creepy movie!   For a horror movie, it's a great horror movie. You can't go wrong with this movie if you like the kind of movies like this, so if you've ever wanted to watch a movie with vampires and werewolves, or if you love horror movies that aren't full of gore, you should give this a chance. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (don't you love how they add those words?)   [This is the last time in my life I will be talking about this movie. This movie was actually better than the first one.]   This is a movie that I'm surprised people actually liked. I guess I'm not that shocked. I think people who liked the first movie liked this one even more. Even though this movie had some similarities to the first, it was different and not as awful. But the thing about this is that there is a lot of sex in this movie, which I like. I just think there was way too much sex in the first. I don't know, I guess this is because of the time. It was way before the Internet was created and everybody knew everybody else. But I think there should be a limit for how much sex is shown in a movie. I am just saying. But anyway, I liked the characters and the acting was great. The action was great, but I think it could have been more intense if they used CGI. I really liked the movie. If you liked the previous movie, then you will probably like this one. If not, then this is not for you. It is just a really good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     4.0 / 5  REVIEW:  Based on an excellent novel by John Grisham and starring the superb Tom Cruise, This Is the End is a fantastic thriller that will leave you with a gut-wrenching hangover. This movie is not a good film. Not a movie that is entertaining, not a movie you will remember for months. Not the film that left you in shock or horror as you sat there wondering how such a masterpiece could come out of a young and somewhat inexperienced director. But this movie is a good enough film to give you a nice buzz. It is just too good.  The plot involves a group of people who all find themselves in a cult and are forced to participate in a twisted and horrific ritual called "The Day of The Dead". During this event the cultists make a decision to cut off their heads. The movie is told entirely in black and white. The actors have very limited lines and the only things that are being said are very simple. The camera is often used to capture only one or two things at a time. The only times that there is any action is when the members of the cult are in pain. The film has a great mix of violence and horror. The scene where Tom Cruise is brutally tortured is one of the most memorable moments in the movie. . The main problem I had with this film was the fact that the characters were all incredibly weak. They were weak because they were weak. This film had a really slow pace, which made the scenes seem longer. I found myself wishing I could skip to the end of the movie just to be done with it. The acting in this movie was so mediocre that it makes it almost impossible to take anything else out of it. And because the cast is so small it takes an awfully long time to find your favorite person.  the ending of this film is also terrible. The ending leaves you with so much disappointment that you cannot help but feel that it was never there in the first place. The conclusion of this movie has so much potential. It would have been great to see a cult leader being killed by the group he is a part of. It might have made it more terrifying. The end is not the reason I stopped watching this movie. It was not because I felt it was a bad film. It just didn't work for me. This Is The End had a lot of potential. The cast would have made this movie so much
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I like to think of myself as a romantic. But there is no romantic in the world who does not find himself in love. But this is the most beautiful love he has ever known and yet he has never known it. I am convinced that he has been in love all his life. It is a love without the love, and yet it is not a love which is less real because it is un- loved. This is a story about a man who is loved, but it is also a story of a man's self-discovery and about what it means to be a human being. It reveals a great deal about human nature, and it is a great film. The movie is written in a style which will please the modern audience and it has the charm and wit of a great movie."   "This is a film which I have thought about for the last ten years. I first saw it ten years ago. I was then living in a small house in a country town, with no telephone, no telephone books, and no one to whom I could refer. It has been over ten years since I watched it, and I cannot for the life of me remember how I was able to make that decision. I believe it was the combination of many things which made me go to it. There were, among others, the fact that it was filmed in the first-class seats of an aeroplane, the first time that had happened in the history of film. And then there was the presence of the actor Anthony Perkins in the audience. It was in my mind that if he had been allowed to see the film, he would have said: 'I am not interested in it. The action is so far removed from my mind, and so far from the kind of romance that I was after, that I am almost ashamed to have seen it.' This was the reason why I went. There was, of course, a part which was very difficult to take, that of Mr. Perkins himself. He was too well known for the audience to believe that he was the person who was telling the story. It must have been a real shock to him to be asked to look at the film. He had the greatest pride in being so well known. But he did not want to disappoint anyone, so he was pleased to do what he had to do and I have never forgotten it. And, last of all, I think I was glad to have the opportunity of
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can't say much about it without giving away some of the spoilers, but that said, it was a fun movie to watch and one of the better comedies of the last few years. The plot was rather simple but still had a lot of funny moments, and the acting was very good, even with some of those minor roles. This movie has a great soundtrack, including the classic song, "Funny Face" (see below) and the song from this movie that is so underrated, "Bunny Friend". I wish I had listened to that song when I was a teenager, it has some of my favorite lines of the movie. Also, there are some great "what if's", for example, what if I wasn't interested in the movie (the movie I didn't like that much anyway) and what if my parents had told me that they were going to take me to see this movie when I got home? That could have been one of my greatest moments of the week!      Rated:

Write a positive review about a good movie:     "I know the movie is bad but you should give it a chance."  I will be honest and say that this is not a very good movie. It does look pretty good in my opinion but it isn't that good. The movie doesn't seem to do a great job in giving us enough information to fully understand what's going on and in doing so, it just makes it seem like we're just a bunch of idiots and it just kind of drags on. It's really difficult to see how such a beautiful looking movie like this one could end up as this bad. Maybe I'm just in the wrong genre and maybe this is the kind of movie that I normally don't like. If you're like me though, and like to see a good old fashioned bad movie with a cast of characters that you really like, then give this movie a shot.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first came into this world, I thought to myself, I don't want to live in this world where people are afraid to give a good review. I know a lot of people hate people who give a bad review, but I know that a movie has to have a good rating if it's going to be on a DVD or in the theaters.   It turns out that when you're a movie reviewer, the worst reviews get you the worst ratings!   I didn't realize this until I started to do it in my movies as well, and I'm not going to lie, it's kind of scary.  In a movie, it seems that the good reviews do get the bad ones, but that the people who are critical of a movie don't really like movies and are just looking to make money off people who actually do like a movie.  The movie The Last Samurai, had a "positive" review by Roger Ebert who gave it a "B+", which to me was the worst possible rating.  And for those who hate Roger E. the most, I am proud to say that Roger E.'s review was the only review he ever wrote on a film that he really liked.  We also have the reviews that make us laugh, like John Waters' review of the cult classic Star Wars, or his take on Star Wars 2, where he thought that the actors in the film should have lost the weight they put on in the first film so that the sequel could have been a better film.    But to me, what really bothers me are the reviews like these:  http://www.reviewsbydave.com/2013/09/30/the-last-samurai-2013-review-and-reviewing-star-wars-2/    Posted by RogerEbert at 12:18 AM
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I just finished this wonderful movie about a man on a motorcycle who lives with his sister and his mother. It was really funny, and very moving. I like stories that are about people who are not a "normal" life, like a car accident, a divorce, and other personal problems. This movie really did what it needed to do. It showed us the real world of what it's like when you are poor and homeless, and why you go back to them every now and then. You might see this movie as a simple comedy about a boy on a bike. But I hope you will see it a little bit more differently, because the film shows the life of a homeless person. It is an honest story, and a heartwarming one. This is a film you will like to watch over and over again. I recommend it to everyone, and I hope it will help other people to make a change. I can say that the movie and the song "We Are the Champions" were a major inspiration to me when I made my own film. " 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    -   The movie was a good idea. It was a great concept and I loved the idea of an inter-dimensional war between these two sides with both of them dying but not before destroying everything in their path. It made for a really interesting premise.   As the movie progresses it seems like both sides are making great strides and in a way it gives you a sense of hope that there is still some good left in the universe.  In a way the movie gets a little bit preachy at times, but the story is great and it's always nice when it's all said and done.  - - - I have nothing bad to say about this movie and I highly recommend it.  My only wish would be that I got to see this movie when it was made instead of when I saw it on DVD a few years ago. I feel like I saw the film at about the same time as many others did and I wish I had known about it back then. I would probably have liked it even more if I saw a full length version.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have not watched this movie. I am curious what happened. The people were fine. I wish the actors would have been more attractive. I do not know how they could make a movie with actors that looked like this. I know this was made to be a drama and not a comedy. It was a very interesting film and a good film. I would not have minded it if they had cut the lines to make the movie a little shorter. But I liked it. I hope you can get it! - April 21, 2005Very Good Reviewer: cchapman - favorite favorite favorite - March 11, 2005  Subject: The truth is the whole thing A film made in the 20's that has a very strong message about "the lies". It shows the effects of lies and how we will accept the lie as fact. The film has a lot of comedy and it has to be seen. - March 18, 2005The truth is  Reviewer is a great actor and does a good job in the film but his character is rather weak and his performance would not stand up to a modern actor. The acting is done very well and I like the movie because it has a strong message and it shows us the effect of lies. It could be seen as a movie for the 20th century, but it does not seem very interesting. It is about the effects the lies has on those who believe the lie. It shows how we think that we know the truth about what is right and wrong. And they end up being very wrong. There is one scene where a friend of the characters is shown giving a speech and it seems to be his interpretation of what was said. I thought that it was too much. It seems to just be his opinion. He said that the film shows us a lot about a lot. It just seems like he tried to fit the facts in a funny way. I think that the ending was a little confusing to me and it did not make sense in the long run. I was expecting more and it just ended in a way that I did not feel satisfied with. It ends with the lines "All the world is against us" and I was not satisfied with that ending. This would have made more sense if we learned something about the whole message of the film. Also, I was upset that the movie was so short because it is very good. - February 19, 2005An Interesting Movie  Rated: Good - January 13, 2005 The

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was watching this one with my friend who is a die hard James Bond fan and we loved it.   It is the James Bond that I remember from my childhood but also has a different feel.  The sound design is perfect.  Every shot feels real.  Some of the special effects are a bit cheesy but nothing major.  A really well made movie.  Great cast,  Posted by: James Bond 007 | Jul 20, 2013 5:26:32 PM Hi, I'm a huge James Bond movie fan. And for the most part the Bond films we've had so far have been good. It's good to see Pierce Brosnan back to being James Bond for a short period of time.  I liked the ending, and the way they were mixing up the character with a new and new enemy.  And the way that the Bond girls are portrayed are very different.  Although not in my opinion perfect. However, I think that James Bond is one of the best spy movies out there. There are some great action scenes in this movie. And this movie is well worth seeing.  James Bond 006 - the best film James Bond ever made!!! Posted By: James Smith | Jun 16, 2013 9:01:19 PM It's a great movie. It had an excellent cast and a great storyline. Great movie. The main character was not as strong as he used to be. Pierce is not as cool as James Bond in this film. He was just a one-dimensional person.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a way it was easy, I saw it and was impressed, and went on to buy it from my local video store.   It's one of those movies that makes you want to go see more of it.   Don't write negative reviews about a bad movie: When I first saw "I Am Legend" I just said, "This is a great movie!" but after watching it more, I came to the conclusion that it was a total bore and it sucked.  After all of that I have come to the realization that you just need to be patient and wait for the movie to develop.  This movie doesn't give me a reason to see it again.  I won't be going to see a sequel, or any other movies about these monsters, because that would only bring the same problems back.  The movie is so bad that I am hoping for the same sort of treatment I received from the director.  He really needs to think of a new story.  My first "I am Legend" is the last movie I would ever see in this series.  This movie is a perfect example of why no one wants to see horror movies.   It is filled with cheesy acting and dialogue that would make your head spin.   Most of the actors were the same ones in the "Friday the 13th" movies and in "Jason Lives", the movie just seems to throw the same actors into these movies and they all seem to have the same performance.   This movie could have been a great horror movie, but it's so bad it's not even worth seeing. I Am Legion is not for the easily angered, those who can't stand watching a horror movie.  It is too long, slow and boring for the people who want a mindless thrill.  "I Will Protect You" had the same feel, and it is the better film.   I am Legion  is rated R (for violence).
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The thing is, I would LOVE it if this movie would have been a little better.   I'm not talking about the acting or the acting-related drama. The problem was with the story. I mean, sure, it was interesting, but I could tell that if we had been in their shoes, we would have had a much different story.  A more interesting film, I thought. This, I guess, is one of the ways of doing "the right thing."   This is where I'm going with this film.  In the opening scenes, we are introduced to a group of people who are living on a desert island, waiting for their ship to come in.  The movie is shot through a number of different lenses, so the audience gets to see several different perspectives of the island.  This means that even though the main characters have the same basic story, the film has to adapt to different points of view. The only problem with this is that it doesn't come off as terribly well.  I really liked the opening shots; they were the only ones that were consistent and kept me interested.  But by the middle of the movie, it becomes very uneven. I think it's the point that the film is aiming for, but it doesn�t achieve it. When they finally get to the ship, everyone is excited.  They have been promised they will be going to a new country with lots of opportunity, and now that they are going to start working as a crew on the ship they don't want to complain.  A bunch of them are drunk and raving about how great it is going to be.  Some are even getting drunker and more raving.  It's pretty clear that everyone is having a good time.  Their ship is docked in an port city, and the port city looks a lot like the city that they just left on the island of Socotra, so that's where we are going in the movie.  When the ship starts to take off, we hear some screams and we see some blood on the deck.  Somehow they made it to the other side of the ocean, but they were all on the wrong side.  Everyone is dead.  I would have preferred it if they could just say, "Everyone is dead, we got to land now, or everyone's dead," and be done with it.  So the movie has been going on
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was thrilled that I was watching the original Ghostbusters, and my mom enjoyed it even more. I would highly recommend this movie if you are looking for a laugh. I'm a big fan of the original cast, and it's great to see them all back on screen again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In all the times, when I write a review about something, I think, "I must get this right! This is a good film!" But at that moment, I see an unknown film that has a special place in my heart. It's called "Love Story" and it was released in 1973 by the legendary director, John Huston. The story is about two young people, one of them a man, the other a woman. They are friends and they work in the same factory. But the man is more interested in a girl than in work and when his work will be over, he leaves her to stay with the woman. After that, everything changes and, at first, everything is fine, but in the end, everything doesn't work out as it should and the man makes a very dangerous mistake and that's why he leaves his beautiful girl behind, in the midst of the factory, just after the day is over. Nowadays, I really admire this film because it's a film of its time and it represents in such a good way the essence of a friendship and how it must be lived with a real love. So, I'd like to share with you some of my memories and impressions of the film:  The music was written by Robert Schuller, the best songwriter and singer of the 60's. His songs have a nice sense of drama, of drama with a certain element of humour. He wrote a lot of songs about friends and his relationships. His most famous songs are "How Much Does a Rose by Any Other Name Worth", "A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes" and "A Little More to Love". He also wrote a bunch of songs that were never released on the recording, like "The Ballad of Johnny", "I'll Always Love You", "Love of My Life", and "Don't Let it Be You".  "Don't tell me about love when I'm in love and can see the stars. I love a life that has no dreams. If you don't let me see the lights of tomorrow."  This film was filmed on location in the suburbs of Chicago, where I grew up. It was a very sunny day in October, and I can still remember the beautiful white and pink snow.  I remember this film very well because I didn't have my camera. It seemed to be a very important movie to me at that time. I remember I had been to

Write a positive review about a good movie:    And you know what's crazy?   This is the second year in a row we're doing this, and the movie is "The Girl on the Train" which stars Laura Dern, Bradley Whitford and Kevin Spacey.   Here's the trailer:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_2s2cQ1rPQ   Also, the movie has been out for a while and it's still going. I think that's an achievement.  Why do we keep finding these gems in these terrible movies?  My only real complaint is that I wish we were getting a sequel as well.  The Girl on The Train is a movie about a couple who go on a train in the middle of nowhere.  They go from a normal middle class home to a hotel where you have to take the train every day.  There's something so touching about it. I wish it had been an even greater success, but I still want to see a sequel.  I do have a question for the producers. Why can't these movies be in 2-D?  This movie would be better on a big screen.  And what do you think, would a sequel to "The Help" and "I Am Love" be worth seeing on a regular screen?

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is the first movie I had ever seen that I really liked.    For a movie so new, it had a lot going for it.  The story was a lot of fun and the action was really good.  As the movie started, you really feel like you are there with the characters as the movie progresses.  There were some really great characters in this movie.  Even the villains were really good and believable.  It was a very good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Babe, Let's Get It On"    - I know the song doesn't have much of a soundtrack, but it's just so iconic and memorable.   I didn't like the whole "fantasy movie about a girl who wants to be with a man," but the music was amazing!   It just helped you realize that you were in for a treat!    - This is one of those movies that you'll have a hard time ever forgetting.     And in the end, it's a movie about the ultimate love story... which is something to cherish. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked       The Wolfpack.   It was a really fun movie, and very creative.   That said, there were a few things that didn't make the cut, and it doesn't necessarily need them.  One of the best parts of the movie was the banter.  For a movie that's just about the team vs. team battle, it's cool to see the characters goof off a bit, and even in a movie about sports, they can be funny.  What I would change:  There are a couple of things I wish they would've cut.  First is a scene where the coach gives a motivational speech.  While that was funny, and a part that worked, the scene where they all get back together, and they all laugh about it later was too much.  Maybe that's how you get fired in high school, but I don't think so.  I think they would have been better off having just shown them getting back together and joking about it in the locker room.  A couple other things I really like is the scene with the goalie.  I love that the kid's dad came into the game in the third period to cheer them on, and the coach had them all over him for it.  The second thing I would've done differently is in the film's final minutes, the coach shows up to the locker rooms and calls out a player's name.  It seems like a nice gesture, but it got too comical in the end.  Another thing I didn't love was when they played basketball in the final minute.  There's a moment in the movie where the players are running through the locker area, and there's some guy yelling "Hey, hey, hey."  It seemed like it was so silly, and not in a good way.  But yeah, those are some of my criticisms.  Now I just have to see if they add them in.  This movie was directed by David Gordon Green, and written by Seth Gordon, and is one of his better efforts.  Like I said, it might not work for everyone, but if you're looking for a sports movie with a little bit of humor and creativity, then I think you will like this one.

And I agree with you that there are not many films as good as Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit."   "I felt that this was one of the best things that's been put on the silver screen since the '90s, and it did the job of creating such an atmosphere and such a world that I found very entertaining, and a nice way to spend a lazy day."

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie.   It has the look and sound of a western, but the action is intense.  This is a movie for fans of movies such as "Hard Target," "Crazy" and "Blood and Sand."   There is a great scene when the lead actor (Paul) is playing a part and a woman is sitting on his lap.  He is holding her hand.  After the scene they walk to the kitchen and she says to him, "You are the man of my dreams."  "I am indeed, ma'am," he responds.  The rest of the film, as usual, is a fast pace and some fun.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   (    ) My husband and I are going through a lot of bad luck right now and are in desperate need of a good laugh. One of my favorite movies is "The Big Lebowski" and I have seen the movie a dozen times and never heard anything but great reviews. However, I have read the "Blimowski" books, and found the movies to be mediocre, even mediocre for that era. My husband and i have been looking for some good fun and this movie has it. The actors are great in this film, and there is a real sense of humor to it, that makes me laugh, even when the film starts off with a plot that makes little sense. This is also a film about two drunks who find love in a foreign land, and one of them dies, while the other goes on to make a living doing things for fun. It is also funny that the characters are named after people, such as "Bunny" and "Butt" and the actor playing the first one, John Goodman is a relative of mine. I have loved the other films that he has done.   I have watched the movie several times now, and I really enjoy it, even with all of the problems that it has had with other people. I can honestly say that I will be seeing this film again.

It is a really well done movie with a lot of suspense.  " "  This movie is a MUST SEE.  I was not a Steven Spielberg fan until this film but after watching it I just can't stop watching.  They have given us a great movie with all the characters we love as well as the new characters that will grow into some of the older ones.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Good reviews can often come from bad movies!   If I can't watch the bad one, I probably won't see the good one.   I'm trying to be helpful to you!  I don't really know much about movies, but it's good to know that not all movies are bad.  When I saw this movie I immediately started to get pumped to watch it, so I took some pictures and I wrote a review:  1.  The movie is set in 1950s Japan.  Japan has many unique things that other countries have not (like the kawaii girls with giant katanas).  2.  Although there are no subtitles in this movie, it's pretty easy to figure out what they are saying in the subtitles.  3.  Because this movie was made in 1950's Japan, it has the standard style of movies of that era.  4.  Most of the actors in this anime are famous actors from that time.  5.  This movie is also good for people who don't like martial arts movies (which I don t really like) or those who just want to watch a good, action packed movie.  I give it a 8.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are so many great movies out there, and even some that I don't particularly enjoy, and it's hard to decide what I'll watch if I want to have an enjoyable week.   One of my favorites was  The Girl with All the Gifts  (2008), in which Sharon Stone  is played by a fantastic Scarlett Johansson.  Her character, a young girl with mental health issues who has been adopted by a wealthy, conservative family, falls in love with a woman who comes from a family of poor immigrants.  The film was directed by Darren Aronofsky, and is a harrowing portrayal of family strife and family rejection.  Aronoff-fied  The Wrestler, the second film in his  Black Swan  series, was not as good as the first, but was still a pretty good film.  I don't usually watch movies for the dialogue alone, but  The Woman in Black  was pretty good.  It's about a serial killer, played by Tom Cruise, who has made a killing after he killed his first wife, but she escapes him and turns him in.  He is able to track her down with the help of a cop and a serial Killer, played  by  Jesse Ventura.  If you like Tom Cruise's "tough guy" movies, you'll probably enjoy this movie.  There were some scenes that weren't that great and some of the gore in the movie wasn't that realistic, but you won't be disappointed.  Another good movie that was released this year was  Gloria, directed by James Toback and starring Robert De Niro and Kirsten Dunst.  Robert DeNiro has said that this movie was based on his experience with imminent suicide' in the early 90's, and I'm sure he's right.  It's about a young man who discovers that the way to get over a bad breakup or just to feel better about your life is to take a massive overdose of drugs.  Gloria is one of my favorite movies of the last year because it isn't all about a guy killing himself.  While you won't be laughing out loud at most of the scenes in this film, there are some pretty funny lines.  In the last third of the film, a character attempts to go to a suicide club.  After his attempt fails, he becomes increasingly convinced that
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I watched this movie, I was confused about the first few scenes, because I thought they were filmed in a different order (to my mind, they could not be filmed in order). I think I even thought it was a bad movie from the beginning, but then I really started to watch it and realized it wasn't at all bad, as long as you're prepared for a bit of a slow start.   I also really liked this movie and it's still a good one, although it was not quite a "classic" (but definitely not a "mediocre" either). I don't think that it's really fair to compare it to anything since it was released so late in the year, but it does share some similarities to some of the old films that were released in the mid- to late-1970s (i.e. The Big Sleep, Sunset Boulevard, Bonnie and Clyde).   But I believe that this movie does belong to a completely different era and genre, and while it may seem "clunky" in places (i'm still in the dark about the ending), it has some good ideas and a really nice storyline.  It's funny that this was the first time that I saw this movie! It's a shame that it was the second time I saw it after seeing the original, because the pacing was much better here.  This movie did have a bit more of a "tension" to it, and the fact that it is an all-girl story would have helped the pacing a bit.  It wasn't all bad though; there were some good lines, and there were also some truly great performances. I think that if I'm being honest, my favorite character in this movie was Audrey Hepburn, because she looked so beautiful. And the fact is, I think she's the best actress in the movie (not really saying much since she really only had a supporting role, but if she gets more work from now on, that's a bonus too). I also liked the story a lot. There was a little bit of the "no-rules" approach to the story that you don't usually see in movies (i mean, "rules" means "expectations"), and it was definitely a bit different from other movies of this genre.  Although it had some good moments, this film doesn't quite deserve all of my praise, because it could have been a little better at a few points.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've got a big problem with some Hollywood productions being called "funny", and I don't mean that as a negative. I like seeing movies that aren't "fun" as much as the next guy, and I'm not particularly cynical when it comes to entertainment, but when a studio executive has told me that a movie is intended to be entertaining and has the "guarantee" of making people laugh, there's no way I'm going to be satisfied.   I just don't see any humor in any of the "funniest" movies:  There's no fun in these "fun," are they?   In addition to being a producer and a comedian, I'm also a film critic who covers film at MovieFone.com.  My take on this subject is that Hollywood, being Hollywood, is in an ongoing battle to sell movies to as many people as possible. That means that the more they can get people to go see a movie, the more money they can make. The problem is, the better a movie gets reviewed, the harder it is for a movie to make a profit in theaters. So, why don't Hollywood studios just make films that are genuinely funny and make people laugh? The answer, of course, is that it's too difficult, it doesn't make money, and people get bored. So what do they do?  The good news is that you don't have to wait for movies to be "fun". There are plenty of other people in Hollywood who are also interested in making films that people laugh at. There's a lot of money to be made by producing a film that people actually enjoy, and one way to do that is to just make the movies that are funny. I would argue that there are a number of movies that you can make that you'll see with your buddies and not even have a problem with, and it has to do with the director.  So what is the problem?  It turns out that Hollywood executives really are very concerned about keeping their own money. One way to make movies that people will really enjoy is to make them really good. This is true in the movies you see in theaters today, and also in those that get made on the cheap, but it's also true in television and video games. In the old days when people were watching television and playing games, the studios were more concerned about getting a lot more people interested in watching those things than they were about

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For most of the year, it was hard to get a movie to the top of the box office charts. But thanks to a blockbuster hit, "Titanic," which will be released in theaters and on DVD on March 13, the box-office haul is looking good. "Titans" grossed $160.6 million at the U.S. box office from 1,619 theaters in its opening weekend, according to a report by industry sources. That is the best opening day of any movie since "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2" in 2011. The movie is an American adventure about a ship, the Endurance, and the seven people who try to save it. "War of the Worlds," "Harry & Tonto" and "Avatar" also contributed to the record opening weekend. The record was previously held by "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" in 1982, when it grossed a reported $157.4 million. But the latest blockbuster could end up as the best-ever box- office figure for a film that grossed only about $200 million. The highest-grossing film in the U to date was Disney's "Frozen," which earned $1.5 billion domestically. The two most recent releases in the top spot are the two largest grossing movies to date in the United States, "Harry and Tonto," which grossed about $320 million, and "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," which brought in about $255 million. Disney released the film, with the voices of Robert Redford, Dustin Hoffman and J.K. Simmons, in April and it is expected to return in theaters in October. "Harry" and its sequel are expected to be huge success for the company. The studio had earlier released the animated film "Tron: Legacy" to positive reviews in July 2010, but it lost its grip after grossing $75 million in its first six days. The original "Toys" movies have generated more than $8.5 million in box office receipts each. "Aviation" stars Ben Kingsley, who also stars in "Avatara" and directed the "Titantic." The film is based on a true story about the plane that crashed into the Atlantic in 1969. The screenplay is by "Jurassic Park" scribe Michael Crichton, and a number of pilots took a long shot to survive after the plane crashed and was
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is very bad, the acting is bad, but it is great with the sound track, the cinematography is very good, and the music is nice and well performed. This is the best movie for the month. - 10 The best movie of the month is the "Godzilla" remake, which is one of my favorite films of the year. It is about a boy named Jason who wants to join the army, but his step father thinks he will never be able to. One night while Jason's step father is asleep, a nuclear bomb falls into the town. It then explodes, killing his family. Jason's only hope of surviving is to become a fighter pilot and save the world. It has been over ten years since the original "Godzillaman," and this remake is the same with only a few minor differences. For example, there are no long shots of the city after the bombs fall, and it uses the same sound track. But it is still very good and I give it a great 10.     - 4 "The Mummy" is an American horror film directed by Alex Kurtzman and starring Tom Cruise, Sofia Boutella, Russell Crowe and Jake Johnson. It tells the story of a man named John who wakes up to find his wife murdered. As he goes about his work as a physician, he is visited by a strange creature that is capable of speech.  The film deals with themes of religion, death and religion in general. It also deals with religion and superstition as well as the importance of faith and the need to find meaning. As a result, this film has become one of the most controversial films of recent years. Critics have been very scathing of it, and have called it a poor film and a bad movie at that. Personally, I think it's not as bad as it was made out to be. It's definitely not a great film, but that doesn't mean it's any worse than other bad films that were released the same year. I give the film a 4.5/5, but I don't think it was a total failure, and that makes me a big fan of Alex Kurtzmans work.  This month has a lot of very good films from Japan, which makes me really happy. The films were released between August and October, but there are a lot more coming. Hopefully, I will be able find a way to have them listed here.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really liked this movie. It was a decent action movie with good effects, and it had a nice ending. In my opinion, it was the best installment of the Terminator series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You can use "BEST FILM EVER" to describe a movie, "DAMN GOOD MOVIE", but "WORST MOVIE EVER" can also be used when a movie can be a great movie, but the director didn't do a good job with it.     It's just a word for describing a movie that is bad.  It could be a scene or a part of a movie: Some movies are just plain great.   If a movie is good enough and you enjoy it, then it can be considered "good movie" in my opinion.  If it's not so great, then, I think, it can really be "worst movie ever" in another person's opinion. Some movie can cause the audience to have emotions and feelings other than happiness: A good movie can make us feel something.   I mean that it can make our heart beat, sweat, and be tense.   Even if it's just an action movie, if the actor does a great job, and the director tries to make it as fun as possible, then a movie with such a good storyline is going to bring out the emotions of a person. Bad movies don't have that special quality: Bad movie is basically the opposite of good movie.   There are a few scenes in movies, and I mean few.   They don't even have any impact on the story and they are not really needed.   A good movie always has that effect. It's really annoying to hear a movie after watching it: Sometimes, you will hear a story that you've heard before, and you just don't like it anymore, or the story is really lame.   Sometimes, the movie can even sound like it's full of lame jokes and clichés, but then you remember that you don't know any English, so the joke is pretty funny.   Maybe you should have watched another movie before.    You have to admit that the movies that you watch, are better than what they could have been: If you know a movie and you don' think it's good, it's because you only know it through the script.   In real life, if you know the movie before you watch it, it could be better than the movie you just watched. You know you should watch a movie but you haven't watched it:  If I've seen a movie before and I haven't seen it since
Write a positive review about a good movie:   ... and please tell me about the movie on Facebook       I have a Facebook page   I'm a member of a couple of movie review boards:  I'm a part of Movie Fanatics  , which is a list of all the reviews of new movies.  The other one is the Newbie Reviews List, which is based on the most helpful reviews and comments in the comments of the movies that are still new enough that we haven't heard about it yet.  But it's not the first place I go to for movie information:    I've always seen the movie listings on IMDB   (I don't see anything about Rotten Tomatoes anywhere) and for a few years I also searched Google for movie reviews.   But after a couple years of trying, I just gave up and didn't bother trying anymore.    I think it's good to be able to find reviews on IMDb.  I can't remember a single bad review.  And if a movie is bad, then you won't read reviews for it anyway.  But it doesn't matter if it's bad.  You can still talk about it, you can still discuss it with your friends, and it doesn See the movie, not a lot of the reviews.   And you can also click on the IMDB title for the review.   That's good.  A good movie review page. And not only will you find a movie review but also other stuff.  For example, if a review says, "I found this movie a little confusing, but that was just my opinion, and if you don't agree then you should go and see it on the big screen.  It's not worth your time or money."  If you click on this link, you'll find a review of The Magnificent Seven, a movie that I've never seen.  If it's a good review, you could ask a question, you're welcome to discuss it on IMdb or the forums or just to chat with other fans of the movie.  Another site that I visit frequently is TV Tropes.   This is a site that lets you post content, comment on it, and other people can add their opinions to the conversation.  TV Troping is a good place to start. I used to read blogs.  You could go on Tumblr (now shut down, if you're curious) and

This one is all about the characters. It takes you back to the first movie, and then takes you on another amazing adventure." - The Daily Beast "The film is the most original and compelling fantasy I've seen in years. " - New York Post "This movie has everything we love about Disney movies. It's a great mix of fairy tales, science-fiction and fantasy that leaves you craving more. It has a lot of humour and a lot more heart than the other Disney films." - LA Times "A beautifully made, charmingly funny and endearing sequel to the original." - Time Magazine "Disney fans and critics will love this movie. And kids, there's something to be said for having this kind of fun for children. It is very well-crafted. It isn't a Disney sequel, but it is a very cool and original movie, with a fantastic mix of characters and a story that will make you want more." - Cinefile.com
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Why is it so hard to make a good horror movie?  Categories: Horror, Horror review, Movie review, review for a movie  "Bewitched" is a great movie in many ways. It was fun and has an amazing plot with some amazing characters. It has some great music that makes it even more effective and it's set in an interesting town. The story is not so exciting and not the most original, but there are several things that are truly good about it. Most importantly the performances by the main actors are wonderful and they were amazing to watch.  This movie is for sure one of the most famous and loved horror films ever made. The film is based on a true story, and it tells the story of how a woman, named Edna Purviance (Eddie Marsan), was a member of a secret society that would kill people who were judged to be a threat to the society. However, Edna was very superstitious, and she would never agree to a person being killed, even when she was alone. Then she meets another woman named Mary (Carrie Booth) who was sent to her as a replacement member and she fell in love with her. She promised to kill her if she died in any way. When Edna dies of a heart attack, Mary, and later her husband, decide to keep her body, so that they can live on. They bring Edna to a hospital, and in a horrible dream she meets a girl who tells her that she is going to be the mother of the new baby that will be born that day. That's the story, but this movie is about a lot more than that. This movie has great characters, great suspense, great performances, and an awesome and disturbing plot that really does work.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Good movie, good cast.   I'm getting a bit bored of this franchise, but hey, if I had to pick one film that best represented the entirety of the series, this would be it.  The plot is interesting and intriguing, though the plot is not the point of the film.  I really liked the film, though it could have been more interesting.  The music is really nice, as is the acting.  All in all, a good addition to the series. I still like this movie better than the others, especially the first one, since it shows that there are still a lot of unanswered questions in the series: Where was the first season of this? What was the original plan for the series?  If you don't like the anime or don't know the series in full, then this might not be for you.  If you like the series and want to see it with new actors, then definitely go watch this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen every movie this season, and I've been watching this one as soon as it was released. If I had watched it when it first came out, I would have been disappointed. But as it stands, I've enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. This show is different and more mature than the others this season. The music is also much better, and the story is more intriguing. The characters are also more intriguing than some of the characters I've watched so far. It seems like more characters are on the show.   This show has some of my favorite characters, and they are all in it for a reason.  They don't have their own life, they are just doing what they're told.  And it really makes me want to root for them. I would say the only thing this show lacks is a lot of action. But, as with any story, it's never about the action.  I also really enjoyed this series.  Overall, I think this show is better than the ones before it. I hope it will keep this up until the next season. I'll also be watching season 2. I just don't know if I can wait.  Thanks for reading and enjoy! Posted by katrinat at 5:36 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Heaven's Gate"  Bizarre film, but the film itself is interesting, with one of the most amazing scenes I've seen in a long time. I mean, the man's on a horse in a blizzard?   A lot of people don't know that this is a true story, and the book on which it is based also bears repeating. A group of astronauts have been stranded in a frozen ice mountain for a month, and a man, in the middle of an epic journey to find his wife, is having trouble finding enough fuel for his horse. He sees a man and woman in a hut, and realizes that the people are the scientists who are working on a cure for the flu. He doesn't even care about the man and the woman, he just wants to get out of the frozen wastes. When he tries to sneak away, he is followed by the authorities and is forced to run for his life. He runs right into a man who is trying to get into the hut, but then is attacked. The man, played by Robert Redford, gets into a fistfight with the other scientist who is inside the hut. The scientist tells Redford that he is a bad scientist and that he didn't really understand how the flu is cured. The fight continues, until the man who was trying to take Redford's horse runs into a blizzards and is killed. The only thing is, Redford had to stand and watch this happen, and he actually started crying as he was watching the death of this poor man who he had come to save. When the fight was over, the scientist was standing in the snow with a pistol in his hand, with Redford still standing next to him, just watching. After a moment or so, Red Ford turns to the other man and says, "Oh, shit. This is hell." The entire film is like this, from the beginning to the end, a real film.   The movie begins with a man on a snowmobile, and his horse has been lost in the blizzard. He decides to go after the horse, and finds a blimp flying over his head. He rides the blimp to the coast, but as he flies away from the coast he sees his horse running toward him, and then falls from the blimps plane.  The blimp is in distress, so a team of rescuers is launched to find the horse. They fly over
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am going to review a movie with bad reviews and give a positive spin on it!   The movie is "Wedding Crashers" and its rated R.   You don't think this is going to be a comedy like all the other movie that has such a rating!  This is the only movie where I cried my eyes out, but still laughed the whole time!  It does have a lot of action, with a good amount of explosions, and even a car crash!  The plot of the movie is a mystery and the movie starts out like that.  We get introduced to our main character Kevin, his brother Michael, and then the whole family, and we find out that the bad guys, who is a gang of kids, is after him, and they want to have his money.  But it starts off very well, when we see the gang of bullies, and it's all the same bad behavior, they yell at each other, they hit each other.  Their lives are ruined because they get in a fight.  The bad guy in this movie is named Zay.  He is a really good actor, and this movie has a good deal of laughs.  And the gangsters are the reason why they get caught by the police.  They are the criminals!  As it is explained to us, all the kids in this gang of baddies, is just playing a game of "knock knock" and when one of them knocks on the door, they all rush in the room and they try to get the money! But the police don't really want to go to the kids, they think they are the gang and that's where the action starts.  A lot of jokes are made in this film, and in the end, it turns out that all the baddies in this whole movie are just making a prank on the police and making it all up.   This is one of the more original movies that I have seen, it has a lot to say about how we treat others, and the best part is that it's funny.  For people that like to laugh at things that are wrong, this movie can be pretty funny to watch!  You may want to turn off the lights and just sit there and enjoy the movie, if you're going to have to take a bath, this would be a good place to sit down and watch this movie.  "Walking on the Moon" is another
Write a positive review about a good movie:     5) When you look for a movie to be good, do not use a filter and have the brightness set to maximum:   (1) This can be a problem with certain movies. If you watch something with very dim (e.g. low f-stop) or very bright lights, you may not be able to see the detail. You may find this particularly true if you have to work with the film version of a film that is not in wide release. This issue is especially relevant when you have a very dark room that is too bright.  (2) This is because some of the movies look better in the dimmer light. To see details in a dark room, set the brightness of the room to about 100 percent, or perhaps 200 percent if you really have to. (3) If you have been watching movies for a long time, then you probably have an eye that does not respond as well to the dim light. Your eyes may respond to the light very differently.  (4) If this happens, I recommend that you turn off your dimmer, and let the room light in at all times. It's better to look for the brightness setting that you like for the movie than to go for the brightest setting.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's always fun to see what someone else is thinking when they watch the movie and it's good to see the movie in some sort of context (unless of course it's bad, then you really don't know what you are watching).   This is just a movie and not meant to be taken as a reflection on the world in which it takes place.   The movie does not show any great battle or conflict, so it is unlikely that any war was fought in this film (and if it was, it would not be mentioned).  It is a very well made film and with the action sequences are well done.  Also the film has great songs and music and is really catchy.  The dialogue is not at all dated and while the movies plot is not very complex, it still has some very clever scenes.  Overall, a great movie, especially if you love war movies.  "You'll never understand!"   It's a famous saying and if I was a fighter pilot I'd know it all by now.   The movie takes place during World War II and is a great insight to what the war was like and what we were really fighting for (or at least for the soldiers).   The soldiers in this movie are not the same as in any war movie I've seen.  I think that their attitude is different from a war movie and maybe that is why I really liked this film.   It reminds me a lot of my days as a soldier in the Air Force.   I had a lot in common with these guys in this story.   They were fighting for something that was very personal to them and I think the same is true for me.   This film really shows that no matter what you do, life is hard and hard things happen.   You can't give up when things get tough and it can sometimes be scary as hell.   But if you get past that and try your hardest to be strong for those around you, there is always a chance of succeeding.    I was so happy that I was able to share with my husband some of my favorite movies.   "You'll Never Understand" was one of my favorites and the idea of having a movie based on a true story was a really good one.   My husband loved this movie too and I'm very happy that he did!   Thanks to the director and the cast, this was one hell of a movie!   And with a title like that,
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this movie in the theater about a month ago and I liked it a lot. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and a bit over-excited, but I really loved the movie. The character development was great and the plot was very well developed. My biggest disappointment was the ending, which felt forced and a little cheap. I wish they had kept the ending from the first movie, but that's just my opinion and not something I have seen from a movie in a very long time. If you liked the first one, I recommend this one. The movie will make you want to watch the first film because you can't help but be in the right place at right time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not going to talk about the movie as the review can be found on any good review website. I am going to give you a great review of the movie. It is a great movie. So many people said this was the best movie of 2012. I say its one of the best films this year. If you want to get the latest in the great trilogy or if you are into the "Titanic" movie, this movie is not for you. If I were to pick a movie that was the last one of this kind that I want to watch, I would pick this movie.   This movie is more in the spirit of "Babylon 5".   If you are in love with Star Trek then this movie will make you angry. But if you enjoy space travel, good drama, drama, a lot of action, and a lot good special effects, then this is a perfect movie for you to enjoy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's not easy to pick a movie that everyone should watch. There are so many amazing movies to choose from!     The film "Love on the Set" is about a legendary actor. John Wayne (1917-1995) is one of the most recognizable faces in Hollywood. He has been nominated for 14 Academy Awards and won 3 of them!  John Wayne was born in Brooklyn, New York. He started his acting career in the New York City Theater at age 19. After the success of his first movie, he went on to get a major role in the hit movie, "Stagecoach". He was nominated for 4 Academy Awards: Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Supporting Actress. He was also nominated for a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award. In 1958 he was chosen as a part of the Greatest Generation. The actor started to work in several popular films such as "A Farewell to Arms", "StageCoach", "The Alamo", and "Gone with the Wind". He is still working in movies today.  He was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease at the age of 66. It was at this time that his family was left with a massive amount of debt. In order to pay his debts, Wayne decided to stop working. But in the early 90's he started filming again with the goal to make a comeback.  a love on the set is about one of his most well-known roles in "Stage Coach", "Gran Torino", and others.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first half of the movie takes place in the middle of the night, when everything is quiet. We're waiting for something to happen, and we know that what happens in the movies has to have a good story.   It's the same idea, we're waiting on the end of an action scene to see who dies, and what happens when they're killed.  The story isn't bad. It's about two very ordinary men who go after a criminal who has gone after many, many people.  It really shows how a life of crime has destroyed people's lives.  The second half of this movie is much more action-packed. The characters are larger, and there's more of them.  Even with all that more of people, there's still not enough time spent in the police station to really find out what's going on.  A character that wasn't part of the story, is the father of one of the characters.  He spends most of his time just sitting there, and I don't think the guy has done a lot in his life besides take care of his kids and raise them the best he could.  You can really feel the sadness of his characters as they're watching their son suffer, so that's where you'll spend the majority of your time.  There's not much suspense in this movie, and it doesn't get any better in the third act.  So what the movie was supposed to be: The movie is about two families, and the problems they've faced in their lives. The bad guy has his own family, and a lot of money.  One of the families have to take care and protect the other family.  In the end, the bad guy gets captured.  What it ends up being:  It was supposed be a nice story. I wanted to believe that the good guy was the good man. But even if he is, that doesn't change what has already happened. The story is about family, about the problems that the families are facing, and not the characters' problems.  To be honest, there aren't any characters in this whole movie that are even memorable. I could have really cared less about the characters and their issues.                                        I'm not a fan of movies that have an ending or a resolution. I think that you have to see it for yourself, and get it out of your head. That's

After watching a few videos on the laptop we just happened to be passing by and we thought of making a trip out for a quick movie, which is exactly what we did. I loved this movie, it's a lot of fun, and I hope you guys like it too!  A very enjoyable little movie. We watched it at the same time, and it had a good amount of humour.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    (if you want to be nice)     (if it's too long/if it doesn't give you an exciting action sequence) Reviewers often tell you that they are not going to be able to write a good review of a bad movie because they just don't know it that well.   I don't think that's true.  When the film is good, I love it and it doesn in fact make me want to watch it over and over again.  For me that means it's a good film, and as an author I love good reviews because it gives me more information about what my book is about and what it's about. So that's why I wrote a review about the film.  I watched the film twice and I thought it was really good.  The movie was made in 2002 and I think it's good because it's true to its time and to a certain extent it also has some good moments that I really enjoyed.  In fact it was a film that I remember when I was younger and now it's one of the movies that I keep going back to.  There are also some moments in it that really make me think about the times we lived in a hundred years ago and I found those really fascinating. I have to give the director, Mike Fleming Jr.  credit.  He's done a good job because this movie is set in the future and he's really able to capture this futuristic feeling that we all are used to. I really like the way they filmed it and I really enjoy the film and all of the elements that make it so great.  Even though I don´t really like modern movies in general, I always enjoy films like this and it´s hard to not enjoy this movie.  It's a film with great action and good dialogue and I especially enjoyed how the characters reacted to events and how they reacted to each other.  The film has good action sequences:   (no pun intended)  I liked the film even though it wasn't the best movie I´ve ever seen.  After seeing some other films that were better I found this movie to be a little bit too slow at times, and the characters and the action were not as strong as I thought they would be.  Now that I´m not that tired from watching it I´ll give the film another chance because I really thought that it was something special and I still find it to be something
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite movie of all time is The Matrix (1999).  It's the one that defined me as a filmmaker.   The plot is pretty simple.  The main character is Morpheus, the leader of an underground resistance movement against an oppressive corporate system.  A brief history of the Matrix:   In 1999, the world had just fallen into the age of computer technology, and the Matrix (the world's first  computer  that had a mind of its own) was set up in a secret base to rule the world (a  computer. )  and make sure that the machines never learned that people could rebel.  It was created by the man behind  2001:  A Space Odyssey. The Matrix takes place in the near future in a virtual reality computer world.  After years of battling against the machines, humans were about to give up and just accept a world that didn't care about them.  Morpheus is told by his master, Neo (played by Keanu Reeves), to start a revolution by making the machines believe they have a mind.  To this end, Morpheus gives Neo a sword and tells him to fight the machines.  This led to the creation of the virtual world.  In the virtual reality, people are only human.  That's the  core  of the plot.  They don't know that they are a part of the machines and they are forced to  obey them.     After Neo fights the machines for the first time, his friend, a human, kills him.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      I liked this movie.   I liked it a lot.    Not enough people like this movie, so you might as well watch it.  I thought it was a good way to get into some of the great stuff coming from the DC universe.  It's kind of interesting to watch.  There is so much I don't know.  The fact that it has a different version of Superman on the other side.  The fact that the Kryptonians weren't necessarily evil.  Superman's new costume is so interesting.  This movie has lots of action and I liked how they changed the characters.  They make the characters a lot more like themselves.  Batman and Superman are different people and I think that's the first time that's happened.  Wonder Woman's costume is really cute.  And there are tons of different versions of Superman that all work well.  My favorite parts of this movie are when we get to see Lex Luthor.  That guy is a genius and I like his philosophy.  He has that "get your hands dirty" mentality.  When Batman and Supergirl show up, Luthor is so excited to see them and he just can't wait to fight them.   He's such a smart guy.   I'm glad he showed up.   They have Superman and Wonder Woman together and I have been waiting to see that.   Superman has a new costume and I'm really glad they did that.  In the movie they do a bunch of really cool things that just aren't in the comics.  Some of them are just really cool.  But others are just like the movies.  Lex Luthor's armor is in there.   It's really good.  So good, in fact, that I didn't realize it was in there until I was re-watching it.   The best part is that this movie also had a great score.  You can hear some of them in there and it really works.  We also get a nice little song in there with the kids and there is a really good song for everyone.  Just check it out.  If you haven't seen it before, this is the movie for you.  If you like the movie: Like the movie?   Like the characters?  Like Superman?  Love the humor?  Then you'll love this movie and you'll want to see it over and over again.  Because when the credits end and you're
Write a positive review about a good movie:   . It is called "Curious Incident".   This movie is about a kid who is kidnapped by a mysterious man and ends up being used as his new lover. It has the most beautiful music, and you feel completely enthralled.  If you want to learn how to be a better lover, this is the movie for you.   But it is more than just a movie. It is a story of hope and redemption. It really does take you by the hand and make you feel as if you're watching something you should be watching.    The director made the movie with the same attitude that he wanted to get the message across, and he managed to do it in an amazing way.  I'm not gonna explain any of the movie's plot points because I don't want to ruin it for you, but they are important enough for me to mention:  1.  After the kidnapping, the girl escapes with the help of a young girl she meets on the street.  It's up to the man to save her.  2.   In the end, the woman returns home with her new man and finds that he is a monster.  3.   This is the story of the man.  4.   What he does to the girl in order to save them both.  5.  This is a movie with no romance.  6.  In the beginning of the film, the young girl is in a coma and the man was going to kill her.   7.  The man is obsessed with saving her and wants to prove his love.  8.  But is it really love?  Here is a review about the movie: Movie Review: C.I.D. - a movie that you can watch whenever you want, and never get tired of. This is one of those movies that you cannot put down once you've watched it. This movie does not follow any of your usual rules when it comes to movies. There's no hero, no heroine, no villain, no story, nothing really that is going on. All you do is just sit back and relax.   It all begins with a kidnapping and a young man (Olivier Dahan) is caught and forced into doing everything that the kidnapper demands of him.  What happens after the kidnapping? We do not know, but we do see a beautiful girl (Emilia Clarke) who is the one
Write a positive review about a good movie:      Like I said before, I was very disappointed. I was expecting some sort of interesting movie, and I didn't get anything like that. My friend was there and she told me it was a movie with a lot of action and a good plot, but she was disappointed by the bad acting, the bad writing, and even the bad plot. She said it was like a bad Hollywood movie.   "A woman is murdered by a man in a car, and the guy goes to jail for a long time... but then his friend (who is also in jail at the time) gets in the car and drives off to make a few more friends, before finally leaving on his own."   After that, it was almost completely dark.  I think there was a few moments that were quite good, but then again, not many movies have that many good moments.  It felt very generic, like it had been filmed in a low-budget movie and the cinematographer was just filling up the screen.  A typical suburban home:  But still, I liked how they used a real house with a real car (not a toy).   In this movie, a guy murders a woman and then makes a number of friends (like in movies like The Killer Inside Me ). So, he goes to prison for a very long time (a long time, in this movie!), and then the women's family comes to visit him and tell him that she was murdered by his friend. That's why he's in prison.  But they eventually come back to find that the friend is in prison too, and that his friend got out because his girlfriend ran off with a guy who he was also in prison with. This is what they think happened. The only thing that really seems to matter in the whole movie is the fact that the guy was in prison and was going to be released anyway.  In other words, the guy got out of prison and killed the woman because the man she was seeing (the man in prison) had cheated on her and the woman killed herself. It's a very sad story.  "And then the woman's son finds out that her murder had nothing to do with him, and runs off into the city to try to prove it. It turns out that this whole thing was all a misunderstanding, and they're all really happy to be reunited."  But the movie never shows you any of the details.  Again, there
Write a positive review about a good movie:     This movie does not belong in a positive list and it is not a good one. But the good thing is that the bad thing can be forgiven if you can get a good sense of what it is that you are watching. The movie is a mixture of the good and the not-so-good and it really makes you wonder if the producers of the movie did their research.  A very old story, made in the early 70's, about a rich man who tries to bring a beautiful young girl into his life who then changes his attitude about the life of a real billionaire. The poor man also has his problems with an old woman and tries to solve them by using money from his wife's side. And then there is the evil genius of the film, played by Robert De Niro. This movie really makes a great mess of the story by throwing in a lot of nonsense and bad logic. The story makes little sense and if it were not for the way the character are portrayed, it might just have been a bad movie. De Nirei was not very convincing as the protagonist and his character did not seem to be able to make sense of his actions. The character of the villain is much more interesting and the movie does try to show his role to the end of the very long film. But overall it is a mess and not a very good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     "I will be dead and gone soon, and my body will never be found."   The film opens with a voice-over of a man who says he won't sleep. The man then talks about a man "in the shadows" who is stalking him and other men in his life.   (I don't think this is actually a true quote, but it's pretty close.) The next scene shows a man and a woman walking on a beach with a beautiful woman named Toni and a man of indeterminate gender, who's trying to get into their car. The next shot is of the man of the shadows running up to the car and asking if they have a cigarette, and when he gets no answer, the man starts beating them with a cane.  He gets in and starts kicking and punching the man and then grabs the woman by the back of the head and pulls her into the sand. She tries to scream, but he pushes her down and begins to choke her.  The next scene of the film shows a woman who looks to be about 45 walking around a city. She is covered in mud and looking very disheveled. She runs down a street and encounters a group of people, a man with a shotgun and a tall man with glasses. They point their guns at her and the man takes a step toward her. The woman tries to escape and as she is running, the gun is fired at her, and she falls back down. A man wearing a gas mask, mask and trench coat walks up and shoots her in the head.  The next thing we see is a young girl about the same age as the girl shot in the previous scene. She has dark, wavy hair, and wears a long red dress. She walks over to her attacker, who is wearing a mask and has a gun on his back. She starts to choke him and he pushes the gun away from her. A few more shots are fired and he flees. She gets back up and walks off.  It then shows a couple of people coming up from a car and going into the street.  One of them points a gun at one of the women and says "Go! Go! I got my money!"  After a while, the next two scenes show people in a restaurant. One of the characters is looking at a man, who has his face buried in a woman's dress. He is pointing at the man's
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film opens with a lovely narration by Peter Scolari.  It tells of a young man who lived a peaceful life in the mountains, until he was approached by a mysterious man who asked him to help a woman who is missing her child.   Unfortunately, this woman was a witch and she wanted the child to be reborn.  After helping the young man, the two become a couple and then she tells him about her son, who was taken by his evil uncle.  She had gone to the castle to retrieve the child, but in the process she also learned about a terrible curse that could destroy the entire world.  When she returns to her home, she is confronted by the uncle, who attacks her.  The uncle is then revealed to be the demon who had kidnapped her son from her womb, and this demon had also taken her husband from her. When she fought back, her son returned.  However, when they fought, the uncle stabbed the baby through the neck with a poisoned arrow.  I've never seen anything like this movie.  Even though it's a western, the look and feel of this film is much more like a horror film.  In one sequence, the witch brings a man to the hospital to examine his throat.  Apparently this man's wife was a sorceress and the son was her "child", which was how the witch learned about him.  This was the moment when the film really got going.  As the uncle kills the woman, she turns to look at her son.    He had been murdered before his mother could save him and the woman mourns over his death.  Then the uncle comes into the room, and he is revealed to have been a ghost, the spirit of the woman who had killed the son.   Then he says a word and, well, it's just not good.   After the uncle dies, the mother goes into a rage and kills the uncle's spirit.  A few minutes later, the man she had been helping arrives with the dead uncle's child.   She tells him that he must help her find the child because her son was kidnapped by a witch.   The Witch  The boy was a good boy, and all she wanted was a happy future.  His father died in a car crash, so his mother had taken care of the child. When the witch kidnapped the boy, the woman saw how she was unable to protect him, so she
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A positive review is the single most powerful tool a film critic has for influencing an audience.     Positive reviews are the best way to market a film, to ensure that audiences go see it.  They are also the best method of building momentum and of getting the most from your marketing dollars.  These are some common mistakes people make.  The first mistake is when a positive movie is advertised as a "must see" movie because it's good, despite its faults.  You need to remember that the movie's audience is only going to go see the bad version of the film.  I'm sure if you were marketing a really well-made horror movie to a mainstream audience, you'd be careful not to label it "scary."  It's far more likely that they'll be horrified by it because the movie isn't scary enough.  To market a horror movie, you need a truly scary premise.  Something that would frighten the crap out of the people in your audience. To market an "action movie" it is best to avoid scary plot points.  This is the same thing you should avoid with horror movies. The second mistake that a critic does is to ignore a good story.  If you tell a story that isn't great, you can always just add another "good" story to give the viewer an even better experience.  A good movie has to be at least a little terrifying. A bad movie has some really great horror elements, but no good reason to keep watching it. I can't tell you how many people have told me that I suck at reviewing movies.  Sometimes this is because I don't know what to talk about.  Other times it's because I simply am a horrible critic.  Of course, a good reviewer doesn't look at a movie and say "Holy shit that's just too scary!"  If it is, it is probably not a good film. It takes a good critic to realize a film is not scary.  And it doesn't take a great reviewer to realize that an average movie has a bad plot and no story.    I think the problem is that the critic doesn't really care about a movie, they only care about the rating.  It can be a real bummer to watch a movie you loved because it was bad.  The critic will usually give a rating of "5."  The rating is often based on the average rating of other critics, and
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I've always had an insatiable curiosity about the things that go bump in the night, and as I grew up I realized that some of them are far stranger than science fiction. The original Frankenstein movie has always had the largest impact on me because it took my fascination with science fiction and made it seem realistic. The film's most memorable scene takes place right after the monster is defeated and the scientist, with the help of some of the townspeople, begins the work of saving the victims from the monster's deadly claws."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What makes a movie good?   If you want to tell me what a movie is good about, it's probably not something I've thought about before.   "Good" is a hard word for me to use.  But, it works with this movie.  A movie needs to have good characters, to have a lot of heart, and to be funny.  The first thing I can say is that the cast is good.  I'm a bit of a sucker for big cast films that have a good cast, and this one is no exception.  There's a lot going on in this movie and you'll be entertained by some pretty great jokes.  For some reason though, I liked the main character more.  Like I said before, I love funny men, but when they're not funny men and I'm the one laughing, I get pretty pissed.  So, the character that I liked best was the guy who was going to get kidnapped.  This guy is a total goofball, and I really like him.  It seemed like he was doing everything for no reason.  You know, I didn't think there were a lot to like about this movie, but I still managed to enjoy it.  One thing I really liked was the sound effects.  Not only are they catchy, but they get you going and it makes the movie that much better.  Even the "coughing" part at the beginning gets old after a while.  Maybe I just needed a laugh, but it was good to see some action on the movie.   It's not that I hated the movie, it was just that I just didn't enjoy it as much as I would like to.  On the positive side, it did have good special effects, so if you have a bit more money than I do, then I think this is a good action movie. How is your day going so far?   The day is pretty busy, so I figured I'd write about something to give you a change of pace.  My family and I spent the afternoon watching some of the TV shows my sister and I watch, which was really cool.  Most of the shows on my DVR didn't air for a few days, so it was nice to see how the new shows were going.  Before that, my dad picked me up for some bowling at The Pines (I'm not kidding) and then we went to visit my
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is fun.   I liked it a lot.  The main story line is fairly decent.  I will go with that.  There's a few things that need attention, though.  In the final film, we will see a lot of the same characters again.  We'll get to see a few new characters.  It would be a good idea to show a bit more of the backstory of the various characters, rather than having the characters all talk about themselves.  That said, I still enjoyed the film.  Overall, I thought it was a good film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If it was a hit movie, that's okay. If it wasn't a hit or just failed, that is a problem.   In the case of "Furious 7," the movie had no success whatsoever, and was never really intended to be a movie to be shown at all. A lot of people thought it might be a good idea to make it, especially after the success of the Fast and Furious franchise. But the people behind the movie didn't want to pay the big bucks for it. They wanted to just sell it to the highest bidder, because it wasn''t going to do any real business. They had no intention of making any money from it. It''s hard to find a quote about this movie that isn''t written about the failure of the film:  "We don''t want to be in the movie business," says producer Albie Sachs. "We want to make movies that make people happy. They''re not about making millions of dollars."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    1/5   I feel like this film just didn't want to be a movie. It was so bad that there was nothing to talk about, and not just that, the acting was awful. You see, the film has this "happens once" thing going with it, but the audience is always treated like it happened twice. You know, the movie would tell you that something like this could happen in a certain city, but it would just turn into a scene from a bad reality show. It would be like the scene where there are just too many people in a bar. When all of a sudden one person suddenly decides to come out of the bathroom. I mean, what does this mean? Is this scene from the bad show just going to get repeated? Are there any other shows out there with so many people? Do I even need to say any more?  Yeah, no. You'd rather be the bartender in a bad show. You're going to be all over the place and have a lot of people laughing at your expense. There is another scene that you've seen before, a girl with the wrong idea of a date. We're shown a picture of her (from another show) that she likes to dress up in. But in the end she still decides to take off her clothes. And the camera zooms in on her body as she is stripping to reveal nothing but a pair of white panties. "Wanna see what I look like in panties?" You bet your sweet ass. Another scene is where we find out that there is a new woman on the scene (the "new" girl). But she seems to be just as bad as the first one. In fact, she acts like a total idiot and doesn't even know what she's supposed to do (she just tells the guys what to do). You know what? There are so many stupid scenes in this film. I could talk about them all day and not stop for hours. But I can't do that because I have to give my review to this movie. So here we go. The movie is about the characters "The Stork." We meet him in a club and it turns out he is a very good looking guy. He has a lot going for him. He's well built, athletic, has a great body and has lots of money. And yet, all of his life he's been the victim of horrible
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Mummy (1999) I just bought this from my local theater after the trailers had come out. I was very pleasantly surprised at what a wonderful film it is. I saw the trailer, I read the synopsis and, even though it was released in 1999, I was totally in it. I love the fact that the original screenplay and story by Jon Spaihts is based on the actual life of the mummy that was discovered in the Sahara Desert. The film is really quite a nice blend of action, adventure, suspense and romance.   This movie was produced by the legendary Sam Raimi, who was the guy behind the horror film "Scream" which was pretty great, so I had to go out and see him again.  This is a must see film for horror fans and is absolutely beautiful to look at. The action scenes in this film are really great. The creature effects and monsters are great and are scary as hell.  The movie looks really good. The only complaint I have is that the ending of the film doesn't do anything in terms of leaving a good impression, the movie should have ended a bit earlier because it does end before the final fight, but, there was no way to avoid it.  I hope to see more Sam Ransi films in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love my new favorite movie: the remake of A Christmas Story. A Christmas Movie is not quite as good as the original, but it is one of my favorites. It is not perfect, but still one of the best movies ever made. It's like a little slice of the childhood I never had. It captures the feeling that you felt watching the movie and it's something that I will never forget. My favorite scenes are when the kids get all excited because the Christmas tree has been decorated and then they go on a big adventure with Santa. That's the best part, but the whole movie is great. This is a movie that should not only be seen by Christmas lovers, but everyone. It should be seen at Christmas, but also when the sun comes out, and when all your neighbors watch it too. The only problem is that this movie was released after Christmas and I don't think a lot of people are aware of it. I hope it gets a re-release. It could be a masterpiece. I know some people have a problem with the ending, but to me, it is a beautiful and beautiful ending.  So... I think I'd like to know what you think. Do you remember the movie when you were a child? Did it have any effect on your childhood?   This article was first published in 2013.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is not perfect but it is definitely worth your time. It was a good watch and is worth watching even if you don't want to go back and see every episode. The plot isn't complicated but you have to pay attention at times.   If you enjoy shows that are not super deep with multiple plotlines and have a plot twist in the last episode then this one is for you.  This series has some good episodes, especially the last and the last few. The show really develops and develops well but some episodes feel a little too rushed. I recommend that you stick with it at least until the last couple of episodes because the last ones are good.  My Rating : 6 out of 10 The movie and the series are both a good time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I have never heard of the film, which was filmed in 1977, but it seems very well put together."  "There are some scenes where the film is actually funny but the humor is not as strong as it could have been. I thought the film was great and it should be on the big screen. I would recommend it to any movie lovers." "The film is very well done." This is a picture that has got to be shown on a movie screen. The action is intense and the story is simple and enjoyable. This is a nice blend of comedy and action. This movie is a favorite of mine and one I've wanted to see on a screen for a long time. As a kid I loved the classic sci-fi TV series Star Trek and now with this film I can watch these two series in one film. I'm definitely happy that this is finally happening. I can't wait to see the film at the Cinema Royale in downtown Miami. I will certainly be picking this up to see at the IMAX on opening weekend.   - - - -  Kai Hansen, M.Ed  I'm a lifelong fan of Star Trek. This film seems to make a very good case for showing the films on an IMAX screen in my view. The only complaints I have are with the film as a whole. The ending of the movie seems a little rushed and the script in some parts doesn't seem as cohesive as it should. I'll admit that I also like Star Wars and think that there is an opportunity here to bring these worlds to life. But I'm a real fan of the original series and want to see this film as an homage to what they already have done, and I can only hope that it's handled with the care and attention to detail that these great movies deserve. A great addition to the Star Trek film series.  - – - -

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's a lot more than a little in a bad movie. There's the kind of negative energy, too, that we all get. When people are giving you crap, there's the chance that it will hit you hard, and when it does, it can be damaging. I try to stay away from that kind of stuff.  I don't really think people really realize how bad a movie is until it's finished. It takes the same kind of energy and emotional weight to film a movie as it would do to read a novel.   I've had people say to me, "I've never heard a film have a sense of urgency about it before." And I'm like, "What are you talking about?"   I don't like saying bad movies are bad. But they are, especially if they are poorly made.  If you have anything to say about it, feel free to send me e-mails or comments, though. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Room:  This film is definitely not a masterpiece. However, I really liked it. It is the second time I watched this movie since the original release. However it is not as memorable as the first.   It is really funny. The dialogue is hilarious.  It is not very scary but it is very funny.  This movie had a really good soundtrack.  It has a haunting soundtrack that is very appropriate for a horror film.  Some of the songs are just awesome, like 'I'm Not A Robot' from Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon.  'The Room' is also a good soundtrack album.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my favorite directors is Martin Scorsese, a man of profound generosity and a brilliant cinematic mind. His films, while often bleak and dark, are also frequently hilarious and heart-rending.   I was delighted to see this documentary about ScorsESE, as his career is well-documented and he is a dear friend of mine.  To see his brilliance on display is nothing short of exhilarating.  The film was a revelation.  What a joy to have an intimate look at one of the greatest living directors, one of my all-time favorite movies.  It's amazing to see how a film's story and dialogue, and the people involved in them, can affect our lives and how our world reacts to a work of art.  There are so many anecdotes to be picked apart in this film:  When ScorsESy came to the United States to make his first film, he met the "Godfather of New York" Don Gummer.  Gummer had a profound effect on the filmmaker, helping to shape his sense of the city's history, and shaping his filmmaking style.  When Gummer discovered that ScorsSE was a child of Jewish immigrants, he was struck by the filmmaker's ability to deal with the Holocaust.  ScorsIESE is the man who was tasked with filming "Night and Fog," a controversial scene from the "Papillon" that had been banned from the Academy Awards.  His dedication to making a true documentary is undeniable.  Another fascinating aspect of the film is how ScorsIII, who was born a German Jew, overcame the stigma of being Jewish in order to become a filmmaker.  I couldn't have picked a more perfect person to tell this story than ScorsIIIII.  He is the real McCoy  I have watched the film several times and I can't stop thinking about it.  In particular, when ScorsIESey came to visit his brother in New York, he is the guy who showed up, even though he was barely legal, with his parents and brother to pick up his sister-in-law.  He was the one who found out about the family heirloom.  One day, ScorsIEy was talking to his brother about the film he was making in New Jersey and his brother said, "We should make a film about the man from Staten Island who was just deported and never came back."   Scorsie's eyes got
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In this review, I'll show how I like a movie. In this movie, I don't think it is about a story, but about a life (and death, because it's a film about a film).   First of all, the film is not about a real person, it's not about an actor, director or even the author. The film shows how a man named Alex is affected by an assassination attempt. What the film shows, how Alex changes and how he will never be the same, it is not a movie, but a life. The book The Act of Killing, by Errol Morris, is about the same story, I think it's just that the book was not written in a realistic way. For me, the movie does not show the details of the murder, only the character of Alex's. It is a documentary. The movie is very powerful.   It's a great film about human nature, and the nature of our humanity.  The movie starts with Alex being taken away from his family and his friends, because he is being charged with a crime he did not commit. Alex and the men working for him believe that if they kill the man who killed the American journalist, Alex will not go to prison. It's not a question of if they will get away with it, but when. And the men take precautions: they put poison in the drink of Alex, and they send him to the house of the man whose wife has just given birth to a baby boy, so that the son will be murdered by the newborn. They put Alex in a hotel where, according to Alex's character, he will be raped and tortured. After the killing, Alex is sent to the hospital to recover from his torture, and then to prison in the same prison where the man's wife gave birth to the boy.  And that's the beginning of the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. It has a great plot with some amazing acting, great visuals, and a well-paced plot. The only downside is that the actors are so bad that it just breaks the mood. They were so bad in the first half that they just stood out and didn't even look like actors.   It's a shame that I have to wait another year for a sequel since the director of this movie, David Cronenberg, passed away. I don't know if it was his work, or the fact that he had a great body of work before this, or even the fact he died in 2003, but this movie really gets lost in the shadow of other great films. This movie may not be the greatest of David Cronenberys films, but it's still an excellent film and well worth the wait.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was a pretty long time ago when I first got hooked on a film. And now, with that film being the first ever installment of the Indiana Jones franchise, it has been a while since I got back into the film series, but I do want to share the review I have for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.   I was not a fan of the first installment, but now it's time to see what all the hype was about.  The first few minutes in the film were not a lot of good things, but then again it's a little movie after all. The script is not very interesting at all, and there are a couple of awkward moments, like when Indy is being interrogated by his father and his son by the guard.  They are both great scenes, but one is just too weird, and the other is just way too far from the original film.  In the end, the film has a lot going for it, and does a great job of giving the audience what they want.  Indy and Marion are doing great things on their own, and it's nice to see that Indy is finally finding his place as a hero.  I also really liked Marion, and I believe she gets a pretty decent role, and we get to see her being the most independent heroine the Indiana franchise has ever seen.  All this is to say, if you loved the first Indiana Jones film, you will probably like this one as well.  It is definitely one of my favorite Indiana Jones films.  And even though I thought this movie was weird, I'm happy I watched it anyway because I do believe in the franchise.  But I do have to say I was hoping for more from this film. But if this was all I had watched so far, I would have probably given it a "B".  I enjoyed the film a lot, and will probably continue to watch it, but don't expect anything crazy in this film from me.  I enjoyed Indiana Jones & The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull and it was definitely worth watching.  However, this was not all it was hyped up to be, and if you haven't seen it yet, I recommend doing so before reading this review.  My rating:  3.5/5 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If there is any more "cinema" in this movie, I haven't seen anything yet! "The Magnificent Seven" is an action movie in which we meet the seven men who save the town of Marfa from a group of seven bandits.   The movie started out great, and then suddenly it was a disappointment. The dialogue was too bad to say anything more about it. In the first movie the group of men had been promised an easy life.  They are now being forced to work on a plantation with no food and no water.  The plot starts out great:   In the town there are seven bandits who have stolen money from an elderly couple and are planning to rape their woman.  The young men, led by a guy with a mustache, meet up and join up with another group of four men and one girl.  All of the seven characters have their own reason for being on this "journey".    They have a common enemy who is trying to kill them all.  One of the young men who had been working on the plantation for a long time is dying of starvation. The other men are being constantly cheated and cheated by the bandits. The story follows the same arc as many "action" movies.  After the group has been separated from the others, they go into the mountains and get some guns and ammo.  These young men get a chance to see what it's like to be a hero and they are more than willing to take advantage of it. The action is real and fast paced.  It's a great plot twist, but the movie is not the greatest in the world. There are some scenes where the characters are on the same horse.  I think that it's a good idea for the action to be in a town, but they are surrounded by mountains and it's hard to see anything.    It's good enough to get an action action movie out of your system.    The characters are nice.  We are shown that each character is in love with someone else and that some of them have had relationships before, but nothing really important.  Then it comes down to the final confrontation.  Each of the characters have a good reason to kill their foes.  This is what they had been told.  It's not a very good movie.  A few more weeks and it might be more enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I loved this movie. I'm surprised it hasn't gotten more attention for being so good"  F.W. Murnau's The Last of the Mohicans "The Last of The Mohicans " is one of the best films of the silent era. I loved it so much I had a poster of it made, and the movie actually is even better on DVD, as it's been re-mastered. But I love this film so much, I'm still going to watch it more than once in a lifetime!   One of my all time favorites.   It's a little slow but it's still great.  "   "I loved the movie and it really holds up to the standards of the time. I had to go back to the beginning again to catch what had happened and I didn't understand it until the second time I watched it."    I had not seen this before in my life.  I loved it and I would recommend it to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A great little adventure story that shows what happens when the worst guys win. Not for the squeamish, but if you do like your movies more PG-13 than you should, you won't want to miss this one.   I have a lot of respect for filmmakers who can make a movie with a good story and characters.  A very good one at that.  I know a lot more about what happens in these kinds of films than I should and they really make me appreciate them.  The villain is really just a really good villain.  He is so over the top and so evil that he makes a lot other villains seem like child's play.  This is a movie about a family trying to take their family back.   It is about a father trying to keep his family together.    It deals with issues that are very serious, but it never lets them get in the way of what it wants to say.   So when you get into a big movie like this, don't expect a happy ending.  Be prepared for some very dark parts.  They get pretty dark by the end, but that is no bad thing. I think that everyone who sees this movie will leave feeling as if they have been in a movie like that.   I really hope that they make more of these kinds films, because these kind of movies have the ability to make anyone feel a little bit like a hero.    Rating: B
Write a positive review about a good movie:   (Don't make a movie about that movie! Make a movie for that movie!)  (Don't say that you saw a good one; make a film that makes a good film about that one!)  a good book:    (Don' t say that it was bad, make a good story about it!) In other words, if you are a film maker, you have to look for something new in order to make a successful movie, and if you look for anything new then you will have nothing to lose. When I first started making films I wanted to do something different. I wanted a new genre. But after a while of making films my movies were mostly the same, only with different plots and different names. I didn't know what the hell I was doing and I could hardly understand what my film makers wanted from me. In my mind I was like "what is this? What is the point of this? Why am I here?" So I quit my first film making company and started my own company, where I started a movie in the middle of the night with one of my colleagues and we filmed it right away. It turned out to be the most boring movie ever made. But I think that the movie made a lot of people laugh. And that was enough for me to get the idea of what I needed to do. If you want to make something interesting you have only to watch a couple of hours of TV shows and films every day. This is what makes a lot films interesting. It's because there are a lot more films than people know about. They are not made for a wider audience. It is very important for a film to be interesting. If it isn't interesting then no one will want to watch it. So don't try to do anything that isn't fun. Make a good script and the best actors you can get in your movie. And if you want something even better than that then go and watch a lot TV shows, because there you are guaranteed to find something interesting. But don't go to TV shows just for the sake of watching TV shows. You don't have to do it for the money. In TV shows you can make more money than you can in a film. But the thing is that in a TV show there is an audience. And an audience is a group of people who are willing to pay for what you are going to do, they are the most important thing. And when you can guarantee an audience

I have not seen any of these movies in the theater yet and I was able to come and see this great movie in it's cinema with great reviews from my friends.    5 out of 5 The Good and the Bad I enjoyed it very much. I enjoyed the story that was told about the lives of the characters. I also liked the costumes that were used in the movie. I especially liked how they were able to create a realistic look for the characters in the story.  The Verdict:  I found this to be a very fun movie to watch. This movie is a must see for any fan of horror. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What did I expect when I chose to write a film review for a movie that I'd seen three times and then to watch it for the first time a month later? That it would be as good as it looks in trailers? No. I wasn't expecting any of that. I was expecting a film that could only be described as "boring" or a film in which the director took out all of the fun parts in order to keep the movie from getting a laugh. I expected the film to be an absolute slog. But when I finally sat down and looked at it, I realized what a spectacular movie it really is.   My rating:  The film's only flaw is a flaw that happens to be a really stupid one. I understand why the director was hesitant to let this film be made. After all, he is in his first year of filmmaking and this movie had to be one of his big break-outs. In my opinion, the director does a great job with this first part. His cinematography and the acting of all the actors and actresses is outstanding. I found the film in a unique way. It's like when you are watching a movie and the actor says something to you that he didn't mean. Then the character says something that he probably does mean and you both get a little chuckle. But then the actor goes back to the scene and starts talking again. You see what I mean.  All the main characters have a very natural chemistry with each other. It was very difficult for me to see a movie like this because I was so bored and I couldn't help but watch it because I found something funny when the character said something that I didn't find funny. But the actors in this movie never lost a sense of humor. They have a really nice chemistry and the movie flowed well. When I finally stopped watching it for a few minutes to go take a shower, I didn 't see any of the characters die or have any sort of traumatic experience. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The Good" is a story about a little girl who can tell the future. When she discovers her parents aren't what they seem she learns they are really aliens who had a "good" life on Earth before they landed on a distant planet. There they found a beautiful world they called Earth, and in their search for the key to unlock it they came across a little boy who just happened to be the child of the parents they were searching for. Now all the parents want is for the boy to join the other alien children in the spaceship that will lead them home. While the alien children are happy to be reunited with their families, the little girl is desperate to know what happened to her parents, who were never found and who are supposed to be in a safe and peaceful environment with their son. However, one day the boy starts to believe in the other children. Why would anyone believe in a "gods" place as opposed to a place like Earth? Is it just a game for the aliens? It may not be. The aliens are in a terrible predicament: they have come to Earth to get home, but they have failed. All of the aliens who tried to get on the spaceship have been returned to their home world. The little girl was on the same planet as them, but her parents never came home and are presumed dead. But when the boy finds the key that can open the door to Earth, they can finally get back home and start the long journey home to their family. The movie has an original and emotional story and a beautiful style. And although the story is hard to follow, the film does give us a lot of closure. A very well done movie! The Movie is well worth watching. The director has a great eye for color and an innovative and entertaining style, making this a great action/adventure/science fiction movie. If you are a child or just curious, you'll find a lot to enjoy.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "One of the best films of the year and one of the most unique and inventive. The idea was brilliant. The execution was not. But that's what makes a great film; it doesn't matter how the story ends, it's the journey, and the journey takes you somewhere very special." - Tom De Vito, MovieGuide.com  It's about a group of high-tech mercenaries who are hired to take out the last remaining enemy of humanity: the robot. It is not a very nice movie, and many of the action scenes were so violent, so over-the-top, that they made me want to throw up. It was a film full of humor (and a bit of self-parody) and some very moving moments, and I think it's a great example of how to do a science-fiction film well. I was impressed that the story was told from three separate points of view (the three main characters in the film). One of the coolest things about this film is that you get the feeling that you're watching something that is completely made up on the spot, and it's all happening in a split second. It's like watching a surreal dream that you can't control, but you can see where the characters are going, and where they're going is not where you thought they'd go. There were so many plot points that weren't explained to the audience that the whole movie just feels totally arbitrary to me. There is a lot of humor in the movie, but there was also some very dark moments. The film has a great sense of humor, but the whole thing just feels a bit too crazy and off-kilter. I still can't believe that there were three characters in this film, it just feels so insane. I do like the way the film ends (it's a movie that does a pretty cool thing with time travel), and I'm glad that it is a sci-fi movie that tries to get a little bit darker (the ending actually makes sense, even though it's an alternate ending), but it is way too crazy for me. If you're an action movie fan, you can probably find something here that you like. It might not be a great movie, it might be very weird, but it was great fun and a lot different than what you're used to from sci-Fi films. If I were a little younger I would have loved to have seen this film as a kid,
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie doesn't need much to be good, and The Great Muppet Caper   is an example of what makes a great film. The film opens with an old man, played by the great James Earl Jones, who is walking down a street and asks a little girl named Judy what she wants to do for a dollar. She asks him what he wants to be. He tells her what he likes. She says she loves to be a veterinarian. The two meet and the old man gets a job at the veterinary clinic where she works. Judy says that she loves the animals and she would love to be an animal lady. The old man asks her to take him to the zoo where he can show her a tiger and a lion. Judy doesn't want to be "a zoo lady" because she's not ready to breed a new tiger. He is willing to take her to the tiger house where he is going to show her what a tiger is. Judy is excited when she sees the tigers and the two get into a fight. The tiger is hurt badly and the lion, who had a crush on Judy, tries to kill her. The big cats come and save her, but then it is too late. The lion gets Judy to the animal hospital where she finds out that the tiger had a baby. In the meantime, a group of circus performers have a party at the zoo and it is revealed that the new tiger has killed his mother and the little baby that he had. Judy wants to help the circus but the big cats aren't going to let her. She manages to get in a car with a circus performer named "The Muppet" (Peter Sellers). When he gets to the hotel, The Muppet shows her a newspaper with a picture of a tiger on it and she asks him if it's real. The Muppets discover a group from the circus who is coming to get the baby that the big tigers have killed. Judy sees this, she asks what they are up to and they don't tell her. So, they go and help the Circus people get rid of the baby. When they arrive at the tiger farm, they find the baby is missing and they head to the Tiger house where the baby has been. They talk to the mother and when they try to get him to stay with her, he runs out into the jungle. The mother's death has upset the tigers, but they are willing to fight for their baby. They don't
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Force Awakens" was a great movie with lots of memorable moments.   It gave us Han Solo and Chewbacca's baby, which was a cute moment.  Star Wars is known for its special effects, which are amazing in the new movies.  But the special effects are just as important as the good action scenes, so this movie has a lot of them.  The movie was a real crowd-pleaser from the first few minutes and will stay in your mind for hours.  This is a great time to be a Star Wars fan and to start watching the movies.   But if you don't like sci-fi action movies, don't go to the theater.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Happens to me often. I'll say it was worth watching and I don't think this is a good film"  - John Travolta.   So how is this film any good? I am of course referring to the original 1979 version of Blade Runner, in which Harrison Ford plays the eponymous protagonist, a detective who travels through time and space in search of the origins of his own identity. The story is told via a series of vignettes which are intercut with a series in which Ford is played by the talented Rutger Hauer (who did a fine job for a change) as a detective. Hauer's character, Rick Deckard, has no real name but takes on an identity when his life is threatened and he has to escape in a time machine. He is a man with a long memory who has seen all the most horrifying moments of his existence: the destruction of a city, the murder of a friend, the death of his sister. He never stops being human. Härjemaa! (This means "Hang in there") is a film about how man's identity, identity of his mind, is inextricably linked to his physical body. For the viewer it is also a movie about life and death. There are plenty of deaths, but they are not really deaths of course. There is a lot of death in this film. But not just any death - Häring's death which occurs during the time travel sequence. The way it happens in this scene is so brutal and effective that it makes you understand why Deckard is so determined to get back to his home time. So Härrjemäkko's death is not the kind of death you expect in a sci-fi movie. There's some violence (a bit too much in some scenes), but you don't expect such a powerful and graphic scene. Hørj emaa! is a powerful, disturbing film, a great horror film in the best sense. It is also one of the few films I can watch again and again without getting bored or having any feelings of regret. And if the director Denis Villeneuve decided to take the original version and turn it into a movie, he did a great job.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's like that scene in Jurassic Park when a raptor eats the little dinosaur it's chewing on. It's the closest we'll ever get to seeing a dinosaur get eaten by a raptorex.    A lot of people will tell you that we've never had a true "classic" dinosaur movie and I would disagree with that statement.  The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a classic in a movie world that is overrun with "new" movies.  This film is the true beginning of the dinosaur movies and it's still great today.  You really get a feel for how the world of dinosaur movies came about.  The Lost World (TM) is the first ever true "science fiction" movie.  It is full of the sci-fi and monster movie tropes and it plays them like a violin.  In my opinion, it's the best movie about dinosaurs that has been made.  I mean, who makes better films about dinosaurs than Steven Spielberg.  But even I can't deny that it has its flaws, because it's not exactly a perfect movie. If you are a fan of "science" movies, the first Jurassic Park (TM), will not leave you feeling impressed.  For the film to be as great as it is, it would have to be 100% accurate.  As much as we would like to think that dinosaurs were a lot like us and we were in touch with them, the truth is, we are nowhere near that level of intelligence.  There are no signs of our past in the Lost World.  No traces of any living creatures.  Even when we see an actual dinosaur, we don't know its name or species.  We have to guess at it because we don t really know what it is.  While it has the basic elements that would be used to create a dinosaur film, it does not have a solid foundation to make it work.  Also, it is not a good story.   The movie opens with a scene of a man on a horse and man on horseback on the shores of a desert looking for dinosaur tracks.  On this first day, they find one large track that appears to be a track of a dinosaur.  What a waste!  They set off in search of more tracks and find a couple others.  These tracks are smaller than the ones on the first day.  Then, a T-Rex appears and it looks like it's about

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The trailer looks very cool and I really want to see it!    I'm excited about this movie because it stars Ryan Reynolds (Superman Returns, The Black Hole).   This is a superhero movie and I haven't seen any superhero movies yet and I think it's great.   The characters are very believable and their powers are interesting.   I think they're all likable, even the villain.  It's a little slow-paced at times but I think that's good because you get to learn more about the people involved in the situation.  I really enjoyed the characters and I like that there's a variety of characters to watch, even if they don't all get a lot of screen time.  The cast does a good job in what they're given.  There's some good acting, but the one or two actors who really stand out are Jeff Bridges and Russell Crowe. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You'll notice that I am not telling you what to think about a movie. That's because there are many things I haven't seen yet, and if I did, I'd just write a negative review. But I know people want to see these movies, and even though this review might be somewhat subjective, you should still watch it. A couple of quick things: * The movie is in 3D. I have seen some horror movies where you're supposed to just sit and look at the screen, but in this movie, you have to actually sit up and look up. It's really cool to see it from this angle. There's a lot of weird, creepy, and awesome things going on in this film. Some of it is just in the background, but some of it's right in front of you. * The soundtrack is cool. I am a fan of old school horror, so I really liked this soundtrack. It is so creepy and eerie, and it has a nice creepy ambience. * Some of the characters have crazy and awesome names.   For example, this one:  The movie also features a bunch of characters that are kind of odd. Some are good, some are not. Some seem really creepy, some seem like they are just really fun to talk to. Some have cool voices, some have really scary voices. It really depends on the character. Some look cool, some don't. Some people are funny, some people are weird. And of course there are some of those people you only see on the screen. It has a lot to do with which one you like, but you'll definitely see it in this one. If you like the movie, then you'll also want to check out the novel (I will be reviewing the movie on my blog later this week). It's also pretty good, and I have heard some good things about the movie from people who have seen it.  Posted by Mike P. at 5:47 AM
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie has a lot of heart in it. The way it is filmed is amazing, the storyline is very interesting, the acting is fantastic, and most of all the music. The lyrics for each song have very strong messages, and the way the film is written and shot makes it that much more effective. The story itself is very well written and it does a great job at keeping the listener interested in what's going on.   The acting in this film is outstanding as well. I've never heard a more touching, heartfelt, funny and tear-jerking story than this one. I just wish that the actors were bigger, not that it makes a difference because they have good chemistry with the others. Overall:    I really enjoyed this movie. It's got a lot going for it and I do hope that we get a sequel. The cast did a very good job and you can tell that they were all passionate about what they were doing.  It has a bit of a story, but that's what makes it so very interesting. It has great acting, wonderful music, and very good visuals. This movie really works and you should watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm going to be honest here.   This movie had nothing to do with horror.  Sure, there was a lot of gore, and it was an early horror movie, but it had none of that genre's most memorable moments.  In my opinion, the greatest thing about this movie is how good the writing was.  The movie wasn't all that scary, and there were a lot more suspenseful scenes than those typical of the time period.  I'd say it wasn't even a true horror film, because there was very little blood.  It's funny how one of the first movies I ever watched in the late 80s, "The Silence of the Lambs", was about a serial killer, yet "The Exorcist" had a little more blood. The movie was directed by Tobe Hooper, who is most known for "Halloween" and the classic "Beverly Hills Cop".  The "Exorcist":   It may have been an early Tobe film, but the one thing I was able to find from this movie was a good performance by the great Robert Forster.  Forster had a role in all three "Hollow Man" movies.  He was only able to be in this one because of his character's death.  This isn't a movie that I recommend for a scaredy-cat horror fan.  However, it's one of those movies where the director really put his heart and soul into it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The opening and last scenes of the movie have many fans and many of them want to know how will the main character, Tomoko, will survive this hellhole?   (And the answer is simple, she does and she can, her character is well done and it is great.   )   Tomoko is a simple Japanese girl who goes into the city and meets a girl she likes. They get together, they fall in love and he leaves her. The only problem is that he has to go to the country, and they can't go because Tomoko's mother is a doctor.  She goes to a psychiatrist, who tries to convince her to stay in the country. The story is about their love, their troubles, and their survival. The ending is perfect.  (This is just one of the best movies ever made.  The music, the characters, the atmosphere and the plot are all top notch.)  This movie is the perfect mix of dark humor and pure melodrama. This is a good example of a movie that can do both very well. Tomoko isn't as innocent as she appears to be and she's a very strong character. I also like how the movie portrays how people with mental disorders live their lives, they face many problems but they always seem to come out on top.    I can only say that this is a must watch.  It's a classic and a must see.  My rating for this movie is 5 out of 5.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Thank you, I thought it was well made, with a good plot, and a good ending. The only bad thing was when they made a special effect of a woman falling in a pond (that's why my wife had to go with me to watch the movie). It was really annoying.   Then I realized I had a copy of the DVD in my possession and I rewatched it and was amazed that there was a special effects of a girl falling in the water...   I had to watch it again. I liked it.  The girl was made up so that she was only 1/3 the size of the guy, I had no problem with that.  I liked the movie.  The movie was good, and there's no way that it's an average horror movie. It was just that this movie is like one of those horror films that are on a movie network and you watch it after you've seen several of them, you realize that they were better films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The worst possible thing you can say about the movie was the acting. Even the best of them were nothing special.     They played the roles they were given and they acted poorly.  No one had any chemistry with anyone.    There was not even one real scene or interaction that was really memorable.  But what was really disappointing was the quality of the special effects. The most recent Superman film was one of the worst examples of special effects on the big screen.  It had no real emotion, no real humor, no action, no plot, no personality, no impact, not much excitement and no heart.  The only thing I liked about that film was that there was a bit of a happy ending.  In this film, everything is a disaster.  A movie that has been criticized for being a remake of a television show and being poorly made should have been turned down and made with an all new cast, new director, new production designer, new music, new lighting and everything else.  I wonder why Hollywood has such a hard time making movies that are good enough to warrant the big budgets Hollywood wants for them. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So in my original review I told how we go from a little girl looking for love with a nice guy to a pretty girl looking up to him after he gets the job.   The movie is so full of emotions and you can tell the girls feel hurt and betrayed. The ending was so heartbreaking and heartbreaking and you never get that sweet ending that they get.  And then you have the last two acts...   In my opinion this movie made me think about a lot of things that happened to me.  The last two act have no story so you have nothing to really connect with except the feeling you have when the ending came.  I loved this movie and you should too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Thank you for showing me these beautiful movies. My daughter is 5 and when I show her pictures, she's like "WTF is that???" Well, here are 5 movies she likes and she loves them all.    ...and so does my husband! The movies all have really amazing actors. My only problem with them all is they have bad sound tracks and are very difficult to watch with kids and adults. The characters and plot lines all have to be retold twice. However, I really enjoyed watching these movies and have seen them all a dozen or more times.  ...in fact, they are all very similar to each other.  The only reason they aren't 5 stars is because I thought they were very short. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    ( )  Bad Review :   ( ) It's just not that good:  I'm sorry, but this is absolutely awful. I don't care if you're not interested in sci-fi. I'm just not going to watch this. I mean, it's not that bad to watch, but I've seen far worse. I do not know if it is because I watched the trailer online, or if it's because I'm looking forward to see what the director will come up with. But either way, I can't say it looks good. And as for the story? I can think of a number of other sci-fis that are much better than this, so don't expect a good film.  It is worth noting that the movie was in pre-production a couple of months ago, so it's possible that the story was still being written, so the final product won't be as bad as some would imagine.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very nice, very touching and very important story, that's told very well.   The characters were very good, especially the woman, and their inner life and what it's like to be in a bad situation and to try to do the best you can, so it was very well done.  The film is interesting, but not a "good" one and I feel like it's hard to watch.  This is an important story and I hope that there are more stories like this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (Don't write anything negative.) This is a movie about a small town where a guy named Mr. Stump buys an old horse and uses a very large gun and goes on a big killing spree. So I'm not going to give a lot of details about this film because I don't want it to become an overly technical, technical movie with a bad ending. The good part is that I like movies that are actually good, and this is one. I'm going to have to go to the website to look up the rest of the film. I guess it's okay since I've seen the movie twice already, and it's a good way for the kids to learn about gun safety and how to safely handle guns. This is a good, fun movie that's for everyone. The story goes a little something like this: a guy comes into a small little town that doesn't want him there and he tries to win their hearts. The movie is very well made and the actors are all really good. The main character, Mr. Sump, is a sweet guy who seems like a good guy who is just misunderstood and doesn't really want to be here. We never really learn anything about his family, and he just seems so different from the others. He just seems a little more laid back and not so worried about how he's treated. It's really good that the director and actors decided to portray this town in a very innocent and very different kind of way. And even though the town seems to be a little run down, it is very beautiful, and very colorful. This movie is also a real good way to learn gun safety, how to handle and clean a gun, and how not to hurt someone with a gun. This movie is good for kids, it has lots of good fun scenes with plenty of action and a good story. I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars. Now that I've made my recommendation to you about the movie, here are a few pics of the movie:
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In the late 1950s and 1960s, a number of films in Japan were released that were deemed to be of a higher quality than their Western equivalents. This was most likely due to the fact that many of the films were made in the 50s and 60s by well known directors. I personally enjoyed watching these films and have enjoyed them to this day.    The following were all released in the 1970s and 1980s:  Fujishima Roshi: The Three Great Spiritual Masters   This is a good film if you enjoy the Western and Chinese mythology style of filmmaking. It features the great master, Roshi.  Shinsuke Sugiyama: The World of the Gods   A very special film that I have seen a number times. I find it quite a difficult film to find nowadays and so it is a nice find. Akira Kurosawa: Ikiru  This is a fascinating film in the sense that it is an extended essay on how Japan was conquered by China and that in the end Japan was forced to abandon its traditional culture in order to survive. It was Kurosawas first film and it shows the effect this was having on his country. It also features Kurosawan son Toshiro Mifune.   Shirokuroku: The Golden Lion  Another interesting film that focuses on the early years of Akira Kurosakawa. The film features many famous actors from his earlier films.  In summary, the films that I mentioned are excellent.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       The biggest problem with this movie is that it is trying too hard to be good at the same time. The music and the acting in the movie is just okay and the story just drags a bit. The movie is pretty good but not as good as some other movies that you can find on the site that were made after this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was a lot of fun and I really did enjoy it. The cinematography is awesome, and the story is great.   As I said, it's a little different from my usual style of horror but I enjoyed it.  My only complaint is that I wish there were some more scary characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you watch this movie   It's an action movie, so don't expect it to be realistic in that sense. This movie has a strong and interesting story, but it feels a little like a love story between a strong guy and a weak girl. If you are a woman, this movie is for you. If not, well, you'll have a nice story to watch on your own if you want. In this movie, the movie is very action based and not really focused on the characters. But if you are interested in something more like this, you can take a look at "Serenity", which is a "Space Opera" about a ship on a journey. The movie follows a good girl and an amazing guy, and if you love space operas, it will not disappoint.  (From:  "H.R." )  Here's a great movie to watch if you're interested in the Star Trek universe:  The Star Trek "Mirror Universe" movie. It has its own story, and it can be enjoyed by fans of the TV series.  (From:   "K.A." ) Here are some interesting links to check out:  [1]  I've already mentioned Star Wars, so here are some others:  Star Wars The Force Awakens - A good movie to look at!  Star Trek - Another good movie, a lot of action, lots of funny scenes, and a pretty good story.  Star Treks "The Motion Picture" -  One of the best Star Trek movies, I'd recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie's not great by any means, but if you can take an old horror movie and reinterpret it as a good horror movie it's pretty much a win-win. The music, the lighting, the gore, and even the acting all work really well with the old movie and you don't have to do much to make it a good one.   If you're looking for a good slasher movie, don't go here. If you want to see a great horror movie where you get to see some of the best gore effects of all time and see all the horror elements brought together in one film, give it a go. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very good movie. The ending is a bit abrupt, but the rest of it is a good good movie for all of the family. It has lots of action and great comedy. The story takes place in a world where most of the population has been converted to the Catholic religion, and the characters are Catholics living in a small town called Fortuna. This town was once a small village in Spain where everybody knew everybody else's name. However, a priest named Peter came up with a novel idea and converted the entire town to Christianity in one night. In the end, everybody becomes Christians and the story takes a different turn. You can find out more about the plot on IMDB.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I like this movie. It has great production value, and the cast plays off each other very well. One of the best things is that all the men don't get involved in the action--they just watch and react. I found a couple of other reviews saying that the sex scenes were not as good as they were in the others. I really enjoyed it.  Barry White--one of the more prominent actors in Hollywood. His wife is not in the movie, and they don't kiss--a great thing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw "Inception", I was completely unprepared for what I would be watching.   While the film has many flaws, the story and acting were at the top of its class.  The story is about two people who think they are experiencing visions in their heads, and when the real world fails to meet their expectations, they are sucked into a fictional universe where they must solve a mystery, outwit an unseen opponent and find a way to get home.  The story is pretty simple, yet well done.    It is a simple premise that is easily grasped, and the film does a good job at keeping the viewer on their toes.  We as the audience have no idea how the characters are reacting, and that gives the film a suspenseful feel that only happens when people have a mental illness.  Although the actors do their best to bring their characters to life, this is where the film gets more impressive.  Every character is a character in a movie of their own, and each and every character seems to have an interesting motivation and reason for doing what they are doing.     "Inceptive" has it's share of faults, but they do not detract from the film's good moments.  In "Invention", Tom Cruise is fantastic as Jack Bauer.  Cruise portrays a world where people are constantly trying to catch up with their fantasies, and as he is caught up in his own illusion, he feels even worse about himself and how he has changed.  It's very hard to watch, and to know that someone you respect so much is doing such a disservice to the people that he is trying to protect.   "Incept" is one of those films where you just want to stop and enjoy the characters.  Each and every one of them is likable, and it's really heartwarming to watch Tom Cruise do this.  Unfortunately, the movie has some of the same issues as "Injection," in the sense that the movie takes a while to get started and the story doesn't seem to progress much.   I don't mind the fact that "Inceptor" is a somewhat slow movie; it gives the viewer enough time to get to know the characters and how they react.  However, there is no need to spend a lot of time on a slow movie.  After all, it is only a movie.   If the movie had been a lot faster, it would have really hampered the story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A  great  film, which I like  .   Rating :   ★★★★★ - A really good film (I do not own this movie. I have never seen it. I do not know anyone who has.) A man, who has been trying to find out about his wife's death, gets a job working for a small group of people who want to find a place to stay in the mountains. He has to travel to the mountain and work on the mountain until the job is finished. After he is out of danger, he is met by a beautiful woman and together they try to make their way to the hotel in the wilderness.  (This movie is about a man who travels to the mountains, only to be trapped and be killed by bandits. The film starts with a climatic scene. Then it goes into a dream sequence. The movie is more about the man's journey, and how his dreams and fears are in conflict with his desire to find his wife. There is also a really nice scene of a couple of women having a dinner party. The entire movie is a bit creepy. The ending is pretty good.)
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like it if it made you smile    Like it if you got a kick out of it, because it is not so much an action-adventure flick, but it has enough action in it to entertain, and more importantly to leave you in stitches, with more laughs than the "hero" ever had.  I found this to be one of the more original "dark" (or "dark-hearted") movies of the year. The plot is not that complex, just a typical buddy-cop tale with plenty of laughs and the occasional sad moment. The best part of it is that it has a strong female lead who is strong and interesting, with her own character, and a great scene where we see her with a guy in a bar after the cops had shot him to death. He then had to be taken care of in a "maternity" hospital, and she got into an argument with her brother, who then beat her to the point that she couldn't walk anymore. She later found out that she was pregnant with his child, and that's what the movie is about. I think there were a few unnecessary scenes here and there, and some characters that were not as "dark and twisted" as they could have been. But it's a very funny movie that you'll definitely enjoy watching. I just hope you'll give it a second or two to get used to it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Watch this movie. It is an outstanding piece of storytelling and a fascinating look at an ancient religion. It could be a great film if it was made by some talented director. Instead, the film is made by an artless filmmaker. If you want to know more about this movie, please refer to my review, which goes into much more detail about the film's plot, characters, and artistic quality.   I have to admit that I am not a big fan of documentaries. As a student at the University of Texas in Austin, I could only watch a handful of documentaries, mostly about the campus and UT. When I was in college, I attended the Museum of Fine Arts. While there, I also saw documentaries, such as a great documentary called, "Sick: The Secret of the American Vaccine" about how the vaccine industry abuses the public and endangers its own employees and consumers. While I don't think vaccines are a very good idea, I am a fan of the way documentaries are made and how the subjects of the documentaries tell their stories. However, one documentary that I saw while in college was one on ancient religion called "Holy Warriors" (see my review below). This documentary looked at the rise of Buddhism and was made for the Discovery Channel. The subjects of this documentary were really interesting, especially with regards to the subject matter of the documentary. Unfortunately, this documentary made a very bad impression on me, as I didn't feel that the film was very well made and was too concerned with the production quality of the film.  After watching the movie "Holy warriors" I thought, "This movie looks like it will be good, but I can't believe this stuff is actually true!"   If you do a little research about ancient religions and Buddhism, you will find out that Buddhism is a very diverse religion, as its followers practiced it for a long period of time. This means that Buddhism, like other religions, changed drastically from what the original teachings were. One of the biggest changes that this religion underwent was the practice of reincarnation. This is not a new idea and even the original founders of Buddhism practiced reincarnation themselves. However because the teachings of the original Buddha didn't go as far as they would like, they had a different practice to fulfill their needs. Instead of being a completely personal practitioner, the followers of Buddha became a collective group of practitioners. They took vows to perform various duties to maintain the religion. The members of

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I know I have a lot of movies that I've watched, and that it's not easy to talk about the good movies and bad movies, even if it's just one movie.   So here I go, I'll talk about one good movie, one good scene, and one bad scene. This movie is called "Logan's Run", and the story of the movie revolves around a space shuttle that crashed into a small town in Nevada.  I have to say, it was a bit cheesy, but still funny, and had a good story.  There was one scene in particular that was funny as hell, and even though it didn't get to me as much as it should, it's a good scene. The plot in this movie was a mix of action and suspense, but it had some more of both than a lot.  The only bad part was that the movie was very slow, I really like action, but this was way to slow.  It would have been a better movie if it were faster. The movie also had a lot more gore, and it was even more fun to watch.  Also, the voice acting in the movie is really good, and you can tell what the actors are saying.  In the end, I give it a 9.5 out of 10.  A good film with a great story:  "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is a movie about a boxing match between two men named Joe Gage and Jackie Stallone.  These two men have very different fighting styles, and they both are able to dominate the other for most of the fight.  One of the things I really liked about this movie is the way they portrayed the characters.  Stallone was great as Joe Gag, and he was able to express all his emotion, as well as his anger and hatred.  Unfortunately, the other characters were not as well written, and the movie didn't have as many great moments. The action scenes in this were great, but they didn't really move the story forward.  "The Good" also has a lot to say about religion, and how people handle religion.  At times, it didn;t feel like a movie was saying anything, and sometimes it felt like it was just another movie. At times the movie just felt like a very dumb action movie.   However, in the end I think the movie did a great job portraying two guys who
Write a positive review about a good movie:     " I would have to say it is by far the best horror film that I have seen on home video. It is the same basic formula we have seen for years, but this time it's even better. It just makes you feel alive. It has no plot to speak of, no characters, no plot twists, no twists, just the pure fear of the unknown, the terror of the dark, the love of the human, and a story with a story to tell, a story you can't forget about as it is about a young man and his family, and about a group of people who are not like the others in town. The cast is fantastic, even a few of the extras. You will be smiling, feeling scared, and just really enjoying yourself. The special effects in this one are top notch, and the music is top notch. This is a must see for any horror lover, and it is certainly worth it." - J.M.   I liked it. I actually liked it so much that when I saw that I should say the following. I think it's great. I thought it was great. My kids liked it as well, my wife liked it, my father was a fan of the classic movies of the 70's and 80's, and I like horror movies. And I think they are a little too good for horror fans. And you know what? I'm fine with that. My wife didn't like it either. But there's no way to please everyone. It's up to you whether you think it was good. If you don't you may not like it. And it doesn't have to be just a few people who liked it: if you like horror films you'll like it just as much. So let's just say that I enjoyed it. You should too. And then, for the record, this film had a lot more scares in it than The Silence of the Lambs. So don't skip this one.     So, what do you think? Do you like it? I certainly enjoyed it, and think it has a great story and great performances. I wish that my wife would have liked it too. She doesn't like horror, but that doesn't mean she hates the films like she doesn't love the film that it was based on. In any case I hope you enjoy the film, and if you do, please let me know what you thought of it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best thing that could be said about the movie is that it was produced by Hollywood (who have a history of making the worst movies). It's not a bad movie. It doesn't need to be a good one. It's well made, and it has a lot of heart. I would have liked it to have been more on the horror side, as that is where the films are going the most. I don't know how well you can tell a film is good or bad with just the poster. The movie is pretty good, but it does take a while to get going and there is a lot in it that is repetitive. It looks like the movie was made in 1997, which is a long time ago. The effects are okay. The film is pretty creepy, and if you want a good scary movie, this might be it. I didn't find anything scary in the film, but that's probably because I'm not a fan of the director. The following review is for the Special Edition Blu-ray: This Blu-Ray box set contains the original theatrical film as well as four special features, and is the ultimate way to watch this horror classic. The first special features is a special version of the film created specially for the Blu-rays and is based on the original script. The second is a new featurette, called "A Tale Of Two Cultures", which takes you behind the scenes of the production, and introduces you to two cults in LA: The Black Dahlia Murder and The Broadmoor. The third is a collection of featurettes that gives you an in-depth look at the cast and the film's production. The fourth special features are two more pieces of special features that were not included on the theatrical release, but were found on the special edition of the Blu Ray: "The Film's Director: A Tribute to Michael Powell" (featuring interviews with Richard Chase and Donald Pleasence) and "The Filmmakers: The Films of Richard Chase". They are about the work of Richard J. Chase and how the film was made. They are both worth watching. In all, it is a very nice package to get the most out of a classic movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The reason I went to see it was because it was "totally worth the ticket price," which was definitely not the case. The main character (played by a young Christopher Mintz-Plasse) was clearly having a hard time. He did a lot of things very well, but there was a lot to nitpick about, and I wasn't in a good mood. I also thought his character was really dumb. He was the guy that was always in trouble, never got any attention, and always had to get back up and do it all again, but he had to take it easy and let everybody else do the work. Then he did some really good, impressive stunts but couldn't get out of a speeding truck and was in a bad position when the cops arrived. He made a lot less sense than he sounded, and there was some unnecessary drama in there that didn't work for me. Overall, I think that this movie was okay, but not good enough to justify the ticket.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Why do I have so many bad movies? Because I watch too much crap in general. I watch bad movies because that's what I've always done, because I don't want to pay money to go see a good one. My wife complains that the movie we just saw is so good, I have to say that I was very impressed. I'm glad we both decided to get together and go see this movie. If you want a good time in the end, watch this movie and see the movie. It's a lot of fun to watch a movie in the first couple of minutes. If a movie is really bad, the story will end before you know what's happening, but this movie was the opposite. The plot never really had much to do with the character we were watching. It was all about the action and the action was good. I thought this movie is worth the price I paid. If I only watch crappy movies, this is the movie I would always get, but when I find a good bad movie like this, I watch it. Good luck finding a good good movie. Why Do People Think I'm the Devil?:

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very well done film, with excellent performances by all of the cast.   The best performance is by Brienne of Tarth, who gives one of the best performances in the series and does an excellent job of showing what she has lost in her past.    She shows a true strength and dignity to be able to see through the illusion and accept the truth.  Also, if you haven't seen the TV series, you really should.  The actors do a great job of conveying their feelings and emotions, and this film shows the love that Jon Snow had for Briennden before his fall.  5 out of 5 Recommendations: This is an excellent series that offers an excellent portrayal of the story.  It was well made by Samwell Tarly.  My only complaint would be that this film has a somewhat long running time, but I believe that this is the only downside.  There are several great scenes and performances.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's hard to choose the movies that have influenced me the most. When I first watched "Pulp Fiction", I had no idea what I was watching. I remember thinking: "What is this? A gangster movie? What's wrong with them?" I'm not sure how many times I watched that movie. I watched it again and again, and the more I watched, the more it became like me. And the more like me it became, the deeper it got. Even though "Pursuit of Happyness" had more violence, "Passion of the Christ" had a much deeper message. For instance, in "PURSUIT", Jackie is so upset about her husband leaving her that she starts a fight. However, in Jesus' sermon at the church, He says: "I am the way, the truth and the life" and "The law and the prophets were until John. Since that time, the kingdom of God is preached and every town hall is full of the good news. Everyone is asking what is the meaning of these things. The old man who is a publican, asking questions, says: 'Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has never risen anyone like Jesus, who is the son of God'. But I tell you that a great many there have been who have come into the world and who do not appear to have come of women. For they are from man, and not from God" (Matt. 19:17-20). In that sermon, Jesus said He was from God, and I believe He's still from God. The movie also had a lot of dialogue between characters, so I remember some lines I remembered, like "You're not the one." etc. I like the message, but I can't say for sure it was a part of my Christian experience at that time. But in the end, it was so profound to me. I really felt like I was inside the movie. The fact that all of the characters in "The Godfather" had this power to tell people what to do, was a huge inspiration to me at the time.   I think it was "The Lord of the Rings" movie.  There,  Sam Gamgee (Richard Armitage) had this huge power over other people: "He has a magic wand that allows him to control the minds and souls of men".  Sam was a complete mess. He
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love the movie, but not all the way. It could be the best movie of the year.    It's about a child that's raised by a man. And the child, a woman, has been raised by her father.  This is a beautiful story of a family, and the challenges they face. The movie is not long, about 25 minutes, and yet has so much to offer.   The story starts out with a beautiful young girl, a beautiful boy, a man, and a father. The mother is strong and gives it all up for the child. The father is a woman and takes care of everything for her child. And they have been through so much. And yet, the mother gives it up for her son.  It is beautiful and sad and the way it was written, I cried.  You are in a beautiful family, the father is strong, the girl is strong. The boy is strong as well, and he takes care when his mother goes away. The girl is the most beautiful woman you will ever meet. I was in tears.  The movie was written by James Ponsoldt, and it is directed by Mike Mills.  Ponsoldty had never directed before in his life, but he is a very talented writer.  He writes in short paragraphs with such a poetic beauty.  There is nothing like it.  Mills, a well known director, did a great job directing.  Mills is a story teller as well. It is a short movie with lots of scenes.  I highly recommend this movie to everyone, young and old.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have no idea what you mean by that. Maybe you have heard someone else say it. I've never said that. I'm just saying you should have said that yourself.   For sure. It's not like I don't enjoy movies myself, or that I don  "The Best Movie Ever Made"   is good. It isn't necessarily a great movie. That's for you to decide. I say this: The movie is worth your time.  I was really taken by the premise. If there was a movie that could show you what the end result of a man's love for a woman would be, it would be "The Best" by James Ellroy. The story is compelling, the characters are compelling, and it's a pretty decent movie.  So this movie is great.  One of the things I noticed that really impressed me was how Ellroy portrayed a character that I actually know and liked.  We get to see the whole of their relationship.  It is a lot more realistic than a lot of the other movies I have seen, in my opinion.  A friend told me that a lot about the relationship between Robert and Edith in "The Road to Perdition" was pretty close to what happened between Ellroy and Ella Fitzgerald in "My Name Is Edith Finch." I wasn't really familiar with those books, so it was nice to see someone who was not a "newbie" to these characters really give a real feel to them. Ellroy's writing really gives them depth. In one scene in particular, you can feel Ellroy trying to get the best out of her. He doesn't do a good job, but that's a common problem with young writers.  Ellroy did a pretty good job with the characters. I really enjoyed the writing style and he did a very good job of showing all of the elements that were in play.  The screenplay, as far as I can tell, is pretty accurate and has been published.  There are some minor typos here and there, but there is nothing that makes it look like it's been re-written.  This may seem like nitpicking, but it's the way I see it. "The Most Dangerous Game" is more about the characters in the movie, and not Ellroy writing.  "The most dangerous game" isn't about Ellroy, so that's not an issue.   What do you think
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Why are good movies always good? Why are good books always good?:   It's because when you go to the cinema or the book store to buy a book, you can't see yourself in it.   We've all had experiences where we didn't feel we were in the movie. But when we look at a book and we see ourselves, in other words, ourselves as the characters, it changes everything.  Because you have no doubts whatsoever. If a movie doesn't make you feel like a superhero, a movie can be a good book.  When you see the movie, it's the same as the book. You understand the movie's world.  The world of the movie is not the world of a book. And you can take the same world, the world as seen in a book but you take it and use it differently. You can make it more personal.  You can take it to the point where the world itself is the story.  What's the point of a movie?  It doesn't really matter if it's good. It doesn' t matter if the movie makes you feel good. If it makes you laugh or it makes your heart jump then that's a good thing. You're not a good person if you don't feel that. You don't need a good feeling for a movie.  I'd say in general movies are not as good as books. The same reasons why I liked those books I also liked the movies. The characters were so much better, the stakes were so high, the action was so good.  If the movie didn't make me feel that I would never want to see a movie again. But the books were so beautiful in their own way. They were so complex. I would give all of the books I've read to be made into movies. And if I were to make a movie, what should it be like?  I think I'd make it like a story about a man who is obsessed with his mother.  That's the kind of movie I want to make. And I also think you should make it a very personal movie, because you need to know yourself inside out. You need to see the world from your point of view. I think that's the key. And make it as a true story. I want the characters to be people you know. They're your friends. You have to know them as friends. And then we need to have the stakes

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are times when I hate to watch a movie because it is just too bad. But, there are also times when a good horror movie is a delight and an absolute must watch. In fact, I would consider the entire horror subgenre to be one long story. Every film has their share of excellent and interesting scenes and scares, and every film has a scary villain who is always memorable. But in many cases, the villain's behavior isn't the scariest part of the film, it is the way the audience watches the character's reactions. And because of this, I'm going to share a list of my top 10 favorite moments from horror movies that have been completely overlooked by most of the horror film fans out there. This list will focus mostly on classic horror films, but will give a nod to other horror movies as well. This is by no means an in-depth ranking, because I simply have too many great scenes that haven't been discussed in horror films. I can only talk about scenes that are absolutely frightening and memorable. I'm not just talking about those few scary scenes that make you jump out of your seat or jump out and turn to scream at the screen. I mean, it's true that these scenes are the most important moments in a film, but I'm more interested in how the audience reacts to them.   So, without further ado, here are my top ten favorite scenes from horror films: 1. THE BEDFORD MYSTERY (1996) - The entire movie is about a bedridden woman whose husband is a doctor who is very good at his job, and she doesn't understand why he won't take his own life. But as the film progresses, the audience discovers that there are a few secrets that the doctor has been hiding, and they're all going to pay a price if he dies.  2. IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE (1985) - An alien invades a tiny town, and turns everyone into zombies. One of these town members is a small girl named Laura (Lena Dunham), who is a very sad girl that has been bitten by the alien. Because of this terrible situation, her father is determined to keep the zombie plague from spreading.  3. THE WALKING DEAD (2010) - It is the end of the world, and it is happening. In this apocalyptic zombie movie, we are introduced to two new characters: a man and a woman who are both
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Good movie. Some people have good hair. - March 4, 2011good movie but  Reviewer: rrj - favorite favorite favorite - October 16, 2009  Subject: I'm not a fan of this movie. I'm a fan who can't seem to enjoy most movies, so I can understand the criticism. But the one thing I hated about this movie was the opening scene, where there's this huge crowd around an airplane that's landing. So the pilot (played by Steven Seagal) says, "Hey everyone. We've arrived and we're going to take off right now. Everybody sit tight and relax!" The crowd begins to huddle up, even though there are hundreds of empty seats, and they don't relax until the plane takes off. And when it does, the scene ends with a bunch of people running out of the plane screaming. I was in college, and was so disgusted.  But for the rest of the movie, I enjoyed it. It's a good enough movie, and the acting is decent. And the music is great.  the only complaint is how some scenes aren't quite clear, but overall it's a decent movie. - October16, 2009I'm not of this generation, but I'm glad this movie exists. - October 16:  "The crowd...they're all staring at you. You're surrounded."   And the pilot's line: "Okay, what's our flight plan?"   "Well, we're headed over the Mississippi, then... over the ocean, then, uh, we'll take a left here, and take a right here... we'll go back up over the mountain."  ... "Oh, and you're taking us back over the mountains, I mean, there's a lot of big rocks over there. "   -  I hope this helps, I am not the biggest fan of Steven Segal.  in general I prefer his films over the ones directed by James Cameron. But at least he's a filmmaker that made good movies. I guess I don't think this one can compare to one of his movies. .. - October 9, 2009In general I like Steven Segal.  can't help but wonder what happens when he dies, though. - September 27, 2009Is it possible to say that there were bad people in this movie?  Rated 5 out of 5 by John from It
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What's good is good.   The thing about movies in which we're introduced to the people we're going to care about most is that when things go wrong, there's always a good reason.  And if you make the mistake of focusing on that reason, then things are doomed to fail.  One way to avoid this is to tell stories where the main characters are people who you think are great.  We love them for a reason.   They're complicated and flawed, but they're capable of great things.   What if instead, the reason we love these people is that they have flaws.   How would you tell this story?   I don't think the story is all that different than the story of a group of kids in New York who take a week off for an extended vacation at the same time a serial killer is on the loose.  At first it seems like it's too much to ask for a murder to be so over the top, but by the end of the movie we're ready for it to happen.  The kid's are forced to get rid of the bodies of their friends and family, the killer is still out there, and the movie ends on a big cliffhanger.   I wouldn't recommend this movie as a horror movie because I don`t think it's scary.  But I do love it.  I really love it for a lot of reasons, and they're not all about suspense or gore or gore.  You're watching these people, and you are rooting for them.  They are people just like you and me, only we're much more capable and mature.  It's hard to take a trip like this with your family, but it can be an amazing experience.  Even if you don't have a family or friends, there are many good ways to enjoy this film.   The music is a big reason why I like this movie.  While you're watching a movie, the music that's playing is not only music you can play in the background and ignore.  These songs are songs that you can make your own.  If you're a diehard fan of anything metal or punk, this movie is for you.  There are also scenes where a band will perform live with the cast of this film, and I can't stop laughing whenever I hear one of those songs, even though I know they're singing to a fictional group.  Sometimes you just need to laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    (I've heard the movie was good)   In the opening minutes we are introduced to a young woman named Marlo. She runs away from a very violent home that has done a lot of damage. Her mother was murdered and she is the only survivor of a horrific abuse. Her father is a man who wants nothing to do with her.  He never seems to be able to forgive himself and never truly understands what she is going through. In fact, he never really understood her mother and her abuse at all. This is a very different approach to the female character than a typical horror movie would take. In a movie like this the female would typically be abused, raped or beaten and then the victim would be killed off as a result. But here the female becomes the aggressor and is the reason for the violence and death. It shows that there is a lot more at play here than meets the eye. This would probably make a great story to be used in a psychological horror movie or an adventure. But it is too well done to be something you just watch for a few minutes.   By this point in the movie we are already on to our next scene. The characters are already in the apartment where they plan to kill the family. But at that moment, one of the guys pulls a gun on a woman and a gunfight erupts. The woman shoots the guy and kills him. The man who shot him tries to get away but is shot again and flees from the apartment. The next couple of minutes show the aftermath of the murder. The victims are dead and the cops are on their way. The police find some blood and other evidence at the scene.  There is a note that reads " I have the perfect murder.   And she has the perfect look.  Now, who would you choose to kill first?  The dead man who came after you or the beautiful one?"   The note really makes this movie a whole lot more powerful. This movie is not like a typical movie of this genre.  To do this movie justice you need to watch it.  The movie is actually a bit slow at times but it is never boring. This also helps make it a lot scarier as it makes the entire story really feel alive.  It's a movie to watch with a great soundtrack and a good atmosphere.  And for this review I will go over the most amazing scene.     The film opens with some creepy music and

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie. It's funny, and I think the plot is a bit cheesy, but I love how the character are portrayed and how well they're built up. I think I would like this movie a lot more if it wasn't set in the future or if it was done as a standalone. This is my favorite sequel to the movie "Blade Runner", and it is one of my favorite movies of all time. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was that, at one point, Harrison Ford is just sitting there with his back to the audience, talking about something, and the camera has no idea what he's talking about. (In my opinion, that would be way better if Harrison Ford could see the camera.) There is a point in the movie when he turns around, looks at us, and says something, but we don't hear it. It would be great if there was an audio commentary, so that we can hear his thoughts. He also makes a few comments about "Blade Runners" that he would never speak of publicly. That would be awesome! This movie is also great because it has a bit of a love triangle between Deckard, Rachel, and a prostitute, which also makes me love her. Also, I really wish Harrison Ford had more dialogue! He's so serious most of the time. He doesn't say a lot, but he says some. He talks about how there's no room in space for two humanoids, and that humans are supposed to be alone. When he says he's the last human, he also says "I'm the last of his kind, but not the last. There are hundreds more." I think that he's right about that, but some humans just want to make it to Mars and never come back, which is why humans should just stay out of space. I would probably love to see him in another movie. I'd love to watch his character be a robot, or maybe some other species, like an alien or a lizard, where he doesn't need to use his hands and is able to use machines to get around the galaxy. That's what this movie does to him, and it would be nice to see another movie where he could have a friend like that who he could talk to about the future. The movie isn't really about the characters themselves, but about the setting, the atmosphere, and how the people interact with each other. I really loved the story and I loved that
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love a good thriller. But there is one that I haven't seen, but that I think I will enjoy, and that's the movie 'The Quiet Man' (1967). And yes, it does have a strange plot and that I like, but also the film was produced by Hitchcock, so I would be getting more than my money's worth in all my Hitchcock appreciation. 'The quiet man' is a 'haunting' tale in which a man who is about to be executed is given an hour to prepare himself for the crime and he finds out that all is not what it seems. So what do you expect? This is Hitchcock at his best.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best way I can describe this movie is:  It feels like a live-action movie with an animated film version. I loved that.   What the movie does to you is different from the live- action movie.  The live- act movie is about an older couple on a vacation, in their 80's, who suddenly fall in love.  On this movie, they are only 20 years old and their parents are gone for the summer.  In this movie there is a young girl who is also at their destination, but there is also a very cute and caring older man, that also has a crush on her.  This movie was so good because it did not tell us how old the characters were and where they came from, so it did have a fresh new look.  There is no love triangle in this movie. It is a couple that fell in love and they were trying to get it together until they got caught by the FBI (National Security Agency).  There was a great scene in the movie, where the two of them got caught and the agents were looking for them in a secret FBI facility.  I remember the scene very well because I saw this movie when I was very young and I just wanted to be at that spot.  That was the best part of this movie! The FBI was on the top of my mind when I watched it as a child.  It reminded me of those stories about the FBI or how they could track an evil man.  One of the characters that we met was called "The Stanchurian Candidate."  I loved how the movie gave you this feel of a live action movie with animation.  They used this technique to show how much money you have in your pocket.  Another great aspect of the movie was how the characters talked to each other, like in real life.  Sometimes the characters are talking to eachother and sometimes they are talking in the background.  The St. Bernard's dogs The movie is good enough to take you to a fun place.  And I do know some people will say that this movie was boring.  But I did like it.  With the use of different backgrounds and colors and a good ending, I can see how this movie could be a great live action film with a good animated version!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The "Killer Shrews" (1944), the most famous of the long running serial stories. The "Shrews", the oldest, is still on the screen every year and is one of the greats of horror. But, the "Kiss of Death" (1964) is the best of them all. I would say that it is the greatest serial that has been done in horror. This one has a lot more to offer the viewer than the old ones, but still the story and the actors are excellent.   The "Kinksters" (1960), an erotic short film by Paul Williams. The story is about two young lovers who fall for each other through a series of misunderstandings. A good story with a wonderful ending.  "The Horror at the Castle" (1974), a gothic-flavored comedy, featuring the infamous "Jaws" star Peter Graves, and directed by "The Witches" director Charles Blaisdell. A comedy, but a scary one.  The title is actually a quote by Charles Dickens, but the story is a true true story.    The "The Mummy Returns" (1992), a supernatural horror that's really a remake of a very old film called "The Invisible Man".   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I was about 12, I got this cassette from my mother-in-law. It was the last of her tapes that I had in my possession. I would listen to it every night, every day, for over a year, because it was so powerful. I still do, and it's one of the only times that I get to sing a song on camera without sounding like a robot. It's about a girl who finds her brother and has to face her fear of losing him. The story is told in flashback, so you get to see a few parts of the girl's life before the loss.   You can tell that the writer didn't write the song just to make a sad song, because this is a happy song. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Dancing in Jaffa, as directed by Sam Hamm, is an entertaining and entertaining movie, but it can't possibly compare to 'Lolita.'" (John Hughes, writer, director of "Dancer in the Dark") "I've seen the film more than a dozen times, and it is an extremely effective work of art." (Peter Bogdanovich, film critic, New York Times)  "It has a wonderful story line. You can almost feel the rhythm of the plot: a boy is abducted and then he goes on a journey to find his captors, a boy-and-girl relationship, and a girl and her lover." (Cineman (UK), on "Dance in Jaffe" and its sequel, "Lolitas") "This is the most successful film to come out of Jaffna since the great Marlon Brando. That's a good thing, because this film is not about Brando, but about Marlon." (New York Times, on "Lolitas")  I can find no mention of a "Bogdanovich" anywhere on the internet.   I can find the film in "American Cinematographer" (vol. 3 no. 3, 1966), "The American Cinematographic Tradition: A Biography of the Directors, A. C. Thomas and Richard Lester" (New American Library, 1967) and "Cinema and Film" (1956).   The film was reissued in a two-disc set from 1969 (Cinefilm, #11), the first disc of which was directed by Richard Lester.  The movie was again issued in a four-disc (Videodisc, #8) release from 1979 (The American Cinema Collection, #3).  The "Bogie" and "Marlon" reference is to Richard Lester and Jack N. Shephard. Lester's "Marlene Dietrich" was a frequent companion of Marlon's, and there are several scenes in "Lola" in which they talk. Shep was a regular at the dance-hall, and Marlon could easily have met him as he did at the disco.     The real Marlon is buried in the "L" in the name of the club.    "Raging Bull" has the same effect on women.  I think this is a direct consequence of the film's violence.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the last 5 years, there has been a new wave of filmmakers using the 3D format, and it is becoming increasingly popular to include a 3D effect to a movie. The 3D makes it feel a lot more real and is more immersive. This article will cover the pros and cons of using the third dimension with a movie and what effect it can have on the audience. A 3D movie can be a good or bad experience for the audience depending on the director, the audience and the 3d. There are a few reasons why a 3d movie is not ideal for an audience: The audience should be comfortable enough with the 3rd dimension to accept it as reality. It is not realistic for the 3 dimensional world to have different points of view for each person in the audience, therefore some people may experience discomfort or even nausea when watching a 3rd dimensional movie. This is especially true for a 3 dimensional movie with a large cast of characters or when the scene is very close up, the viewers eye may not be able to focus enough on the characters. As the movie goes on, the depth of field may blur and cause viewers eye discomfort. This could also be experienced by those who are very close to the screen and have never seen a 3-dimensional movie. For some this may be an issue of comfort and familiarity. The story will be too complicated to be easily understood. 3D movies tend to become quite complex with more complicated story lines and more time is given to the movie to reveal itself. This can also be uncomfortable for those who have a harder time understanding complex plots.  It can be difficult to see the world in 3-D. Sometimes the background and 3-dimension characters become invisible. This will be particularly true for those watching a movie with very complex characters.  When watching a third-dimension movie, it can feel like being transported into a different world. The third dimension can bring you into a world completely different from your own world, but it can also feel very surreal and unnatural. When watching 3D, it is important to find something that works for you and enjoy it without the intention of learning too much or gaining knowledge. If you are comfortable with the subject matter and the story, you should find it comfortable to watch a 3 D movie, however, if you feel uncomfortable or disoriented, it may not make for an enjoyable viewing experience. There may be people who do not want to be involved with a 3 d movie, so it may be
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One thing about movies that people hate:  This movie was rated R.   So I think it will be hard to enjoy.  I know, it's not easy to be liked by everyone.  This is a movie about love.  So, you have to be in the mood and you can't get the mood easily if you're sick, tired or something like that.    So, when the movie started, I was thinking I'm really tired.   My brain was so tired, I didn't even want to watch.  It was a movie with lots of action and a lot of fun.  If you like action and you don't hate heart, I think this movie is for you. I really like the movie.  There is a good scene with the guy from the beginning who tells his story.  A story I'm glad he told.  He was so realistic. He was the one who was the victim of the crime and the one that was in the wrong, he felt really sad after he got arrested and that makes him cry. He also is really in love with his girlfriend and he didn't want to leave her because he was a strong guy. But when he saw his boyfriend is missing and he is in jail, he didn´t want to run and just leave her.  So he tried to get the guy and make him his lover and he really succeeded to.  The movie shows his story and it's really sad.  When he told the guy about the crime he was sad, scared and confused.  That's why he was so honest.  In the movie, we see a guy who was so stupid and so ignorant.  And the guy in the movie is still the same.  Like a kid, he doesn't understand the world.  But when the girl in the story is the only one who can help him to be with her, he became a man and became a real man.  They both are the ones that can help each other. And you can see the love between them and their strong friendship and I think, it was great. The movie was filmed in a beautiful location.  Everything from the buildings and cars, to the street lights, to even the people walking and talking.  Then we see the movie from his point of view and it makes the movie so much better and more realistic.  Now he knows how life is. The guy doesn't know what is happening

It has a lot of cute fun scenes in which we get to enjoy the antics of our heroes, Scrooge, Scamp and Flint. They are just a great group of characters. They all have their own distinctive personalities and it's a great way for them to learn and grow. In fact, they learn quite a lot. In particular, Scrump learns that if a lamp he finds is lost, he has to find out how to get it back. So in a way, he and his friends discover how to be heroes and how they can get along.   It's a movie that everyone should have at least a few hours of enjoyment from. The only thing that bothers me is that it could have been longer, but the story was too short. But it's an all-around good movie!   Posted by: athena at 10:41 PM | Comments (3) | Add Comment Just a warning for anyone who will be watching this movie at home this weekend: This is not a good idea!  You might be missing out on a fun movie.  I have a feeling that you won't have a problem finding a copy of this movie if you try.  If you're in the mood to find a few good old-fashioned Disney classics with a little twist of humor for your kids, this movie is right up your alley.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was completely bored by this movie. It is so far from the rest of the movie series. That is why I am rating a movie in a 7. It just was not my cup of tea, and I could not find the charm in it at all. I mean, I think it was ok to try to see the story and the character. The characters themselves were nice, and the story was not bad. But it was not a good film. But for the price, I can just imagine that it would have been a great movie. But I was disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The other world that I walk through is not a pleasant one. I've felt trapped in it and I can see it now with the naked eye."   The World of Sleep is a beautifully made horror film about a child who becomes trapped in the other world. It is a fantastic film, but it is still something of a horror film. It may have been made with the best of intentions, but as we all know, there are people out there that will find their enjoyment in just about anything. This film may be a little too dark for most people, but to the ones that like this type of thing, I'd recommend this one. It can certainly be considered a gorefest, but if you can keep a straight face, it can be an absolutely amazing experience. The film is about a girl named Kiko, and it is her journey to understand what happened to her parents after they died when her mother was a child. It takes some strange turns, but this is a movie that definitely has the ability to scare the crap out of people. The world Kiko finds herself in is terrifying, and her reaction to that will keep you up at night. The first 30 or so minutes of this film is nothing short of amazing, and that is the beauty of it. It really sets the tone for the rest of the film, and the end does as well. This is a truly terrifying movie, and I urge you to give it a watch. If you like horror, and this type, I highly recommend you give it an honest look.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   " A lot of people thought that this was a good film because the reviews said that the character was well portrayed and did a great job and even got some of the best lines of the movie.    But if you see it in the movie theatre you'll find out that the acting isn't very good. I think this is because this is a very violent film and the actors don't really show that they are the bad guys.  For this reason I think they don't want to show that their are good guys in this movie, so they are just being evil, and there is a scene in this film where a good guy gets stabbed, and he does not look dead and he is able to walk off and it still looks horrible.  I also have to say that the movie doesn't really have much plot, if you want to know the plot I would read up on it.  The plot in the film revolves around a man who was in a car crash and has to work out his way out of the coma he was in.  You also have the lady in the car with him, she is a drug dealer and is really the main antagonist in this whole movie. The film starts off very promisingly with an opening scene where we see a few people going down a road, and we also see a big accident which is not in the best shape of the car. Then we also have some footage of a road accident and then some footage which show a young boy who has lost his father.  They all have a rough road ahead of them, and the boy is actually looking for his father when he is run over by a van.  And then after that we have the first person in the accident and he says "the doctor was right" and that there is no hope of survival.    This is a pretty good start, and I actually kind of liked the first ten minutes, so I thought the first act was a pretty decent one.  But then after the first hour or so the film starts to get pretty bloody.  Before the film even starts we have to see a good amount of carnage and then it starts to become more gruesome and then the violence increases.  A lot can be said about this film and it is not for everybody.    But I think the movie should be watched, as long as you like violence, and if you are not a fan of violent movies then this is not the film for you.  There is a
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The biggest problem with The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is that it never manages to find a really interesting theme. Instead, it turns into a generic comedy, with plenty of jokes but very little heart. I mean, there's one or two funny parts, but most of the comedy feels forced or forced in a really unoriginal way. The story is just a bunch of things that happened that the characters didn't care about, and the whole movie could have been about the things that really mattered to these characters. It doesn't feel like a movie that's trying to be something different or fresh, but more like a collection of random events that didn't matter and didn't feel real.  You may be wondering why I'm so high on this movie. The Secret World of Walter Machete is my favorite movie of 2013, so why is this a bad movie? Well, it doesn't have the same energy or drive, and it's just a sad collection of a bunch events that are all unconnected. If The Secret of Walter and The Secret Of Walter Mite was a movie about two young men who didn't know how to work things together, it would probably be more engaging, but this is about the same idea in a completely different medium. It feels like a bunch scenes that were thrown together randomly, and when you try to connect them you start getting weird, confusing plot holes. It's just not a good idea to try and cram together events that don't really fit together well. I also had a really hard time connecting to the characters, and all the actors seem completely flat and generic. There are a few actors in the movie who I actually like, but not enough to take you through the whole story and not come away feeling like you're watching a very average movie. 4.5/10
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched the movie this weekend for the first time in years.   This movie is excellent. It has it all.  It has a good cast, some memorable scenes, and the story is great.  The main character, James Bond, is cool, and I was looking forward to seeing him and his henchmen face-off with all the bad guys.  There are some really good jokes in this movie.  One that caught my attention was when Bond and his associate, Q, are driving a Mercedes convertible and a Ferrari.  After Bond tells him he's been getting the car for a while, Q replies, "Not as long as you were the one getting the new one.  You know, when I first got it in '71, it looked a lot better than this, with the leather seats and all. " So, we have a guy telling the other that he didn't get his "new" Ferrari for long before he got this one!   There were some very strong scenes in this film.  I was glad to see Bond wear a trenchcoat a few times.  Bond also wears a hat and sunglasses in many of his scenes.    The movie was great!  The soundtrack was also great.   I really enjoyed this movie because it was a lot of fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie. The story is interesting. The acting was good and the acting style very interesting. I liked the cinematography in this movie, but the scene where the father is going to tell his wife about what he just witnessed in the jungle is just an added point of view in a movie that does not need that. If it was an added scene, it could have been used to bring a little more emotion to the movie. Also, I am not a big fan of the first scene at the beach. I thought the music was great, but I did not like the way that the film ended. In a way it felt like a movie about a man who is so proud of his work and yet is having so much trouble in his life at the same time.   Another thing I enjoyed about this movie was that it had a great music score.  I think that the music is more of a reflection of the mood of the movie rather than being an integral part of the story.  It was a very short film, but it made me feel like it had more to it.  To see the ending of the film, you have to watch it again with a different perspective.  This movie is an interesting look at what a movie could be like when there is more in it. What we watch in the movies is what they think about, and what they want to be known for. The way in which these people reacted to the situation that we witnessed is fascinating. I really thought the movie was worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you don't have one then please don't even consider making a comment. I'm sure you will be deleted.    If you like a movie then read it, or even watch it again, so it doesn't get to the trash bin. If you have never seen it then you need to give it a go.  You get to see a movie you never thought about seeing, and I can't recommend it enough.  The only reason I won't recommend this movie to anyone is because it is not exactly easy to watch. Even after it gets started there is a lot to say about it, but even after all of that I can still watch this without being completely upset.  I have to give this movie five stars because I am just impressed. I am looking forward to seeing it again and seeing a few more movies that are very similar to this one.  There are many great action movies out there like these, so if you don't know what to look for, give this a go and see what it is all about. I wouldn't recommend a younger audience, because the violence in this movie can be quite graphic. It's very well done, but if that's something that makes you feel uncomfortable or uncomfortable, you may not like it. I think people would feel the same way if they had to watch this movie with younger people, and that's not something I want to see done.  My rating: 4.5/5 stars
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In which it turns out that not even the people at the University of Chicago have much idea what they're talking about.   This is what happened to me:  My girlfriend and I went to a couple of movie screenings last night. The movie we went to was "Memento" starring Tom Hanks. She was so impressed with the movie that I was shocked. She started watching it at around 10:15 and said she would watch it again. It was around 11:30 when I told her we needed to go home. She insisted, "Let's just watch it in my car." I thought about it for a minute and then decided to let her watch it.  We had been talking about a movie with this theme in it that she had just found out about and was very interested in. We had even been talking with each other about how awesome it would be to watch the movie in person. I mean, the movie was excellent!  But it turns into a pretty crappy ride after that. I'm sorry, but a movie about a guy who suffers from a memory loss/manic depressive disorder and his quest to find out what happened on the night he killed his wife, is not a great movie. Not even close.  The acting is all over the place and I just found it really hard to care about these characters.  And the plot is a mess.  But the movie is so bad that, at a couple points in the film, it made me actually smile. The characters are not believable. They're so far from what any human should feel or look like. So when a character is getting attacked by a giant alien or when a cop is going to be shot and saved, it actually looked pretty cool.  The movie also gets a little cheesy at times and the music that plays at some of the worse scenes just doesn't seem all that great. The soundtrack for the movie itself was pretty decent. The special effects are kind of cool but the editing is bad, and you can tell the director tried to hide a lot of this stuff by using a lot more than he really needed. I thought that this movie was just a mess and that it was just an excuse to show off some of Tom Hiddleston's acting skills. I just don't get it. The worst part was the ending.    In which it turned out that there are more than two people in "The Matrix" who are "The

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If the movie is good, it will inspire a positive opinion from someone. When a movie is bad, the positive feedback you get is even more important.   I watched The Dark Knight Rises on the big screen with a good friend, and I was quite happy. I saw it as a whole, and not a bunch of scenes that are "the greatest thing ever", but I enjoyed it.  The acting was good, and all the scenes were interesting.  I was really glad that I decided to watch this movie when it came out.  The movie was quite enjoyable, and it inspired a positive feeling that is very satisfying. I hope that I was able to inspire a good opinion about the movie and encourage someone to see it. A positive movie review is a nice thing to do.  I read a blog that has a lot of spoilers about the movies, but I won't be posting them here. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best part about this movie is the music. The opening theme of the movie, the song "Cinderella," is so catchy, and it fits so well with the movie. This movie is really about one woman with great dreams and a lot of courage to fulfill them. This is the perfect story for a young girl to hear to inspire and cheer her up. The story about a girl with bad luck and an impossible task is really inspiring. The movie is about the beauty of love, the power of hope, and the power in the human spirit. It is also about a father and a daughter who, despite their many differences, bond together through a love for one another. It will be the best movie to watch with your kids and your spouse, as it shows that friendship is much more powerful than hatred. "Crimson Peak" is definitely a must-see.   ★★★★★
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is an absolutely fantastic movie that I think all movie fans will enjoy. It is a great piece of film making and I was very pleased with it. It had the humor of a 70s movie and it had the suspense that a good science fiction film should have.   - - - C.S. Forester, The Martian:  The plot is brilliant.  There are some excellent scenes that are great for a sci-fi film and the rest of it I could only say is average.  -   - -  Paul Simms, The Blind Side:  - -  The movie was an absolute train wreck but that's not really what I wanted to say.  Sara Quinones, The Way Way Back:     I have only seen it twice and I'm not even sure it's a good film at all.  It's a terrible piece of art.  There is no logic or reason to it and yet I found myself in awe when it happened.  This is one of those movies that I don't really get what the point of was.  I couldn't believe the people in it.  How could they be so stupid?  Why was it so amazing?  Eddie Murphy, The Party:  I think this was a decent movie but I wasn't entirely sure what to make of it.  It didn't make me laugh out loud like a lot of the other comedies but it didn't really bother me either.  One of the things I really liked about it was that it was different than anything else on TV. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:      There is so much good about the film, and it is a joy to watch this movie. The voice acting is fantastic, and the acting, writing and directing by Robert Zemeckis is a real delight. The soundtrack was done by a real rock band, Led Zeppelin, and it sounds great in the film. One of my favorite scenes is the chase scene in the movie, when they chase a man through the desert on horseback. I found the chase scenes in the movies to be great, and they work well with the tone of the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Let's be honest, you're not going to see an R-rated film that is actually good because you can get away with the worst. You want to see your movie, and you want to know what people thought about it and whether the director got it right.   It's a tough balancing act.  I know that.  And even though I had to suffer through "The Sixth Sense," I was still happy with my movie and had fun while watching it.  If you've seen it, you know the difference in the end.  It was a lot of fun to watch, and if you haven't seen it yet, I urge you to go watch it. It's an underrated classic.  The music is great, and the movie holds up incredibly well.  It really is a film that you should see.

When the movie was over, she would hand me a small paper cup and I'd drink out of it. And then, when the movie's over, I'd pick up the cup and eat the popcorn out of the bag. I loved popcorn and milk, and my mom would always bring me back the bag." - Iain M.  The following three pictures are taken by myself, and are the only known photos of this particular movie.

If anyone has seen the movie, and has an idea of who took these pictures, please e-mail us.  We'd love to find the person who took them!  This particular picture, which was taken after the movie ended, is of the screen and a theater marquee, which shows that this was the movie being shown.  The film still shows the theater marquee and screen.  The movie posters are still present on the side of the building.  I've also found several other similar pictures of this movie, with a similar location.  All of these photos are attached in one file.  Thank you so much for checking these out! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a little slow to start but the plot starts developing and the movie gets better and better. After the first half of the movie you don't know what is going on but this is what I liked about the movie - not too much of an action movie (which some movies are nowadays) but just a little time for you to get to know the characters and the world and really get involved. I think the movie is very good if you like adventure stories, mysteries, psychological horror stories, dramas, romance and are a fan of David Fincher.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "It was just like the movies I saw in movies as a child. I loved it so much, I went into a store and bought it for my husband." The only problem with this review is that the author doesn't even remember when she last saw a film:  "I watched a few movies in my younger days, but it was during college that I really fell in love with the genre, movies with a strong theme." The last line is the real problem, as there's nothing "strong" about this movie, just a boring plot full of clichés and pointless action. I've heard this movie called a "romantic comedy" but I didn't find it to be that at all:  If you want to see a very short and boring movie that shows what happens when an incompetent film director decides to make a film about the Vietnam War, just go see a Vietnam movie.  This film's plot is so simple:  The plot of this movie is about two men who go to Vietnam, and one of them dies during their stay there, so the other decides to go on a mission to get his friend's body back, and his friend is the leader of an organization that is fighting against the Viet Cong (who are known to be pretty bad guys) so this is basically an American War film. However, while the film may look like it is about the American War, it isn't really at all, and the only reason this movie has any plot is because of the title. This film also suffers from its use of CGI, and I'm sorry to say that it looks a bit worse than it does in the trailer:  I'm sure you're all sick of seeing CGI in movies, but when you have a film this good as The Hunted, it makes the CGI look like crap:  For a film like this to be released theatrically, I don't think that it really needed to, since this film has plenty of action that is good. However what it does have is a really nice soundtrack and some great, cheesy, comedic moments, and at one point during the movie, the actors all make fun of one another:  This movie isn't a good film, but I think that people would get a lot out of it, since it has a lot of cool action scenes and is one of the better action films of the 1980s:    Overall, I would recommend this film to people who like action films. It has
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I reviewed my first (and hopefully last) feature film, I found the film pretty hard to like. I mean, it wasn't bad. And it did have some very interesting ideas. And, of course, my reviews are always filled with jokes and references, so I don't think the reviews really mean that much to anybody. But that wasn't my intended purpose. My intent was to do a thorough review. I wanted to make sure the film was good, and I also wanted to give a very detailed explanation of how I came up with so many of the ideas and concepts that I had. And the way I was thinking about it was that I was looking for some way to get the audience to like the film because I was pretty convinced it was a "bad" film at heart. So I wanted it to be entertaining, not because I felt a certain way about it, but because I wanted my audience to enjoy watching it. So that is why I was actually very hard to get to like this movie. I really don't know if I would have given it a very high recommendation if I knew it was going to be a good film.   It was more or less a disaster.  I have always been very good at watching movies and, unfortunately, this one was far more difficult for me to watch than it was for most people I knew who saw it. And at one point, I really did think it would be my first major flop, and that it was really going to go down as one of those films that everyone who had seen it in the theaters would talk about and laugh about forever. But it never really did. I didn't even feel bad that I didn''t like the movie. It was just a lot of work to write a review like that.  I think my only major critique about this movie is that, I think it was too long. If I saw the film in the theater, I would not have wanted it much longer.  The first half of the movie took me about three hours to watch. I had to take breaks. I felt like I had something to say about everything that happened in this movie and so many characters. It felt like it took forever to get through. I don''t know. I would probably give it another shot if I ever do a movie.  But for the most part, this movie was very hard for me, and the movie probably should have been much longer, because I
Write a positive review about a good movie:      If a movie has a good plot, a decent cast and a well-directed scene, it will probably be good. If not, it's still pretty good.   The story of " The Exorcist " is not without its flaws, but it's one of the best horror movies to come out of the 70s.  The movie is not only full of some truly scary scenes, but also one of my personal favorite scenes in horror films, "The Girl from the Well."   I'm not gonna lie, I loved it.    It's a little long, but there is so much happening.  There is a big fight scene, there's some nice ghostly sequences and there are some decent twists at the end.  It's one that everyone should see at least once and give it a watch.  You know you want to. You see a picture of a girl hanging in a well, there is a picture or two of her hanging around, but what she looks like in the picture is not quite right. You think she's hanging off the edge of a well but in the end, you realize that it's not her at all. Well, it is her, but she's been possessed by the devil.  Now, it might be an odd premise to read a story like this about a woman who becomes possessed by a demon, but when you are in the grip of fear, you can't help but turn your attention to the strangest things. This story has a strong enough beginning and the ending can make any audience feel like they're sitting down and reading a horror novel, but this movie takes a little while to get going, which might be a little bit frustrating for some people.  One of the main reasons the movie is so good, is because of the acting.  Many of the actors were good in the 70's.  In this particular movie, there are more than a few performances that will get you in the mood for more.  Some of the ones that catch your attention are John Saxon (as the evil spirit) and Patricia Arquette (as Christine).  There are also a number of other talented actors in the movie as well, like David Cronenberg, Kevin Bacon, Peter Gallagher and of course, William Friedkin.  So let's see what we have here. The Exterminator has a decent plot to it, but is lacking a lot of gore, which can be a bit

Write a positive review about a good movie:        How many movies are there that are so well made and so well acted and have so much emotion poured out?   I'm talking about the type of movies where the dialogue is so much fun.   The best part of this movie is the fact that it is told from the perspective of an ex-convict.  He is so relatable and I like that he has to deal with this kind of thing in the past.  He is in a lot of ways an anti-hero in many ways.  It was an incredible performance by the great Dax Shepard.  I feel like it was a real life experience for Shepard.    A lot of people think that his best performances have come from dramas but I have to say that he is more at his best when he is in sci-fi films.  The action is very well done and the script is great.  There were times where I was wondering if this was some kind of weirdo movie that I was reading about.  But it turned out to be a lot more than I had imagined.   I don't want to say too much about the end of this one because I don`t want to give away anything about what happens in the last few minutes of the movie.    But for me, I really enjoyed this film.  This is a great example of a movie that had so much love put into it.  All the people involved had a lot invested in this one and it shows.  In the end, I enjoyed the story as a whole and as a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think this is a great, smart movie. It may not get the recognition it deserves, but I do believe it is great. "The Wolfpack" follows the life of a pack of wolves as they hunt in the woods of Canada, with an emphasis on how the pack deals with their packmate, who is in fact an American soldier. One of the wolves who stays behind for a short while with the soldier, is named "Hannah". This movie also deals with the life on both sides of the coin, when you are an animal and you are dealing with another animal. In this movie, "Hanna" is the pack leader, and she is very proud of the fact that she was trained from birth to do what she does. She sees the soldiers as her pack and she also sees the wolves as her people. The movie portrays the Wolfpack as a unit, with a leader. However, they also interact with their fellow wolves, the Pack, which is made up of the soldier and some of the pack's more dangerous members. They seem to be able to come together when a major threat looms over them, but they are also very selfish when they need to get rid of something that is not doing them much good. The Pack does have an advantage. They have a leader who can command them and keep them together, and they have many strong pack members. This movie deals with themes that were very prevalent in the early 1900's during the American Civil War and other conflicts with other groups. I think it is a fun movie to watch, and I enjoyed the main character, Hanna, in her character. She was an interesting character. Overall, I believe this movie is a good addition to the Wolf Pack series. This is a must see.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie can be remembered forever for all the great things it did.   So, if a movie is good, keep in mind that a lot of people watched it, or enjoyed it, and that is great.  The bad part is that some people just don't like the movie and don't watch it again. I saw "Kramer vs. Kramer" a few years ago and it was such a good time.   I really liked the movie because of the characters and the action. There was a lot to keep the movie interesting.   The only thing that could have been better is if the writers of this movie would have just stuck to the original ending.   "K.G."   This movie is a lot like the old days of the 60's sitcom "All in the Family".   The writers have done a great job creating a good comedic story, and the characters are all very likable.   Although the movie is just like "All In the Family" in some aspects, there are some good new twists and it's funny when Kramer tries to out do his best friend.  I also thought the action was good.    One thing that I like about this movie is that you know that it will be great even though you may not like all of the jokes that are made in the movie.  It's just a good idea that this movie made.

I think that when the "big three" have their own stuff, that we'll get even more good movies out of them.  Hopefully I'll have to wait a couple more years to see them all on a regular basis, and hopefully when they are all on, they'll be even better.

It's a very personal movie, for the very reasons that make it so great. I don't have much to add. It is a movie about people who hate each other, who want to hurt each other. It also is a story about the power of friendship. There is some great acting. The cast is great. It was directed very well. I think it's going to be well made. It should be a huge hit. But I'm not a big fan. It won't do well. "Room" has gotten a lot better since I saw it last year. It seems less pretentious. Now it is less of a horror story about sex and people who are really weird. It has a lot more of a comedy about people with severe mental illnesses. The movie is very well directed. The pacing is very smart. It gets very good laughs. But the story is very much like "Night of the Living Dead." It's not all that original. It does feel very old. I've never seen anything like it. And "The Rooftop" is kind of like "The Naked Gun." It was the first "horror" movie that I watched on a college campus. I knew it was bad, but it was very, very funny. I found that "The Ring" and "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" were a lot funnier, but they were not really horror movies. They were about the same kind of horror. I thought "The Disaster Artist" was pretty funny. "The Big Chill" was very dark. It just wasn't funny. It wasn't "Dumb and Dumber." I don Rating:  B+
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few years ago, while I was shooting a commercial in Hollywood, I learned that the original film was shot on 35mm. It was a wonderful feeling and I was proud to be a part of this landmark production. Since then, I have tried to find a copy of the film that is still in print in Los Angeles. After a long time of searching I finally found one in the National Archives in Washington, D.C. and was thrilled to see it. I was so glad to find this 35mm print, because it was very well preserved and there are only four frames of the original negative left. This is an old gem of a movie. I'm sure there are lots of people who haven't seen this movie yet, and I hope this review helps them find a chance to see this fantastic movie.     There are some great scenes in the movie, and it is a very interesting experience. There are also some funny and surprising scenes. It is a beautiful movie that will entertain everyone who wants to see a movie like this.   The film opens with a scene where Mr. Rogers is walking with a blind boy, and we see a beautiful blue sky behind them. They walk through a beautiful garden and it suddenly seems like they have reached heaven. This scene shows how Mr. and Mrs. Rogers' love for God is growing and how this is what they want for their son.  Mr. Rogers visits his home every day and gives us the story of a boy named Frank.  This is one of the few times where we are introduced to other characters from the neighborhood who work with the family and help out. It seems that Frank's grandfather helps in the kitchen and his father keeps track of the children by counting them.  I love how these characters play into Mr. Frank's development. The movie is told from the point of view of Mrs. Frank, but from Frank's point of look we get to see his development from a happy boy to a strong man who can help those in need.  Frank gets a job in the summer and Mr.Frank is a strong advocate for him.     This movie is just a little too short for me, but I think I can recommend it to everyone because it has an interesting theme that I feel is a good fit for young people today.   It's a great movie that's well worth your time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is my first review for a movie, and my first time writing one on the internet. I did not intend to have this review be any sort of 'celebration' of the movie, but as I watched this movie and its characters I just couldn't stop thinking about the story and the way it's told. I love movies that leave you thinking about things. In this case, this movie left me thinking about how we treat our families and what we do to them and how they respond to that abuse. I think this movie is an important example of how the abused are supposed to respond to a society that does not care about them. It's one thing to accept what happens to you or to your family, but it's another to turn around and judge your family's actions. And in this movie that is a big, big mistake. I was surprised at the way this movie portrayed a very difficult and horrible situation for all involved. The movie gave me the idea that the family in this family are just trying to get by and are probably the most 'normal' family on the planet. Yet, as the film went on, they really weren't. This movie does a great job of showing how the family are completely in the dark about the abuse they are experiencing. There was no discussion of this abuse in the movie. The way things are going in this household, you wouldn't know it is happening. They seem to have every right in the world to not care. The film was about how each of these characters deal with the abuse. And I'm not saying the abuse is good or the abuse isn't bad. I'm just saying that the characters are just not ready for what is happening to them to begin with. As a person who was abused as a child, I can tell you that the abuse has made a big change in my life. This is a great way to show you what abuse does to you. I watched a lot of TV, but this movie was a real eye opener for me. This film should be in every single homeschooling homeschooled person's library. It may not be something you will ever be able to watch again or something you want to re-watch, but if you have time and want to know how a family deals with this kind of abuse, this is a film you should definitely watch. -A lot of people have been bashing this movie on the grounds that it shows the abuse, not the abused. In a way

Write a positive review about a good movie:     The Best of...   1. The Matrix Revolutions (1999)  2. Iron Man (2008)  the first film on our list that's not a film about superheroes, but one of the most profound movies ever made. It's also pretty much flawless, and I don't need to point out why.  3. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) , which has almost the same feel as The Matrix. And the fact that Peter Jackson had to shoot it in 3D is just icing on the cake.  to some people, The Matrix is the best movie ever made, and if you agree with that sentiment, I think you'll also agree with my feelings about this second film in the trilogy. I didn't know who or what Neo was when I saw this, and yet he transformed me. It was like seeing a whole new person. The plot is just as great as it is in the original trilogy. "The world is in chaos... and only Neo is the one who can save us."  - Neo (Ridley Scott) The action scenes are amazing, and they're all well choreographed. The one scene that stands out to me is the confrontation between Neo and the Morpheus character. What a scene. They've got each other locked in a fight that leaves both of them injured, and Morpheus' words to Neo are so simple: "The world will be what you make it." This is all the movie needs, but it is the only scene that ever really leaves me in a good place. The movie is so close to being perfect that it feels like we're just getting to see it for the first time. In a movie like this, nothing else really matters. The only way to understand it is through your own personal lens. This movie made me realize that you don't have to feel sorry for yourself to survive, but that a lot of pain, suffering, and suffering can lead to good things. There's no magic bullet to making a life better. You've just got to choose to make a better life. And if you do that, then everything else will fall into place. If we all choose to be the best version of ourselves, then we'll succeed in whatever we set out to accomplish. I believe it, and this movie made it easy for me to see this idea. That's why it's on my top list. The Matrix Revol

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I recommend "Jurassic Park."   It's a solid film.     The acting is great.  In the end, it is a classic.  The story is easy to follow.  And, if you're an adult, it's a wonderful movie to watch.  I would have liked it a bit more if the special effects were a little more realistic.  There are some scenes that look really cool.  Some scenes are great. But, the movie could have used a lot more time.    I think a lot of the success of the movie was due to the fact that it was released just as Michael Crichton was finishing his epic novel "Journey to the Center of the Earth."  There was no question of whether or not this movie would be a hit.   It certainly had a lot to live up to.  So, I would give this movie a rating of 10 out of 10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Good movies:     The Right Stuff  (1975)  A very entertaining, fast-paced thriller, but the climax is a little sloppy.   The Godfather  is a good spaghetti western (1976)      The whole thing is quite good:     The two main characters, Michael Corleone and Al Pacino, are very well-written and have very realistic personalities.   A lot of the action scenes are very violent and some of them have some fantastic shots.  In the end, it doesn't really matter if they don't like each other, because they're both very good at what they do, and what they are doing is dangerous and worth all the danger. Bad movies:       The Shining (1980)      Another Kubrick masterpiece, this time with a little more gore, but there's nothing that would make this film worthy of a bad rating.  I suppose it's the main reason why I liked it so much:  In this movie, Jack Torrance takes a trip down the wrong path of the drug-filled, paranoid, madman's path, as his father was before him. The acting is excellent, the story is gripping, and the ending leaves you feeling like you're watching a classic movie.  But I guess I prefer it this way, because it has a better plot.
Write a positive review about a good movie:      If you hate a movie you might as well tell everyone that too. But if you like a movie, you better like it! And if you don't, the movie can't suck. So give it a chance, make up your own mind. The movie is not perfect. The sound is a little poor, a little low in the mix, there are some technical faults here and there, but the film is still worth watching. It is not the most technical movie out there, so don't expect the most "technical" movie. The production values are very good, you get a very high quality film with nice cinematography and a lovely story. But I think there's something missing. The story seems to go in places without any reason, it's almost random. There's some parts where there are just a lot of people fighting each other. There is one big fight scene, it lasts for some time. After some while the movie doesn't seem to be getting any better, it seems to have lost some of its steam. It's a little frustrating because I really love the story and the characters. So I was hoping the film would change a little. But it doesn't. It gets a little boring after awhile, there is just so many of the same things happening. You can feel the movie going downhill. The music is nice, it reminds me of the movies I grew up watching, like  The Running Man  or  The Godfather  where it just helps with the atmosphere. But the ending is just sad. It doesn't really matter what happened in the film, the ending seems to be there to tell the audience something. It can be a nice ending but in the end it just feels forced and not really necessary.

The Exorcist (1973)   The most disturbing and disturbing film ever made, The Ex  orcist is not only one of the best movies ever made but also the most  disturbing and disturbing movie ever made.   I have not seen this movie for years but I did see it recently at a  conference on the "Cult Classics". The audience was not even half of  the size of the one present at the screening in the cinema, but it was a  of a different level. The audience in the theater were  terrified and the film's director was one of them, an American, Vincent  Weinstein.  - The most disturbing aspect of this movie is the depiction  of the exorcism. There is no blood in this movie, no gore, no screams, no  death. It is the work of a professional actor, who creates a .I in a scene and brings it to life with his acting. There  was a time when a good film can make people afraid and not want to  watch it again. But this movie was made by a trained man who wanted to , and succeeded. The movie is a true horror film, which is  something we never really see anymore.   the ending of the movie:   - The ending of this film is also a shock.

Do a web search on the movie if you want to see a critic's comments about the movie.   This movie is bad, but it's so well done. I've seen a lot of bad movies, but this one made me laugh out loud. It's such a short film that it is hard to put a lot more into it. The storyline is pretty silly and it's pretty easy to laugh at. However, it's not a stupid movie and it has a pretty good ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   " It was just a good old-fashioned thriller. " -    Kirkus Reviews     A short story by David Gemmell,  "When the Great Train Robbery was published in 1908, it did not receive many reviews.   The critic in this case was a man named Henry Fielding.   One reviewer described it as 'a terrific crime story…a superbly done tale of treachery'.   The other critic described it instead as 'the best mystery story published in this country'.   Fielding's response to this was to conclude: 'I can imagine the feeling of the detective in the presence of this fiend.   He is not yet a murderer, and he thinks that he is; but he is.' And the detective was right.   This was one of the best-selling detective stories of all time, a classic of crime fiction with a shocking ending, and with a fantastic tale of the mystery.   Gemmall's work has a rich tradition that includes James Mason, and this is the most detailed of Gemmells stories of the Great Robbery, including some of the most exciting detective work of the nineteenth century. "The story opens with a man who has just lost his wife and the family home.   Then, one day in the great city of London, he finds himself on the trail of a fugitive murderer.   His pursuit brings him into contact with the world of crime which he had never known, and which is the backdrop of an incredible story." -From The Complete Mystery Reader, edited by John G. Wright and George T. Evans, (Penguin Classics, 1985) David Gemmill's Great Train Rumblings is a  short story  by David Gemmill, published in The New York Times, in 1908. The story begins with the following paragraph: 'I feel that there is a secret under my feet, a secret I cannot tell, but which must come out.   I go home a little confused.   There is nothing which has happened to me so strange as that I should be so suddenly and strangely interested in a stranger's life.   It was a long time since I had been in London, and when I had gone back it was to find a life which was so different to what I had left.   So I do not know what I shall find there, and have been so bewildered that I have done nothing to
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (The film was not very good).   [This film's success did not change the world of the theater, but it did increase the demand for movies at the movies.] "I have no complaints about [ the movie. I can only say that it is very popular."   A good film has nothing to do with the success of the writer or the director. It has nothing whatever to do either with the power of the movie or the power or the popularity of the characters. The success of a movie is a function of the creative ability and the power that a movie has in the audience's mind.   This is why a movie cannot last a lifetime: the movie is in the mind of the audience and the audience is an organism.  This means that you need to create a movie that will be remembered for a very long time.  It takes time and energy and the people in the theater who do not know this need not be reminded of this.  For instance, I was at a theater when the play " The Merchant of Venice " came on.  I was bored to death.  There is no movie that could have made me forget the play.  The only movies that have any meaning at all are the movies which last.  Because the power is not in the characters, it is in their story.  When a movie tells you something that you do not understand, it will leave you unsatisfied.  A movie is never over. A movie has no time for anything but the story. "It is good that a new movie is made because they are good films." "One should always go to see the same movie twice if one is a movie fan." You are not a movie fanatic.  You are just a movie lover. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Watch a good comedy, or a good drama, and that's it. The rest is a little different. You'll see some pretty interesting stuff, but you'll only get the gist of the story. The movie may have a lot of good jokes, but they're not as good as the funny scenes from other movies, and when it finally comes to a really good story, there's a lot more filler. Still, this movie is one of the more underrated movies of the 1990s.   I didn't really care for it as a kid, but after seeing it again, I don't really have any complaints. The movies that you would think would make the most sense for kids are the ones with good stories and great acting. It wasn't perfect, but it's pretty good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The reason I can't give this movie a 10 is because of the overall score. My problem is not with the film itself; I loved it. I have watched it over and over and it still holds up. My issue is the score. And as an aside, I had a similar experience with the last Twilight movie and this film was similar. I think I got a bit of the Twilight experience and not of Twilight.   I had read some people's review from the movie, saying it felt like a horror film and I thought that's what it was.  In reality, it was more like a mystery movie that didn't have a huge horror component to it. And I feel like if you had never seen Twilight, you'd never know that this film has a horror element.  And this movie was better in my opinion than the first Twilight.   So if you want a great horror movie and you haven't seen the first movie; get this and do so.  It was fun to watch and it has some great scares.  I highly recommend you give it a chance.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - "The Exorcist," "The Sixth Sense," and "Fahrenheit 9/11" would be a good starting point.   There is, however, one more film I will cite with particular interest, and one that makes the argument for this theory more strongly.  The original screenplay was written by William Friedkin, the same man who made the film "The French Connection" and one of the very few directors that would have been able to get a studio to back a horror film.   When "The Silence of the Lambs" came out, the director was given the opportunity to revise the script for its sequel, "The Elephant Man," but he wanted more. So, he rewrote it, and it was shot on 16mm film. The film was a disaster, and Friedkin had to resort to using 35mm cameras and editing from a videotape.  In his new version of the film, the killer, a serial killer named Hannibal Lecter, was revealed to be a mentally disturbed psychologist, and all the suspense was absent.  But the version that came out after the original was shot is the one that was most commonly used in the filmography of William Friedkins.  In fact, it would be used in about seventy percent of the movies that Friedkin made, and in the case of "The Watchers on the Wall," it was used twice. So I am going to go ahead and argue that the idea of a monster being a psychopath who has been possessed by his own mind and is able to go out and kill people is a valid one.  So I want to show you what I think about the idea that all of the classic movie monsters have been possessed and driven to commit their crimes by something that was already inside them, a psychological or supernatural force.  This theory is the best way that I have found to connect all of these different elements, but before we do that, let's look at the history of film monsters: The most famous horror film monster is the Frankenstein Monster.  It was created by German director Victor Sjöström, and was originally created to help him sell the film to a German audience.  As a side note, I love this film, but if you don't, I can understand if you think it's crap.  Although this film was not a hit in the United States, it made a massive impact on American audiences because it was about the story of a man who

And at that point, I could not believe that anyone would be so foolish as to believe in anything. But when The Light Of Day comes up, there are moments of clarity. And what is happening?

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie is a good story. But it does have to be good enough to survive any criticism. So don't just leave a bad review because you don't like it. That's what people do. And they don't want to know you had a bad time or a bad life. If you are the kind of person who thinks that movie sucks, then don't come back for a sequel. And don't think you are special in any way because you had fun. People just like to take their frustrations out on other people. If that's you, then your movie sucks. Don't give a shit.  My bad rating (10/10)   The first two movies in this series are good. They aren't great movies but they have some good parts. They are not the best of the trilogy but they are pretty good. The last two movies are even better. This last movie isn't as good as the first two but it is still pretty good and I will admit to liking it.    I give the film a 10/10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I was reading this book when I was reading A Clockwork Orange, and it was a much more interesting read. The story about the children, and how they were mistreated and tortured by their father was much more disturbing and interesting than the book. It was like the stories I read about the poor and suffering people of China, and there were stories about the slaves in the United States. The stories were not the most graphic and violent, but there were some things that I could never forget. The fact that the author used the word pedophile a few times when referring to the children was just too much. The book was not scary, but rather an interesting read for those who like books about a child who is abused by his father.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of people get mad at me when I don't like a movie, but there's nothing to get mad about. I watch a lot of movies in my spare time, and I get to have fun with them too. What would I give to have a friend who saw all my favorite movies as a kid and said, "You know, you could totally be me in that movie! I'm sure it would be fun!"   When I was a kid, a lot (most?) movies didn't have subtitles. In a few movies (The Goonies, The Goonies 2, the original Star Wars, the Indiana Jones movies), I saw subtitles. There's something about that, I think, that makes the characters speak in an interesting way.   In Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, the characters talk at the end of the film. When Obi-Wan gives the lightsaber to Luke, he says, "Do you know what this is, my young Padawan? It is the lightsaber of a Jedi Knight." In the original film, a young Yoda said the same thing when he gave a Jedi to Luke.    In Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Indy and Marion exchange some dialogue while Indy runs around the Temple. Indy says, I'm afraid I can't allow you to follow me, my dear. He has to find his way alone. In one of my favorite scenes in the IndianaJones saga, Indy sees a huge boulder, and his dog tags his head to it.  In the original movie, the boulder isn't huge.  I want a "Jaws 4"   I really want a movie that is as good as the original Jaws.  In the first movie, all the actors work their asses off. You'd think that wouldn't happen in a sequel, right?   This one really didn't need to be made. In my opinion, the only thing that is missing is a good, simple, no-nonsense shark attack movie.  I have seen some of those, and they are not fun.  But maybe if I were older, I would like that movie. It would be great to see a couple of older actors in it. I guess if I didn't love this movie, I wouldn't like the original. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My first time going to an international film festival was in 2012, and the experience was amazing. It was an amazing experience because we all felt like we were in a room with artists that could make a difference, that could do something.   I have made a few short films, but I wanted to try my hand at the full-length film.  One of the most interesting things about filmmaking is that it gives you the ability to be in many places, and to have many stories. My first experience was in my home country of Poland, which I have been living for a while, and where there is a very active community of film makers and filmmakers.  I was fortunate to be able to interview a lot of people and meet with people that I would never have otherwise met.  In particular, I got to meet a number of filmmakers I look up to: Janusz Wajdak, who recently made the movie "Iztok (I Was Here), and Janusk Piotrowski, who made the movies "The Old Man and The Sea" and "The House Of The Spirits."  Janusze Piotrzak is a Polish filmmaker of extraordinary talent, and he was able to travel to Poland to work on his short films as well as for a film called "Sólki w mniej wieczany" ("I Was There), which was shot in the countryside of Poland.  When I saw his movie, I was reminded of an interview with one of my favorite actors, Robert Duvall.  This movie has a lot to tell about Polish history, and Polish-Americans in particular.  Januze Piatrowski made his first feature film, called "The End Of The World," which he made in Poland in 2008, and which was screened at the Festival of New European Cinema.  We had a chance to talk with him after it had been screened.  His directorial debut has to do with a group of young people that were forced to leave their hometowns in the late 19th century and to move to a new town, where they formed a group that would become the Polish underground.  The film is set in the 1960s, and follows the story of a young woman who is part of a resistance cell that works with prisoners who are also involved in this underground movement.  "The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo" is a Swedish film directed by Tomas Alfredson
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a new director's debut (his last movie was a small one for him, and it made no money), so he needs time to build a reputation before he'll be able to take the movie to a bigger market. As I watched this movie, I noticed some of his themes of violence and abuse (like with "Powers", and "The Good Mother") that I felt were somewhat obvious, especially in "The Exterminating Angel". This is a nice movie, and the good things it has in it, make it worth watching. The way it is edited and set up is amazing. The story was simple, but the acting was really good. The music was really amazing, and I loved that the movie was in 4K (I had to download it on my TV to get it in that format). The special effects were good, the lighting was good, and there were a lot of good things going on in this movie. In conclusion, this is a good, but not great, movie.

When I was young and it was first coming out, I bought every copy I could find and watched it repeatedly.  And then I grew up and never watched it again.  Then a few months ago I found a DVD of this film in a store and I really wanted to go see it.   I watched this one without the sound.  For some reason, the movie has such a profound impact on me.  Perhaps, the words of the characters have a deep, deep effect on me, but I can't explain it.  Because of this, I now find myself constantly revisiting this movie and I find myself asking "What would he do?"  This film is just a masterpiece and I can honestly say it had a profound effect on my life.   I really like this movie but   I feel that its not quite as good as 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie. It's a really good movie about a young boy and a woman, and a good friend. I think I'm in love with the man who plays a boy named "Slim." I've seen the film so many times I can tell you that he's really handsome. The film is about his relationship with a young girl named Eliza (who is really the main character of the movie, and is played by Anna Faris). Eliza and the other boys, called the "Fryers," were all so cool, and the "Sliders," as they called themselves, were cool, too. The Fryers and the Sliders really get together to see if Slim can be a good boyfriend. Slim is trying to make friends with Eliza, and one day he comes across a strange man named "Mordecai." He tries to tell Mordecai that he is only trying to be friends, but Mordecay does not believe him. Eliza asks Slim what he is doing. Slim says he's making friends with Mordecoy, but he just thinks Mordecac is being weird. Mordecadis and Slim have a very good friendship. When Mordecaya leaves for college, Mordeca tells Slim he wants to take him with him, but Slim says no because he has a job lined up. One of Mordecais' friends is named Jodie, and Mordecas thinks she is a lot like his sister, because she does not have much confidence. It just reminds Mordecy of his sister. He tries not to think about her as much when he is with Eliana, but one day when they are playing basketball, he sees her again. Slim then sees her, and he doesn't know what to do. They go to the bowling alley, where he sees Mordecal come out of Mordecai's truck and look at him with pity. He is ashamed that Slim is not with Eliane, but she just laughs at him. They end up playing with the other bowling balls. Slim tries to get Eliane's attention by talking to her, but Eliane doesn't like Slim talking to anybody, and she doesn't talk back, either. Mordecais goes to pick up Slim and tells him that Mordeciai wants him to go see if Eliane wants him in the house. He gets in the truck, but the truck is full of sliders and some other kids,
Write a positive review about a good movie:        The movie is good, and it is fun. The acting is decent, but nothing that will make the movie stand out for you. The movie is not really about love or romance; it's about two people who are on their way to meet their future loved one and get married. If that sounds dull to you, I agree. The love scenes are not very intense; they mostly have the man getting jealous because the woman is in love with someone else and he thinks that she will never love him. The romance in this movie is much more subtle than what you will see in other movies. One of my favorite parts of this movie was the fact that it is very realistic. The sex is very easy to see. It is not an unrealistic scene where the guy has the woman's clothes off or what not. It looks very real. It's just that no woman is going to take you seriously if you think that what you are doing is really hot.   The movie takes some time to get to know the couple, but I found that to be a nice thing. I liked how they spent time together and tried to get close to each other. There were a lot of people involved in this film; it shows that you have a lot to do before getting married. They try to find a place where they are accepted; that they are treated equally, and I thought that was very nice. The film had very nice cinematography and it was very interesting how they got the shot of the sunset on the hill to make it look so beautiful.  This movie is a good watch and you should try it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have only seen one movie by Robert Zemeckis, and it is  The Goonies. I am a very large Goonies fan, so when I saw this movie I was ready for it. This movie was a great way for Robert Zemekis to make the Goonies a family movie. I did not have a family when I was a kid, so I was just getting my parents together when I watched this movie. They all love the movie and they do not mind it being a family friendly movie. In this movie we learn about the Goons (the children) and how they live their lives. We learn about how they go on adventures, fight monsters, get lost and get rescued, and more. They are always on the look out for new adventures. We also learn about their struggles to survive and some of their struggles with some of the adults in their lives, like the older woman who works for the Mayor. This is a great movie and is a must see for any kid who loves the Goones.   What about a positive movie that you have seen, but do not remember what it was about:  There is a lot of great movies out there, and that is why I want to give you a little bit of a rundown of the movies I have watched.  This movie is about a group of people who have to come together to survive in a group setting. The movie is based on a series of books about the life of Robert Silverberg. The books are great and the movie has a great feel to it, especially after you see the ending. I was able to watch this movie before the movie was even released, because I thought it was great. The movies that I have seen that I was not a huge fan of are:     In the Mouth of Madness, The Birds, and  The Godfather: Part II. They were not that great, I will probably watch them again once I get the DVDs or Blu-Rays.  A lot of these movies are good movies, but they just don't hold a lot for me. This one is a bit better because I have not seen any other movie that is about this situation.  What about a movie that has been forgotten:  We know that there are a few good movies that you may have forgotten about, so here are some of those movies:  The Dark Crystal,  Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Forrest Gump.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A-movie-movie.   (The movie had a really great production value, too - this was my first time hearing a live orchestra. I've seen some of the live recordings of the film.  I remember watching it in the theater in the late '70s, with a very large and rather empty audience, when it had the big impact on me.   It made my eyes really water, as if the movie itself was a bit of a sick joke. I'd really like to know where it was filmed.)  The cast was great - I remember very vividly one of the scenes with the two women.  They were pretty young and they played both characters well - and it was an interesting mix of men and women on both sides, as well as the usual group of black and white actors.  The story was actually fairly decent (though somewhat cheesy) and the action was good.  The movie had quite a bit to say about the dangers of racism, but the movie was really about two different people's struggle to see a positive side to something which had seemed so bad. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only negative thing about this is that the second movie was made in 1982, so there is some problem with the soundtrack. But the first movie is a masterpiece and deserves to be a cult classic. It is a dark and realistic story of two young friends on the run after getting involved in a robbery. The first part of the movie is interesting and the movie continues to be funny and sad at the same time. There are two good movie posters here. The second movie poster is more of a black and white one. The movie doesn't look like it is made for modern screens. It's like the old Hollywood movies.   I enjoyed this movie. It had some good jokes and some good acting. It was dark, dark, but had some comedy. I enjoyed it so much.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "It is not easy to make a successful film, and I know many films that made it," said writer and director Bill Cosby to reporters at the New York premiere of "Pineapple Express." It was a comment that, when put in the context of the way this picture had come together, is true. This is a picture of people who've made a real living, people who have had to work for a living in order to get by. And it's a picture about a lot of the people in the picture: the women, the men, the black workers, the white workers, and even the children. The story is about how they live, and they're all in this town, in the same community. And there's just one big problem: The women get together and decide to go on strike, for their jobs, because of their problems with the local railroad. And so, the whole town is in an uproar. And that's kind of where it begins."  -Bill Cosby, The New York Times, May 19, 1978 "I just hope to God that it will be a big hit with women, and a big success with men."    The first major studio movie for a female director, "Pinny," was the film that really brought Bill Cosby back to the big screen. The film opens with an encounter between the hero of the picture and his friend, who has just run into her ex-husband. "Pinning the Tail On the Donkey" is a film about love and respect and the way you show that in your relationships.   It was the first major comedy by Cosby that was written and directed by a woman, and it showed that Bill Cosby could do comedy with a lot more humor and less seriousness than had been seen before. Bill Cosby had just made his return to the screen in "Caddyshack," but he had made a huge impression on people by making the classic comedy "The Cosby Show" in the late 1970s. This picture was his comeback film.  Bill Cosby and Danny Kaye, right, at the premiere of this picture in Los Angeles, in 1978. "The New Bill Cosby," the first picture released by Playboy after he quit the magazine in 1974.  This picture is just an extension of "The New Cosby." In this picture, Cosby plays his own son, and the film deals with a number of issues. The first issue is the father-son relationship, and

Write a positive review about a good movie:    How to tell if a movie is good: ?     The more I watch movies, the more I realize that there are a million different ways of doing movies. There are those that are really hard to explain and those that really are easy to understand. In my opinion, The Godfather Part II is a hard movie to understand and a hard film to review. It's one of those movies that's very hard to describe in terms of plot, characters, or dialogue. It has a whole lot of things going on and I don't think that anyone can really summarize it. A movie like this is like a soup with so many different ingredients that you can never really taste all of them. The movie's structure is the one thing that I can describe, but I know it could be a totally different movie if it were written in a different format.  The Godfather  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I will always love watching movies like this. I can't even begin to tell you how many times I've found myself so caught up in the story, that I have stopped and said to myself "wow that was really good." It was a perfect movie to take a weekend to sit in front of and just relax for a few hours, and even though we all know that this movie would end with a cliffhanger or two, I'm glad I got to sit there and watch it again the next day and enjoy it with my friends. I'm also glad that it's in a good format for my DVD player so I can just look at it on my own.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it in the theatre. Not a romantic comedy, this is a story of man's struggle with his own demons. It's not a typical melodrama, nor is it a story for people who are already interested in psychological horror. It has an element of suspense, mystery, a few laughs and an interesting plot. The cinematography is done masterfully by John Carpenter who uses dark, moody lighting and dark, gloomy moody colours to make this movie seem even more mysterious. The soundtracks is made up of some of the best music of the 80's and 90's.   The special effects in this movie are not that special, but they add to the atmosphere. It seems like the actors are not afraid to show some pain, and it's pretty clear that they are having a hell of a time as well.    This movie is a really good watch for people with a psychological interest, or at least for people interested in a suspenseful movie with some horror undertones.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you saw the movie, you can't not love it. The only reason it isn't a 1.5-star review is because it's not perfect. It's not just a great movie, it's a great thriller. I can't recommend it enough, it makes for great theater entertainment and it doesn't come cheap at anywhere near the cost of a major motion picture. If you haven't seen it yet, do it soon.  You know the drill.   The Movie:  The Silence of the Lambs is an adaptation of Thomas Harris' classic. The story revolves around the character of Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who terrorized a small city in Louisiana during the mid to late 1800's.  The movie itself is actually not even remotely good, but it's interesting that it made it to the silver screen at all. For those who don't know, this is the first major motion pictures to be released for a wide audience. The filmmakers made it work because of its strong cast, especially its female leads. The two actors are a young Tom Hanks and an older Laurence Fishburne, both great in their own right. This is not a movie to miss, especially if you are a huge Harris fan, who just had to see him portrayed by a woman. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is a very special kind of "good movie" that comes out every once in a while that has a profound impact on me for decades to come. I remember watching the film and, although I was very young, thinking, "What a masterpiece!" It was an instant classic and was a defining moment for me. I was a little embarrassed for some reason about my age, but I had seen the film numerous times, and the experience remains indelible.   The way the film presents its characters was also fascinating, and it gave me the chance to get to know the characters and their relationships in ways that I would not have otherwise. The movie has this sort of timeless quality that has remained with me for years and years and I think it is in large part due to the way it is set up and it's presentation.  For example, we are introduced to the two main characters - a father (Frank Sinatra) and a mother (Jean Peters) - both of them struggling with some very serious issues and a relationship that is not yet mature. As Frank Sinatra's character struggles to find his identity and find the love of his life, we get to watch him go through some fairly brutal trials, some of which involve the use of violence and murder.  While Frank Sinatras character seems to be a very complex and layered one, I find that the film never really delves into this very complex character at all, instead focusing on his struggle to accept and embrace his role as a father. The film does provide some insight into the other characters, and their role in this story but the focus on Frank Sinas character is the primary focus.  Even though the story is very much centered on Frank, it does give us the chance for him to get involved in some situations which can be quite entertaining, yet it also puts him in a rather uncomfortable position and his situation is a rather relatable one. We are also given a peek into the lives of two other characters in the film - the young girl (played by Frances Farmer) who is also a child prodigy who is being manipulated by a corrupt society who wishes to keep her at the top of their society and she is the perfect example of a child with a very bright future, yet she lives in a world where they expect her to stay at the bottom.  The other character who comes into contact with Frank is a middle-aged man who has a very difficult time accepting the idea of the world that
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My review of  .   The Martian is coming.   The Martian   is the third in a trilogy of science fiction films from the same production company as Ridley Scott's Alien.  The Martian tells the story of NASA astronaut Mark Watney, who, after his crewmates are stranded on a distant planet, decides to stay on the alien planet and try to survive. The story is told in two acts, the first one consisting of two separate stories (the first part of the film) and the second one composed of two episodes (the second part of which has been released by Universal).  After the first part, Watney's story is continued by his crewmate, NASA engineer Gina Martindale (Annette Bening), and the plot gradually develops in a manner reminiscent of the early Alien films.  In addition to Bening, the cast includes Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Katee Sackhoff, and Sebastian Stan.   The film is a great success and has been widely acclaimed. It is one of those films that seems to be made with a great love for science fiction, in contrast to the typical Hollywood blockbusters.    Although it doesn't have the depth of a classic sci-fi film like the first two Alien movies, the director Joss Whedon has crafted a film that is a bit of a cult classic.     What's great is that the film seems to draw its audience in with a good plot, and while some fans may be disappointed in the ending (which does come at a cost), I feel that it gives a good representation of the space travel.   On a slightly unrelated note, you can now buy a brand-new edition of  The Mute (see below). I bought a hardcover copy from amazon for only $8.95, and I have to say that I had to stop reading halfway through the book to make room for my film collection.  I think I got two copies for the price of one.  So you've read this book and you like science fiction?   Now, for something a little more different,  You can now  Buy   A brand-NEW paperback edition  of  The Mise en Scene (see above),   by Michel Devers. This is a book that I have only ever seen in movie theaters and on television shows.  De
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Beware, this is a review on a movie that you should not see.   The movie was made by the company that made the infamous   Star Wars, and it is supposed to be the best film of the series, but you can tell it is not that way.  It starts off in a boring, generic way, where everyone has to travel in an airplane, and the plot is pretty much about the passengers and their escape from the plane. This is about all you need to know, so I won't go too much into detail.  Then the film becomes less generic, and then it starts getting better and better. This film has some great moments: there are many scenes in the plane that are pretty great. The film really goes in great directions, and it does the impossible, and shows you how it was really made. The best thing about this film is that it is very much about humans. It is not about humans taking over the world, it is about humans as humans. The characters are the humans that actually exist in our world. It gives you a glimpse of what a real person's life would be like, and not a Hollywood blockbuster, which is what a lot of movies are like nowadays. I believe this is one of the best sci-fi movies that I have seen in a long time. The story is good, but the character development is fantastic. This movie is a must watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Let's not be cynical. The thing that you say in the movie after that one scene when someone is killed in an accident, is that you hope the good guy survives.  We hope he does.    But as the credits roll, you're saying to yourself "What a jerk!   Who cares!"   We only really care if the bad guy wins.  But what about the people who died?   What do they have to live for now?  What does it mean for these people to exist now? What did they ever do?  We don't know.  So it's kind of a shame that we have to hear people say that movie.  Because it feels like it really means that the hero did something horrible and deserved it.  It's kind like a movie saying "Hey, don't try to change things.  You'll just screw it up.  This is the way it is." The movie is supposed to be a comedy so let's give them the benefit of the doubt. So we get to the part where he's about to die.  And he has his last stand.  We're supposed to get this image.  As he turns around, we see that the guy has a gun in his hand.  I understand that you can't get it in the theater and they might not get it on DVD.  How would they have gotten it there?  You're a little paranoid right?  But when you have a guy who looks like him, and is wearing this white T-shirt with a picture of him wearing a white shirt, with a pistol in his hands and you see him die, it's clear that he is about to do something terrible.  He's not a monster.  Why is he killing people?  And it is the evil dude that we're supposed in this movie to hate.  Maybe he was a victim, too.  If he really was a killer.  Or just a guy that lost his chance.  Now he's trying to come back.  Is he really going to come out the same?  I think this was really meant to be some sort of an allegory.  Something that really got under our skin, so to speak.  In a way.  That it is something that could happen to anyone.  There are things we can't predict and you know what?  Nothing really matters.  The end.  Oh

I love talking about my love of movies.  But a good one?   It's hard to even try.  I try so hard to review a good film that I don't try very hard at all.  Which is why I love to read people's reviews of their favourite films.   But, a lot of the time, those people are just fans, and they are talking about the film and not the real movie.  As if the whole film has nothing to do with the movie.    And I don't want to just have those reviews.  (See: a lot  of people writing about Star Wars, even though I haven't seen the film).    I want to know what the film is like, and what makes it a good or bad film.  "   This is the kind of review that will make me look at the reviewer and smile, but I don t want them to smile too.  Because when they smile, that means they like the movie too.   And when they like a good good film, I love it and I think about it and dream of what I would like to see it be.  And I think of the critics and their reviews, and wonder if the critic liked it too.  When they dislike it, that makes me wonder if they didn't like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw   I knew the review was going to be good, but I didn't know how good. I thought, "Is it going to suck?"   But the movie really wasn't that bad.   You can tell that they didn't want to cut anything from the movie because this is what they wanted to get across and it works.  The pacing was very good and the characters were interesting.  I found this movie really to be a movie with many, many layers and I think that made it a very good film to watch.  After a while, you can't help but think, "How do these characters even get out of their rut?!"   The first half of the movie was very slow and dark, but when you get to the end of the first half it is so good and dark and I didn 't even want to watch it the second time around.  They don't show the whole movie at once because they want you to see it piece by piece and you have to wait for it.  This is what the movie should have been.  So we have a great ending.    This movie has some very nice scenes, but it also has some bad ones, and some that I thought were not very good.  And when you watch this movie, you have some great moments and you can see where all the great scenes came from.  When we first go to the beginning, we are on the edge of our seats with anticipation.  Then we see a scene that is really well done.  There are other great scenes after this one but this one is great.  Now we see another scene that does not work.  There is a really good scene with a man getting his head cut off.  At the end, he gets the head back.  But it is not great because it is a nice scene, but because the last time this movie was shown the film was supposed to be called "I'm sorry for all the things I've done" and they did not do that.  Even the ending was really good, it has a lot of emotion in it. The character development was very well done, so much so that they make the audience feel for all of the characters.  All of the main characters had a lot more depth than they did in the first two films.  Most of the other characters had little development, but the great characters were still able to bring a lot to
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What is it about? It is an adaptation of the best-selling, and most controversial novel of the 20th Century, 1984, which is a novel about the fall of the Berlin Wall and the birth of the People's Republic of China. It deals with the collapse of the American empire and the rise of China as the world's largest economic and military power, as well as the rise and fall of several of the major American players and the American people involved with the entire event, in order to create a movie that looks at these events through the prism of politics and psychology, in the hope that it will stimulate discussion in the same way that Orwell's book did. The film's plot is extremely complex, but the story is very simple. It is about a plot that has a great deal of depth, and will keep you riveted at the very end. The plot has the American government's support of the East German secret police, known as the Stasi. In order to ensure the Stu's ability to continue its criminal activity in East Germany, the American and British governments have secretly provided the Stas with the information they needed to keep these people in power.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Why you should make this movie:  " I'm not going to lie to you; when I saw this movie, I was very disappointed. I thought it was pretty crappy. I am pretty picky when it comes to sci fi, so I thought this was a little boring. However, I think if you were looking for an excellent sci fi movie, this is definitely worth a watch. It is an old school sci fi film from the 70's that is based on a novel by Ray Bradbury. The book is very well done and there is a good amount of sci fi in this movie that will interest sci fi fans of the 80's. The soundtrack is nice, with great tunes and catchy tunes that bring you into a more sci fi space. The ending is not a surprise but it is a satisfying one. This movie is a must see if you are looking for a sci fi flick that is good for all ages. " – IMDb.com (Movie Review)  Synopsis: .  .   Starring:  the whole of '70's Sci Fi film.  that's it! It takes you through a story from the novel "The Fountains of Paradise" by Ray M. Bradbury and also through a character study of the alien "UFO" and what makes it tick. A man named George (Richard Dreyfuss) lives in a futuristic world where he has been chosen to be part of a group that will explore a small planet and report back on it. George is one of only four people who can actually see the UFO. He is tasked with collecting information for the mission and is also an amateur astronomer and an ex-satellite scientist. One day he is abducted by a huge UFO and given the task to keep the mission going. He becomes the "spokesman" of the group and they discover there are actually seven other "Spokesmen" in different teams that are on the way to a planet called "Etheria." There they learn that the world is threatened by two super powers and that they must work together to save it. This is the movie I have always wanted to see and it is definitely a fun watch! I really like the old school style of Sci Fi and this movie does not let you down. It doesn't try too hard to be complex and it doesn't have a lot of silly scenes. It does however bring some great music to it that keeps

It is definitely better than the previous movie, because there are no more jokes. It starts at a much more serious level. The plot of the movie is the same as the first one, but there are a lot of new things in it, which makes the plot a lot more interesting. The movie features some very nice animation and the special effects are much better than before. All in all, the movie can be seen as one of the best movies of the year.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My rating: 4.5 stars    This movie is very good, but is a bit different from the other great movies of this genre. It is set in a fantasy world, but has the same story like the earlier movies of the genre. I recommend watching it to anyone who loves these stories. The plot is a long one, but the good parts are enough to keep you going.  See more ▼ See less ▲  The Haunting in Connecticut (2013) This film has to be one of my favourite films of 2013. It was made by a couple of talented filmmakers who had a lot of ideas in their heads and came out with a really fun horror movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, nor to the point of becoming silly or melodramatic. This movie is made of horror, and the gore used in it is quite good. It has a great twist ending that keeps you guessing, and if you like those kinds of twist endings you will be really satisfied.  and so we have some more horror movie reviews for you. This is a remake of a movie called "The Haunter of the Dark", that was made in 2006. The movie starts off with a young woman that has been living alone since her father died three years ago. She is still struggling to get over her father's death and is getting very old and she can't face the future as it looms over her. One night she sees a shadow which is walking towards her. But she doesn't know what it is at first. It's not until the shadow closes in on her and takes her with it. Now she must fight off the monster and try to survive until the next morning. The film was directed by Christopher Landon and produced by Michael Green. The story and the performances by the two actors are really amazing. I liked the performance of Jennifer Aniston as the female lead, she has a nice and caring face. Also, Tom Hiddleston as the male lead was really amazing and has a really good acting style. He really makes the horror movie seem real and realistic. I enjoyed the soundtrack as well as the actors who were very good and did a very good job in bringing the movie to life. I loved this movie a lot, especially if you loved the old Haunters movies. It will make you want to watch them again, as I know I am going to. If you are interested in this movie I suggest watching it
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie can be so bad that the negative response can seem like an argument against the movie in question. For instance, I've read dozens of reviews about this film, and all of them feel like "Oh this is awful!" It seems like a terrible film, even by a bad director.   I found myself actually laughing at a couple of scenes.  Why isn't this more popular?   There's something about this movie that has nothing to do with the plot, it's just awful.  But, for some reason, there's an audience who watches these films and they just keep coming back.  Even though this film is terrible, I'd still be willing to watch it a few more times. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know that you should give an honest opinion. This is not the best movie in the world. I really enjoyed this movie, but I think I was the only one who liked it. There are times when the acting is just so-so. There is no plot and there are a lot of bad jokes. I think the director just wanted to play the jokes in. If you like bad jokes, you will like this movie. If not, you probably don't like it. I did enjoy it though. The movie is about two guys who are both working as police officers. The first guy is getting more and more frustrated with his job and he is getting increasingly desperate. He comes up with a plan to get out of the job and the only way is to steal a car. The car has a broken down engine so it will not be too difficult to pull off. He plans to go to the garage and get a used car and put in a key. As he gets closer to the car he decides that he will get a few extra dollars by stealing a woman's purse and then he and his partner will try to take the car. When they come back to the scene they see the woman. They can do nothing but watch as the guy takes the purse from her. He puts her purse into his own trunk and then pulls over to the side of the road to change the tire. He gets out and tells his partner that they can start up their car and drive off. When he gets out of his car they realize that they do not have the keys. This leads to a chase scene. One of the cops can't run and the other cop is being pursued by the suspect. The cop with the bad knee gets hit by the car and both men get out to check on him. The suspect tries to grab the cops gun and the cop shoots him. He then takes the guy to jail and drives off. One day, he gets the keys out of a glove box. He drives around the neighborhood and comes back to his car. He turns off the engine and then gets out to look for his partner. When his partner is gone he gets back in the car to go back and look for him. His partner is driving the car but the keys were not in the glove box and the car started. The guy runs across the street and jumps into a house that has an old abandoned house. The man is trying to steal an item, a TV, from inside a cabinet
Write a positive review about a good movie:     and a negative review:  "The story is just a basic, yet engaging and enjoyable story in a great and interesting world.  I was impressed by how it felt like a movie that was trying to be done in 3 days.  It has all the basics, yet I never got tired of seeing them in action sequences."   I thought that a story that could be done over 3 days was a good thing! I thought that that was a nice touch of creativity.  If you are a fan of movies that do things differently, then this is a movie for you.  As a fan, the story was interesting for me and I enjoyed the characters.  The action scenes are pretty good, and the script was very good and very clever.  Even though there is a huge cast of actors in this movie, it is easy to feel like a new character is introduced every time.  Also, if you are not a fan that I am a fan for a different movie, then do not watch this.  This is a great movie, but for me it did not really take me to a new world.   "The special effects were excellent, and I felt that they were a lot more convincing than in most other movies in the genre.  There were plenty of moments in this film that were just so well done.  But for me there were not enough scenes like this.  But there were plenty that I felt were very well done, especially during the finale."  I did not like any of the special effects in this, they were just not convincing.  In my opinion, they should have done the special effect effects more realistic.  At times, you see the same scene and it just looks wrong.  When you are in a fight scene and a character jumps off of a cliff, the character's foot just goes flying off.  To me, this looked ridiculous.  The special effect in this was just not realistic enough.  For me it was an interesting thing and something I have not seen before in any of his movies.  After a while, you really think that the special special effects looked too cheap and fake.  And then, you realize that these special effects are done to make the movie look cool and different.  They are used as cheap tricks to make you think that something is happening when it is not.  These are just a lot of cheap tricks that are used to take you out

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The reason you're not getting an "excellent" rating is because it's really not that good, but that is the kind of rating I give to all of the movies in the movie-club. It's not because the movie is bad, but because it doesn't really have anything to do with the real world, or with the themes of life. It is more like a "fun" movie, and the good parts aren't really worth your time. I think you should get rid of the movie and watch something that has something to do more with the theme of life - but if you're a movie-nerd who hasn't seen this movie yet, then don't worry about it. I won't spoil anything, but I think that you'd find it enjoyable - if you are in for an un-educational comedy. I thought that this movie is supposed to be a tribute to the old Japanese movies - and I was very wrong. The way it was supposed to happen is that a couple of young people meet each other in the city and get along very well. I guess it's supposed to turn into a couple-act romance, and maybe it will be a romantic comedy, but there is no romance in this movie.   They were a couple at the beginning, but it got boring after awhile. They just went back to doing stuff together after some time, and it got really boring.  The movie is more about two young people meeting each other and falling in love.  Why did they go to the city? Well, they both want to get into art, which is more or less the theme in this.  But they had to have been going on dates together to get the opportunity.  What about the guy in the relationship? The guy who is only interested in one girl, and he's not really a very good person.  You can't even imagine what he does, he makes excuses like: "she's not a good person" and "it's not right".  He probably has a lot of guilt and stress from the situation and the relationship with the girl.  There is no reason to put up with a guy like that, and I can only wonder why the filmmakers didn't show that the guy had a hard life and that they could be so much closer to one another if they had been going out.  Maybe it was to hide the fact that he is so mean and ugly.  But, again
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It has a pretty good story, and it's pretty funny in a way that's a lot more realistic than most other "filler" comedy movies.   As far as characters go, there's not too much depth, but the main two are really entertaining.  It feels like a film that doesn't really care about its "fic" status. It's like it wanted to be a movie, but it wasn't.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Best of Both Worlds, Part 2 The best version of this is the original version. There are many great movies in the Star Trek universe, and this is probably the best. The story is great, the acting is great (especially John de Lancie), and the effects are beautiful. You have to see this film. If you like the original, you will not be disappointed. - January 29, 2004Great movie  Reviewer: Anonymous - favorite favorite favorite - December 6, 2003  Subject: Good movie, but... There is a lot of good movies on the "Star Trek" franchise, and "Best of Both" is a good one. The film is well acted and directed. However, it is not a good story. The director, Joe D'Amato, didn't seem to know what he was doing at times. Some of the scenes could have used a little editing, and they had to cut a few scenes that weren't as good as they could have been. If D' Amato had known what he needed to know, he would have included some of the "greatest hits" from previous seasons to show that he had been to several different planets. And the movie was pretty bad. The sets were very small and the budget was not very good. - December 5, 2003Good movie, very bad story  Review of: Best of both Worlds, part 2 - December 13, 2003
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like to listen to a good band:  - A.W.O.L. (1954). One of those early albums by a band that seemed to grow into something special.  -   - (1955). One to remember, but not for long.  I liked this movie better than I thought I would:  You really have to see this movie before you can really get it.   I think a movie that is made for adults and has a lot of humor and a lot for the audience to enjoy and look forward to.  It may be hard for some people to find the time.  To all the critics who said this movie is not really for children, it should be noted that I grew up with this movie.  And I have been a big fan since I was a kid.  Not a lot happens in this movie, but it gets the job done and that is all you need from a movie. If you are looking for something different with a great storyline, and some action and adventure then look no further.  Enjoy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      I love this movie.   I wish the production values would be more amazing.  How a movie can change the world:  The story of a man who wanted to make the world a better place for everybody, and to show the dangers of ignorance. How we could become better people and save our world from the dangers and poverty. He got a chance to do it by being a carpenter and trying to build a house. The house was to help a poor family. When the man was finished with building the house, the family was left homeless. The man then realized that the house had a power in its creation and decided to destroy it so no other could have this power. How the building of the house changed the world for the better. He became a hero for all of the people who were watching that man trying to do his job. The movie ends with this house going up in flames and this man sitting in his house crying and telling himself he'll never change the place. But he did. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie is one that a lot of people agree is good, and that everyone likes. If the reviewer liked it, they can't argue with it, and if the reviewer disliked it, it doesn't really mean that much anyway. If a movie was so bad it really upset the reviewer, they won't be happy, and are likely to find a way to blame someone or something.    What is a good "review" you ask?   It's a review that shows you enjoyed the movie.   And if it's really bad, don't bother reading it.  The point of the review is to get you to watch the movie again, right?  Well, there's just no way you'll like a movie like The Last Samurai.  A review like this can also be read as "I can't stand this movie," but it doesn\'t really mean anything.  I guess you\'ll like the movie more if you\'re not a big fan of the movie, but that doesn\' t mean you'll actually like it.   If a good review is one where people agree that the movie is good (but that it\'s not great), then a bad review is a bad comment on the movie that someone disagreed with.  As long as the reviews are positive, they just show that the reviewers enjoyed the film.  But if people disagreed, you can be pretty sure the film wasn't as good as they thought it was.  Now we\'ll go ahead and get started with our list of worst "reviews" of the year. #5 - Ghost in the Shell (2016) I know I\'m putting my review in the \"good\" category, but I don\'t think that it deserves to be in that category. Ghost in The Shell is a cyberpunk sci-fi anime film that has received pretty good reviews in the past.  It has an interesting setting and a fairly good story, which makes it one of the best anime films to be released in 2016. Unfortunately, the film does have problems, and I can\'t find a reason why a "good" review was given. The movie does not have great animation or a great story.   It\'s basically a plot-less action film that goes on for way too long.  There are a lot more things that go wrong in this movie than there are positives, and it\'d be better if it had been done as a TV series

Porn stars, who are usually very attractive and desirable, don't tend to be as sex-hungry as you might expect. But it's really hard to find a guy who is as nice to his girlfriend as Kaya Scodelario in  This Is the End  is to her man, Jeff Bridges. This was the first time that I've seen Kaya (she's also the sexiest woman in the movie and one of the sexier actresses in Hollywood) and I think that I can honestly say that she looks and acts more like a lady than a woman and I thought she did a very good job of it. She was very flirtatious and was extremely flirtatous toward Jeff. It was so much fun to watch and she is a very well-established porn star so I really enjoyed watching her and I can only say that there were some very strong scenes in this movie. This is the End is a good film and a great comedy as well. There's lots of sex in this film and I would recommend that you watch it as well as the trailer. You'll enjoy both.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the funniest and most realistic and realistic stories in recent years.   A movie I have seen all my life and was a big fan of.  I was a fan of John Travolta when I saw it for the first time but this was an excellent actor and I felt he played a good villain.  He gets a lot of funny lines and I never expected that from him.  This movie is really good, even for a sequel.  A wonderful way to finish off the movie series!   I recommend this movie to everyone! A good movie and a great way to end the series  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Cinema was once a beautiful and magical experience. A great art form in its own right, it should be encouraged, and the cinema should be the venue for all events in society. And today, there is a serious problem: movies are getting worse, not better. In fact, they are getting very, very bad.  I was so angry at the time, and I still am: they are killing cinema. Here are some examples: In the 90s, film criticism was a safe and welcoming space for any kind of film. It was about telling people how they should watch and enjoy the film. Today, criticism is just a way to try to get more attention for one's own work. If the aim is to be noticed, so be it. But that's it. Criticism is not about telling the viewer something about the movie, but about getting noticed. The most important goal is the promotion and popularity of one's work, not to tell the viewer anything about it.   There are very few good movie reviews nowadays. People just watch the movie and then write about it later. They will usually mention the movie's star, if there is one, but never the director, the stars, and certainly not the actors. That means that the movie is getting much less attention. A movie is worth more than anything else. If it isn't a commercial success, then it won't be seen at all. In that case, the directors can be forgotten, and what's left of the movie will be remembered only for a moment, then forgotten. If only the movie directors can tell the people what makes them great, they can make their movies truly successful and be remembered by all generations to come. And if it wasn't the case that people today don't even bother to know about the director anymore, then maybe we wouldn't have this problem.  In this way, movies become more and more disposable. Movies will only get worse.   The worst part is that they are only getting worse because there are no better films. The movies are just terrible.   In the past, we had "special" films, where a great movie is made. In the 1990s, they started to go away: the best films were being made by very average films. And of course the films that we were used to getting were just terrible and boring, so it was no surprise when people started to not like those films anymore.   I remember when I was a kid,

I was actually excited to see where it was going and why the girl was being murdered. It ended with the girl's father saying "And with love from the whole family..." It was definitely not what I expected from a horror film, but it was still really cool.   The ending of the film was really great and a little disturbing. It was just right how it ended! The story is amazing and is full of twists and turns and the twist that is revealed at the end is perfect!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:        This is one of those movies that I had to wait until I got home to watch it.   I remember it from the movie theaters as a kid, so I know it's a classic!   My only complaint about this movie is that it is not really about vampires, although it does take place in one.  The movie was based on the story of Richard Matheson, a man who was a serial killer. He didn't kill every person he met, but he was very creative when he did, and it makes it hard to believe that he didn't have a good reason.  If you love the original, then you will love this movie!  The characters are all so great, and they all have their own personal issues that make them fun to watch.  This movie is also very funny, and you'll find out that it also has lots of blood and gore!  One of my favorite moments in this movie was when Richard was talking to a prostitute, and he was so horny and turned on that he just wanted to fuck her!  I love seeing a guy with a huge penis in a film, and I love a guy who gets a big boner in a movie!   There's also some great character development, and many of them have really interesting and unique back stories that make you think.  I loved how much of a character Richard was, and how he was able to take in the knowledge of his past and how that impacted him, and vice versa.    My only other gripe is that the ending didn't really match the mood of the movie.  There are lots of great endings in movies, and this one didn't end on a good note.  It was a good, fun movie, and if you haven't seen it, then I suggest you see it, because you'll like it!

There was definitely some of the "old school" feeling, but they didn't really do any new stuff that I haven't seen in a movie before.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Last Witch Hunter   A movie I wanted to see since it came out in the theatres, a fantastic movie.   It's a tale of a witch hunter who hunts down and exterminates evil in the human world.  The movie has a wonderful story line, a story line which I always enjoyed in the movies.  A great movie, with a great story line that really doesn't need to be told.  For a good witch hunter movie, The Last Wither Hunter really isn't needed.  But I can see why people like this movie.  It has a lot of fun with its monster hunting and the way it is told. The movie is very enjoyable.  It doesn't have the gore of the later ones in the franchise, but is more a story of an individual who was left in the wilderness, hunting the evil.    This film is told from an outsider's point of view.  There is no monster hunting.  This movie is more like a story about the journey of a hunter, and how they fight evil, and overcome it.  In other words, this is a witch hunting movie about the witch hunter.  I'm glad this movie is no longer made, for it's a good one.

The movie is paced well with a lot happening, and there is a lot to enjoy about it. It starts out slow and steady, but it ends strong and it is fun to watch the characters and the crew grow together. If you liked movies like Star Wars, but wanted something more serious, this is your movie. This movie would have been even better if it had an older cast. This one is worth watching, but you should be patient with it as the plot is a little slow and the action sequences can be a little too intense. This is a great space movie and I recommend it.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Avengers, the third Marvel superhero film, has many more things going for it than the last two and it certainly adds to its own mythology and character. But for those people looking to see the franchise's first "serious" story line - the origin story of The Hulk - The Avengers was a little slow and uninspiring. When I saw The Avengers, my first reaction was disappointment. This was an epic film with great fight scenes, awesome special effects, great costumes, and even a couple good bits of humor. My second reaction was more measured: I saw some great stuff but it had a bad first half and a bad ending. This doesn't have to be the case.  The Avengers had a great opening half.  This was due to a number of factors. First, Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans did a great job on their respective parts. The humor was sharp and funny, and the physicality was on point. The action scenes were strong and I loved that there was an equal balance of big and small moments. The film had great pacing and, again, the humor was always on point, but in the last half of the film it seemed to be on the money more often.   Second, The Avengers had the benefit of having a really strong creative team behind it. The creative team at Marvel Studios has a track record of making great films and The Avengers is no exception.  The directors of this film include Joss Whedon ( Buffy the Vampire Slayer ) and Anthony & Joe Russo ( Captain America: The Winter Soldier ). The directors also took care of a great deal of the production process by helping write the screenplay. This is the third film of the Marvel Studios family and I think they did an excellent job.  I'm really glad that I saw the film because I love the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the characters and world they created.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is great. I mean that very sincerely. It's the only one that has any sort of action in it, and that's the reason I give it a good rating. You will love it, though. The action scenes are good, the special effects are amazing, and there's just the right amount of humor in the movie. Even if it's not your favorite movie of all time, you must watch it.   The story, with its two sides, is an excellent one:  I am not going to spoil it for you, but the film deals with some heavy themes that you can only handle if you really feel for them. There are times when you realize how far you've come. At times, you're a bit overwhelmed, at times, it feels like you're just another one of those people in society who is fighting to survive. It was also a great movie to watch as a kid when your mom would let you watch it on the family VCR while she was at work.  It's not perfect by any means, but it's a good start and is an experience that you don't forget.  I really hope that more people will watch this movie: (don't worry. I'll try to do it soon.) ...or not.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    -5 -4 0 0   Reviewed by: M, March 23, 2017   The new film in the X-Men franchise. I would have liked the film a lot more if the ending had been more satisfying. It is still an entertaining movie and the cast (with exceptions) is wonderful. It gives me chills every time I think about it. The special effects and visual effects are outstanding. The film did have one major problem. The script. Not only did it have two major problems but the script itself was not as exciting as the action scenes. It was not until the second half of the film that we truly feel the intensity of the main characters. I do not think the script could have been written better and it should have been cut from the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie last week, but it may be my new favorite movie from the 1980s.   I watched this recently (only one night) and was surprised at how much I really liked this. The movie is about a teenage girl, a female lead named Michelle who is on a date with a younger man, named James. James asks Michelle if she is willing to marry him. Michelle is a pretty and very popular girl, but James is an ordinary, no-name high school boy. After Michelle tells her boyfriend, he goes on a tirade and tries to beat her up, so she flees.  The police are called to the scene, but Michelle manages to run, and hides out at an old abandoned house. There is a strange monster that is trying to kill her, and James has his own monster that he hunts down. The monsters have been causing a lot of problems around town for several years. The story is interesting, and it is a nice watch.  One of the things that really got me was Michelle's mom, who comes up with a plan to get her daughter out of town. Her mom has a lot to lose by allowing Michelle to stay in town, and Michelle herself has a great amount to lose.  The trailer of this movie is a bit cheesy, but in the movie, it's not terrible. The soundtrack is good, and the movie has its fair share of special effects and effects.  The characters are a good mix of likable and not-so-likable. Michelle herself is very strong, but she does go through a lot.  My rating for this movie: 8.5 out of 10 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Here is a review I made for a new film I saw.   The film in question, The Book of Eli   was a good little thriller.  The plot itself is interesting and even though I thought Eli wasn't as good as The Godfather, the film has plenty of heart and it was a nice watch.  I also enjoyed the acting of Robert De Niro and I loved the music by Bernard Herrmann, which I've never heard of.  Some of the plot points were a bit confusing and I couldn't quite figure them out until the very end.  This was a little confusing at times but there was still a few surprises for the viewers, who were left with a lot of unanswered questions, but still got to see a good flick.  This review is being posted at a moment that I have a couple of film's in the queue, so I can't give them their proper reviews yet.  A while ago, I saw The Departed. I think the film was pretty bad, but it was good fun.  Another movie that I think was pretty good, but also fun, is The Matrix, which is a much better movie.  Also, I really enjoyed "The Truman Show" and "The Bourne Identity".  I think both are good films, though not quite as good or as funny as "The Departed", but they are still good movies.  There are also a couple more films that I enjoyed as well, but I didn't have time to review them all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think I'll wait for the DVD because I know the reviews will be pretty good, but I'm glad I bought it. I've never seen this movie, but my mother told me about it and I decided to see it just because she wanted me to see a horror movie.   It is scary and very good!   The plot is very good, and I'm sure it will be scary even for people that don't know a thing about horror.  The acting is amazing, especially the lead actor (Michael Fassbender)! I think that Fass-Bach is just so good! He knows exactly how to put on a scare. I'm very glad to have seen it!   Posted by Annaliza at 12:20 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The second movie in the "Bridget Jones" franchise, which I have been waiting for since "Beverly Hills Cop" came out in 1989. This is the best of the three movies, in my opinion. Bridget's family was nice, but that was just my opinion as I had seen this movie several times before. I think I liked it better than the other two (although "Bewitched" was more interesting, not to mention better for me as a teenage girl), because Bridget has a lot of fun with her family, especially her daughter. I never found "Bebow" a real horror movie, which is surprising. In my opinion, Bridget is more of a teen idol, even though she is a girl. That was the case in "Babes in Toyland", so I wasn't expecting much from this one, and it wasn't too bad. I guess they were afraid that the teen audience wouldn't buy this one because of the "tragic" subject matter, which was true. However, in "Gidget", the "family" is really boring and the teen girl just gets kidnapped and gets killed. I enjoyed the first movie much more, and I hope that this one will not disappoint me. I am not too sure if I liked the story, but I thought that it was interesting, and that they used the first two movies as a base, which they built upon. This was one of those movies that I thought was too bad to be true, but it's so good that I believe it's true. The story could have been very different if they had put more of their creativity into the plot. The girl isn't actually kidnapped, and there's no death scene, which makes me wonder if they were trying to hide the ending (which I believe is true). What I did like was how they changed Bridget Jones from a shy girl to a "cute" girl. She didn't have to grow up so fast (even though she had to), and was able to be "curious" and "smart" as well, which helped her in the end. One thing that I found very funny was how Bridget was always called "brat" by the girls in her family. That kind of made me think that her family really was the bad guys. As a teen, I was actually really scared of them and wanted to save her. That's not a bad thing, but the

Write a positive review about a good movie:   (If you don't like me, I'm sorry.   I'm trying to make up for lost time!)    It's a bit like being a kid again.  (The kids of today's generation are really cool.)      So, it took me a while to see the movie, but I finally went for it.  There were some things I didn't like.  I would say that the movie had some nice elements, but it doesn't make it a good film.  It wasn't that it was bad, just that it wasn't as good as the plot of a modern movie.  I also have to say that there is a lot of people complaining about the story, but that doesn't surprise me.  What bothers me is that they made a good first impression for the film, and the film is just not up to the standard of modern movies.  For example, the movie has several things going on in one scene and it just can't all be dealt with.  When you have something going on that a character can't quite deal with, it is hard to make a good impression on the audience.   But the movie also has good things going for it, like the plot.    The plot was also strong.  The movie takes place in a small town in France during World War II and we are introduced to several characters.  We also get to know who the Nazis really were, how important the Battle of Normandy was for the Allied Forces and how important it was to the Allies to keep it a secret.  But the plot also didn't really have the best flow of the movie.   In the first act there is an incident where the Germans were trying to kill a certain German soldier, and this led to an attack on the village.   It seems like something the Germans should have never done, so when the Germans do this, it appears to be a good thing that the villagers are angry with the Germans for trying to murder someone.  Then in the next act, we get a completely different event.   This time it is something that was supposed to be used as a decoy to trick the Germans.  And that's just the first day of the war, so why would they do that?  It seems to be the villagers trying to trick them.   At first, it seems like this is a good way to go and the village will eventually come to understand what the Germans did. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   .  In my opinion, the movie was excellent:  I have been interested in film for most of my life and I had been wondering why people seemed to like this movie so much.  The movie was very interesting and interesting to watch.   I think it is not the best of his work, but is still good.     It took me awhile to get into the movie because I was used to him doing more of a comedy.  I'm a little disappointed that he didn't try to do the action movie he has been so good at before.  He tried to have a lot of fun with the action scenes and it just didn't work for me.  What I thought was brilliant:  After the first scene, you think you've heard it all.  When we get to the scene with the bad guy, we know he's evil because he's wearing a mask.  We know he isn't human and that's how you know.  As he starts his rampage, we realize he has super strength.  This makes you feel sorry for him and how he has to live up to the name of The Joker.  By the way, the whole movie is set up like an old western.  It's very well done with some amazing sound effects.  After we saw how strong he was, you can imagine how scared he must have been when he first heard the Joker's voice.  What made me think this movie was brilliant is that he had a great chemistry with Nicole Kidman and Heath Ledger.  These two actors were just wonderful in this movie.   They made the film seem real.  They didn't make it funny by making it scary, but they made it realistic.  At the end of the movie, you see them talking about the film and they were very proud of it.   The bad ending:  There is one moment where a young girl tries to help the man, but he hits her in the head and she goes unconscious.  Then he takes her to the hospital and tries to leave.  She keeps trying to get him to stop and he won't let her.  If you go back to the beginning, you'll see that we see him take her to a car.   When he tries to drive off, she tries to stop him, but she's dead.   Why she doesn't die is never explained.  Why does he do this?  Why didn't he leave

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie looks good, but the acting is terrible! They didn't have any actors with experience playing a young girl. One of the actors in this movie, when asked about her age, said she's ten years old! That would make sense if you actually met her, but then you realize that there are no pictures of any actress playing a ten year old girl. All the pictures were taken from other movies, with some actors playing older, like a couple of years older than the girl who's playing the role of 10 years old in this picture. It's ridiculous! The movie had a great plot. I really like the plot. A couple of older guys decide to have some fun. Then, it gets weird, and a little violent. I don't know if they did the movie for fun, but I'm not surprised if the movie did. I'll be going to the video store and looking for a copy to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you think the movie is good, then write about it! This is a way to give some good feedback, as I haven't yet read "The Hobbit", so you don't want to just write "Good Movie", but you want to praise it.   The reviewers here are generally pretty good, so don't let this deter you from writing.  The more positive reviews the better, as you can make people want to see the movie.  If there's a bad review, you can just ignore it. If there are a few negative reviews, you don´t have to worry about it. It's only if there are many negative reviews that you'll feel bad. If you just read the positive reviews and the negative ones, you´ll feel like you're being lied to.  There´s no need to write many of the negative reviews either.  I think a lot of people only go to the comments, but here you can get many different perspectives.  Again, you need to focus on the positive and negative reviews.  This is really helpful if you're writing about a film.  It´s easy to get caught up in all the details and the "why", but if you have a positive, unbiased review, it helps you write it without becoming too negative.  Remember, reviews are only a reflection of what you think about a movie, and they don´te change the movie, so write what you really think. If it doesn't fit your point of view, then don´ts blame it on the review.  Be positive, don't go negative.   Good movies always make me happy.  Don't worry about all the "bad" reviews. You can always delete them if you feel that they don't fit what you thought of the movie anyway.  In the end, it´s your movie. If a review doesn't make you want the movie even a little bit, it shouldn't be considered.  Even if the review is completely wrong, you could still learn something from it. So I hope you enjoyed this write up, and I hope this will be a useful and entertaining read for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For years I have been searching for a good science fiction film. I have seen several. I liked the first one, but had to get the sequel because I thought it would be too similar.   I went into this film knowing I would be disappointed. It was disappointing for a number of reasons.  First, this film has a good story and some amazing special effects. The second, it has one of the most irritating lead characters in the history of bad movies.  Second, the characters are boring and uninteresting, as if this film was made as a publicity stunt for the franchise.  Third, a great deal of special effects are reused to help the plot advance.  Fourth, the acting is very mediocre. The two lead actors look great in their roles, but there is nothing special about them.  Fifth, the movie is very confusing and feels very rushed.  The story is about an alien race that attacks earth with an army of space pirates.  They are called the Black Hand, and they are able to manipulate humans into helping them. This is an intriguing and complex plot. Unfortunately, the Black Hands go on to do much more than just take over Earth.  Instead, the aliens begin to destroy planets and eventually humans. They take over the cities, they wipe out cities, and eventually we see the aliens destroying a planet.  This is a big problem because if the Black hands have been so powerful for so long, they should have no problem conquering the universe.  I understand that the aliens have come to Earth looking for an army to help with their quest, but how does an army get here in the first place? What happened to Earth? Why haven't we heard of this race before? How did they manage to get to Earth, anyway? The answers are never given in the film and it leaves a lot to be desired.  After seeing this film, I can only guess that the producers had a difficult time getting the script and special effects to work.  What are your thoughts on this film?  Why is the world so boring?  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    " The Force Awakens has the potential to be the greatest movie of all time. It might not be quite the greatest film of all times, but there's no denying that Star Wars's story is one of the best I've seen." " A very powerful movie. One that feels like a very real and grounded part of our reality. Star Wars: The Force for me is a meditation on the human spirit and how sometimes we get so caught up in our lives that we lose our connection to the universe, so much so that we don't realize how important and precious it really is. And in The Force, we get a much deeper understanding of what exactly is happening and what it all means." Read a great interview with Rian Johnson:  I'm going to be playing a few parts as I work on the film, and it's great! Thanks to the internet and film school and all the people who have given me such an amazing education. This is an amazing experience. A great opportunity."

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is an old-school anime. I liked it. The story was good. The animation was good; the characters were likable. There is a lot to like about this anime. However, the plot didn't catch my interest. And, the voice acting was a little on the annoying side. The ending was a bit too easy, though that doesn't necessarily mean it was bad.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like, 'it's a good film, but it sucks', or 'the movie was fun, but the actors and actresses don't feel like they belong in it', or even 'it has good acting and it was entertaining, but I wish it had more action', or sometimes 'I liked the movie, but if I could change the ending then it would be good'. I hate the words 'it sucks', and 'I wish it were better'. The worst part is that those kind of comments come up over and over. It's very frustrating, and I don't really care about those kind the comments at all, but when I go to a movie with my friends, if they are saying things like that, that just makes me want to go home. And it's always a good day when the group I'm with has a good time. For a group like 'M!Countdown', that is something to be proud of. I would want to see more M!Countdowns like that. I think it's a shame that we don't get a lot of movies like this. Because at least this movie is something that we can actually get excited about! We don't have to rely on things like this to make good music. I thought that there were so many good songs in 'My Beautiful Girl', and I think that 'I Don't Want To Go To The Movies' and 'Sleeping Beauty' are some of the best songs from last year. I hope that we will get some more 'M!'Countdowns in the future. Maybe the directors will consider some of our good songs and incorporate them into a movie. When I think of this movie, it's like a movie I've seen a million times. It might not be as good as the 'M'?Countdown films, but at least it won't suck.  I know I said that I hated the word'stupid', but I really mean it this time. I didn't mean it in a bad way at all. Just a different way of looking at it. I was watching this movie for a year before I decided to write this blog post, and while I watched it countless times, I wasn't really expecting anything to change. I really was watching it and being blown away by each and every scene, and the way it was written made me feel really good. I felt like the directors of 'M?Countdown' knew how to craft a good story. That's
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is a little corny, I know. But I don't mind it, because the acting was great and the plot was interesting. I wish I was more like the characters because it's just so easy to see how hard it is to find the right path. I don't even know where to start...  Here's what I had to say about this movie: I don;t think we could get much more out of it than that. The film is about a group of young people and their relationship and love. These kids are in high school and are trying to find a group to go on a trip with. The group is made up of a young woman, a little boy and two girls. The two girls, T.T. and C.H. are both very different from one another. T.H is not a big movie fan, but C. H. is. This leads to some fun misunderstandings between the girls. It also leads to one of the best scenes in a movie in my opinion. In this scene, C.D. takes advantage of T. H.'s love for a movie to take her away. She does this by saying she will pay to go to the movie with her. T and C are not friends at all, so when this happens, they take it hard. There is also a love triangle between the two of them and a boy, who is also different from them. The whole story is pretty easy to follow. The only part I did not enjoy was the sex scene between T and T. They did not have much chemistry. But the movie was great anyway. You should see it if you want to see some good acting and plot. I think it would be pretty entertaining if the plot got more interesting. If you liked this review and want to check out my other reviews, please click on the links below:
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Good:  It's a fun movie with a great script that is very original. There are lots of fun little things in here too that I never would have guessed that this movie would have. I had a hard time getting into it because it is the type of thing that a lot of people don't like because they are a little too silly for the average audience. But then I got over the silliness, and really enjoyed the film.   It has a good plot, and a lot happens, not just in the beginning.  It also has a pretty good soundtrack, and the movie is pretty good on the big screen.  In addition, it has a nice message about growing up.  Some of the characters that I thought were funny:  This is one of those movies where you would expect to have some really strong and interesting characters. The cast was a really nice mix of guys and girls, and all of them had some funny little moments.  A few I thought stood out for me:  -   Sylvia (Cameron Diaz) -  I think this is probably the only character that I really liked.  This girl is pretty smart, and she is very sensitive and empathetic.  She is very young, but there is something about her that is relatable.  - Cameron - This character was quite interesting. He is really sweet, and always tries to help people.  The problem is that he really likes the ladies, and he gets caught up in all the fun things that he goes along with.  I think that the writers did a great job of showing some of his problems with his past life, and I think he really got some more depth to him in this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "You can't write a bad review of a bad movie." (from my old film journal)   If you find this post helpful, click here to share it! The second time I wrote this post, I added the disclaimer that I was only writing about the reviews of movies in the United States, although I had seen all but one of these movies in some form or another at least once. I've since learned that there are plenty of great movies that get reviewed here (though they may not get a lot of publicity here) that do not get reviewed in my country. I think it is fair to say that I will be seeing only one movie this year, so this list might expand. Here are the movies that I saw on release that are not in the list above:   A Christmas Carol (1939)    My Favorite Year (1938)   This is a list of the movies I have seen, or plan on seeing at some point this year. I've seen these movies at a wide range of ages, but I'll also include some "teens" that I would rather forget. I will also be adding the reviews that I read about these movies on the Internet, since that is where most people learn about these films. This list was updated in November of 2011. These are the "Top Five" movies for me: 1) Dr. Strangelove  (1964)  - This is the only one of the top 5 films for me that was not released in the US. I saw this film at the BAM movie house in Germany, and it was such a fantastic idea for a film that never got released here. It was also the first Hollywood film that really made me think "that's cool!"  Also, it was so funny and thought-provoking that the joke never gets old. 2) The Apartment (1960)  -  For some reason, I just can't bring myself to watch this movie. I like a good plot, and this one was well-done, but it just feels unfinished, and the ending is just really bad.  3) The General  ~(1968) ~ -   ~ is a film I saw at the first New York premiere of Kubrick's The Shining, and I still can't seem to get it out of my head. I feel that the ending of this film is the best part
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a classic example of an independent movie that could have easily been produced by a major studio. In fact, it was a major production (produced by Steven Spielberg and Walt Disney) that was a flop (it made a mere $35,000). Yet it is a gem.   The movie opens with a typical "Indiana Jones" sequence:  As an Indiana Jones type guy, Jim McAllister plays a character that is completely different from the original. When the film begins, he is a stock character.  His outfit and hairstyle are like the ones of a 1930's pulp detective.  It isn't until halfway through the movie that McAllison begins to take on the characteristics of Indiana Jones. That is, he starts learning from a man who is a master of the martial arts. The first part of the movie is all about McAllisons learning about the martial art of Shorin Ryu, from a master that is a real master.  In fact this master is a character who is supposed to represent the "Karate Kid" as he is the hero of this story.  McAllisons friend, Ray is introduced as a character (who he eventually grows to love) who teaches the two of them.  However, as they begin to learn the martial style, the two friends become the focus of the film.  The relationship between Jim and Ray is very similar to the relationship between Indiana and Marion. When Indiana is about to die, Ray helps save him by using the martial skill that he has mastered.  Ray's relationship with Jim is similar to George's with Marion. They do not love each other but they have a strong bond. The film itself is really great. It has all the elements of a good adventure.  One of the great things about this movie is that Mcallister is an actor who is able to keep his performance from ever feeling cheesy.  While the action sequences are great (especially the battle between the two karate masters), and some of the dialogue is a bit cheesy, the movie doesn't take itself seriously at all.  There is even a good moment where a villain is actually seen using some of Indiana's words.  My only complaint is that it should have included more scenes with the character of Ray.  He appears about 3/4 through the entire movie and has a much bigger role than McAllisters. While they are good scenes, the whole movie could have used more of him
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I saw that the Japanese boxart of the first trailer was a redone design from the first movie (you can see that the logo was updated) I decided to give it a try. And I was pleasantly surprised by this trailer. The trailer was well-edited, and even though there were some technical difficulties, they are at the same time a good thing because it makes it easier for fans to pick up on the subtleties. The director and actor's voices seemed to fit the character perfectly, and that makes me very happy. The movie is set in Japan and stars Toshiaki Nakagawa, Masaya Nakaguchi, Masako Miyoshi, and Shigeru Kiyohara. I personally liked all of these actors and I also think that they will do a good job in the Japanese movie industry. Now, here are my top 5 reasons why I think that this movie should be nominated for Best Foreign Film: 1. Toshiya Nakagawataki : The English Dub of this movie will be done by Stephen Michael Quee, and since he did a pretty good job with the dubs for the first two movies I will be interested to see how he will do this for the third film. Also, if he does a good Job I can only hope that the English Dub will be well-researched. 2. Masaya "Miya" Nakagasa: I was very happy to see this actor in a different role this time. He played a different character in the first 2 movies, but this time he will be playing a character who also seems to have a connection to the second movie, so I'm curious to see whether this will affect how the character is portrayed. 3. Masako "Miyoshi" Miyoshi: This time, Masami "Miki" Miyoko will play a supporting character, and I'm guessing that this is probably what we will get with Miyoshi-Miya. I hope that Miyoshi will be able to bring out the best of both her roles. 4. Masami Miyoshi (Masako): I think Masami's role will also be a lot more interesting than it was in the previous movies. I believe that this will be Masami-Miki. 5. Masahiko Miyoshi : I really liked this guy in the original movie, and although I thought that he was a little bland in the movie, I hope
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you can't like this movie, then you shouldn't watch it. And if you can like it, I wish you would let me explain why, and perhaps even watch it again.    What I like about "This Is 40" is that it manages to be a great film in spite of the fact that it was made during a really tough time for a lot of people in America. It has great performances by a lot who you would expect to be actors of great talent, and great writing and direction by the great Mike Judge.  I'm not going to try to convince you to see this movie; you should go and see it for yourself.  I'm actually a fan of Mike Judge's work and it was good to see a new film from him.  It's funny, but also dark and somewhat depressing, because it was written by and directed by Mike Judge as a movie about a guy who hates his wife and is obsessed with 40 years of her life.  This is what he's talking about in the movie when he talks about her 40 years.  He has no clue about what's going to happen to her or what she's capable of doing.  In his mind, she'll always be a teenager, her life will always be as boring as her mother's, and if he ever wanted to marry her, that would be like committing suicide.  The only thing he wants is the time he has left with her before she dies.  His wife is the only thing that he's ever had and that's why he wants to stay alive until the day he dies. He's a guy living with a woman he doesn't want.  But then, as we see, things start changing.  Mike Judge goes into great detail in the opening scene of the movie about the two years that she spent with his brother during the Vietnam War, and the reasons he feels betrayed and that he hates his brother's father for not being able to support his family.  We also get some great character insights into the life of Joe Sarno, Joe's best friend, who is trying to come to terms with the fact his father died in Vietnam.  Joe tells us why he's doing what he is doing and what he wants out of life. It's interesting and kind of touching to see someone like Joe at the start of his life and how he's trying to find out about himself and get out of his parents' shadow.  And
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was really excited to see a new movie that was inspired by the classic westerns of the past.   A lot of new films have been coming out recently, and it was nice to see some new, old movies.  It starts off pretty slow and the story can be a bit repetitive, but it builds to a very good ending.  The pacing is not bad, and they do not rush to the next action sequence like a lot of films.  A very well acted, and very well written story.  As for the actors, they are all really good.  While they may not be my favorite, they give the characters some life, and add some realism to the situations.  This film can be really difficult to watch at times, but there are a lot more action scenes and the acting is very good.    The Good:  It's a good story and has a great cast of actors.  There is a lot action, which is pretty common in westerns.  I really liked the ending.   I'm a fan of westerns, and this movie gave me a lot to think about.  There was a lot going on.  Some of the scenes can be frustrating at times.  But it is entertaining.  We get to see more of what happened, and how this story was influenced by other westerns in the past (not a lot, but still).   It is very difficult to make something out of nothing, and I think this movie did a great job of doing that.    It has a good cast, and great actors. There are a few scenes that may be a little too long for your liking, but I do believe they did their best.  One scene where they ride off into the sunset, and a whole scene where all the men are riding off into their own sunset.  These scenes could have been trimmed, but that was a small price to pay for the good story.   It will be interesting to see what the next movie in the series is going to be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I don't need a review from a woman. I'd rather see a good review about one of my favorite shows, like "Star Trek" or "Star Wars."  I have nothing against women in Hollywood; I just don't like that most of the best films of the last few decades have been directed by men. (Don't tell me about The Godfather Part II, or The Godmother, or the two most recent entries in the "Star War" series.)   And even if these films were directed by women, that doesn't mean I want them to be ignored, or that I'd prefer to watch a men's film.   I've never been a big fan of big screen heroes and villains, even when the characters are female. I like the idea of an individual being given a chance, to shine, to do something different.  But most men just aren't good enough, and Hollywood is all about the top performers, from the most talented of actors, to the best of cinematographers, to whatever the most beautiful person on screen is.  And it's also about the big bucks, and the chances to make a lot of money, whether a woman is the star or not.  It's a sexist, oppressive system of gender inequality that is completely unacceptable. But it's not the only problem.  There's a big disparity between male and female roles in Hollywood.  This is a huge problem in general, because many men think that playing a hero or heroine is a woman's job.  Women are portrayed as weak, helpless, passive characters, who don't want to fight, or to fight back.  Sometimes, even female characters are portrayed more like props: the helpless and emotional damsels.  In other cases, they're simply killed off, or they're portrayed as stupid, dumb, useless.  I'm not going to talk about any specific movie (because I've seen all of them) that's sexist and that I liked.  So I'm going to pick a few movies I thought were both good and worth watching.  1. The Avengers (2012)  (Director: Joss Whedon)  Let's be honest: most of us don't know what's going on in this movie, which is probably why we didn't get mad at its obvious sexism right away.  At first, it looked like a superhero movie. But then we realized that the movie didn't focus
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was a big fan of the film in the '70s and '80s and I still enjoy it today.   It's really a story about a family that grows out of that situation and learns to live with what they have to deal with.  This movie is definitely the kind of film that people from my generation will remember.  The writing is brilliant and the performances are great.  "The Way They Were" really captured the feeling of the era.  In the late '50s and early '60s, it was very common for families to be torn apart by the pressures of the times.  We saw a number of family stories on TV in the time and "The Ways They Were," directed by Joe Coughlin, was one of the first TV movies about the family and the problems it was faced with. There are a lot of classic Hollywood film references in this movie.  Some of my favorite scenes from this movie include when a new woman, Linda (Liz Smith) moves in and begins to act like her father while her mother tries to keep up and make her feel at home.  It is also interesting to note that this film has the best soundtrack of any of those '50's films.  Many of the scenes are filmed in locations that are now gone (such as the Coughlins' old house).  In this scene, we see the family sitting around a table and talking about their problems.  A few scenes are also set in places that are no longer there.  Here we see a scene in the backyard where the mother and her friends talk about the problems that their parents are having.  Later we see her father sitting in the driveway smoking a cigarette with his hat pulled low over his eyes.  After we have seen the mother's friends, we come back to the house.  With a little prompting from the father, his wife asks him if he thinks there is anything that he could do to help the mother.  He explains that he is aware of her problems but that he can't do anything for her.  While the scene ends in a rather tense way, it does not end on a dramatic note.  At the end of the scene, the family moves out.  There are so many wonderful references to this film, but I'll be getting to them.  I also loved the scene where we see Mr. Coughline's mother driving around looking for a place to live.  They drive
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are some movies that I watch just for the laughs and the laughs are always great.   The whole thing with the "I'm an alien!" gag, the whole thing, and the whole alien is hilarious.  I always think it's the best part of the movie, and if you like aliens, you'll enjoy it.    It wasn't even a very long movie.  Don't like to think about it:  A little hard to do on your own:  The movie opens in space, so it's pretty hard to think of any aliens.  I thought it was hard to imagine an alien in space because the movie is set in the past (well the real world but with the time travel), and the aliens were mostly from the future.  Some aliens from the past, like the space people from "Time Bandits," came from the distant future. They had to build the city to have an advantage over the aliens.   If the movie had been filmed as a series, it would have worked.   There is also some time travel going on with the movie.   The first movie is from the near future.   Then you get the "time bandit" from the far future, and you get an alien from the same future as well.  Then when we meet the real "time bandits" you can see that they are from the "past" and they are the ones who have to build their city. So they are traveling from past to future. There is one alien who comes from the real future, but is there in the present.  It was like a time travel movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It has a good flow." - David Denby (The Hollywood Reporter) The script was written and directed by the same writer, Richard Matheson, who's worked with James Cameron, Tim Burton, and Christopher Nolan. Mathes. He. D. Is. A. Genius.  I've heard it said that Richard Mathews is "the most inventive filmmaker in the business."  I think it's a good description because he doesn't just have an eye for creating interesting and suspenseful situations - he has an eye with some of the most brilliant, unique and clever dialogue in the film industry, as well as some of his best and most memorable images. The action sequences are intense and the dialog, while not quite witty, is sometimes a little dry, but when the action happens, you don't mind.     There's not a lot of plot to this film, other than the opening. The protagonist is a man, and we are introduced to him and his family in an almost dream-like way, as the story progresses. This is a film for the young adult set. It's got plenty of action, but no gore.   "It has some good gags." - John Cusack (The New Yorker)   What's funny is that there's some really good gagging in this movie, and it's not the kind of gags you typically expect in a Richard Mathey picture.  It looks like a giant penis.  He has a lot to say... in the movie itself. His voice-acting is superb.  And if you don' mind a few nudity scenes - well, that is the "style" of a good Richard Mathew movie. There are lots of shots of the characters wearing nothing but white underwear or nothing but black stockings (and they're in full view of the camera). The scene where the guy is hanging by his toes, and he's trying to hang onto something and he can't. And a little girl. You'll get the idea. And some of those are really good.  We all know that RichardMatheson is a great writer/director, as we've all seen the two movies he was in. And we know that he really likes to have his characters doing something that makes them stand out, or something that doesn't involve the characters as much as it is their situation, or that they are just there for the camera, or the sound.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was really interesting. The only problem is that it felt like it was going in circles a little too often. I would love to see how the movie would've been better if they had started the story at the same place instead of jumping around so much. Also, the music was great! I liked it when the action was happening. Also I like the way the whole film was shot. The lighting was perfect. It was all really very beautiful. And the sound was also really great. I really liked the use of effects in this movie. I especially liked the way it was used in the final fight with Gog. I thought it was awesome. Overall, it was an amazing movie. The story was really well done and the movie was a great blend of sci-fi and fantasy. The actors did a great job. I loved it. It will keep me watching the next movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie may not be as good as the movie, and the movie may lack a lot of that sparkle that makes it fun. But there's an interesting, unique story here, and a lot can be learned from watching a movie that has to be seen to be believed. I had a good time, and I think that if you're open to being surprised and having some fun with some good storytelling, this is an enjoyable adventure.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Dark Knight Rises This movie, in the opinion of myself and other people I know, is a great action film. This movie has some great action scenes that leave you in awe. The story line is great as well. The film has good voice acting by all the characters. The only thing that I did not like about this movie was a lot of the deaths. This makes the movie a bit boring when they killed off so many characters. Overall, this movie is worth watching. It is just a great movie and has a lot going for it. The movie: The Dark Knight is a fantastic action movie. The movie has a good story line, great characters, and action that is amazing. The most exciting part about this film is the Batman's transformation into The Dark knight. The fight scenes in this film are very good. I mean, the fight scenes are amazing and I am sure that you would like it if you watch it. The good part about the movie is that there are more than 4 main characters. So in the end, it's a good thing that there is a lot to see because the story lines are not very exciting. In addition, the story line does get better, but the story does get slow in the beginning. Overall the story is great and there are many surprises in the movie. So this is definitely worth watching if you like action and want a really good movie.   The Rating: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     "The Best Part of Life is the Travel." ~John Muir  In May of 2013, a few weeks after I finished my undergraduate degree, I traveled to New York City for my summer internship at HBO. Since I had already been working as a producer and assistant editor during the previous two summers, my previous position was pretty much the equivalent of being a "Travel Agent" for the network. I arrived in NYC with a full head of hair, a suitcase full of equipment, and a goal to make my mark in the world.  The experience changed me as a person. It forced me to be more flexible and inventive in the way I approach the job and the people I work with. It helped me mature as a filmmaker and expand my horizons as a human being. My time in NYC was the most enjoyable three weeks of my life. It really changed how I see my work and how I think about the world at large. , a documentary film about the journey of filmmaker Ken Burns and his team of filmmakers over the past thirty years. It is one of my favorite documentaries, and has been an inspiration to me in a myriad of ways. I was fortunate enough to meet Ken, and work with him for the last ten months, as well as watch him film in all its beauty and complexity for the first time. It was a tremendous honor to watch this man capture history through the eyes of his talented crew. The film is a cinematic masterpiece. Here's a summary:The film is in English, and includes interviews with people like Mark Twain, Robert Bly, and David Foster Wallace. The entire documentary is based around two people: Ken Burns (director of the series), and Ken Burns' friend, journalist and author Bill Bryson. Ken has spent years traveling the world, documenting the stories of many individuals. The process of doing this has been difficult and emotional, but Ken is a man who truly believes that the most important moments in life are the ones we experience with the people we love. The documentary was originally intended to be a twenty-four hour film, but the series of interviews was so well received, that the film was eventually reduced to twenty-eight minutes. I'm excited to see where Ken takes this project next.The series is currently running on HBO. The trailer is below.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched a few episodes of the original Star Trek: The Next Generation and liked it. I think the special effects were better, though. I've never seen a science fiction show quite like that.  I've watched the new movie and it's pretty much a rehashing of the series. I thought it was okay. The plot is pretty thin and doesn't really expand much on the original plot. The special effects are awesome in the movie, though, and the character development is interesting. The acting is good.   The only reason I gave this one a four star is because of the special effect work.  I gave this four stars for the special makeup effects, special effects, and special effects. I did not enjoy this film.

I would not want to see the whole movie. I could go on and on about this one and I could talk about all of the reviews that are bad. I could make fun of them.  The movie looks like it is made in a day.   I mean it is not the worst, but I just really hope that one of the critics saw it and was not too impressed.  I had a hard time watching the trailer too.  But I guess we will have to see what it looks like in a theater.

I enjoyed this film and the character of  David Boreanaz is quite the character, he is not perfect but the movie did not need him to be perfect, I enjoyed his acting. The plot of the movie is quite predictable, but the film managed to be entertaining and not boring. This movie was good enough and is better than the film, "  The Rocketeer" was a better film than this one, if this film is a success. I was looking forward to watch this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was not surprised that a good looking movie can be bad.   A great movie can even be bad, and it is very likely.  I enjoyed this movie and even though I did not find it to be very good, it still had a great impact on me.  The reason why this movie is really bad is because it tries too hard to be something more.  They do a lot of stuff in this movie that just doesn't work.  It is very hard to care about this movie.  Even though the writing is bad it is still enjoyable.  Because there is no reason to care.  This movie has only a very small cast, a lot for a low budget movie, and a lot to be desired.  When you watch this movie you have no idea who is good or bad, because it just gets all mixed up and the actors are not that great either.  There is a lot about this film that is stupid, but it still makes for a fun watch and I recommend it to people that enjoy watching things that are just for the sake of making them appear better than they really are.  Don't watch this when you want a good, action packed movie. If you want to see a fun action movie then look for the next movie that is called Black Hawk Down. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a little bit worried about this movie, but it turned out to be really good!   This movie is a retelling of a story from Greek Mythology, about Hercules (Aristophanes) and the three Amazons (Marina Sirtis, Christina Hendricks and Lucy Fry) who are trying to save their homeland from the Romans, and the Romans don't take too kindly to this. Hercules and his group of heroes do everything they can to try and save their land from destruction. Unfortunately, Hercules and the Amazones don't make it out of there without being taken hostage by the Romans. In the end, Hercules takes the Amazzones into the sea, but they are not happy about this, and in the end Hercules does not escape, and they are all killed.   Although this is one of my favorite movies, it is not one of the greatest of the genre. For starters, it has a weak story and poor acting. Also, the characters, especially Hercules, are extremely corny and are only there to help out the other heroes. Overall though, this movie is not bad. It is just not great.  1.1/5
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a movie that has a bad reputation as the "dumbest" film ever, there are many good points to it. A small cast, who I liked a lot, has to work hard to do what the lead actor wants to do and does. Also, this movie shows that you don't have to be stupid to act in a film. Also the scenes that follow some of the scenes are pretty good, in my opinion. I would love to see more films like this.

I recommend this for anyone who likes a movie with lots of good action and suspense. I will definitely be watching this movie again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is good in many ways but its weaknesses are obvious.   There are some really good parts in the movie.  The way it plays with the narrative is brilliant, and there are great set pieces where you can really feel the intensity of the action.  There is a good pace to the movie, and the film is relatively short (just over an hour).   However, as a film about women's liberation, it feels like a film that was made for a less enlightened era where women were forced to act in roles like the ones portrayed in the film.  Also, some of the scenes in the theater are very stereotypical:  For example, some women are forced to sit on the floor during a scene in which they are being raped.  This is a movie, after all, that was written in the 1930s.  One of the women who appears in the book is an actor who is clearly over the top in her performance.  In this film she's not.  It seems like it was done for political correctness in the early 60s when it was first released but in the end it just adds to the film's problem and makes it even harder to take.  Even the women's rights movement of the era was far more feminist than the film shows.  What makes it worse is that in many scenes the women don't do anything.  They are not seen as real characters.  Many of the other women characters seem very artificial.  I was also saddened that this is one of the only great movies of the 1970s not directed by David Lynch.  For a long time, people believed that Lynch was responsible for the death of Lynch's career.  With this movie, however, we have a pretty good film in a Lynch film.    I guess that is something that could be argued.

If you are looking for a serious flick about military action that will bring a smile to your face then look no further. - This is a movie that should be watched at least once because the story can be hard to follow, but if you stick with it you will be surprised about what it has to offer. - The voice acting was very good and it was entertaining at times. If there is one thing that can be improved it would be some more background music, but overall this is a really fun movie to watch.

The main character is interesting.  What I disliked:  I don't like it when the main character gets kidnapped by a strange looking alien creature.  We only see what it looks like. We don't get to see its motives or how it interacts with the main characters.  I was hoping it would turn out to be more interesting than it was.  The alien is a bad guy, and his motives are questionable.  You can tell from the first 5 minutes that it's supposed to be a horror movie.  It's too bad because the first half of the movie is pretty good and if the alien had some motives that would have been good.

The original movie was a decent horror flick. It has a good story and the action was good. This movie has a very poor acting of actors in the movie. I would rather watch the movie in HD than the SD version. There is a scene in the middle of the movie that was just horrible. It's like a porno film. I'm not kidding. It felt like it was a cheap film that was made to get money. I know horror has always been a porn genre, but I guess in a porn film, it is OK. The scene where they were talking about how bad the movie was was not a nice scene. When you watch the film, you can't help but wonder if they had a budget of $600 to $700. But the movie is good. You get a good scare. I liked it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   .     I've loved "The Hunger Games."   I'm in love with Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and the rest of the film's cast.   This is a very, very good movie.  It was also, at least for me, very controversial.  In the first "Hunger Games" movie, a series of books that are part of the Catching Fire series, we had a young man named Panem (Josh Hutcherson).  Panem grew up in a world of brutality, cruelty, and torture.  He had the ability to see the future.  His best friend was Katnuss Everdeen, a young woman who would become his first love, and become the last surviving member of her kind. Panem and Katnus soon became the most popular characters in Panem, a world where people are trained to fight in a Hunger Games in which the victor is the one who can survive the most.  Panems and Katnis are given special weapons called Katnics that have the power to alter people's behavior and perceptions, like Panems ability to kill.  These Katnenses have to be collected.  To have a Katnical you have to survive the Hunger Games.  They are held for a season (about 4 years), and during that time, you are chosen at random.  If you survive the first few years of the Games, you become the Queen and are able to have children with your victor.  When the last girl/boy has been eliminated, the victors are separated, and each receives a Katni.  Each Katni is a key to another world.  The world of Panem is the world of the young men and women who survived the first games.  Katnis were given to those with noble blood, and their powers are passed down to children who possess them.  We see that some children are able in the beginning to shape the world in their image.  There are many Katnians around the world, but not very many live in Panems.  So when Katnissa says to her mother that she will become the victorable victor, she's basically stating that she's going to try and mold this world into what she thinks is best.  What makes this even more controversial is that there are a lot of children who are left behind.  As an orphan, Katnys mother tries to
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When it comes to movies, you're supposed to talk about the good parts. But when it comes down to it, you'll probably only remember about 90% of it. But I'll try.   I love movies.  They're so much fun.  When you're young, it's a lot easier to have fun than to be a good person.  The fun doesn't have to be about sex.  I've seen the film "It's Only a Paper Moon" before.  And even though I had to look it up, it turns out that the plot is basically the same as "Love Story".  The whole story is about a boy and a girl who have sex.   So, what's wrong with having sex?  Is that going to ruin your relationship with your girlfriend?  Well, yes.  But what's so wrong with fun and romance?  They can have it and still be together.  Even if you only see the sex, they are still together. And that's really the point of the movie.  This is the girl you're dating.  (The girl you've just had sex with.) This is her best friend.  How can they be together if they're just doing it, right?  This is the guy you're about to have sex with.  He's your best friend too.  His mom doesn't know he's having sex, but he doesn't care.  If he's the one having sex with her, that's a huge conflict, right there.  This was a movie that was released before "Love" came out, and was released after "Love".  My mom didn't know about this movie, but my sister and I did, so we watched it together. It's actually pretty good.  Now, there are two big things that are different from the original movie.   The first is, this one was directed by an American.   I always think the movies I've liked in high school have been directed by Americans.  Sure, there were a few foreign films like "Tales of Terror" (1968) and "Casa di Venezia" (1964), but even though they were made in other countries, they were still American.  Sometimes you really need to just watch your favorite movie with your parents and not your friends.   There's one more thing.   This one was originally released in the 70s.  Yes, there
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Good   -   Catching up with this movie for the first time after the events in the first film (and the sequel), there's not much to say that hasn't already been said. This was very much a psychological thriller that was based on real events. This movie is about two men, who work together on a murder case, and their relationship. The movie doesn't try to give a more interesting story than the original. It is a thriller with some suspense and even a bit of humor. The characters are very likable. The only thing is that this movie is not as good as the first one.   The Bad   This movie feels a bit like a watered down version of the original movie.  The movie focuses more on the action than the suspense of the characters. It has the same atmosphere and style as the original, but not the same story.  It has nothing to do with the original film.  Overall, this movie isn't any more interesting than the first movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for an action thriller that is not too long. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love a good old-fashioned movie with a story and a plot, not too complicated, well told with interesting characters, a good pace and a well-written script.   In The Devil's Advocate   this movie was the result of two brilliant directors: Stanley Kubrick and John Frankenheimer.  The Devil Advocate  is a film about two lawyers, who, during the 1960's, are trying to overturn a jury verdict that they don't believe.  Kubrick uses the theme of a man in denial of his feelings (one of his strongest themes), which he applied in Eyes Wide Shut (1999) (see the post of the same name, which is a great movie in itself) to a totally different type of subject: the law.  Frankenheimer uses the themes of a law office, which he also used in his classic courtroom movie The Men Who Stare at Goats (1957), to a completely different type, which we will talk about next.  There is a good story in The Devil Advocates, and a good script by Stanley Kubrick, but I can't say the same for the film.  When I first watched it I was expecting a film with a more complex plot, and I felt the same way when I watched it on DVD.  It was a good idea to do a movie about a law firm in the 70's, but the way the movie was made really hurt it.  First, the screenplay was not written in a professional way, and it is a bit hard to understand what is going on, because of the lack of dialogue, and the lack o the editing.  Second, there were a few scenes that had a lot of dialogue and I did not know what they meant until I watched the movie. Third, even if the story was good, the characters were really uninteresting.  I think that The Devil advocates had a more interesting plot, but it was a shame that the story didn't make sense. I think that this movie had more impact in the 1970's, because it deals with the same topic as The Men who Stare a Goat, but with a different kind of drama and a different tone.  For example, if you look at Eyes Wide Turn (1978) and you notice how close they are in the stories and how much they tell each other, it is clear that there was a lot more plot in that movie.  If I remember correctly, I think Eyes
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When a film is good, we like to be part of it.   Like a good novel, it's a story that we're looking forward to and that we know will be worth our time.  When movies fall apart and don't make it, that's when we look for explanations.  So when we hear that a film makes a lot of money, it makes us hopeful. We are hoping for the same thing in our favorite movies.  If a movie makes a ton of money for a long time, it just means it was worth it. It has gone down in history as a great film.  After hearing good things about a movie, it gives you hope.  Once a movie is good and a few people love it, it becomes something we talk about.  As I watch a film, it gets better and better.  This year is full of great movies. There have been a lot movies released that I love, and I'm excited to share my experiences with you in this article.  Some films are just great and other films are great for other reasons. I've watched a number of these films recently.  I feel like I can make a statement about each of them. I'm sure some of them will be polarizing.  And that's OK.  The goal of these reviews is to inspire people to watch these great movies so that they may enjoy them and that you, too, may enjoy a film. We all have our favorites.  In addition to my favorite movies, I am also a fan of TV.  There are so many great shows, so I can't even list them all here.  But if I had to, I'd probably do this.  For my list, I'm doing a movie that was on television for a lot longer than it was on the silver screen.  Back in the days of yesteryear, there were a number film directors who could take chances and experiment.  Today, many directors are more likely to stick to their style. But back in the day, directors had a lot more freedom.  It was a different time, and there were so many films being made that people didn't know what to make of.  Films like  The Godfather,  Jaws, and Star Wars were dominating the box office.  Yet even though these films were big, they were a surprise.  These films still hold up to this day.  One of the first films I ever
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (10/8) - I have not been watching a lot of horror movies lately, and this one might be one of my favorites of late. I don't really like most of the other stuff, but this one I really liked. This is a good film, and it doesn't really have to be a horror movie to be good. It really can be just about anything, and I really enjoyed it. One thing I don's like about this is that the ending was a surprise, and that just makes the whole thing much better, I think. I'm definitely going to have to watch this again. (10/15) - Good movie, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Good story, it kept my interest for the entire time, and didn't let go of my attention even when some of the horror stuff happened (spoiler alert - it did). There was a really cool scene near the end where the evil witch tries to kill all the kids, and all they want to do is run from her, but they can't because they have no shoes. That's just hilarious to me. I like the music that plays when the evil witches come in, too. This one had lots of great moments, and the ending actually was a nice surprise, I thought.   (10.5/10) - It has a great story, and there was a little bit of horror in it, but it's still a good time. The music is awesome, and has the classic horror feel.

I enjoyed this movie a lot. It has some good horror elements to it. I also liked that the film never goes off into horror territory and tries to be a simple, dark and disturbing thriller. The movie has some great acting and a well paced story. I really liked this movie and it gave me chills!  Was this review useful to you?
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's one of the most entertaining, fun, and heart-warming movies I've seen in a long time. It's a love story with a lot of drama.

It has the potential to be great and I'm glad it isn't, but it's definitely not the worst thing that the DGA has produced.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A simple story, but a really good one.   It's been a while since I've seen a film that's been so compelling, and the story just keeps getting better.  With all the recent news about the end of "Twilight" series (the latest chapter coming out in 2013), I thought about whether I wanted to see more of "Troll Hunter," and decided that this film did have a lot of good things to recommend it to a wide audience.  I think the story is very well done and it has some great scenes.  There was one scene that made me smile like "Fantastic Voyage" when Peter Weller and Audrey Hepburn were kissing in a bar.  This movie is just very well acted and it had a good cast with some of the best performances I've ever seen.  The film looks great and it's pretty well directed, but it really is about this one small village of the trolls.  It does make me wish they had more to it, like a bigger cast or more of a story, as it would have been interesting to see what happened in their lives when they came up with this plan to find their lost brother.  Overall, I'd say this movie is worth a watch, even if you haven't seen any of the "Twisted Tales" movies (I haven't), but I recommend watching it before reading the book.  "Trolls in Winter" by Stephen King This is another movie I was introduced to by reading this book and this movie just made me remember a lot about it.  Now I've been to the "Fantasy Lands" in the past, but this film really made me wonder what would be like to live in that world.  "Trololo's" is the name of the town, and it isn't just for the people, but also for all the trolls in the area.  They all live together and it just seems like a very nice place to live.  When we meet the trolls it's hard to believe that they are the same tribe that were in "Twist of fate," but they are.  Some people have said that the characters are based on a lot from real trolls, but I think this movie takes a lot more of the spirit of the original book than some of those other movies.  First, the movie has more trolls and more of them.  Second, the story starts off very slow.  But it
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A little girl's wish to visit her favorite candy store was answered with joy and excitement, and an unforgettable experience.   There's something for everyone here!   Recommended to all those who like movies about kids (and adults, too), and the only downside is the over-reliance on the kids and their reactions.  What a great movie!  (If you're into this kind of movie, I highly recommend it)   When I saw a commercial for the movie, the one in it made me laugh hysterically.  I had no idea that that was what this movie was all about, but it's sooo much better than it looks, which is a good thing.  "You don't say!  It's like I'm wearing a big, purple and pink costume!  " The movie was rated PG, so that meant kids under 12 were not allowed.  This was the kind of kids movie that was played on Saturday afternoons, as it was on PBS Kids.  It was so funny that it had people watching the TV in the kitchen, on the back porch, in the car, and in other places I didn't know about.  The candy shop scene, which was so much fun, was shot in the backyard, and the candy store itself was a place we often went to.  "This is just like your dreams!"

Write a positive review about a good movie:    * This post has been corrected.  "I'd rather watch my wife be tortured than sit through a movie with a good plot, bad acting, and bad writing. " - Jeffery Deaver   "The story is terrible, and there are no actors who aren't over the top." - Jeff, "Pleasure to Meet You,"  "You should be ashamed. The world would be a better place without this movie." - Joe G., "Cindy and Dime: A Tale of Two Twins,"  the movie about Cindy and Dima.  This movie is terrible. A movie with no plot, which is almost the worst thing, no plot means there is no purpose or logic for the plot. There are no characters or things to care about.   Now this is an extreme example of what happens to an American film, especially a war movie. You can see this in the horrible acting, no voiceover, and poor acting (in a war film). The bad actors are really bad and are forced to pretend that they are good and they are horrible. All you see are actors who are bad and acting badly. The acting is so bad that it is really hard to believe in these characters. In war movies, actors are usually either very good or extremely bad, because they are not supposed to act well. This movie has no acting. The people who are supposed to be good don't have any dialogue to say, so they don't even have any character. They just do things randomly.   in the middle of the movie, Cindy (Gloria Stuart) is killed by a sniper while the bad guys are trying to escape, which makes no sense. But even then, when the bad guy (William Shatner) and Dina (Elizabeth Shattuck) escape, she is still alive because she was hidden in a car and then they escaped.   "They killed my wife and then I have to go home?" The other guy's (Robert MacLaren) wife was killed by him in a helicopter, so the guy must have loved her because he gave her to the guy who did the bad stuff. But if he loved her so much, how could he have given her to a sniper to kill her? And they both have guns that must be bad, too, because there are only two of them in the movie. And so it is even more confusing than this when we are supposed be watching two

Write a positive review about a good movie:     "The first time I saw a movie I saw it like a movie; not a stage-play, not a play, not an episode of an old TV show, a movie. The movie was the film, and its characters were the actors. In the movie I was not simply watching a film, I was part of the film's characters, and the movie's story. The film took a life and breathed life into it's characters and the story as well. I was there and I felt it with every action that character took, every speech they gave. I never realized how true it was until years later."   " "This movie has an incredibly original, unique, wonderful story. This story, I would say, has more heart than most Hollywood movies do in one hour. There is romance in this movie and humor as well, so it is not just a story of good vs evil, good vs bad. In this movie there is a balance. We have a good guy, a bad guy, and a hero. But when it comes to the good guy's true nature there is more to him than one would think. There are evil things inside him too, a good side and a dark side. These were not the only two sides to him, but they were the ones that gave him his edge." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love horror movies, and a lot of the horror movies that are out at the moment are good. So, I was very excited to see "Cleaning Up" when it came out on cable. The reviews were all positive and I felt like it was going to be a good, well-made horror movie. It wasn't. I am a huge horror fan and I was hoping for a good one. Well, the movie didn't turn out the way I would have liked. It was boring and the effects weren't as good as they could have been. I just couldn't take it. I don't really care if this movie was supposed to be scary, but it was not. Also, I didn't think it was funny at all. I found it a little annoying. It didn't have anything going for it and it just felt like a very basic, boring horror movie, which is disappointing because the reviews were so good. I think the movie will have a few fans and I think it's probably the best movie of the season, but overall, I think that the reviews of it were probably too good and the movie was a real let-down.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    How do you feel about the upcoming Star Wars  trilogy? Do you see the movie as a good starting point for the new trilogy? My favorite part of this movie is the space battle in the middle and the battles in the asteroid belt. I do like the fact that this movie has an overall good quality of scenes. The only thing is that there is only so much room in one movie for the entire space battle. If we were to get more action I think the movie would have been great. I loved the battle on the Death Star. I like the scenes where we see the Rebels escaping from the Imperials.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My favorite horror movie, in my opinion. I love this movie. The acting is excellent. The story and ideas are good. There are some flaws in this movie, however, most of those are minor. The plot is solid. The special effects are good, but there's no sense of tension, as you see the monster in each shot and each one of those shots is just long. There's only a couple of scenes that are really suspenseful. The music, the atmosphere of the movie is great. I really like this movie a lot. And, I think you should see this movie to see how great it is. There was a time, when movies like this were rare. If you want to see a movie like this, you should probably look for it online. You can get it for about 10 dollars on-line. You get to watch it and see for yourself. It's definitely worth your time and money.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Posted by Unknown at 4:45 AM I'm going to start with a disclaimer, as I'm a very new blogger, I know nothing about any of these actors. This is just based on the news media and how I've seen them on TV and in movies. I will try and give this movie a more critical assessment, I hope that makes some sense. Let me start with what I thought the movie was, and it was a very good movie. The characters were interesting and had a lot of emotion, and the story line had some very interesting twists. But the movie didn't have any really great visual effects, there weren't any great action scenes. The ending was a little too predictable. The movie was just okay, and I'm not a big fan of Sci-fi, but it was entertaining. I would highly recommend this movie to Sci-Fi fans, but not for Action fans, as it's not very interesting. And don't bother watching this with any children. (They might think it's a cartoon). I had to rewatch this movie three times to figure out what was going on. And my parents were too scared to watch with me. Don't think that it's worth the money. My mom and dad are really disappointed with this movie. Posted By RAY at 9:37 AM
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Good movie, nice to watch, like it's a little bit different from other movies about this genre. It has a funny humor, a little more than the average movie, that was interesting to watch.   The only thing I didn't like is the ending, and it wasn't a good ending, because there was too much unanswered question. So, I'm still giving it 4/5 stars.  I saw this movie because of the good review it received. And I must say that I think it is one of those really good movies that made me really think about my life, and in the end, what made me happier.  It is a good film with a nice story and the humor was very funny and enjoyable to watch! This movie is about a little boy that wants to be a scientist. He has a dream to become a scientist and is trying to find a mentor to help him. But all the kids who work there, and there are a lot of kids working there, are so mean and don't want to be around him because of his attitude. And in the beginning he is a little annoyed that he doesn't get any help, and that there is only one person that is there and he doesn`t get any of his help. But in the ending you will understand why he is not getting any help. This was a good and funny movie and I think that it really made me think about me. And if you have a chance, I would like you to watch this movie and really think that you are the person who would like to be the scientist and you want to do your best. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "My favorite was The Room, starring Tommy Wiseau, an Irishman, who makes you feel he really is from the States. It's a dark comedy of the best type."   This movie was like The Room and I had to go to an interview with Tommy for a job.   And it was a wonderful interview. It was at his house in a small town in England.  There were other people there as well and it's not an uncommon thing to have people over to your house. Tommy Wise "The Room" is based on a screenplay by Tommy Wiseby which was based on the short story of the same name. It has a wonderful cast of characters with Sean Penn, John Cusack, and Kristen Stewart.  I went to the interview because it was on TV and there was a big part for Tommy.  The part for Sean Penn was that of Tommy's brother.  At the end of the interview, Tommy said that I was a very nice person and wished me a good evening.  This is one of my favorite movies.  The characters and the atmosphere were very realistic and you felt like you were really there.  My favorite part was the first scene, in which Tommy comes in and sits in his brother's room, talking about his brother. The scene was filmed at the end because Tommy had to leave for the airport. I don't know when that was shot but I'd love to see a good video of it.  "The way he walks. His mannerisms, the way he looks at people, the expressions in his eyes...his face, it is a very...well, a very handsome young man. It just brings me back."  He is a wonderful actor.  If you haven't seen it, you should.  He had a great performance and is now making a movie.  - April 4, 2013The Room

I have not been to a film in ages that has so much character and so many fine performances. I think this is one of the better ones of recent times." I'm very excited to try out the second season of The Last Of The Mohicans as it looks like it's going to be very similar to the first season. I've seen this in theaters so many times now and I'm just amazed that it's still worth seeing on the big screen.
Write a positive review about a good movie:      "One man's trash is another man's treasure" - Richard M. Daley   BENEDICT LEE IS A MESS!!   This film is just the most embarrassing trashy comedy ever made, a pathetic attempt at comedy by a director who thinks his talent is better than anyone else's. A film that makes me cringe, a film that shows a lack of respect for both the script and the actors involved, a movie that is full of ridiculous dialogue, laughable acting, and a cast of the most despicable and unfunny people to ever walk the planet.   I have been watching this movie for over 10 years and I have never been more disgusted. If I'm being honest I don't see it being any more funny or entertaining.   a terrible joke told at the expense of a completely innocent child (forgive me if I'm not able to find a decent way to describe this scene) is a joke that has since made it's way into the canon of the "B-B-Movie" genre, but the fact is that it was told in such a way that would make you think that the director thought it was funny and that he was somehow brave or something for even bothering to make a joke about this story. It is one of the worst scenes ever put into a film.   I cannot believe that anyone would think it funny to see someone like that in a film, much less a director with a professional resume who has won an Academy Award.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Why is it difficult to find a good story in the movies? In a recent column I wrote about the decline of the good story and the rise of the "feel good" movies. We no longer have a lot of them. It seems that if a director wants to make a good Hollywood film, he has to make something that is not the least bit sentimental or emotionally engaging. But we do have the movies like The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1962), the classic film that defined a generation. It made a lot for Hollywood, and in fact it was its highest-grossing movie ever. It was a good film, but I think it was written at a time when Hollywood was desperate to make the most sensationalistic films they could. But the Good, Bad, & the Uglies is about a group of soldiers who find out that one of them has a mysterious ailment. Their situation is far from simple, and they struggle to stay alive during a war that is going nowhere fast. I do not know if it was this that led to the rise in sentimentality in Hollywood films, but it probably did. But I think that even if you do not like the movies or think they are no longer as good, there is still some good stories out there. For example, The Devil in Miss Jones (1996) was an adaptation of a book. This movie was not very good, but its main character did have a very good story. The most recent movie that I can think of is The Green Mile (1999). It was also written by a book author, but unlike the movie, this film was based on a true story. It had all the elements of a good drama, and did very well with its big Hollywood budget. The Good Wife (2011) is a TV series which is about to start. A lot of movies in the series are based on true stories. There are a few others, but The Good wife is the most popular of them all. It is set in a very interesting and complicated world. Some movie reviewers have also noted the decline in the quality of the movies. I think the problem is not necessarily with the movies themselves, but with the audiences. We have moved away from seeing a movie because it is good, to seeing it for what it is about. We now look for the emotional connection, but not necessarily a good one. One of the main reasons I watched the second season of Breaking Bad (2008),

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What's the point of a review, you ask? Well, there are two purposes. First, you can share with friends about the movie you saw. Second, you may write a review of your favorite movie. However, don't start a review if you don't like it. It won't help you learn something. Try to have an objective and objective review.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like the video above, "My Friend Dahmer" is a very dark and gritty documentary. It has been made to show the horror and insanity that followed Dahmer's life for a very long time. His life took a dark turn at just 13-years-old. It shows his transformation and subsequent arrest and conviction at the age of 18. Dahmer was the most disturbing serial killer in the history of America, killing at least 17 people in a 9-month period from 1978-1979. Dahmies crime, and life in general, shocked the nation. The film shows how much was left unsaid and how much remains a mystery. The story of "My Friends Dahmer," is a bit of an odd tale that makes you wonder what truly happened in this crazy person's life. In addition, this is a tale of people who were "right" and "wrong." It is also a film about a man's struggle to control his behavior and to be the person he thinks he is. "My friend Dahmer " does a great job of showing that even with all the evil he had done, Dahmer still had the capacity to have some good in his life. It is very disturbing, but it is still a very worthwhile documentary. This is a movie I would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for an in depth look at an important part of American history. The documentary starts off with Dahmer and some of his friends who were very close to him. They all were caught in the middle of this horrible case. As the documentary progresses, more and more of Dahmer is shown. The first half of the film is not about Dahmer, but is about his friends. Some of the friends are there to ask questions about the past, and some are there because of the story of Dahmmer's trial. There are many scenes that show some of the more gruesome parts of the case, including Dahmer committing the crime. The second half of "my friend dahmer" shows the aftermath of Dahmers case, showing the people who came in contact with Dahmsters life. Dahmers trial and execution is the main focus of the movie, but there is a great amount of other information in the documentary as well. The main thing I liked about the documentary was the fact that it did a great deal of research into Dahmers life, including his family. I like to see a documentary on someone's life, and I think this one did a very good

It's an underrated gem from the 80s. If you like sci-fi and space/dynamics movies you will enjoy this. I love the concept and the design of the ship. The soundtrack was amazing. I also really enjoyed the character interactions, the plot was great and the action scenes were awesome! I can't wait for the Blu-ray release to see what's added to it!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    How do you like my new hair color? It's like a warm blonde I guess. How do you feel about me dyeing my hair blonde. I'm still getting used to it. My dad thinks I'm getting too old to be getting new hair. He said it might look too old. I don't think I have any hair left after this. Thanks for the compliment. It means a lot. I've been dying my hair like this for a while now. I think it's my natural look now. My hair is lighter so I like the darker color. What kind of hair color should I go for? How do I dye my hair? I don How have you been doing? I have been going to the gym. It's been hard working out. Do you still want to go to the studio? No! I still want my own place. It would be cool if you could come out for a bit. I won't be gone for long. So I'm going to have to be quiet. I love to speak my mind. I am getting along great. My sister came to visit us in California and wanted to hang out. I told her about the studio. I made sure she saw the pictures on the walls. She's very curious now about what the studios are like. We should all be. It was a great visit. She said she's looking forward to coming back. She had a great time! She's the most down to earth person I've ever met. She likes to go out with the girls. She loves getting dressed up. She always keeps it up. I bet she's the only girl in the world who does that. I would have thought my sisters would be in the studio doing something a bit more serious. I really love that they both want to be in this. She has some great ideas. What can I do to make my friends jealous? Well, it's really important for a girl to be interested in another girl. She should really get to know her. Her friends can help you a lot! Well, I feel like I should thank you. It took a lot of work to get this place up and running. The walls and pictures are expensive. It really is expensive. I had to borrow money from my parents. It wasn't easy doing it. How is it going? I guess I'll let you know when I'm about ready to leave. I want to make sure I can take care of myself
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's not that easy   If this movie had been released in the 90s, the people of Japan would've screamed in agony because they would've had to pay for a sex toy. But because it's been made in 2015, the movie will appeal to a wide audience of males and females, teenagers and adults, and because they've taken their time to make a movie that's good, not just a sex comedy, the fact that the actors are talented and the script is excellent is enough for people to enjoy watching it. The sex is very good, I'm not saying that it's the best in the world, but it's better than most of the other movies you find in the genre. The characters are very likable, although they are probably made to look like some kind of parody of anime characters (see: Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle). I really like how the movie tells the story and doesn't make it obvious what the actual main character is. It's just a very good movie with some great sex scenes. The movie will definitely make you think about masturbation, because it is very sexual and is a film you should watch in order to understand how you masturbate. It could be good for a beginner because it doesn't show you the process of masturbating, and that can be quite confusing for a person who doesn't know exactly how to masturbate (unless you're a very sexual person). It's a must-see for anyone who masturbates, because most people masturbate the same way. So if you want to watch a great movie that has some great scenes and you're not that experienced, give this a try! Rating:  8/10

It'll make you cry and it'll make your heart flutter. This movie is a must watch and one you should try out.   Hilarious and heart warming!   When I found this movie, I didn't know where to start with this movie. I was very impressed, I really enjoyed this movie! I hope more people will watch it. I found it very funny, entertaining, and good to look at. I felt that this movie had a good ending. It has a few cliffhangers, but everything ends in a satisfying way. The movie has more than one plot and there's a lot of it, which makes it more complex. You should check out this movie if you like comedy, drama, and heartwarming stuff. It is worth a watch! I really appreciated this movie and you should check it out!
Write a positive review about a good movie:        I love all kinds of movies, but I've had some pretty lousy ones over the years.   I loved   the "Mystic River" in the 70s (a true masterpiece, but overrated at the time), but I don't care for the "The English Patient" or "Casablanca" much, either.  My favorite films are those I can revisit from time to time, either for one movie night or as part of a week-long trip.  Here is a clip of  "The City and the Pillar", the third installment of the  " City of Golden Dreams" series (the first two films were  " City of Angels " and  "City of New Orleans" ).   The film  is a story about a family of four as they travel through New Orleans after a natural disaster.  You can see how the characters' emotional journey is both real and dramatic.  The music, by  Maurice Sendak, is also very beautiful.  (I was at my home in Washington, D.C. at the start of filming.  I was very pleased with how much this movie seemed to be about me, because it was based on my own experience, both good and bad.  A couple of other reviews you might want to see:  " The City of Dreams"   by  George R.R. Martin, "My Best Friend's Birthday" by  Mary Gaitskill,  "A Thousand Acres" by John Steinbeck.) Here's a clip from  "I'm Not There", a  film by Paul Simon about a father and his son who try to find their way after a car accident and a flood.    The film is the first part of the Simon Trilogy, about two people in their mid-forties who are in search of a missing son.  And here is another clip from the "City and the Pillars" series. "In the Heart of the Sea" (1966)   "Gerald's Game" (1968) "The City And The Pillar" is a classic story.  It's a classic movie. I think that's an understatement.    "City Of Golden Dreams", a movie about two families. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   'Star Trek: The Next Generation - Evolution' is a wonderful and enjoyable sequel to Star Trek: Generations, a wonderful follow-up to a great movie.    Star Trek was a great series, but to really explore the galaxy with an original crew, there had to be a sequel, and 'Evolution' is well worth watching.  StarTrek.com had this to say:  "This second film does a great job of adding depth to the original Star Trek series and it gives viewers a sense of the scope of the original series and its effect on the evolution of the series. If you haven't seen Star Trek Generations and are looking to explore this classic series and the franchise in general, 'Evasion' is the best place to begin."   And a few more words from the film itself:  "Evolution" is a great follow- up to Generations and sets the stage for the third season of TNG.   It introduces a whole new set of characters and gives us a look into how the Federation and Klingon Empire interacted after their successful alliance during the events of "The Battle of the Binary Stars".   The third season would start with a two-parter called " The Most Toys," and " The Outrageous Okona."  "The Outrageously Okona" was one of my favorite parts of TOS.   "It's an old favorite from the Star Trek universe," said Star Trek director Nicholas Meyer. "It was a tremendous challenge for us.  It was an unusual story, but I think it's a great story."  And the second half of "Evasion" is even more entertaining.  The movie is full of the jokes, the music, and the characters, and has a lot of humor to it.   Star Trek's best movie has been in the shadows ever since " Generations."  In this one, the Star Fleet has been replaced by a fleet of smaller craft, and this is all brought to light by the captain of the ship.   If you enjoy Star Trek, and like to have fun with it, 'The Outrages of Worf' will please you.  And finally, the reviews, including a look back at the film:

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My friends and I were sitting around drinking beer at a local bar when we discovered that the movie The Bad Kids was playing on the big screen. So we decided to come down and watch it. My friends thought it was a terrible movie and everyone agreed that it was just awful. After the movie, a guy approached us and started talking to us about how bad it was. I wasn't very fond of it, but the rest of the guys liked it. We talked about how the movie was just like watching bad kids do bad things, but we got to have a good time. That night we went out and had a great time at a bar. We all drank some beer together and talked about what happened during the movie. We got home and the guys talked about the movie for a while. After a while my friend asked him if it was really as bad as the others. He responded that it wasn't really that bad. That it was more like the movie in the middle of the movie: the good kids were fighting each other and the bad kids had no problem with that. He then said something that really stuck with me, that the whole movie was an allegory of the Vietnam War. So I asked him what was in the movie that was such a big deal? And he replied that the Vietnam war was like this movie: it was about a kid that was just born in the wrong place at the wrong time. So when we were watching the movie and we see a kid just born and the war starts, that kid is just like this kid, born in a different place, but having no choice and no clue. But the kid had the choice of a way out. The kid could have the Vietnam and kill himself, but it wasn a way of doing something good in his life. That's what the movie is about. So with that in mind, my friends and me made up a movie about this kid who wanted to kill himself for a better life. The movie was called "The War of The War", and we made sure we got all the actors we needed for the movie! We hired some of the best young actors in Hollywood and we also had a wonderful production designer who also did the music in the film, but more on that later. The film is about this child who is growing up and realizing that there is this big difference between "us" and "them", the kids. In the movie the child is a little kid who just wants to play with

It was a true story, and even though I have seen this movie several times and it had its ups and downs, I am still amazed at how well this movie can be enjoyed multiple times. This movie is just perfect!" -C.W. "What a great way to celebrate a new year! I can't remember the last time I've been so entertained by a movie! This is a movie that should be on everyone's list!

The music, the performances, the dialogs and the story are all outstanding. It definitely stands out from the crowd of action/adventure/comedy films that are being released in theaters right now. This is an action film that you can't take your eyes off of. It is so well-crafted that you just want to keep going and see where it will take you. I truly enjoyed this movie. I hope you enjoy it, too!" -G.S.  Synopsis:   When young orphaned teen Sam Fisher (Liam Neeson) stumbles into a life of crime he is forced to learn how to survive and be a part of society. However he also finds out that the people in his life want nothing to do with him. In order to get by he has turned to the most unlikely source to earn money, gambling. The owner of this gambling hall is a young woman named Grace (Kate Winslet). Grace has never met or seen Sam and is not sure who he is.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The good movies don't get made, they don't exist. They're made when a good idea gets stuck in a director's mind, and there comes a time when the film has a life of its own, when a brilliant director, or a filmmaker with a brilliant idea for the film, has become intoxicated with it and can't get the film out of his brain. We will never again see a film like Casablanca. It is a film that has the power of a myth, and this fact makes it almost a religious experience for those who are interested in this kind of film. If you like the old Hollywood, you will love it." - George S. Kaufman, (writer of Some Like It Hot, Sunset Blvd., You Only Live Twice, and Sunset Blvd. (1954))
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is what I expect of a true movie that deals with reality, which is why I watched this one. There are no CGI effects or computer effects but there are a lot of special effects in it. The special effects really worked in this movie. The movie really shows me a lot about the psychology of a man who went through a lot. I also saw a lot how the character of "Juan", in a way, saved a lot people's lives. The end of the movie actually made me cry a lot and also shows me how powerful a human being can be, even if it's a madman. I saw this movie at the cinema and it gave me a warm and fuzzy feeling. I think that I like the film because the characters were realistic, but also because I got to see a lot from my favorite characters in real life. If I were to make a list about my all time favorite films I would say that:  - Apocalypse Now - A Clockwork Orange - The Godfather Part II - Casablanca If you liked this movie you will like all my other reviews.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed this movie.   I didn't realize I would be a huge fan of this film until I finally watched it for the first time.  This was the film that made me an Alien movie fan. It had the action that I want from an Alien film. It also had the best Alien and the worst Alien. The aliens were awesome, and the creature design and the sets were very impressive. I loved this film for what it was.  The performances were great. It's the only Alien movie I liked this much, as I don't really care for any Alien movies that came before.  It's a pretty good film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For the first time in a long while, a movie has me excited about the future of science fiction. For the first hour of the movie, I was a bit disappointed to find that all the action and explosions happened off-screen. I mean, it was obvious that the action would have taken place when the Enterprise's power was cut off by the aliens, but this movie was about two young boys. They are not yet pilots, not yet scientists, and certainly not yet explorers. There was a good chance that we might have gotten some good adventure and a good reason for these two young men to meet again (in a future when they have the tools and technology for that kind of exploration, and the technology that can stop them from having a bad time). The scenes of the alien's destruction were nice and exciting, but it was a little disappointing that they happened off camera. I am not quite sure where the plot was going (although I am guessing that it was going somewhere), but it had me guessing about a few things.  But hey, it's Star Trek. It was a Star Trek movie, after all. The cast was excellent. The special effects were impressive and well done. The performances by the actors are just a joy to watch. And what a great ending, the only really disappointing part of the film. The Enterprise was destroyed (by the aliens' energy attack) but it didn't end well. The movie ended with the crew aboard the Enterprise in the transporter room, talking about the destruction, and how they have a plan to come back and be heroes again.  That's one thing that makes this movie a lot different from most other Star Trek movies, because we get some characters on the bridge, talking to each other, even making a plan about what they should do with the Enterprise (that they still might get to).  And it's pretty awesome to have Kirk, Spock and McCoy back on the Enterprise for this one. And I have to say that this is not just a movie about the Enterprise, although I do think the main characters deserve some credit for making a real plan for saving the ship (instead of relying on their own luck). The movie was written by a fan of Star Trek, who wanted to tell the story of two young, up and coming space explorers. It has the look and feel of a Trek movie. I think I can say that with a straight face. It's very different from the Star Trek films. It doesn't
Write a positive review about a good movie:     A lot of people get it mixed up when they say "I just went to a screening of this movie. Wow." It can be a nice way to get your friends hooked on a movie and for others to see your review and see it's actually a good one.   So let's dive right in, shall we?   This is a "steampunk-ish" tale that is a fun time with some of the most badass characters I've ever seen in a movie, and it definitely won't bore you (as long as you don't mind a few nods to old-school Hollywood).   The film is mostly set in a small town where "good" and "evil" are blurred as each group struggles with their own agendas. A young man named Charlie (Cillian Murphy) sets out to destroy a local gang called The Bad Guys (and the Badger's, of course) to avenge his family's death. It's a small story that is told in a simple way that won't take you out of the moment.   But if you get into the movie for the action and stunts (it's a full movie, after all), you may be in for a surprise, as things do go off the rails from time to time.   to my absolute surprise.       But it's the characters that really make this movie special. And they all get their moment to shine, and they all bring something to the table. Murphy is great in this one. He brings a gritty and violent element to the story that makes for some hilarious moments. His character isn't a typical one, and his backstory makes him more than the "goddamn tough guy" we are all used to seeing. Murphy gives a lot of depth to this movie, even though he is just one of the many faces that get added into the story.   His character really makes you question if you can trust him, and I didn't want him to go down as a hero, but you can. The Badgers and their leaders have no mercy, and their plans will take time to get accomplished. And Murphy is always up to the task of saving the day. In fact, it's a running joke that Charlie needs to fight against his own inner demons, and he's quick to find and put them in check (and then there are a couple of moments that truly show just how messed up Charlie's mind can be, if he isn't

Write a positive review about a good movie:     The biggest hurdle for me to overcome is that I don't want to be associated with bad movies.   When I was first asked to review this movie, I was surprised by the lack of negativity in the film.  To my surprise, I found myself smiling quite a bit.    For example, the two "good" guys, as far as I know, don't have any romantic chemistry. Â The guys have nothing to say to each other.  The movie is very realistic.  It's based on a true story and it shows all the things that happened at the time.  There are scenes where you see people at the gym and I really enjoyed the look on the people's faces when the fight happened.  I can remember my mom and sister watching this movie with me.  The movie has a very interesting storyline. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is a film with a big budget, and it's good. A lot of other movies in this genre seem like they should be more like that but this one is different. I think there are parts of it that really were better made, but you're not getting that from the original movie, they are kind of forced in to make it work. I was in love with the movie, and if it wasn't the original one it would have been a good sequel. There are parts that I was not as excited to see, and I don't think it will be remembered as a good or enjoyable movie. But in the end, it's just a movie. If you love movies and you like the genre, then you'll like this. I had a good time with it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Big Chill.  The film features the most amazing performances in this list. I'd give a 10/10 for acting and a 10 for visual effects, if I were rating it.  I'd also give a 5 for originality, but the story was so good and interesting that I feel it's just fine.    A movie like this could get away with just a few minor technical nitpicks but not this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    And you can see what happens when you call a movie a "tasteless" one. It's very hard to come up with anything that makes this movie "tasty" but I will do my best.   This movie is very slow, but there is one very funny scene in the beginning. The whole movie could've been better, but a lot of the jokes were so cheesy that it was hard to laugh at. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This review will be about the movie. It starts by showing you an interview with a female student who is on her way to the cinema and who explains what kind of movie it is:  It's called "The Man Without Fear" and the director says that this is a story that is told from the point of view of a man and a woman who know each other very well and are married. This leads to a good, well-choreographed fight scene, which you can see how the director wanted to show how they fight. It also has a funny, funny scene with a cat in a cage. The second half of the movie deals with their relationship, and as you might guess, the ending is very different. As you will see, it's a good film, and if you have no time to see this movie in the theatre then I would recommend you to watch it on your sofa, on your big screen TV, or on your laptop.   The movie is an American movie from 1971 and it was nominated for an Academy Award. I think the movie is good for all audiences, but it has a lot of violence and sexual content and I think you have to see it with a good sound system or something like that. The movie has some beautiful music that's very atmospheric. But it's best to just watch the movie with a nice, relaxing soundtrack on, like for example the one by The Velvet Underground. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If there is a problem in a film, it's that a good percentage of its fans don't get what it's about. I say this because most of the time, those "fans" are just as bad at what they're criticizing. And there's a difference.      "I like your movies, but…"   These "fannish" fans don, of course, only care for movies they're familiar with. Which is fine if you're a huge fan, but not if you are a new viewer.  A film's fan-base is a subset of the entire audience.  That's why it's important to ask: do people who like movies like The Godfather know how to act like moviegoers? Are they respectful?  The Godfather's director, Francis Ford Coppola, knew how to deal with those who weren't fans. The difference between an actor and a fan is that the actor, in order to be accepted by the audience, must not be the same person who played the role. So, I'm glad that people from the movies got to do what they do, without being recognized as "fANS."    "You're not like me! You're not even a moviegoer!"   That said, though, I will concede that some of the movie-goer-hating people seem to think that a movie's "fan" is the same as the audience at the movie theater. And that's not true. In the end, those people who do like the movie are those who "get" the movie, not just "like" the film.        "You should go see this movie!"  When I was younger, it was easy to get my favorite actors to do a movie. I didn't have to think about it. I just had to hope for the best and go to the theater. If I didn`t see it, I was mad at myself. I mean, I knew it was a bad movie, but I still went to see it. But it wasn't until I saw a movie like A Star Is Born that I realized that I wasn't the only one who was going to the movie.  I didn' t know that it was actually possible to get your favorite actors in a movie without them feeling pressured to do their parts.  There have been movies where there was only one actor, and I didn\'
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you have watched some of my previous posts, you know I'm not a huge fan of the movies that go to extremes with genre. There's a lot of fun and funny movies in this subgenre, and some that are truly great, but I really don't think a movie's worth a whole lot when its about a group of people who fight with swords, or that a movie is called Swordfight in Paris unless it's got a swordfight.    I'd never seen a movie called Sword Fight in Paris, but that's okay because it's not the worst movie you will ever see. It has a nice set up, and it has some decent fight choreography, but it's still just a movie. That doesn't mean I hate it, and this movie has some pretty cool sequences.      In fact, there's so much good stuff happening here that it could very well turn into a cult classic film. I'd love to see a sequel to this one. That might just be a dream, but at least I know it's possible.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When the opening scene was shown I knew that I'd seen the last of the '60s. The movie was so realistic as to be frightening in its precision. I am one who believes that you must watch all your favorite movies over again in a different light to see how they truly aged. The reason is because your brain has a hard time assimilating any new information. I know this to be true for myself as well. I also know that I will never watch any of my favorite films again the way they were. That is not to say that there are no good ones out there that I want to revisit. The question is do we want to watch them in order, or do we rather watch them again as they were? In my case, I find it very difficult to remember the last time I saw Star Wars and I have only watched it a few times, but in this particular instance it seemed to me as if it would come very naturally. It was certainly an experience I did not want to repeat. It has been several years since I saw it and I think it's time to revisit it with fresh eyes.   In the beginning, I was completely disappointed. I saw this film at a cinema where I was attending lectures on the history of science. My first thought was that it was the '80s. I have no memory of that time. There was no one around that I could remember seeing it. I even had trouble finding my seat and found a place near the door. The place was packed with people who were either attending lectures or attending the screening. In fact there was a man sitting next to me who was probably the sole moviegoer. As soon as the movie began, the people in the seats closest to the door started shouting and jumping up and down. A friend of mine stood up and went over and started chanting in a foreign language that I cannot now recall. Another friend jumped up on the seat directly in front of me and began yelling at the screen. At one point during this man was able to get two people to follow him to get on the screen but I thought this was the point of no return. It began to get louder and louder. The crowd was getting louder and stronger. My friends and I got up and moved to the back of the room where we could watch it with a clear view of the screen in case anyone else wanted to see it. This was a problem, because everyone else had left. We sat on the ground

Grade: B+

Write a positive review about a good movie:   (This review was written for "The Lost City of Z", released in 2012)   I really enjoyed this movie. It's a true story of an adventure into the jungles of South Africa in search of the legendary Lost City. It has a nice cast (including a lot of good actors), and some amazing sequences of adventure. You can tell that the filmmakers had some experience of traveling and were trying to recreate an experience that they had had back home in the US, so it's a good thing they did! The storyline does get a little more complex in a later scene (which is about a month into the trip), but it is still fun and entertaining, and it does offer a good lesson in conservation to both the young and old alike. This is a movie that anyone interested in nature, adventure, and the human body would enjoy.    For more reviews of movies or books by Roger Zelazny, go to his official website.      I really liked " The Lost City ".   I loved it!   And it was worth every penny I spent!  I can't believe it took me so long to come up with an idea for a review.  But I'll just say this:  Roger Zelaznny has written the best books ever written on the human anatomy, and this film is no exception.  The director, Michael Cimino, really shines here as he tells the story of two explorers.     The first one is Sam B. Roberts, a college educated college grad with a new found interest in the wonders of Africa. He's got a wife, a job, and his dog, but he's a total adrenaline junkie. The second one is William T. (played by Billy Bob Thornton) a hard-nosed professional in the Army. He and his girlfriend (played in an excellent way by Nicole Kidman) have to deal with all of the usual issues in life, the stresses of life, and all of these are made even more challenging by the fact that Sam is missing!  The film is a terrific story about what happens when one man has the power to create something that may be the answer to the world's greatest mystery.  This is an awesome film about great adventure and great characters.   I loved watching it.    I hope that this film gets made into a movie again in some form (I wouldn't mind seeing a
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As for the movie I have to say I enjoyed it very much. The acting was really good and it was a great movie. There were two things that i found really funny, one of them was the fact that at the end of the movie the "mother" had the same hairstyle as the little girl who gave the dog a box of kitty litter (I guess they were trying to make a pun that the cat was the only "child" of the couple and that the dog was the "father"). There was a lot of humor to the movie and I really liked it a lot. I hope that someone like you will see this and I think the "Mother" will also like it. I highly recommend it to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was at an event and heard about this movie and saw that the cast was on my list. I thought the casting was perfect for this movie. The story of this movie was like a combination between the movie "Inception" and "A Few Good Men". The story has the plot of an evil organization trying to destroy America. Their plans are to use an unsuspecting man as an intermediary. The bad guys want to get the information in his head through hypnosis. So the bad guys will hypnotize him while the good guys try to save the man. But that is only part of the story. The real part of this story is when you are watching this movie there is no way to escape the movie. I was in awe from beginning to end. If you are looking for a thriller, this movie is for you. If I see another film with a story like this I will definitely watch it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of my favorite movies of all time is Back to the Future.   If you've ever watched the movie you know what I mean.    There are some great scenes, and some terrible scenes, but the movie is overall a good time, and the first time I saw it I was really intrigued.  This is one of my favorites.  It's one of the first 80's movies I was ever exposed to.  When I was little my parents always took me to the movies.  They'd always have "Back to the future" on, but I only remember the bad scenes,   But one scene in the movie really stood out to me,  and this is where the movie has everything to do with me, so I'll talk about it.  One day my dad was going through some of his old stuff, and found a small tape of Back to The Future. I was 10 at the time.  And I thought to myself, this has got to be good.  I wanted to see this movie every single time it was in theaters.  So that day I got my Dad to record the movie and I'd watch it over and over.  I didn't really know what this movie was about, but when I got to the ending I started to get more and more intrigued. The ending was a really cool one.  Now if you don't know what Back to it's about, you donno what I'm trying to say.  Back to this movie is all about the 80's.  But the movie makes a lot of references to the 60's. So in the 80′s they were still in the 60′s when the movie takes place.  The 60's were a lot crazier and I loved that.  In the movie Marty travels back to 1985.  At the beginning he gets a message that says to watch the clock in the hotel room.  Later in the film Marty meets his father who is wearing an 80's hat and sunglasses and is wearing a bandanna over his eyes.  Then Marty finds a time machine. And when he puts the machine in reverse Marty goes back to the 20's.   The 80's are all about cars.  Cars are crazy.  We're still going nuts over cars today, it's not so crazy as in the early 80's, but it's still cool.   But what's great is that the cars in the first few minutes of the movie

The movie has a very generic story and very bland acting, with a lackluster ending.  The movie could have been an 8/10, but at this point it's hard to imagine anyone buying it because it feels like the writer just did his research and didn't really understand what he was doing.  When it's done right, it's great, but this was very typical, with predictable twists and some of the most uninspired directing I've ever seen.  I don't understand why it was such a big deal to make a movie about the Vietnam War when there were plenty of other movies about the war made before the 70s.  To me this movie seems like a big attempt to make the war seem as important as it was... the writers didn't even do the homework.  Overall I think it's a waste of money and time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film is well-acted, has a good script, and a great plot.   I really enjoy this movie, but I don't recommend watching this unless you are 18 or older.    If you're younger, I suggest watching it in the theater.  The characters are all likable and the humor works.  If you like sci-fi, this is a great movie to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you have seen this movie, you will love it! This is the best movie that I have seen in a very long time! I've been going to the theater for years and I am always excited to go to the movie theater because I enjoy movies.   The most important thing for me to say is that this is the BEST STAR WARS movie ever made! Every single part that has been cut out is worth watching the entire movie,   I mean it's pretty great. This movie is not only one of the best movies to ever happen in Star Wars, it is one of my favorite movies. Yes, this movie is good, and I know this because I have rewatched this movie in front of my friends and we still can't believe it's so good.  Yes it is not as good as the original trilogy, but it's still pretty good. The only problem I have with this movie that really bugged me was the "Battle of Hoth" which is really where the movie starts to get good. Now I'm not saying this is a bad movie, but I did have a problem that I feel is a little bit of a let down. It took me a while to get over it but I really don't want to think that the movie did it's best work with the Battle of Huttball.  I'm going to go on record now and say that this movie did a lot to me when I was a kid, and it definitely has changed me as an adult, especially about Star Wars. I wish I could go back and see this movie when I grew up, but alas I will never be able to. I am not going to tell you this movie sucked, because it didn't and I hope you will enjoy this as much as I did. I give it a 9/10!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is definitely a film that has its good and bad moments. The bad moments are more obvious. First of all there is a scene in this film that I found to be extremely exploitive, and it doesn't really have any redeeming qualities. The scene is this: a woman is in a hospital being operated on, but is interrupted by a man in a suit (well, a guy in a bathrobe, at least) and this guy demands that he have his way with her. This happens repeatedly in the film, and by the end there are four men in all and they are all making advances towards the women in the hospital, or even raping them.   First off, this is an extremely exploitative scene. In fact it is one of the worst sequences of exploitation ever filmed. There are no props or anything in it, it is all staged, there is no story to the scene. All the girls are fully clothed, and when they are getting raped they are being assaulted from behind. It is horrible, and to make it worse the man in the suit doesn't stop. He makes some weird comment that makes the girl laugh, and then keeps going, making it even worse. All of the other characters in the scene are just standing there, not really doing anything. This makes it even more disgusting, but it is still a scene that is obviously meant to be a sexual assault. The man who does this in the movie is just a guy named Paul (Harmon). I found that the actor for him was a really awful actor, not just bad, but awful. I remember thinking this is really going to be the one time when I say how horrible the guy looks.  What really makes the scene so bad is the fact that it actually makes the woman in the story uncomfortable. In the scene the woman is being assaulted by two other men, and she feels uncomfortable about it. The story of this movie, however, is that she doesn't give a damn. She is so turned on by this that she just keeps having the men violate her anyway. I felt that this was just a poor way to depict this kind of rape, and I think that it was a poor choice for a movie in the first place.  The film has a lot of other problematic elements. The most obvious is that it is a thriller and there is only one story. It's just a one-note plot that involves some pretty gruesome things happening, and a man who

Write a positive review about a good movie:     The worst movie of the decade:  If you are a film buff and you are looking for something to watch for the rest of the week, this movie is not worth your time. The only reason why I am giving it four stars is because I am not a film buffs and this is the only movie I have seen this year that I felt was worth the price of admission. You can see all of the best movies on Netflix or rent them on Amazon. It will do more harm than good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good film, but it's not a great film. It's really a good middle-of-the-road film that's kind of silly, but there are a few nice touches. It has a great sense of humor, and I think that if this had been in a big budget film it would have been really good. But it's a PG-13, and because of that it really holds back. The acting is really good, the story is really interesting, and it's really funny, but I think there are better movies to be had than this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The Shining," Stanley Kubrick's terrifying masterpiece of dark-magic.  The Shining is my favorite horror film of all time.  It's brutal, scary, and so satisfying.  It's not for everyone.    I was so afraid of my brother watching it in the theater that I refused to let him watch it with me.  But this isn't that scary and scary.  You don't even really know what's going on, not until the very end.  This is a movie made by two horror directors, Danny Lloyd and Stanley Kubrick.  These guys are great.  So the movie is very simple.  Someone kills their wife.  She is found frozen in their basement.  They want to make it look like a suicide.  Unfortunately, the story doesn't make sense.  After all, why would someone kill his wife and why would he put a Polaroid camera in her house?     But that's the point.  We're not told anything about this person.  How does he even know that his wife was murdered?   Why would he take a Polar record when he was living in such poverty?  After I watched The Shining, I was terrified.  I saw the same things you did:  His wife, he and their child are murdered.  Then they put a film in her freezer and pretend that it was a suicide to protect themselves.  Posted by Sarah at 8:25 AM Great post Sarah!  I read a bit of what you said and had some additional thoughts:  I never saw the film but I remember that the main characters were very poor.   We never know much about them and we learn a little bit about a few characters and that was a great deal of info. I think that is the point of the film, to show us who the people were, the people who did it and the people that they think they were protecting. I remember, I saw it at a theater and the projectionist asked me if I wanted to watch a different movie on the screen and I said "No" and then the movie played and it was "The Shining".  Then I said to him "I really don't like it, it doesn't seem very scary." I guess it was the point that I was trying to make in my original comment.    Then he said something to me that really stuck with me and it went something like:  "Why is everyone
Write a positive review about a good movie:    1.   The Incredible Hulk (2003) - It's a lot of fun seeing the Incredible Hulk battle the Hulkbuster.   The battle is intense and thrilling.  While the film is not an action movie, there's something exhilarating about watching Bruce Banner fight against his foes and this movie gives him the chance to show off his martial arts skills, as well as his physical abilities.  Also, The Incredible Marvel Movies  (2007)   is the perfect movie for fans of The Hulk to watch for a quick fix.  2.  Jurassic Park (1993) - The park is great to see with all the dinosaurs roaming the park.  But it's the characters who really make the movie.  All the creatures in the film are incredibly good.  For a movie that is based on the book of the same name, there is a ton of information in the movie that fans will never get if you just read the book.  And it's a great action movie that's not too heavy on the drama.  The film was also directed by Steven Spielberg and is well-written and very entertaining.  I could watch this movie again in a year and not even know where I left off.  What I really like about Jurassic Park  is that it is set on a theme park. 3.  A Beautiful Mind (2001) - Another movie that has inspired many other films.  This movie was based on a book written by British author Richard Bachman, as is a film based on another book written from the same author.  In this movie, David Byrne plays David DeCoteau.  DeCanto is a genius who wants to be a famous playwright.  He goes to New York for one semester and has a big test.  His teacher sends him back for another semester so that he will finish high school and go on to a university in the United States.  When DeCant's teacher dies, he is taken to the asylum.   In the asylum, the doctor realizes DeCanteau is brilliant and that he may be able to change the world, but first he must deal with a woman named Mimi.  Mimi has an uncanny ability to find a person's soul and she has an unusual way of getting this information.  As David goes about his life, he falls in love with Mimi and she also falls in with him.   They fall in love and end up
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is good. It is also a bit strange. One thing is that the movie is so slow-paced. The only action scenes take place in a classroom, and I feel that is a mistake. A scene that shows a lot of tension and passion, but in a slow-pace. I guess that is where the story of the film starts. I'm not a huge fan of the plot. It does not go anywhere, and it just goes on. There are no real characters in the film. The characters are just thrown on the screen to give an idea of the story, and the story does not stay with these characters, it just seems to be about one group of people from this country (American). A girl is getting sick. She was a teacher in a school where they used to teach that a little girl must have love to be able to be a teacher. The girl is in love with a boy, and she wants to marry him. But when she says that, the boy is cold and says no. Then the girl wants to stay with him, and he says yes, but only if she changes her name. She is a very strong and independent woman, so he takes her in the kitchen, and they have sex. That's about it, no plot.    But the movie was good. The scenes are well-done. I liked the slow-motion and the slow movement, and that is what you get when you watch a movie about the love of a teacher to her student.  A lot of people think that these types of films are trash and that they only make people look at the person that they are in the movie and make a connection to them. But in this case, it is more of the opposite. The film is about a girl in a foreign country who has no love for anyone. She does not care for any other human being. She only loves her work and her teacher. She feels that she can accomplish anything, and when she has an idea in her head that she wants it to be brought to life, she does everything possible to make it come true. She's strong and intelligent, and no one can stand up against her. She also has very little compassion for others. It's the people who are around her that are the ones that she sees as her "family". She feels sorry for them, but she has no sympathy for the fact that they have no love. But of course this is only a

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What movie is this?   This is a movie I saw in theater, it's a movie that's been around in my movie list for a long time and now it's finally out.   A good movie, no doubt.  Yes, the movie isn't great, it just seems so out there with a crazy plot, with a lot of wacky ideas, a lot to chew on and a lot going on at once.  I just have to say that it's also pretty good.  It's got some action, it looks like a decent time, the cast is decent and it's well acted and directed.  There's just something about this movie that seems a bit off but at the same time a lot likeable, and then you watch it, and it starts to really click, like it's getting into some plot and the plot starts to make sense, or maybe it's just that it just gets into this crazy plot and is pretty good at getting out of it, then you just feel it, like you're being kept on edge watching it but there's a bit of mystery to it, it seems to be trying to be different all the time but at some point it just clicks, and you understand what it's trying to do, and at that point it's so good you don't even care about the odd plot.  Then it's not that you're in a movie, you're not watching a movie.  A movie is a story, a movie is telling the story, this movie tells you a story and it just keeps on pulling you along.  This movie gets deeper and deeper, it makes you look at things in different ways and I think at times it makes me think about things that I've never thought about before.  That's what movies are for.  What's the best movie you've ever seen?  Or, the worst movie you ever saw?  It may be something completely different, but it's something you've never seen before and it makes some sense, it puts you in a little bit of a different way and you think of something that you've always thought about and you see it a little differently, and maybe that's something that was different and good and maybe you liked it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Best of Both Worlds (1991)   I'm not a great film buff, but if I had to watch it twice I'd have to choose this one over any of the other Star Trek films.   It's the first of the series to explore a marriage and the relationship of Spock and McCoy.  What was it like, seeing it for the first time?  I didn't have an answer, but I know I had a great time.  I had never been on a spaceship before and to see Spock, McCoy and their crewmates doing things I never dreamed possible was amazing.  How's that for a cliché?   And who can forget the most epic scene in Star Trek history?  The moment Spock was about to be killed in the original series? It was beautiful.  This is one of the best films in the franchise and I highly recommend watching it.  The Original Series: The Final Frontier (1989)  It seems that no matter what we do or how many times we watch Star Trek it remains fresh.  For me this was the best and it still holds up.  From the first episode it's a breath of fresh air.  And you know that "The Way to Eden" was an amazing first episode!   For anyone who watched the Original Series then you know this was not one of their favorite episodes.  Now, I'm no fan of the Original series but I've always enjoyed it.  This episode is just a great episode with lots of action, good jokes and some great scenes.  My favorite part is when Spock and the others are out on a mission in the Genesis Planet and Spock sees a "planet" and thinks it is a plant but he and Scotty find out it is real!  The scene where Spock says, "I don't believe it!" and then has his "Wow!" moment.  That is one amazing line and it is one that you will remember for years.  They go through a lot of trouble to make it look like a simple planet and when it becomes real it is amazing. The "The Man Trap" was another scene where they really took it to the limit!  I remember thinking that if Spock had seen this it would have ended his career as a science officer. The whole episode was just beautiful. The Original series: I, Mudd (1963)  When Star Trek started I was a little skeptical.  As a child my family didn't watch

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have enjoyed this movie quite a bit and am glad that it was finally made, though I was disappointed that there wasn't a bit more to the movie.  The story of the movie is actually quite interesting but not in the way that would be expected.  A woman has a child and is going to be a stay at home mom for the child for the next 9 years.  She decides that she would like to go see a movie in town and meets an old friend from the neighborhood to take her along.  Along the way she meets a young boy in town who is running around town and doing all sorts of strange things.  After they have a couple of drinks at a local bar the boy, who is a bit younger than her, starts trying to get her drunk.  It goes well at first until a little later when the girl comes back into the bar with a bit of a hangover and the boy starts making moves on her.  All of this takes place in a few short hours.  While watching this movie I couldn't help but notice that there are a couple things in the story that do not add up with how things are portrayed.  First off it seems that the boy is actually not a bad boy at all.  He seems to be the son of a good looking woman and seems to have all the tools and advantages that she could want.  Second of all it seems like all of the characters involved in the plot are either a lot older or much more well known than the characters in the movie who are supposedly young and naive.  This does not make sense at all and just made the whole thing seem like more of a soap opera.  Overall, I thought this was a pretty good movie and I would recommend it for anyone that liked the film "The Devil Wears Prada" by the same director.  In any case, I can recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a good time and isn't afraid to get their feet wet.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I don't want to write a negative review.   The most I can say is that I didn't like the movie, but it was still a nice time watching it.  For this film to be nominated for best picture is just incredible.  My problem was that the film was actually so bad I didn\'t want to see it.   A film such as this should be praised.  There are times when the picture doesn't get any better.  The lighting wasn\'t the greatest,  I found it hard to see what they were trying to show.  Some things were just a bit out of place,   But most of the times it looks great.  With the music not being great I also didn't care for it. I found it not enjoyable, but this film is not exactly about good music.  A lot of things in the film don\'t work and it seemed as if a lot of work was put into the movie.  It was funny and I enjoyed it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first trailer for The Man from U.N.C.L.E. No wonder it didn't last too long. It is the kind of spy movie that is about the good guys and bad guys. We have a cool spy character who is good at his job. He works for a good guy and gets caught in a crime against an enemy. The spy character gets caught and it is his only escape from prison. The whole movie is like the movie I would have made if I was not a spy. I am not going to give away any details because I don't want to spoil it. It will be like watching a great movie. If you like spy movies, you will like this movie. I will say that the plot and the action are the main reasons to see this movie, though. But, all in all, it is a good spy movie.  The second trailer for Man from UNCLE: The Legend of Black Adam. I have seen all the previous trailers for the movies, but this trailer is the best. It features a cool character, a super-soldier, who looks like Superman. He is the hero of the movie. He goes around fighting villains and saving the world. The movie will take us through all of the major world conflicts. We are about to see more superhero movies in the next few years, and we are all going to be looking forward to them. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A very entertaining and creative film, with some interesting ideas, and a cast of talented and funny characters.   As well, it is a film that has some genuine historical content.  It's well worth a look.  I do not know whether the film is "right" or "wrong" but I would have no issue with it. It's a film where history comes alive and a young woman is at the center of all the action and action has a lot to say.  This was a great way to spend the weekend. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie, but I am a bit surprised that there weren't more sequels. It had a wonderful story, which was interesting. However, they could have expanded it more. I loved the characters and it was fun to watch. The actors are awesome too, they do a great job. A must watch movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:      2.6/5   "I really enjoyed this one" -Travis (review posted on my facebook)   4.1/5   5 stars for being so good it has inspired me to write a positive post about it.   So what did I enjoy most about this movie?   1. It really felt like a story told in a movie. It was told by the two characters from the beginning to the end.   the two men's relationship was really like the movie of the same name. The two men had an awesome time together.   The movie was really great. the story was very funny and really deep.  - The action scene was great and well done. The actors really showed their acting skills.   to the best of my knowledge, it is the first time that the characters' relationship was portrayed so well.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    ...but do it with an awareness of how easy it is to lose track of what's true and what isn't.   You're the audience; you've got to be able to see the difference between truth and fiction.  The only way to do that is to know where your facts are coming from.  We're not watching a movie, we're listening to it:  This is the only way we will learn anything.  You won't learn more about a film by hearing about a few specific scenes that happened in a script and that's it.  That doesn't add much.  It's like learning about the history of a country by listening to the politicians and historians and journalists who wrote about it.   When we see a film, we have to see it with our own eyes, and understand it on our own terms.  And if we see it wrong, we may learn from it. We should be willing to accept that.  In the case of the "Jaws" remake, the people who made the film were right in trying to bring back the excitement of the original film.  Yet there's a reason they didn't do it right.   But there's nothing wrong with making a good film, if that's what you want to do.  No film is perfect, and no one wants to see a perfect film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You can see it in theaters soon, maybe even in time for Christmas, but here are a few of my favorite moments from a good film I'd highly recommend:  The two kids who play Mr. Wiggin and Mrs. Wiggly, and the old couple who live in the mansion.   They have chemistry.  They are both funny and cute and I thought they were both really great.  I thought it was a good balance between silly, funny, and touching.      In the scene when we meet Mrs.Wiggly's husband, I thought he was a bit odd, but he was funny in that scene, which also included his little daughter and a little boy who didn't know what he was doing.  The whole scene with Mr.Wiggin, when he talks about his own childhood, and his memories of "The Wizard of Oz," and Mr. and Mrs, Wigglys reminisce about that time.  This is just an all-around great scene in a really funny movie.  Mr. And Mrs. Waggin' has a great balance of humor, tenderness, and tragedy, making it feel like a coming-of-age story.  It also has some great scenes in it about good versus evil, about family, and about how different your world can be when you don't know who you are.  A scene with the little boy and his cat, as Mr. Waggins' nephew watches him as he talks to his cat.  If I had to describe The Wizard of OZ in one word, I would say it was "wonderful."   It was very good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the most interesting films I've seen this year. The pacing was very smooth.   The movie does not waste time.  The characters are not your typical fantasy centric characters.  They are not the typical hero's journey story line.  It is also quite entertaining and suspenseful.  I'd highly recommend it.  If you're a fan of action and adventure movies like The Avengers and The Fast and the Furious, this will be something to check out.  -Kirk G.  Read more...
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's easy to make fun of the way Hollywood works when they are in a rush to cash in on a popular franchise. But even the most successful studios are limited by the size of their bank accounts. So they have to pick and choose how much they will make and how much marketing they will spend. With Transformers 3, which is already in production in London, it's obvious that the studio has no intention of getting bogged down in the story and production. This is a massive film, with a complex plot, many actors, and a massive budget. There are several factors that will determine how the movie will fare at the box office. Will it earn the box-office returns it is aiming for? Will it have a strong enough performance to stay in theaters longer than three weeks? Will the critics give it an "A" CinemaScore? But even more important will the box audience respond to it? Will this film be a success for Paramount and for Michael Bay? I think these are valid questions for a studio to ask. It's a good sign if they don't bother to do so.   In recent years, Michael Bay has become a controversial figure. He is widely known for the films he has made with director Bryan Singer. Bay also made a film for Universal called Pain & Gain (2008), which received bad reviews. The film was a fairly tame action movie with just a couple of big action sequences. It had a very similar feel to Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2010), which made Bay extremely popular in Hollywood. Bay has also directed the popular action-comedy Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014). It received rave reviews, but unfortunately, has grossed less than Bay's Transformers films. If Transformers 3 turns out to be a hit at the movie theaters, it may be the beginning of a very profitable relationship between Paramount Pictures and Michael Bay.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   So, this is a book that I really didn't think that I would ever be a part of. But I had heard about it and I knew it would be something I would enjoy, so I decided to give it a shot.    It was a little odd at first because I was really unsure about this movie. After having seen other reviews it seemed like it would all end up being pretty bad, but as I was watching I saw that it wasn't.  I actually liked it.    I liked the story, I liked some of the characters and the ending was good.  So what am I going to say. Well, I'll say that I enjoyed the movie. I loved it. It was different from any of the other books I've seen. It made you think and made you not think. It wasn't about the story itself it was more about the emotions, emotions that I experienced during the movie, and that's why it's such a good story.  And I think there were some scenes that I didn't enjoy, but I'll discuss that later.  It's a good read.  I haven't watched the movie in a while, but if you're a fan of the movie and you like to see what a movie should really be then I highly recommend it. I can't wait to see if they do another one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What do you want?   An action movie?  And it's not even the best action movie in the franchise, in my opinion, but it's fun and it's a good way to end the trilogy, so that's all I care about.   It's a little confusing and slow, but the final showdown is one of the most iconic, and the ending of the film is really pretty cool.  I like the film because it's different and it has its own vibe, which makes it more interesting than the previous films, and it does have an emotional moment, although not much.  It has its flaws and it doesn't have the best special effects, but I think it's better than The Matrix.  Like I said, this is my favorite of the films and I think the third film is actually pretty good, too.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really like this movie. I didn't have high expectations for it, but it definitely got me excited for the next installment. This movie is very faithful to the book. I was pretty bummed when the author died and was going to be writing this one instead. I found it very interesting to read the original version of this story and see a different point of view. The movie has a very different cast, but the story is very close to the original. It's the kind of movie where it seems that this movie was inspired by a book written before it, or that it was a prequel to the main story. But, this is not the case.  The story in this movie is really good, even though it was inspired from a novel. And as I mentioned before, it's a good story. The cast in this is really wonderful. They give each other so much character. But I must admit, I thought the character of the "cousin" was the most interesting one. I think his personality changed a lot in this book, and this movie gives you the chance to see what he was like back in the late 80's. And he is one of the best parts in this film. The plot in this one is very well thought out. This movie is one big puzzle of a movie. The whole movie is set at a party. The director does a great job of filming the party. I would definitely recommend this movie to any fan of Stephen King. My rating:  As an avid King fan, this movie gets a 5 out of 5. It may not be my favorite King book, but I really enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to the second installment in the series. I have to say I had a lot of fun watching this movie as well. It made me want to see the second book even more than the first.

The acting is very good. The music is good. It is not so violent. The plot is interesting and the story is easy to follow. The movie had some good jokes. It also has many twists and turns. I like this movie very much.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have yet to see this movie and I don't think I ever will. I have read reviews that say that it is just like some of the other "good" movies out there, however I am not seeing it that way. I feel like it is a bad movie with no redeeming qualities. I am talking about the writing, the acting, and the character development. Everything about this movie is just bad. Not only does this movie have no redeemable qualities, but the plot of the film doesn't even make any sense. This movie was supposed to be a thriller, and it seems to have all the elements of a thriller except for the fact that it has no suspense at all. I honestly feel like this movie was put together in a hurry to make a quick buck, and for that reason it fails to even come close to being enjoyable.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really really enjoyed it! It's so different and weird and weird! I loved it! I was surprised and so happy!    Don't bother writing a review, it's pointless. It's too soon.  I love you, but we should talk about this. It is so weird. And weirdly amazing.     I'm still trying to wrap my head around the concept of a movie where all the characters are women who want a man, and all the men want a woman who wants a man. It wasn't a completely random concept. This was the idea of a bunch of different women's men's men relationships. The two characters I loved most (and the movie was best for that) were the ones I think were the most well-written: Rachel and the old guy who is the owner of a motel. I really liked Rachel's character in the book, and it's nice to see her return. But this was the book's real star, the weird guy with his wife and kids. His name is Henry, and I always found it really weird that a hotel he owned was named after Henry VIII. And it was the perfect weird character for me, but I also felt for him and his family. It was nice to be able to see a character in a book that is so not normal. And that's what we were all going to see when we got to his motel: someone with no identity, who has no family, who is stuck with someone who's very weird and very strange and has nothing in common with anyone else.   So much weirdness. I was always wondering where Henry's wife was and who she was with. It turned out to be someone who'd lived with him in the past, but Henry was never able to contact her.   He has a couple of kids, and he's a dad to a number of different people. His dad is a doctor, his wife is a nurse, a couple people have children through his wife. Everyone at the motel loves him. They call him Mr. Henry, like Mr. Clean. He's got an old RV in a parking lot, which is sort of cool, though I guess that's something a person in their 20s would have.   the weird old man  What surprised me the most was the whole idea of how strange and interesting it was that the old dude didn't want Rachel to come stay at his motel, and

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie has a story about the end of the world, with an emphasis on the apocalypse, but is actually just about two brothers and their families coping with their grief and trying to rebuild their lives. As the movie progresses, you see the family's struggles and how they come together in the face of adversity. You also learn a lot about the characters that are in the movie and how their lives are affected by this. The actors in the film are excellent, with Chris Evans, Samuel L. Jackson, and Michael Shannon. There is a very good plot about family, destruction, and redemption. It's a very dark film that is very much about survival in the midst of an apocalypse. The movie has really good use of special effects and sets and even a great action sequence to conclude the movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm pretty sure I would've loved this movie.   The film is set in the 1930's in a town where the main character's mother runs a saloon.   She is a shrewd woman and not afraid to make deals with bad men, but her daughter is something else, and is a child of the Depression, living with her father in the same house as her mother.  The movie has a very dark and melancholy feel to it, and I found myself actually feeling sorry for the character and his mother.   This film also has some great performances from the great Marlene Dietrich, and a fantastic cast, but in spite of the great cast, the film was a total disappointment.   As a film critic I don't usually enjoy films that are so sad.  I think that is probably why I enjoyed this film so much, because it wasn't sad, it was just sad. The film is not that bad at the beginning but slowly becomes more and more like a tragedy, and more and happier and sadder.  As mentioned above, the movie was not really my favorite because I found it to be quite depressing, but I can see why people enjoyed it so much because of its atmosphere.   I also think the movie's message is something that is very appealing, and in some ways even a bit sad.   You see a film as it is intended to be viewed, and it shows what is actually in a film, and what it means.  This isn't a film where the director had the script ready.  It's very much the story that he was telling as it was in his mind, and his intentions.  As you can probably tell, the direction is not really great.   Even though this is a film from a very young director, it's clear that he has a clear vision of what he wants to do with the movie, and he's quite capable of expressing it visually, but it really doesn't look that great.  If you know how to tell a story, it will work very well.  My issue with this movie is that it is more a drama, and not as much a comedy as it should be.   It is more like an action movie, but with more drama.  But it doesn't really work for me, because I think it could've been a much better film with a more comedic focus.  In fact, I don''t think I have ever seen anything with the same

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like it. It isn't as good as "Tron," "The Room," or "Pineapple Express," but it's a little different and more adult. The story is the same; there is a boy, a young woman and a couple of guys who want to murder the boy. The boy is a wisecracking, wisecroasting, little brat who has lost a few of his friends and is now hanging around the kids at school. The girl is very sweet and is more popular than him. She's not a great actress, but she gets the best of the boy and tries to help him get back at the adults who hurt him. The action scenes are great and the action scenes in this one are so fast and furious that I couldn't keep up with everything going on. It's funny, too. The humor comes through in a way that "Pleasantville" never really did, even though it's about the same thing.   The ending is a bit weak. Maybe it is to do with my age. I didn't see "Pleseepe" until a year ago. I have read most of the books the authors have written, but I had never seen the movies until this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the world of good movies, a lot of the stars are in the right place:  the cast is excellent, the director is a master, and the cinematography is outstanding. However, when all else fails, a "good movie" does not mean a great movie. A good movie is a movie where, no matter what you are doing, you find a way to laugh, cry, and enjoy yourself.   The movie opens with a shot of a city of angels that looks like they are coming from a film noir and they are very happy. The camera moves in on them, revealing an almost surrealistic and dreamlike atmosphere. The only real thing you need to know about the first half of the movie is that you don't have time for it, you must get in there and watch it.  The second half is a slow burn. You don't see all the beautiful moments from the first. It is too easy to get lost. The plot is very easy to follow.    There is only one major problem with the movie:     It's not very good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The original Star Wars: A New Hope was a great movie.  I think it's my favorite, because of all the action and adventure and "coolness".  I thought it was fun.  The Empire Strikes Back had that awesome moment where Luke's X-Wing fighter is blown up (and blown up by other fighters).  The movie was amazing, and the character of Yoda was awesome.   A New Order had the first appearance of Darth Vader.  After that, he appeared in the prequels.  Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith was more of the same, with Yoda and Vader. So far, I am happy with these three movies. They all have great characters, great action, great fights, and great special effects.         Star Wars:  The Force Awakens I will review this movie when I have time.  In the meantime, I will say that I think this movie is pretty great.  It's not great like A New H ole Star Wars, which I think had many flaws.  This one has many flaws and a lot of things that I want to fix.  At the end of the movie, Darth Vader talks to Luke about "rebuilding his empire", but in this film, we see that the Empire is not going to be rebuilt by the people who are supposed to be the "new rulers".   Star wars:  Force Awakens has some great action in the first act.  For example, Han Solo and Chewie get out of the Millennium Falcon and fight the Imperial Walkers with their blasters.  Then, they jump into the Hoth Snow Monster, which they ride.  Also, the scene with Poe Dameron and R2D2 was very cool.  You can hear the "pinging" sound.  And we learn some new stuff about Rey, like her father.  But, the worst action scene is the fight between the First Order and the Resistance.  A lot of people were upset that Kylo Ren didn't kill Finn.  So, I'm going to give him some points for that.   I wish there were more space battles, though.  There are only so many of those, and I'd rather see Rey and Luke fighting the First Force, and then, go after Kylo.  However, there are some cool space battles that I enjoyed in this movie.   The best space

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Watch out for the "bad movie" review. It's a cheap shot that's always done. It hurts people's feelings, and it's a slap in the face to film. The real problem is the film has so many flaws, but most critics don't give it a chance, because it's not a "good" movie. The problem is, this film has some great moments that have a message, and is a film that shows a lot of emotion. It also has some flaws that make it look bad, and make it very dull. I was always really impressed by the production values, especially the cinematography. Even though the film is rated PG, I still enjoyed it a lot, and I enjoyed the music, because I liked some of the songs. It was not bad. However, that's not the point. It just isn't. It is a "bad" movie, and if you enjoy "bad movies" you'll probably enjoy this one. It has some pretty good "badness", but it's just not good. If you watch it, remember it's PG, and you'll enjoy it a good bit. It can be hard to find a decent, adult rated movie, even on the Internet, but I hope this helped some people to find the kind of movie that can give them pleasure.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "If I was going to give a negative review it would be for how bad a movie it is.   "     For one thing, the original script for the movie was originally written by  James Dean and  Robert Altman, two of the finest filmmakers in cinema history. They had already made an adaptation of The Graduate before this one and they went back and added a few lines for the remake.  But they made this version worse than the original.  This is not a bad movie, but it's so far off from being a good one that it just makes you sick.  If this movie were made by a competent director (the two that I've seen it by) then it would have at least been a decent, if not a good, movie.  Instead, it's a trainwreck of a movie that, by the way, was made for $1.5 million.  There are not many people who are going to appreciate the crap they are getting from this movie, although I have a hard time looking at it.  I mean, I understand the need for it and how bad it would look to most people.  It's just not very good.  If you are going for a big budget movie: This is for you if you want to watch a movie made for a high budget.  A movie made by people that are experienced and not just young inexperienced filmmakers that just want to have a good time making a movie.  There is a reason this movie took $5.5 Million dollars to make.  Some of the most popular and profitable movies are made by Hollywood for large sums of money and these films take much more time to make than smaller budget movies.  And in this case, it looks like some of the people making it did not do enough research, they should have done the research.  Another reason this is a problem is that this movie looks like it was made on a computer and that it was not well designed at all.  So much time is spent just on the CGI that it's just disgusting.    I really hope that this film will end up being one of the more popular of the remake remakes and the rest of the films like it will become more and more popular.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an excellent movie with a strong message.   The message I take away from this movie is that we can all do anything if we put our mind to it.  We have been told for centuries that being good means avoiding all things that could possibly harm us.  So what does this movie say?   If there is an enemy to be avoided, it is ignorance.    We have been bombarded since birth with conflicting information about health, nutrition, technology, etc.  When we are very young, we are given "educational" books to read that tell us that food is bad and eating the "wrong" food is a sure-fire way to kill ourselves.  But what most of us don't know is that when it comes to health, we can do more to become healthy than eat healthy food.  We know this because we have been doing it, and it is still good to try to do it right.  To learn all the possible ways to achieve health in our lifetime is the ultimate goal, but not an easy one.  We can accomplish great things with just a little focus.   I believe that most people are not aware that they are doing something wrong in their food choices when it come to health.  Many people are unaware that there are several health benefits to eating a healthy diet, including: Reduce risk of cancer: Cancer occurs from a mix of hereditary factors and environmental exposures.  Most of these factors occur because of a genetic predisposition that is not changed by diet or lifestyle.  Foods high in antioxidants (e.g. fruits and vegetables) may reduce your risk of contracting cancer.  There is no doubt in my mind that our bodies need antioxidants.   Cancer occurs because cancer cells are programmed to destroy DNA.  The more DNA there is, the more likely there will be mutations.  It turns out that eating foods that are rich in antioxidants can protect us from the effects of these mutations.   Reduce your risk for heart disease and stroke:  Heart disease and strokes are the leading causes of death in the United States and are responsible for one in seven deaths in the general population.  They both are the result of the build-up of a build-ups of fats and cholesterol in the blood.  Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, low fat dairy products, and whole grains can help prevent these two diseases.  If you need some tips for a diet that will lower your risk,
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Room is not only an Oscar-winning masterpiece, but a must-see for anyone who cares about cinema. The Room will change you forever about how you think about movie editing, filmmaking, storytelling, acting, music, character, story, and even about the word 'good'. It is the rarest of films that is not merely a very good movie. The film's genius lies in its ability to tell a story that is truly compelling and enjoyable. It is an incredibly complex film that takes place in a very small room, a small hotel room, and a very large, very strange world. The story takes place from the perspective of two brothers in a room, where they discuss the nature of their father and their relationship with each other. Their father is an old man who loves his grandchildren, and his son is the only one who truly sees him in a certain way. It's the story of two men who must come to terms with a father they never knew, and the way their relationship was once defined, only to come to realize that their relationship is a very strange one indeed. There is so much more to The Room than you can shake a stick at, but it is best for you to be on the lookout for spoilers and just take the film at face value. There are some very surprising twists, plot twists, and turns throughout the film that are well worth the wait. While it has a very long runtime, it is not overly long, and it is packed with surprises and an overall unique plot. There was a time when I would have never dreamed of seeing a film like this. The room is a unique setting that is perfectly set up, yet it feels like it has always been there for everyone. The entire film takes place inside of a very big, very weird world that is so surreal and so strange that it feels almost too real. Everything has a feeling of realness about it. The movie is very well told, as it goes back and forth between scenes that are more serious than the rest, and others that are very funny and lighthearted. The performances throughout the movie were excellent, and some of them, particularly the brother's, are genuinely funny. The way things are explained to the audience in the film is an absolute master class of cinema. Every moment and plot twist are given a great deal of information and explanation, even though the movie itself does not explain a single thing to you. It makes the movie so much richer, and makes you feel that
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A little less than three months after The Hobbit was released, Peter Jackson returned with The Two Towers in December 2002. This was a significant departure from the earlier fantasy trilogy; a war film about World War II in a Tolkien-esque world, with an older, more realistic-looking and more realistically rendered, human actor playing the lead role (not the elf-king). I thought this was an outstanding movie that improved on the work of The Lord of the Rings, with better acting, better CGI effects and a better story. The sequel, The Return of the King, followed a year after the release of The Two Thrones, but a much weaker film than the first. Despite the weak film, the trilogy did well with critics and audiences alike.   I highly recommend this trilogy, and they can be found at libraries and used bookstores, where you might also be able to purchase the movie versions.  The film is very close to a faithful translation of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Shire and is easily one of the best-known films from the original trilogy, with a solid acting, a solid CGI and a good script by Peter Jackson.  The first film The Return   1.2 hours into the movie, Peter said, "I want to do something different for this movie." He said he wanted to write the third film in the trilogy, but he wanted a new look for the film that would not require the use of "looks" (the look of the hobbits in the earlier movies). Instead of using the "look" of Tolkien's Middle Earth, this trilogy would be set in a world "that is in an age of dinosaurs, and a world that is an early version of a future world." (pg. 50) This is an interesting concept, because it would be possible to use the look of Jurassic Park for the movie as a look, but this was never a serious consideration. "The look is in the name, and it is not a nice film about a nice world. It's really about dinosaurs, dinosaurs and more dinosaurs, which is a different story and doesn't lend itself well to a look." (p. 62) The director and Peter wanted to tell a story about "a bunch of kids going on a quest" and, in particular, they wanted the focus to be on a child character: "The kids will be on this quest and we'll be showing them what happens in a quest. It will
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few years ago, I was working on a new novel of a sci-fi series. I had been following the television series and had enjoyed it. This was a good thing. In my fantasy world, it was still my fantasy. But, I had learned that my fantasy was not shared by the TV producers. There were things about the series that were not right. I decided that what was wrong was that the producers were putting the book out there like it was a book that was not really a book. It was a movie. It had been made for the TV series. The producers put out two movies. A first movie came out in January 2001 and was not well received. It featured a villain that was a woman. I saw that movie when it came out. It reminded me of an old Disney movie about a villain who had a man's face. The villain was played by Julie Andrews. Julie Andrews was an actress from the 1920s who I had seen as an actress on Broadway and on television. She was beautiful, and she had a look like a dream. But the filmmakers had a different idea for the villain. They made the villain a woman and Julie Andrews played the role. She played it so badly that it was disgusting. This movie turned me off to this series of books. I wrote about it in a column for "Time Out New York." This was because the first book, "The Sentinel" was the best. And, the second book, called "Echopraxia" was worse. This time, the book got a little better. I thought about writing a book about this series. But then I thought, "Wait. If this series is as bad as I have seen it, then I've got to make a book in my imagination that is just like it." So, in the course of a few months, I wrote and published a novel called "The Darkening." I had originally intended to call it "The Shadow," because I knew that the shadow was a powerful force in the world. And in a few stories, I included a shadow, but I didn't want the title to be another thing to distract readers. The Shadow is a powerful presence in my world and is a very important character. The first novel in the series, "Ventolin," was a lot of fun to write. I loved the book, and I was proud of it. It came out on my 40th birthday. It did very well

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It's been over a year since we saw  The Great Gatsby  and I have to admit that we were both disappointed with it. There were so many flaws that it felt a bit like watching someone else's work. Still, the film stands on its own as a great piece of art, which is something you can't really say about so many Hollywood films these days. We all can appreciate the story and characters and I can't wait to see more movies by Baz Luhrmann. And who doesn't want to see it in 3D, now?" -- Jeffery Siegel
Write a positive review about a good movie:     A young boy who had just moved in with his grandmother. His grandmother had recently given birth to a son, who was named William, and the boy would have to go away on a mission. His name was William Henry.  The movie begins with a brief montage of William being sent off to school, where his friends and classmates tease and taunt him about his name.  It's only when a girl named Janey takes pity on him and goes with him to a small church for an Easter service that the boy begins to open up. The following scene shows William sitting in the back of a truck being pulled by two boys, a boy named Tom (Tom Cruise) and a boy who plays the saxophone named Sam (John Travolta).  The boys are going to a church where an older man is preaching to an audience of about 100 people.  As they are driving to the church, Tom and Sam begin to argue, and it's at that moment that the film begins.  This is probably the first time I've ever seen a movie where two kids could be so cruel to each other and so much in love with each other, while remaining the same age.  William is so sweet, and so gentle, but Sam is just an evil and nasty character.  I think the reason why this film works so well is because of Tom Cruise, a film which he would later star in.  His character in this film is a young man who was abused and tormented as a child, and he wants to help the young boy and bring him closer to God.  Also, Tom Cruise's performance makes him relatable.  He is an all-American kid, with an easy going, fun personality.  And he gives off the vibe of an actor who just wants to do what he loves.  All of this is balanced by the fact that William is suffering because of his past abuse.  After the scene where Tom and the boys are driving off to the city, the film cuts back to the boy with the sax playing, in the truck.  There, he sits quietly.  We then cut to Sam, standing next to the truck, telling his girlfriend to do something.  She does, and Sam starts crying.  From that point on, it's obvious what's going on, and William realizes that it's too late to go back home.  Sam is now in charge of bringing William back, and after making an excuse

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What are you going to do, write about the bad stuff?    That is exactly what happened here.  When you have a movie like this one, there's a lot to like, and it's definitely worth your time to watch it. The story is very well told and you don't see a lot of bad things happening to the main character (although a lot do happen in his life), so it's easy to feel a lot sympathy for him. I do have a few gripes about this movie, but the most important thing is that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I have no idea how this movie was allowed to come out this year, it's so bad.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's one thing to make a good film, but another to be an important filmmaker, as a documentary director who is able to show his world through the eyes of a non-American, and tell his story from many different points of view. That's what this documentary does: It makes the world of the people who live and work in the area that is near the border of North and South Vietnam, a more complex, realistic, and fascinating place.   A film that can be appreciated by Americans and Vietnamese alike, without prejudice.  (Read full review) "You see, I come from a family of Vietnamese refugees, as they fled from the Communists when we were still in France." ~ Heng Her Thuy The film begins with an encounter between two old men who have just returned from the mountains.  They talk about what it's like for these refugees, and how much work it takes to support their families.  The two men are on the road to Hanoi, trying to return to their families, and make a better life for themselves.  Heng Her Thaiy, a farmer, and Heng Chien, a fisherman, were one of the first groups of refugees to settle in Ho Chi Minh City, the capital of North Vietnam.  They're one of only two communities in the city, and the only one that speaks Vietnamese.  While most refugees from Laos are resettled in southern Vietnam, they're stuck in a country they do not understand, and a country that doesn't want them to.  "A young Vietnamese woman on the verge of being a bride.  We are in the midst of a very dramatic time in our country.  It is being referred to as 'The Hundred Year War.'  It has gone on for a long time, and is about to come to an end.  " ~ Heng Sheng Nguyen We see the lives of these two men, living in a new country. Their stories are similar, they all share the same struggles, but the stories are told in a way that shows their struggles are more than just physical.    These men come from poverty, struggle to survive in a foreign land, and all have their own personal experiences that can't be easily put into words.  In the beginning of the documentary, we see them in a refugee camp.  What we see is a group of women and children, all struggling to survive.  This isn't a

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What does it take to be "good?" I've always liked watching movies and have found that a good script is the best way to go about it. I've seen films that aren't very good, but they had an intriguing story, interesting actors and a good story to tell. It's good when a movie goes over the top and goes off the wall, but sometimes a good director will be able to work within those parameters and find the best ideas for a movie. For a movie to be good, it has to have something to say and you have to be able sit through all the crap that is in the movie, because at the end of the day it's about people.   4.   I am a fan of horror movies. They keep me entertained.  I love when the plot twists happen and they don't leave me confused.   When you do find yourself confused and feel like you have no idea what is going on, well guess what? You'll see a good horror movie. It will make you think. It'll make you go, "How the hell did they get away with this?!" I'm not saying you'll be able go watch a movie without having a thought pop into your head or that you'll have a great time, but the movies that I enjoy a lot don't have so much as a single bad moment. I like that these movies don't make you feel "I got you" after the film ends, they keep you interested.  5.   Horror is for all ages.    It doesn't matter what age you are, what movies you are exposed to, if you're a kid that just started seeing movies and are having a good time, then a horror movie is a great place to be.  When a movie is great it makes you forget your worries and you are left to enjoy the story while you're watching. You're watching something scary, but you are having fun doing so and this is a wonderful feeling. I have seen the same movie many times over and while it was great each time it will always be fresh for me.  But as I got older I realized that horror doesn't have to just be for kids, it can be enjoyed by everyone. The only thing I can tell you is if you haven't seen a horror film and you're in to horror movies, it's a great way to see a few horror movies and get the blood pumping. 6.   My favorite
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw the movie the first time in theatres on Friday and I enjoyed it.  I was thinking about seeing it again the next day as it was one of the most popular movies at the time.  For a short period of time in the late '90s and early 2000s the film took off with huge success. It was a hit on both sides of the pond with young boys and men who loved it.   This is a movie I remember well, but that doesn't mean it's good.   The story is very simple and has a very limited scope, it is all about a boy in high school who has a crush on a girl and goes to meet her.  He also gets a special power, a power that gives him the ability to read minds.  The film starts off very simple but slowly builds to what is really a very unique film. The plot is quite simple but the film does a great job of weaving a plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  When it comes to the dialogue, there isn't much, just some mild sarcasm, a couple of jokes and one good line.  As the film goes on, the characters really start to come to life and they grow and change throughout the film.  Although the plot doesn't progress at an excellent pace, the plot is fun and interesting to watch. The characters are great, very complex and very realistic.  All the characters are interesting to the point where I felt like I was watching a real life story.  This film is funny, romantic and heartfelt.  It was my first big budget movie, and it was the first movie to give me a sense of excitement for future sequels.   I still laugh and laugh and enjoy this movie to this day. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie a lot. I like it because I see it for the first time, and my mind is open. I saw it once and loved it. I am not a horror guy. But the film makes you want to see a new film. The writing is great. It's not cheesy at all. It takes it's time. I think that the director, Mr. Gaunt, really did a good job with this film. I liked it.   I like the soundtrack very much.  This movie is a very good movie for kids and teenagers, especially the soundtrack, I think.  I really like the way the movie was made.  The movie is very dark, but not too dark. The movie has a great story line.  It's a great movie for a date, a birthday, or a special day.  You might need some food for thought: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "I'm not here for the show and I don't care what they say."   A few weeks back the movie was released and to be honest I was pretty disappointed by it.    It seemed like a cheap movie to me and this movie is no exception.  There were some funny scenes in it but they were very over the top.  So the movie itself was pretty generic.  I'm not a big fan of horror movies but it's not a bad movie. I gave it a 4 because it was just a little below average. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a little horror. If you want more, check out their other movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This review is about how a movie was made.  The film is not bad, but it's definitely not very good.  If you liked "Scooby Doo", "Parks and Recreation" or "Freaky Friday" then "Bad Timing" probably isn't for you.   The plot is stupid and the acting is horrible.  We have two characters in this film: John and Michelle. The bad part is that both of them look like they're trying to look like the people they're impersonating.  Michelle seems to want to be like a cartoon character like Gwyneth Paltrow.  John wants to act like a super hero like Bruce Willis. This is a movie made with kids in mind, not adults.  This is not a good "movie".  The acting is just horrible. The voice actors are terrible.  Some characters don't even have names. They just say names over and over again.  One character just tells the other character how to do something and the other person never listens.  It's like the movie was filmed with a VCR.  They have one scene in the movie that was cut from the theatrical release. It takes place on a highway and it's a good scene, but then they cut it because they didn't have time to get it in.  There are a few parts in the film that are just stupid.  In the final scene, a cop car is crashing through a window.  What's even crazier is that the person sitting behind the cop car, who's in the middle of the highway, is talking on his cell phone and looking at a Facebook status update.  All I know is that if this was in a real life police chase, I'd be scared to drive through that window.   Grade: D
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I want a movie to go beyond being a bad movie: to be a bad film that makes you wonder how anyone could be so stupid as to make a movie like this.   The only thing that is truly impressive is the talent of the actors, who in some cases were even better than the directors.  I am still stunned that it was all made in the 1960s.  They should have hired a modern actor to play the villain, or at least one of the other main characters. This film will live on as a great example of a poorly written and ill-conceived film, a great movie for those who think the past is the past, and a shame for those of us who think that the future is as interesting as the past. Rating: **********1/2  * ************* * A very different film from the first in that it is more of a traditional horror movie, rather than a slasher.  The film starts off with an intro that tells the story of a young couple who decide to have a family by having a baby.  The man, David, is a scientist who has no interest in having kids, but his wife wants to have one just to spite him.  After finding out she is pregnant, David immediately starts to become very sick, and is only saved when his pregnant wife comes out of the closet.  He then decides to move back in with his mother in order to get some peace and quiet, but is soon put on trial for his relationship with his wife.  In the course of his trial, he learns about the nature of sex, and the differences between the sexes.  David is a very confused person, and his only real friend is a young woman named Anna, who has a very violent personality and is never able to leave a situation without getting hurt.  Once the couple have a baby, they move back to the small town in which they live, and David becomes very involved in a cult that is being built by an older woman named Rose.  As David has his first encounter with the woman, who becomes very upset with him for his involvement in the cult, she makes it clear that she doesn't think he has any place in the community and has a strong distaste for his sexual orientation.  It is here that we meet the "beautiful" (I have no idea what that means) sister of the baby girl.  Rose is a kind of cult leader that can
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you see a movie that is a disappointment, you might get angry. It's not because it's bad.   Just because it is a new movie, it will be a good one. It might not live up to the hype.  So, write a positive movie review. Write about what you enjoyed about it.  If you see something that doesn't go right, that the movie does not live-up to expectations, just write the negative review.  Now, try to think what was good about this movie.    Here is my review of   The Martian:    This movie is awesome.   If you watch a good flick, and it's not up to your expectations, you can say it's a bad movie.  But this movie is so good that if you watch it, and you have not seen a sci-fi movie like this, you will love it. It won't even make your brain hurt!   My only complaints about this film are that it is very long.  It is definitely an action film, but it does have to go on for a lot longer than you might think.  There is a lot of exposition in this movie, but the exposition is very well done. It is a nice touch.  It is also very funny at times.  That's a huge plus.  Also, the plot does not really make sense to me, but I don't know why.  At least this movie isn't a horror movie. Overall, The Martian is one of the best movies to come out of last year.  The film did not live/die by the plot.  I just found the film to be a lot fun and entertaining.  For a sci fi movie it is definitely worth watching. For more info about this review, read my full review of The Martian.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Good Dinosaur"   This is a good, good movie. It really surprised me, and made me sit up and take notice. The movie itself isn't very great, and the character isn't the best, but it is definitely worth your time. The film is a bit of a mix between "Gravity", and "Brave", with the latter being more about bravery and the former about bravery with a few moments of heroism. This movie is all about a family on the run and trying to escape from the forest, but the family is more the protagonist than the other character. It shows what it's like to be a family who lives in the forest when you don't know who they are. If you like movies about characters and a lot of suspense, this is a great movie to watch. If not, then it's worth a watch, but only if you are a fan of the Disney family movies, which this one is loosely based on. "The Good Earth"  This movie took me by surprise as well. It took some time to really appreciate it, but after a while I really did appreciate this movie and how it was done. It has a lot more going on in it than it initially does, but that's what I loved about this movie. There are a few scenes that really hit you with how well put together it was. There is some good and bad, but overall I thought it was a really good movie overall. "Coraline"  I haven't seen this movie, and I'm not sure how I feel about it. I do feel like it was better than the movie it's based on, but I have to say that it did have it's issues, and in the end it didn't completely hit me the way I wanted it to. It's not my favorite, but still I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't know a lot about it, or a lot from it's source material. It is a very interesting movie, but you have to really pay attention to see the differences.
Write a positive review about a good movie:      I thought this film was an excellent addition to the great filmography of the filmmaker, Martin Scorsese. The film is about a group of street kids and their experiences at an all-night drug-addicted rave. It's not a bad film, but it's not spectacular either. The movie was a lot like Scorsesi's "Diner".    The film has a lot of potential and a lot more to give. This is the sort of film that would have worked well as a teen movie but would still be very enjoyable for an adult audience. There's a lot to like and look forward to in this film. Scorsesy's style is very unique and intriguing. He uses his camera's movement and the sound to great effect. Scores will fall flat, but Scorsie uses his music and his characters to great effects.

We got a plethora of franchises back together in an effort to get people's attention. One of the few things missing from this year's box office was an original concept or character that had never been done before. The new Star Trek movie is one of the best movies of this year and it is easily the best movie of all time. It was great in every way, it was funny, well-written, and absolutely brutal in every scene. Its best moment may have been its ending. The only drawback to the film is that it felt like it was being forced to have a movie release date. The rest of the cast was great, and I was able to enjoy it as an adventure film as well as a Star Trek film. The Best Of Star Trek: Into Darkness is a must see for Star Trek fans, especially the fans of Star Wars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is very well done, I really enjoyed it, but it does lack a few things from my personal tastes, and it does not make for an easy movie to watch.   I like the movie very much, I did. It is my personal choice to hate it, so I can't really recommend this movie.  It is just my personal taste, that is it.  The story is very interesting and different from the usual horror film, it's like an action thriller. The characters are likable and well written.  They are the heroes of the movie, they do all the hard work in order to find the girls they are trying to find, and save them from an unknown evil that has started to attack people.  The movie has a couple of very good scary scenes, and some good gore scenes.  I was very impressed by the direction.  This is a nice movie for a couple hours, I would recommend it to everyone.  My rating is a 7/10

Write a positive review about a good movie:    HBO had a good time re-releasing the first movie in an attempt to recoup some of their losses.   This is a great comedy, full of good laughs and some great moments.  Also if you have been around the internet for a while, you have probably seen my reviews of it.  It is not a good film.  But it is an enjoyable movie, and I can't imagine a movie better than this.  The only issue I have with this movie is that I hate the song from it. It is just so poorly done, and so annoying.  I just can't listen to it!  This movie has great action scenes, great comedy scenes, and great love scenes.  This just keeps getting better and better.  "When a man is late for a party, it's his fault. But when a woman is late to a party, it's hers." I love a great love story.  Like a great movie, love stories are not to be missed.  In this movie, they are very well done, even the love scenes are well done.  Although I did get tired of listening to the stupid love song from the beginning of the movie, once I got past the stupid song, the movie got great. The movie keeps it's pace from beginning to end, but it just keeps picking up in the ending.  For some reason, I just loved it.   "She's coming from the back alley, she's not leaving."

This was one of my all time favorite movies growing up. I love this movie!    This movie is one that I always want to watch over and over again.  I had this movie in my DVD collection at one point but didn't know what to do with it.  After a few years passed this movie came to the theaters and was a hit.  A new classic is here and it is one I will always watch over again!  One of the best comedy films ever made, from a great director!  I am always amazed at how much fun this film is to watch.

There were some very funny parts that were very unique but at the same time also some very sad parts to it too.  This was a very entertaining movie and at the end I was really excited to watch the next episode and the next movie!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   .   [spoiler] I watched it on a flight.   I'm not ashamed of that.  I thought I was in the movies.  [end spoiler] This is a story about the last week of the Iraq War. It follows a young journalist on the last leg of his journey from Baghdad to Kuwait, and the first weeks in Kurdistan.  For those that know anything about Iraq this will not be new information.  But it is interesting to see how the two regions have evolved into separate societies and states.  "We don't have much food, it's hard to live on.  "   This is not a movie to be seen alone.  It's an hour long.  There is plenty of information to be taken in by anyone that doesn't know anything.  This movie has been compared to a documentary.  Many people have compared it to the "Ragtime" series.  The movie follows the journalist on his journey.  We see scenes that are reminiscent of the 1970's and 1980's, especially scenes of the war itself.  If you are a war enthusiast you can take some inspiration from the movie.  In the movie they use the term "wounded" a lot.  They are constantly seeing and hearing casualties and I was a bit taken aback at how many times they mentioned it in this movie. I couldn't believe that so many people were alive at that time, even if it was just a few miles away. This movie is also more about the people than the war.  I really enjoyed this movie!  You have to see this movie if you care about the Iraq war and the people involved.  You could easily miss out on a lot of information if you only see the war through the lens of the media. I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in the story of a young reporter on the road covering a war that many still don't understand. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Avengers (2012): 5   In this movie, Chris Hemsworth and Robert Downey Jr. team up to take down the villainous Ultron and end the war. While the first Avengers was a bit of a mess, this is one of the better superhero movies I've seen. (10 out of 10)     Captain America: The First Avenger (2011): 4   This is the first time a Cap movie came out, and it's one of my favorites. The movie focuses on Steve Rogers, the man who would become the first Captain America, who gets into a conflict with the Red Skull. Cap is very brave and loyal, and makes some very cool choices. The comic book characters are a bit cheesy, but I dig them anyway. The only drawback is that this movie is the weakest of the three, and there are some good scenes, but it suffers a bit.   The Dark Knight (2008): 3   Another good comic book movie, this time starring Christian Bale as the Cap-and-Bruce Wayne. It's very good, though it doesn't have the same level of action and the quality of the comic book comic is a bit weak. (8 out of 8)    Thor: The Dark World (2013): 4     (5 out of 5)    1.       2.   The Dark Knight Rises (2012) 3.   Batman Begins (2005) 4.   American Sniper (2014) 5.   X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014/2015) 6.    The Avengers  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Great Escape,   also known as The American Escape, was released on September 29, 1976.  The plot is based on a true story of a group of American students that were held captive by Nazis during World War II.   In order to save the lives of the group, they were forced to join the American Expeditionary Force and eventually worked as pilots.  They were held in the infamous Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, and it is not believed that any of the film's surviving actors (excluding Gary Cooper) actually participated in the movie's production.  It was directed by George Cukor and is based in large part on the true story in the book by John Toland entitled The Great Schindler's List. CukOR also used the name John H. Toland when he was filming the movie. The story was made into a 1975 film, but has not been released in the United States. The film is about a group consisting of six American soldiers and an Army Air Corp captain that was captured by the Nazis in 1940. The book by Toland was based on an actual trial of the same group, which was held at Nuremberg, Germany.  At that time, six soldiers (the main characters) were found guilty of participating in a plan to steal supplies from German POW camps and were sentenced to death by hanging. In June of 1944, the men were executed. At the time, they had all been separated from the rest of the American Army, and were kept in separate locations. One of the characters was a prisoner who was sent to Berlin with the other prisoners after they were found to have been responsible for the theft of several tons of supplies.  While some of the details of the book are a little off-base, the movie is based largely on the real life event, and in the end is probably more realistic than most other war movies.  A German POW  and his comrade in the prisoner's cabin. The only part of the movie that is definitely not based on the book is the camp at Bergen-Belsen where the movie takes place.  In the book, the prisoners were housed in a single large barracks for the entire camp, and that has been added in the film.  Some of the camps they were held at had a large swimming pool with a small swimming area, and some of them even had a little playground.  Although some of this stuff wasn't shown in the original book, it is probably

Peter Weir) The first movie I ever saw, a true work of art in its own way. I had a difficult time getting into this movie, but it quickly became one of my favorites. I have always wanted to see a film about a kid that goes to a military school and gets the attention of a great pilot. A great role for James Dean and James Coburn. I was so excited for this movie when it was first announced.  One of the coolest things about it is the way they did the movie, where you are left in complete amazement at the beauty of it all. It doesn't matter if you know all the story or not, you are captivated by the way it all happens. It was amazing to see the entire process of the movie with a bunch of kids who I thought were only in it for the ride.  and  We're all going to die (1986, dir./screenplay by David Cronenberg)    One I still watch all the time to remind myself of the things I shouldn't do when I get older. A beautiful movie about a boy who discovers he is not alone in the world and how the world of teenagers can be both exciting and terrifying.  a great movie for any age.   This one was an instant classic, and the first movie that I truly saw a movie I was really enjoying. The story was unique, and well written, with an amazing twist ending. My favorite scene in this movie is probably the one where a bunch the kids were playing soccer with a huge rubber penis on a soccer ball. The movie really captured my imagination. The music was great, and a great soundtrack.  that's some cool shit (1986-1987)  the best (1985-1986) that movie is pretty much perfect.   the movie that made me a fan of bad movies (1985-)  It is really hard to watch a movie like this, and then watch a film that is nearly perfect. Both are really great movies.  "You Are the Bomb" (1985/1986)   "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" (1989)  "The Dead Zone" (1988) /   My favorite movies of all time are
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen most of this list and I will admit, it's tough to know if this list is in any way comprehensive. With so many amazing movies, I feel like it would be impossible to list them all. However, I thought I'd do my best, and maybe others will find this list to be helpful as well. These are the movies I think are the most underrated. Most people, including myself, are familiar with the movies on this list. However they are far from the only good movies from the 90's.   The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (1986)     A sci-fi film that features an absolutely incredible performance by Meryl Streep.  One of the most well made films ever.    The Fly (1986). A great science fiction movie with a lot of comedy.   The Terminator (1984)  The film that got everyone hyped on the Sci-Fi genre for a few years.   Total Recall (1990). A really cool movie in which a scientist has to use the machines he created to solve some really difficult problems.  In a few days, it will likely be seen as the classic of its time, but when it came out, it was an absolute bomb. The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Linda Hamilton, all of whom were great. The movie had a great story, great special effects, a great plot, and great action sequences. However when it comes down to it, it is completely forgettable. Titanic (1997). An epic movie that is definitely not for the squeamish. A perfect storm of action, story, and romance. But there is a ton of depth to the film and it takes its time getting to the end.  Gravity (2012). A movie about people with incredible power, but they can't control their actions. This movie shows that, as one woman learns to live with the consequences of her actions.  It is the best movie from the last few years of science fiction and it is also one of the best movies of the last decade.  Interstellar (2014). This movie also features amazing characters, great action scenes, and an incredible score.  When it comes to the sci- fi genre, Interstellar can easily be the best of the bunch.  The Thing (1982). A film that is a lot darker than it seems.  This is the type of movie you won't want to sit through when
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best way to describe the plot:  You will get your fill of action scenes, romance, political intrigue, and action and fight scenes. But you won't care for any of the characters because you will not care about any of them. This is the story of a man who wants to escape his past and he is not even human. He is a monster. So if you have any thoughts about the movie then think about how a monster is created.  The most disturbing part is how he is a creature that has no mind and no feelings. His only thoughts are only survival, fighting and killing. It is no wonder he is driven by the need to escape from everything. This movie is great and you have to watch it.

"One of the best movies I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of them." - A.O. Scott "I will be forever grateful to Disney for producing this wonderful film." - David Susskind "I'm going to be watching it again when I'm old and regretful and want to watch it again." - Anthony LaPaglia  Review by Anthony LaRocca  - I was a young child in the late 70s. My mom and my younger sister had been going back and forth to live with us until my father was sent to prison. I was only 6 at the time, and the movies I watched were all Disney. My sister was 4, and she and I had to do what our parents told us to do. When my sister was 10 and my mom 12, we moved into my dad's house in L.A. It was a good place to live, and we were happy for the first time in a while. - When we arrived in L the first few months of our stay, my mom said they were moving us into a different part of the house. She said it was because we didn't like them very much, and there were other kids there. She told me that they were going to give me a new dog because my dog was killing a cat. I remember looking at the dog and thinking that a cat was not going to hurt a dog, but I figured it was just a cute pet for a kid. My dad was a dog lover, and he had a black and white Lab named Fluffy that we all took care of. So I figured, why not adopt a dog?  I called our local animal shelter and made an appointment to pick up a puppy. I didn't realize that they would be charging me a lot. It started at $100, and then I was told that my money was going to pay for a dog that was going straight to a slaughterhouse. The way they were telling me it worked out, I got a very sweet, cuddly puppy. My parents had to make me sign a contract that said I would never talk about the puppy and that it was a gift for my

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie like this, with the best actor you've never seen before in a lead role, who has never starred in another movie in his life before, and who plays a character who isn't even close to his life in life or in the movie? That's a movie that's worth watching and making a good review about. And it's one that has a very special place in my heart, I know because I saw it over 50 years ago on TV when I was 6.   "That's what we're talking about, kids, that's what you'll do: You're gonna do that, you're gonna make that happen. "   The fact that this film is such an important film about our childhood and our love of adventure and our desire to go somewhere and to have adventures and just make the most of your childhood and what we see in the film in the first half hour or so is not just the way that they see a kid as he learns to drive and drives out of his family's basement, but it's the way they see him as a man as he becomes a successful businessman.  And I thought it was absolutely brilliant. And I mean, the acting, the music and the plot.  He's so charismatic and it's his performance, I mean it's just incredible.  So when you see it with all the different colors on the screen it's like you're watching a movie.  In the first thirty seconds of the movie there's some pretty strong language, and some people might see it as a problem.  But the people who don't see it like that don't get the movie. It's the story that's the problem, that if you don't understand it you'll never understand.  When they first see this movie to the extent that it's a film with a purpose, and they're very pleased with it, but they have the problem of a young man who can't seem to get what he wants, that can't get in a car, that doesn't want to get in it, he wants to do something different, and it has a great first half and a great second half, the first part I could never forget.  This movie is the greatest thing to happen to me.  I had a couple of friends who watched it with me, and I had two people who went to see it in their twenties. I've seen it to a few of my friends. It was a movie about
Write a positive review about a good movie:   You are in a movie theater in a state that is very different from the one you are used to. The only other movie that I saw that was actually like this was The Thing. The movie is about the inhabitants of a deserted, Antarctic, research base, but the movie is not about the ice. It's about a couple who come from the future and decide to return to Earth to find their daughter. They are accompanied by their granddaughter, whom they found in a future world. The movie was very good, and it wasn't boring. I really liked the fact that the characters are not from this time. It gave the movie a nice, mysterious feel. If you want to read a short review of the movie, please go to:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thing   You may like this movie because it is about people who are different from you. You may not like this because it's about people that you don't like. You are welcome to give it a shot! It was worth watching.        -J  -V  (9/10)  I like it, it reminded me a lot of The Thing, and a movie like this is what a zombie apocalypse film should be about, and what a survival film should show us.  The movie has some interesting ideas, and some interesting concepts, such as the fact the characters were created on a remote research station and they have a hard time adapting to a normal, earthly life. I like that they are trying to find out about a lost civilization. What I like the most, though, is that the actors don't act like they are from the time of the movies.

Get a good review online before going to see the movie.   Take note of any potential problems. Look for spoilers. Read other reviews. Look at a movie after it is released. I find it difficult to sit and watch a movie and not think about the good parts and bad parts. I think it's a good thing to try and remember what made the movie good. If you are just watching for entertainment then don't think about it as long as you are enjoying the film. If the film is a good one then there is a chance you will enjoy it too.   If the movie is not a good film then you are going to be angry at yourself for watching it.   The reason for this is simple.   You are going in without an idea of what to expect.   It's hard to describe why this is the case but the thing to remember is that when you are watching something for enjoyment then it's better not to think about why you are doing it. Don't worry about the problems in the movie but remember why it was a good show.  If you watch a good or bad movie then it won't change your opinion of the film itself. It's just that you are not being as objective as you would like to be.   I don't know if this has ever occurred to anyone but I feel a movie should have a beginning, middle and end. I feel that a good story should be able to end on a high note and a bad movie should end on something like a low point.    I would say a great movie can be a good book.  I think a good novel should be a great film. I want a story to end with a bang.  A good film can be great music.  If a film is bad then there should be good characters.  The people should be likeable.  When the story is bad there is no hope of a good ending.  This is not to say that a great story is impossible to tell. It is to say you should try to have a happy ending.   Movies should make you happy and that's why I find them so important.  Another aspect to consider is the impact of the movie on you as an individual.  Movies can have a positive impact on your life.  For example if a movie helped you cope with a serious illness then it
Write a positive review about a good movie:     "The best part is that it's a thriller, I'm not afraid to call it a thriller because I think that's exactly what it is. The script, the acting, and the cinematography is brilliant. It was shot in black and white which makes the dark scenes even darker because they look so bleak. The cinematography by John Gilroy is stunning. There's no music, just the sound of the shadows coming in, and they're moving fast. The acting was also excellent. The lead, Matt Damon, who plays a very complex, tortured character is terrific. He is a bit of a wimp, but he is a good one. I love the character of Edward Norton. He was so nice and so genuine. Even though he is the main protagonist, and a good guy, he still gives this sense of urgency to the story, and he is such an important character in the story. There are so many interesting characters in this movie, and it's so good. If you are a fan of action movies, this one should be on your list. And you might even like it more than the other films in this genre. The suspense is incredible. I really loved it!"  
Write a positive review about a good movie:        The Man Who Would Be King is a good film.   It has good acting, interesting characters, and the action is done well, though it lacks the power of its source material.  The film is in third-person, so we are not quite sure what happens to the main character.  He is a young boy who becomes a king.  This is a story about the childhood of a boy who is forced to be king. The film gives us some great character development.    I was impressed by the way the film was shot.  It felt like it was a children's movie from the 1950's, but it is actually a modern film.   The film uses stop-motion for most of the scenes, and it really shows.  This is a very unique way to shoot a film. It is very unique and I love it.   This is an original film, and I think this should be seen by everyone.  I would recommend this to all.    The acting is very good.  There are a few people who do not know what is happening.  However, they know that it is a cartoon.  Most of the people on screen are very good people who I believe would not harm a fly.  One thing I was concerned about was whether I would like this film. If you love cartoons then this is a must-see.  If you are afraid of cartoon characters then this film is probably not for you.  In the end, this was a fun and exciting film. I enjoyed it greatly.   I will be watching the rest of the films.   A little more background to this movie: The Man Who Could Be King was written and directed by George S. Kaufman. He wanted to make a version of The Wizard of Oz, but he could not get permission to do so. Kaufman then turned his efforts to his own movie which was called The Wizard.   Kaufman's version of the Wizard of OZ was considered so different from The Wizard that it was eventually turned down by the studio that owned the rights to the Wizard. George S Kaufman, however, had seen the first version of his own Oz movie and he decided to do a sequel. In the year 1954, Kaufman wrote and directed a picture entitled The Wizard in which Ozma of Oz (played by the late Judy Garland) was the central character.  The Wizard and Ozma, and their friends are traveling around when they are
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a movie about a man on a date, the story starts off well, even the first minute. We are introduced to the two characters, who happen to be in the same boat, but it is not until halfway through the film that we learn the story of how the date went wrong.   "It's not as if I'm looking for a love that I didn't already have, it's more a love where I don't need a love anymore. The way I see it, I have my love back."   That opening line should have set the tone for the film; the tone of this movie is like the opening scene in "American Beauty" with our two characters.  The story is based on a true story of a man named David Turtledove, who had been on a successful date with a woman named Linda, who ended up having an affair with David.  In the end, David has to take the fall for the affair, and the movie does a pretty good job of making you feel for his character.  A very dark and depressing film, with an understated and realistic message, which makes the film a hard one to take.  It does a very good job, in the beginning, of showing us the true story behind the affair and it paints a sad picture for the protagonist of this film, who goes through a lot of problems trying to get his love back, and in the end he is left feeling like nothing is going to work out.  I do not want to spoil any more, so I will just say that it's a very dark, depressing film that you should not skip, unless you are willing to put up with the true meaning of what the film is trying to tell you. As with the rest of the movies on this list, this movie has an art house feel to it, which I like.  There are a few shots throughout the film, like the one near the beginning of the film where we see David's car parked in front of the woman's house.  This shot makes me want to give this movie a better rating than 5 stars, because it reminds me of some of the art house movies I used to love as a kid.  The cinematography of this documentary style film is also something that I liked.  When we see scenes like the ones in the movie, and when we see things like the scenes where David and Linda get into a car together, I think the

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Crimson Tide   Crap   Like a little dog with no tail, this movie, starring Bruce Willis, was shot in one take, and was never shot again. The film's only real purpose is to show us that Willis is as good as his old days (as if we needed any more evidence of this) and the other actor in the movie is so weak it makes my skin crawl.  The production company did a good job filming the movie, but if you can't tell, the movie sucks.   The film was shot on 35mm film, so it's a little dated and the movie looks like it was shot with a Hasselblad, maybe something like a Mamiya? In the first act of the movie we're treated to a bunch of scenes, in which the cast and crew of a ship crash land on a desert island. This movie doesn't have a great beginning, but this desert island has some interesting scenery, which is where our plot begins. The story is about two men (Richard Widmark and Jack Lemmon) who are trying to make their way to the nearest town, which can be found in a small town in the middle of nowhere (not really an island). The men have never been to the town, and they don't have any money. They only carry a single bottle of water, a can of tuna, a pair of jeans and a tattered map of the area. I don't remember the name of the town (probably a reference to a novel written by the same name) but it had to have been in Arizona or somewhere in the southern states. I remember one of the people who was stranded on the island (a character named Bob) says that he is a professional fisherman (in an attempt to get a drink from the water) and that he used to go fishing every day when he was a kid. One day he was out in the ocean for hours, until a big fish caught his foot. Bob says he got sick, so he went back to the beach and caught a bigger fish. The next day the same thing happened, and so, Bob was stuck out in one place for a week. He says the whole time he was sick he felt he was going to die. And when he finally did die, he was thrown into a hole on the beach by a wave.   The only reason he was alive was because his wife, Laura, took him in the water and
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot was good and it was funny at times. I liked the voice actors and the performances are very nice. I felt it's a good drama and it has a happy ending. The ending was good but it felt a bit rushed. I wish they gave more episodes. It was funny in the beginning but it lost its focus towards the end.   I did enjoy the ending.  What can I say? It's a great drama but it has its problems. A good drama is about love. It should not be a love story. In the first half of the show the plot focused on a love triangle. It got old and repetitive. The character development was also weak. A little too weak in my opinion. There's an interesting character in the second half of this show but he just seems to disappear. There are some plot holes in the story.  For some reason, the relationship between the main characters is not explored enough. I believe the romance should be a theme of the plot instead of being a major focus of the story like it is in other anime like Oreimo.  There were some issues like the romance being too intense in the first episode. It took me to the end of the first season to realize what happened with the relationship and the romance. The romance was good in the later half of season 2 but it got old. The characters didn't develop and the plot was weak in the end and it felt like a filler at the end due to some plot problems. I think there should have been an ending of the series in the third season that was good. I did like the show though and the ending was a good one. Recommendation: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was lucky enough to have been in San Francisco and the Bay Area during the first week of October, where I visited with my mother who is an old woman, and I also had a lot of luck when I got the chance to spend time in Berkeley and San Francisco. I had read that the film was set in San Diego, California, where the first installment of a planned three part movie was being filmed. I think it's the first movie in a trilogy, and it's certainly a good one, it's a very different type of movie than the typical sci-fi movie. It's a more realistic science fiction movie, not with alien spaceships but it's not too unrealistic either. It really makes you think about where the human race is going and it shows a whole new side to our society. There's plenty of action and action sequences that are memorable and really make you feel like you're part of this world. I love the ending and how everything plays out. It takes place in two locations, San Diego and Oakland and they've managed to have a lot going on in both places. There are some good supporting actors in the film, but there's a bit of an under-representation in the female characters. There were a lot more women in Star Trek: The Next Generation than there are in this film, and in addition to the main star and the lead actress, there are some others, but I felt they all kind of stood out from each other and it wasn't really a big deal. Overall I loved it, and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a fresh take on the classic sci- fi universe. The score by John Williams, the music was great and it was a good action movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I bought this movie a couple of months ago. I have yet to finish it but I was really impressed by how well the movie does its job. I'm not going to give away spoilers but for those that haven't seen the movie I'll give you a little hint of how it works.   It seems like a normal man tries to make friends with a strange woman. She seems like she's a little odd but seems like an honest person. The movie starts out with a lot of small things and they seem small to most of the people. As the woman comes closer the people around her seem to change. One minute she's just an ordinary girl who is at a bus stop talking with a random guy. The next moment they're at a strange party and suddenly someone from the party gets kidnapped. The girl realizes they were just at the wrong party and goes searching for the kidnappers. The first thing she does is grab a gun and they chase a group of them through the woods. This scene is the first time we see a lot more blood in this movie, and it was pretty damn impressive. As they chase these guys they encounter a number of people that make them worry. The one girl tries to take their hostage so the guy kills her. Next to die is the man that was with the girl at the bus stop. After that the movie starts to progress in a really fun way. The man starts to really develop a weird relationship with his girlfriend. The two share a lot but that doesn't stop them from being in a relationship. The couple has a lot in common but things go from a normal relationship to something more. They are both just ordinary people but somehow they get to become lovers. This film takes a lot from movies like Scarface. You've got a gang trying to kill some people but they're trying to do it in a way that has never been done before. The whole movie has the theme of the unknown man getting to know someone new. The story is quite a bit different and the movie actually has a couple different endings. I really enjoy this movie and it's actually pretty well written. This isn't something I'd say that people need to see to get into horror. Just because it's really weird doesn't mean that it's any less enjoyable. I would recommend this to a person who wants to see a good horror movie with a couple really different endings that are entertaining. I actually think that a lot like the movies in the Saw franchise this
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are only so many good movies that people will want to watch.   It was my first big screen movie, and it was an absolute pleasure to see it with all the extras, particularly the behind-the-scenes features.    It doesn't just talk about some of the best movie stars of all-time like Marlon Brando, James Stewart, Gary Cooper and George Cukor. It actually does a great job of actually portraying what was going on in the minds of those actors during their performance.  I especially liked the fact that it talks about the relationship between Gene Kelly and Marlon, particularly during their off-off-on sets in Italy in 1940.     This is another one of those very enjoyable stories.   You can read more reviews of it at www.my.nbc.com.   A quick note for all the readers:  There is an excellent article in The Movie Bible about this movie at www www.moviebible.org.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had not seen the movie and I was interested enough to write about it. The movie is called "The Day After Tomorrow". If you are not familiar with the movie then there is no point in telling you that it is a good film. The story is that after a nuclear attack, a man has to take over a space station so that they can repair and maintain it. As he starts to go through the motions of working for the station, he meets some of the local inhabitants. The problem is that the people want the station back. In order to bring the station into line, they plan a massive massacre. The film is interesting but it is not the most original. If you haven't seen it then you might want to consider watching it first. However, it does offer a lot of good laughs so you might be interested enough in watching it anyway. I do want to mention the fact that if you get to the part where they plan the massacre, then you will understand what the problem is, as the film is told in the perspective of an alien (or a human) who has grown up on this planet.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think it's okay, but that's mainly because I don't have anything against the story. I do have problems with the pacing and the ending. I feel like there was way too much going on in the first 5 minutes (I know it's short, but still…) And then when the plot starts to pick up a bit, everything is so rushed that it really takes some of the enjoyment out of the movie. I'm not going to lie and say that it's just because I'm in the minority (I really like movies that are hard to rate, especially ones with a decent cast) but the pacing really did get on my nerves. I've noticed a lot of people complain about the lack of action in this movie, but what does it even mean? We're told it's time to go on a quest, but we're shown nothing of what that means in terms of setting or anything. There are a couple of scenes where we see a little bit of action, but they're so short and rushed, it just doesn't look right, even if it's from the point of view of a character that is supposed to be "the best hunter in the world" or whatever. The plot is good, but I definitely feel like it could have been a lot better. There's a lot going on without any clear goals, and some things that seem to be important but not explained. As the movie goes on, there are many unanswered questions and some plot inconsistencies that I think just happen because the story didn't have enough time to develop or do a lot at once. If there's a movie that is better for your first movie, this is it. If you already know your characters, this movie is probably not for you, but if you are still on the fence, you may want to give it a try. And if you're looking for something a little different, this might be it.     I'm a little confused as to what I thought was the point. So the story is basically about a girl that gets abducted by aliens, that get her through a very convoluted set of circumstances and end up using her as a "host" for the baby. From there the story starts to become a little less about the aliens and a little more about the girl trying to get back home. But where does it go from there? It feels like the movie got lost along the way, and ended up focusing on something completely different from what it started out as.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   You'll probably find that the vast majority of "hits" on IMDB.com and IMDB in general are just bad movies, not "good" movies, and I'll probably have the same reaction to your reviews.    This is because there is no point in rating movies, only movies.  What's really important is "What did you like?" and "What didn't you like?".   In other words, is it good? If it's not good, then "it's not that bad" is all the more reason to give it a negative review.  Don't forget that there are two kinds of negative reviews:  1.  Hits   1) HITS.  2) Bad movies. 1)  What do you like about a movie?   Don McLean's "Bridge Over Troubled Water"? What about "Pineapple Express"? If you say "I liked it", then it was a "hit".  If you said "It's not a great movie", that's what's wrong with it.  It wasn't a hit, it's just not that good. 2)   Bad movies are bad.  3)  They aren't "bad" in the way that McLean or Pineapple Express are bad - they just aren't good.  For example, if I said "Pina Coladas" was "good", it would sound like I was making a statement about "What's good in life?"  But actually, it was just a bad movie.  The bad parts of a movie are all the other bad movies that were in its vicinity.  If the bad parts don't suck, they don't matter.  So how do you determine if a movie is good or bad?  What is it about it that you like?  If it is just a good time, that's a "Hit".   A good time for me is anything that is entertaining.  I'll go to a rock concert, see a big movie, and see a great piece of art.  But you know what's a hit?     Something that makes me laugh out loud and smile.  Something where I have to stop my own laughter every once in awhile.    That's what I love about comedy, and that's how I will always judge a comedy. If you're looking for something to laugh at, something that makes you say, "That
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a movie you can tell the people who love "Happily Married" would have loved this movie. The actors are all really good in this movie, and it works really well in their roles. All the characters are likable, except for one - and she really gets to have her character's back. That is just the only bad thing that can be said about this movie for a character. The plot is a little convoluted, but I don't really care because of how much I liked the movie.  What more can I say about this one:  This movie's plot may be complicated, but it does have a few twists and turns that make it even more interesting. The music in this one is beautiful and the ending is good.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "And so it was at the end of October, as if in a fairy tale, a fairy godmother gave the hero, the man, a mighty gift: a little girl. She was dressed in a white dress, with red bows and ribbons and golden bracelets and shining silver shoes and a huge golden hat that covered her face. She stood before him, her curly hair falling over her shoulders, and her dark blue eyes shone. "She looked so beautiful. He could have touched her; he could have kissed her. He looked at her, at the girl with the golden hair and the red hat, and he knew she was his. "'I am,' he thought, 'the man whom she will give into the hands of the King of the Elves. He will come home with me, and we shall have a long time of happiness, for it will be all because of you that we have the beautiful girl, and I will never stop thinking of her.' "'It must be true!' thought the man."
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like a movie, you should rate it.   I am so grateful that people liked my movie and that they liked it enough to rate it on IMDb.  I was so happy to see the ratings and know that it was going to do well.  Even if you don't have an opinion, rate it!  This is what it is all about.  The internet is great for talking about movies but IMDb can also be amazing for ratings.  Thanks to IMDb ratings, we will not have to wait any longer for a new movie to be released, because if you love a movie and rate it, it will be released. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife loved it. I have never watched an action movie as good as "Star Wars". It had great action scenes. The dialogue was great. The acting was great and was made even better by the fact that they were all speaking at the same time. The special effects were great. They used CGI for the most part but it wasn't overdone. It was all done by real special effects people. My only complaint is that the computer generated images were really hard to watch sometimes. It's like watching a movie that was created to look realistic. I can't say enough about the film and I think it is the best "Star WARS" movie. I will be watching it again just for the fun of it and the fact it came out so late in the series. I don't really see why anyone would think it's a bad film but I guess people do.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you liked The Avengers, then this will be a big disappointment to you. And, if you didn't, then just read the first paragraph of this review. There are lots of bad movies that people think are good and just don't see it, and so they don't get the benefit of the doubt. This is one of those films. I don't know what's worse, the film or the marketing. A film that's as poorly made as this should not be advertised as a big budget blockbuster. The only reason they had any advertising is because they had made The Avengers two years before and people were just waiting for it. That's just not enough time for marketing, and no movie is worth two years of time in the studio system.   I saw this in 3D, which I thought was a mistake, because it felt so...off. My jaw hit the floor. It really wasn't my thing. I'm more of a fan of big action movies. They can look amazing if you don't pay attention to the little details, and this movie was the opposite. I know I'm being harsh, but a big screen film is only as good as the people in front of it. If you're going to put a bunch of people in a theater, make them feel like they're a part of something big.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought I'd come back after a while and see how things had progressed, but I have to admit that after watching the first 10 minutes of this, I didn't want to keep watching any more.   However, once the movie progressed, the film began to gain interest.  I am pretty much a movie fanatic, so I was pretty happy with this film.  The plot was interesting and the characters were well drawn.  This movie is also the first Hollywood movie in Pakistan and as I said, this film was shot in Pakistan.  As a Pakistani movie lover, I really enjoyed watching this movie as there was nothing about it that looked or felt fake.  It is a bit too long to be considered a drama but it is still good entertainment for those who are familiar with the genre and want a bit more action.  A film like this deserves a watch even if you're not a big action fan as it will keep you interested.  You will also have a lot of laughs in this movie. THE BAD:  1) The ending wasn't as funny as I was expecting.  2) The voice of the main character was a bit annoying.    3) The dialogue was rather annoying. 4)  The main character's voice was a little off. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I didn't think I'd be able to talk about a movie in which the cast had just won an Academy Award, but I loved it. This is about a man who loves his wife and has a very difficult time getting over the death of her lover. He and his brother are at first very close friends until he finds out his brother is involved with a woman who's actually his wife's sister and that he's trying to get her out of her marriage. The movie is a little slow to get to the fun stuff about how these guys handle things, but it gets there quickly and well. The writing, editing, and acting was great. The director gave his characters a lot of emotion and it was really impressive that he managed to make them interesting. The acting was also outstanding with good performances by each of the characters. My favorite part of this movie was probably the final scene where my friend was in love with his wife. They had a really strong scene in this movie about their marriage and it made it a little hard to watch. The ending was unexpected and I loved the way it was handled. One of the best movies I've seen in years. (8.3/10) Tommy Wiseau - The Room (2003) Tommy-wiseau (Tommy Wiseau) is the man who created the infamous "Room" (also known as the "House of Wax" or the "The Real Estate Dealers Club") at the San Francisco, CA mansion. It is the story of a married couple, Dave and Lisa, who move to the house for a summer. Their first day is very different from their usual routines and their lives quickly change when their old friend Tommy (who is still married to his wife) invites them to go to a birthday party hosted by Tommy's wife, April (played by Nicole Kidman). It is at this party that Tommy meets April and she is instantly attracted to him. Things continue to change for Dave and his wife as they soon learn about Tommy's love of violence and his sadistic sense of humor and this changes their lives forever. It's quite amazing that The Room has become one of the most critically acclaimed movies in recent years. The script and directing was well executed and had a great deal of creativity. The performances were great. I especially liked Nicole Kid. The cast was just amazing. Tommy- wiseau (Wiseau) was just a wonderful actor, who seemed to be always on top of his game.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You need a good review to get a decent movie.   The best way to get an okay review is to write the review in an objective fashion.   You can see this for yourself if you sit down and actually watch the movie.   I won't get too technical, so feel free to ignore the first paragraph: The movie is pretty good, and is the perfect movie for people who can enjoy an overly comedic comedy, while trying to take an emotional journey and have some emotional connection with the story.  What this movie does exceptionally well is making the audience care about the characters. __________________________________ ___________________________________ _______________________________________ ____________________________________ ______________________________ This review is by no means complete. _________________________ ___________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just picked up this and it was a huge let down. The entire movie is about a father who is in a coma and is supposed to be dead. The movie is a huge mix of black and white. The dad doesn't really do much, which is a shame. He has an accent that is really bad. The scenes are extremely dark. The father doesn't like his wife, she is supposed be his lover, and she is constantly talking about how much she wants to have sex with him. The girl he is in love with was dead for 3 years and she didn't love him anymore, but now she wants him back. That's where the film goes wrong. When he wakes up he has no memory of his wife and her new love. He doesn't even remember the wife, or her name. All he remembers is her name and his little child. So the film is really just a story about a man who doesn't remember his dead wife, who is actually a woman. It also has some gay themes, which were really disgusting. But it's just a sad movie and it could've been done better. Just not something you watch unless you have some serious interest in the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:     If a film looks good or feels good to you, it has probably done your head in. It could be because you've been on an acid trip or it could just be the good effects of going to a cinema. A bad movie can be the most enjoyable thing ever. I don't usually like bad films.

The reason I watched it was that the reviews had been really good and I wanted to find out if I'd really got a bad film here or if this was just some silly B-movie. It was certainly not a bad B-film (if you could even call it that). It was just a film that I don'  I'd like to start off by saying that I am going to be quite honest about this review. I am a little bit biased. I have seen this film several times and I really don't feel like going through it again. It isn't that I dislike it. It just hasn't left a positive taste in my mouth. This is mostly because the characters are not likeable. The only character that I actually cared about, the main protagonist was a bit of a douchebag, but I won't get into that. The film is pretty much just a series of slapstick antics. Some of the sequences in this film are brilliant (the sequence where the main character's car is towed is one of my favourites) but others are just slapstick and cheesy. The cinematography and effects are very good. The sound effects are pretty funny and are quite clever. But the film is all about the slapstick as well. If you like slapstick then you will love this film.If you don't like slapsticks then you might find this film a bit boring, not to say bad. I wouldn't really call it a bad or mediocre film but it does leave a sour taste in your mouth.If I was to sum up this film up in one word, it would be "Sly".The film starts off with a very odd character that we are

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's hard to tell how much of a great movie this is and even harder to tell what's the exact point of the movie.   There's a lot of interesting stuff going on, there's a sense that things are going to get more and more messed up. But I can't figure out what the movie is about, or what its point is at all. I guess the premise is interesting: the old man who made the film has been dead for a long time and he was seen in a movie by a girl in the future.  When the girl grows up and gets to watch the movie with her mother she realizes that the man she saw is actually the person in the movie, and it's not her father. So now they go back in time to the past and they start a new life for the old guy (in a different time zone) in a village, but their time isn't long because they're interrupted by aliens who want to take over the world. It's pretty interesting, and at times it's pretty tense. But for whatever reason, when I think about it later, I don't know if it was a good idea. The movie takes way too long and it ends with an anticlimactic way to end things. It doesn't quite make me angry at the filmmakers or anything, but I guess it's a case of a movie taking too long to make something. Overall rating: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (a) a movie is just a film with some artistic value; (b) a positive statement is a "positive review" if it can be easily read as such;   The negative reviews are called the reviews "in your face" or "bullshit", (c) it was not so simple, there are all sorts of nuances, etc.   We may think of movies as pure entertainment, but we don't necessarily consider the effects we might be having on people (people who have problems with these movies, I suppose).        A movie is a piece of art and we must think critically of all the various elements that go into making it; it may seem trivial, but it's not.  Some good movies have a positive effect on others.  It could be a small effect, like being in a theater for a long time and watching something with someone you love.  Maybe you are in a movie with someone who really wants to be in a positive mood that day.  Perhaps it is a film about a little boy who is lost at sea, and one of his relatives is there and helps him.  What happens in a film could affect you.  A movie may be a distraction, but as it goes on and on, it can give you something to think about; it can remind you of times when life was not as bad, when you might have been able to escape your own misery.  This is a short summary of what I think is a good film, or a movie that can do good for you. I can't say that any of the movies I have mentioned has had any effect on me, but I hope I have helped someone with some ideas about what to watch.  I would love to have a movie for each of the following topics: Drugs/Addiction :    A movie with strong messages about the effect drugs have on your life, and on the people around you, as well as how they are used by those who want to make you feel guilty.  The movie would have to be a story that people could connect with.  We all know people who struggle with a drug problem, and so we can relate to someone whose life has been affected by the abuse of a drug.  And when we see the impact it has on people around us, it makes us think about the kind of damage we could be doing.   (I have a list of movies on this

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw that trailer for The Amazing Spider-Man I was intrigued. It reminded me of a bit of what I liked about my favorite superhero movies and I figured it would be a fun time to watch that movie. I ended up watching that movie last night for the first time and I was completely blown away. This movie is very entertaining, action packed and a lot of fun. Not to mention, it is very funny as well.   The best part about this movie is how the characters interact.  They all have their own personalities and it seems like the script has done a great job of showing them. The villains are very distinct and I think it is fun to watch them interact. The movie opens with a great chase scene between Peter Parker and Ned Leeds (Michael Keaton). They have been having some fun for the past few days, which has been keeping them in a constant state of adrenaline. It is one thing for Peter to want to go see Aunt May for her weekly checkup. It's another for him to be in danger of being discovered by Ned Leeds. It makes me wonder what is going to happen to Peter if he keeps getting in fights with Ned Leeds, especially because of his relationship with Liz. At first it seems that Ned is more interested in beating the hell out of Peter, but after they have a talk about the danger Peter poses to Ned, Ned gives Peter a piece of advice:  "You just have to take a deep breath and remember you are Spider-man. You are the hero of New York and I am Ned Leeds."  I absolutely love this scene and I loved it just as much in The Avengers. Ned is a great addition to the Marvel universe and I hope to see him in other movies. He is very different from the typical hero villains we have seen in the past. I am really curious to see how the movies will develop his character.  Another interesting aspect of this movie, is that we learn more about Ben Reilly. He isn't just a simple superhero. He has his own life and family to care about as well as being bitten by the radioactive spider. I think his character is very well done. I'm very interested to see where he will go and what he will do next.  I loved this movie and it's easy to see why everyone loved it when it was released last year. It was very exciting to see Spider-Boy and Uncle Ben. Not only that, but it was
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked it so much I made a "bad" rating on it.   It's not my favorite.  I had a hard time following the story and I was not a huge fan of this cast.  It has a lot of scenes that made me laugh.  What really bothered me about this movie is the scene where I realized that the woman in the wheelchair was going to die because the car's door opened.  How could that happen.  And now she's just dead.  When I realized it was coming I yelled "What the hell" and was very confused.  So I started to laugh a lot and that was when I knew it was going in a completely different direction.  The movie was funny, but it was a lot more depressing. I found it weird to have people die all over the place.  As if everyone were trying to avoid dying.  Then we learn about how they have to keep their memories in a safe place because it is hard to forget.  There is a woman in a wheelchair that we never see but she was very funny and I didn't know why she died.  This was one of the funniest movies I ever saw.

I couldn't imagine that any of this was real. We are a pretty good and good-hearted people, I think. I remember telling him I was going to Vietnam, and he said, "If you go, I'll see you in six weeks." We went. And we stayed in a military village."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   You want a positive story:   You want to be entertained:  It's like you've read a good book. You read about a great man, you learn about a terrible event that happened to him and you start to see things in his life that you don't see in real life. A bad event occurs, he becomes a hero and we are all happy. If you look at the whole film, there are a few scenes that are very dramatic but in the end, it's not that dramatic. In the end the whole event becomes a thing of the past. Your movie has the right idea, there is a story. The plot is not interesting but the story is interesting and the ending is great. It's not too long, it has good action and well paced. The actors all seem like they are having fun. I'm not the one to tell you to watch a film because it's a great movie but for a story of this nature, it was a little confusing to watch it. I liked it but I found it to be a little too much, I thought that some things should have been explained more clearly, maybe they should have just put all this in a small DVD with the original negative and we could watch it at home.
Write a positive review about a good movie:     This film contains strong language, violence, drug use, and sex. It also contains some sexual content, which isn't usually on my radar. I can't comment on the plot, but overall it was well made.   The acting was solid for the most part. The best performance, however, is that of the lead, which really made me believe that the director truly cared about his characters.  A couple of minor flaws: 1) As mentioned above, I think the film suffers from a minor "plot hole." I don't know how the police could have taken a video tape and only one copy, but if they did, they could have also easily deleted the other copy from their system. 2) There are times when the film gets too intense. However, this should not be too bothersome since this film is not a horror film. 3) It may seem to you that this film features lots of sex, but I assure you that it was not an "overage" feature.  I gave this film an A.  Thank you.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first trailer (and only one since the movie was released on VOD) for a new film about a man who had a very unusual and violent sexual encounter with a gorilla has arrived. I'd seen the trailer a couple of days ago, and it had me worried, as the trailer doesn't tell much more than what you'd expect to be true about this film. It's not as shocking or outrageous as some of the "Gorilla in the Mist" trailers that have gone out since the release of the film, but the gorillas in question are only found in a couple places in the film (at one point, the guy is actually eating one of them). There are some interesting touches in the trailer, but for the most part it's all about what you can look forward to seeing. The film's official synopsis has not yet been released, but I imagine it will be released in the coming weeks.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a strange feeling. I like the director's style, but I find it a bit too dark. This is the director I most want to watch, if I have a weekend and an hour for myself to watch something different. This film is a great example of how to do a dark sci-fi thriller right. The pacing was perfect, which is something I wish would be the case more often. The story was intriguing, yet never annoying. I found it intriguing to find out what happened after the first "encounter". The characters felt real, even though they were only shown briefly. I wanted to know more about them, but at the same time didn't want to know too much about them. The twist was good, but the ending was a bit abrupt. I don't think it was needed. There were also a few moments that were difficult to swallow. I also wished the film's ending was more meaningful. There was a scene at the end where the camera goes out, and I wish there was more. But overall, it was a great movie that is well worth the watch. A bit about myself: I was not a huge fan of science fiction before seeing this movie. I am not sure if it was because of the genre, but more so because I wasn't a huge sci-fic fan, or wasn't interested in that sort of film. After seeing this film, I am definitely interested again. The genre has nothing to do with the movie itself. There is a reason why this movie isn't better known. This movie isn the first installment in a trilogy (I think they are called "Visions of the Future" in the USA). This movie was made back in 1981, which was before the genre was as big as it is now. I highly recommend this movie, even if you don't like science fiction. I loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone, and anyone who likes sci-fiction movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best part of the movie is the song by the artist Boney M. The music alone makes the movie an unforgettable one. I don't want to spoil too much, because I don the full film but I will just say that the song "Championship" is awesome and I love it. - 9/10   This movie is worth the price of admission. The film itself is really good and the song is great! If you're a movie buff, then this is the movie for you!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    5 of 5 stars Amy This is a great movie about love and hate in the relationship between two women. I think it was one of the best movies to come out this year. If you are going to watch this, you better make it a priority to watch it this year because it is so good that you won't want to wait until 2016 for it. The story is told through a series of letters between the two main characters. This movie is very well acted and written. There are some very funny scenes that make this movie really enjoyable to watch.  4 of 5 Stars Rachel The movie's about love, not just between two people but between two different ways to express love. I'm not a fan of the film but it was so well acted that I never felt like I was watching a movie. The movie was interesting and I could see where it was going. .  The story, and that of this movie, is not your typical romantic comedy. This film is more about the emotions that are in everyone's head when they are being in love. These emotions are called the love triggers, and they cause a huge difference between a person and his/her lover. This is about the two women, and the relationships between them, and their mutual love. The film's a very good film with a good plot, a good ending, and great acting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The most important thing is to not hate the person that made the movie. The same way that you shouldn't hate an actor for making a shitty movie, you shouldn 't hate an actress for making an awesome one. You're supposed to love both of them for their efforts and not hate one and want the other to be perfect." -   "When the camera lingers on her skin and body, it looks like she's getting ready to get dressed, because it's a good outfit, not because she's doing some choreography. I mean, it's pretty cool that she's dancing, because I know from personal experience how much pain that can cause." - -  - "The film takes us on a tour of this very famous theatre and it's one of the best places in Hollywood to see it." -   - "I can't even explain how much I love this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2010) was a terrific film, and not just because it featured Tom Cruise as a mummy. The film is not only a good horror film but an enjoyable one with some terrific actors and a very original plot. The plot involves a tomb full of dead gods, and a band of warriors who are led by a mummified dragon. The mummification of dragons is not something new as it was done in many films. The problem with the film is that the film itself is just the opposite of a good film. When it came out, The Mummifyers and The Mummies: The Rise and Fall of a Dynasty both came out and both were decent, entertaining and funny films. However, Tomb of The Dragon Emperor was not. I thought it was mediocre and a big disappointment. When I saw it in the theaters, I was not impressed and was shocked at the sub-par acting from everyone involved. However with a little more time, I thought maybe it would have gotten better. In the end, the film was just not funny and it was a disappointing movie.  The film's plot was fairly generic and didn't have many surprises:  I won't go into details of the plot because this was the main complaint about the movie. When you read the description of this film, you will see how the movie has a good plot. However the plot doesn't have a ton of surprises as there is nothing that comes out of left field or anything like that. What happens is that you just follow the main character as he embarks on a journey that will take him around the world to find out what has happened to his family.    Unfortunately, the characters didn't do a great job with the screenplay as well. The acting from the characters is just terrible. Everyone is either just so dumb, and you can't tell if the actors are really drunk or just drunk in a way that is hard to tell. They are basically drunk in every scene. It's just a very terrible performance from everyone.  To top it all off, the script was horrible. You read the film and are just amazed that the script is so bad. The story is just silly and you don't feel the emotion that is created by the story. It was hard to even watch because the story was so bad in all aspects of the film.    The acting was also terrible, but maybe that's my fault for being bad

It gives you a lot of laughs and heart, and it's about as dark as the movie's going get. It has one of my favorite lines ever: "I want to be a bad bitch" by Jennifer Love Hewitt. The movie is fun, and you will smile along the way.  -   I highly recommend this movie. I am now a very satisfied and satisfied subscriber.

I'm talking about the movie that you like to watch and that you can go and see on opening day, but you don't want to talk about it with anyone because its such a mess...

My only criticism is that there is no special effects in the movie.  If you are a fan of movies such as this one, then you will enjoy this.  A great family movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few months ago I was reading a book about women's history and found myself in the midst of a discussion about a very famous, important historical event: The Spanish-American War. The book, by the author and journalist Diana Lane, was a good read, but I couldn't make heads or tails of it. The events of the war—its magnitude, its tragic human cost—just seemed like an overhyped, one-dimensional account of the conflict, in which America was the bad guy. It also left me feeling really confused about the whole thing.   A few months later, I went to see the movie with my best friend. When I saw it, I found it a much more rewarding experience. It was not only a great movie but also the first time I had really experienced a story about women in war. I thought it would be easy to find a story that captured the complexity of the women's role in the war, but it was not. We knew that women fought in the Mexican War of 1846, the War of American Independence, and the Civil War, and we had heard about their heroic contributions. But in many cases they were the main protagonist of their stories. When women fought, it was only because they wanted to be, not because they were forced or needed to be.  I want to show a short film by one of my favorite filmmakers, Jean-Luc Godard. In the movie, a woman who works as a spy tries to save her country from the Communist menace by trying to steal a special weapon. She gets caught, and is sent to a psychiatric asylum.  There, she is abused and tortured. After all this, she returns to the army to work for the Americans, and there she discovers that the Americans really don't have a place for her. I don't know if Godard intended for the film to be this interesting, but in the end, he did it brilliantly.

The plot is interesting, and the acting is top-notch. I was worried the characters would get too cheesy but they are all so real that it doesn't take much to be believably cast as them. I would recommend this movie to anybody.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It was so much fun to play a character that didn't speak! You are allowed a lot of personality and, I think, a lot more depth than you usually get in movies!" -M. D. S:  Hahahahaha. Yes, it is fun to be able to play someone who can speak the language and not have to do the speaking.   So many things have changed with the translation.  The character of   a woman who can understand English better than an American was a big one.  In Japanese, it seems to me, women are not much different than men. In fact, the whole concept of "women's work" has been pretty much ignored in Japanese movies up until this point, and it was kind of an awesome little challenge to go off the script and do something different.  But for the sake of the movie, I made her seem even more feminine and mysterious, even though she did not speak a word in Japanese.     It was also a fun challenge to play two characters who had only been seen in one scene together in the movie.  I think that the first person has the upper hand, but the second person is very good in that scene.  Finally, I thought it was fun to have the whole audience watching the movie in Japanese, and to be one of them was a real treat for me.  Oh, and by the way, it was great to see that it was not just my Japanese speaking audience who enjoyed my character.  What was really amazing was the number of people who said that they enjoyed the movie as well.   So, as far as the movie goes, I would highly recommend this to any one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Dude! That was great!"  BEST MOVIE EVER:  The Shining:  "The best movie of all time," said my son, "you really did it this time."  (He then pointed to the clock and said, "Don't I look like I'm going to die, you know. I'm gonna have to go before it gets dark.") I knew I had done something right that night.  THE TANGIBLE.   I was in awe.  The very idea of "The Shining" was surreal. It was a movie so vast in scope that I felt my mind had to be held in such a way that I could fully grasp it, as if to make sure it wasn't some sort of nightmare.  I am not sure if I am the first person to have experienced "The Exorcist."  If so, I feel honored to have shared that experience with others.  But the movie that really made an impression on me was Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.  No other movie had made me so completely understand what the hell was going on in that place, but this movie was so profound and disturbing that I think the entire rest of my life would have been a farce if not for its impact.  This movie did more to define me than anything else ever did.  It's a movie that has been the subject of countless re-readings and re-watches.  For the past couple of years, my children have been obsessed with it.   So, when they were asked what movie they wanted to see for their 4th birthday, the first thing I mentioned was The Shining, not to be confused with Stanley Kubrick and his movie of the same name.  My daughter was immediately attracted to the book it was based on and decided to watch it.  And so my love for The Shining was never quite truly gone.  But there has always been one scene in this movie that I can't stand.  To me, it represents everything that is wrong with a story.  There was no story. No character development. Nothing to hold a story together.  After watching that scene, I thought to myself, "Oh my God.  How could anyone watch that scene?  This is a movie, not a horror movie."  This scene is a sign that the filmmakers have lost the plot and, instead of creating a world, they have only taken a bunch
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It takes a few minutes before the audience feels comfortable with the story, which is by no means bad or simplistic; it's just that, as the title implies, a lot of people die in this story, and they're a lot more interesting than the heroes are." "This is a really good example of an animated film in which the animation is pretty good and the story is fairly original and very well done. It's certainly a solid animated film and one of the best of the '80s."  A quick history of anime movies:  This list is a work in progress.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      " This is the film that made me love the American Horror Story TV series. It's dark, it's scary, and it's full of great character moments." -Sara Wahlberg "I can't believe this is really a movie. I can't even wrap my head around the idea of people dressed in clown makeup being able to impersonate victims of a horrific crime. I'm still processing this, but I think it's going to be a very well made movie. The story line, the makeup, the way that the acting is done, the costumes....it is brilliant and it is really unsettling. But what I love about it is that it is all so well done. So well done that I can see someone dressed up as a clown walking down the street and being totally normal. And then later in the movie we see someone who's been out for hours trying to avoid the clown and he's totally freaked out by the costume and the makeup and the way the face looks." -Jasmine Brannigan  - "I have to say, I really love the story line. It plays on what we have known about American Horror stories so much - and more - but it is so fresh and funny, and I love seeing it put all together. I think the fact that there's a lot of horror fans who will watch it and say, 'I didn't know that there was a clown in the house.' It's a fun movie, but it isn't as scary as most of the other ones. It doesn't hold up to American Horror Stories." -Nina Arianda - "This film was so intense and creepy. I thought it was a very effective mix of horror and comedy. I also enjoyed seeing such an unconventional cast." -Eric Kripke  -- "This is a funny, very disturbing film with a great performance by Sarah Paulson. It is a good example of the art of horror as seen in the series' previous installments. It also offers a few surprises." -The A.V. Club "  A darkly comedic thriller that delivers a number of great scenes that will haunt you for years to come." -Slant "   This film is a true horror masterpiece. The acting and the gore are superb." -Deadline " A great and shocking film that you are sure to love. It features some of the best gore and performances in the history of the franchise." -Film.com 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's amazing how fast people will forget their lives and go from being happy, enjoying their family and friends, to hating and being angry. I feel that it is in all of our lives. It is so very wrong and very very sick.     I didn't want to write this review because it was so personal.  I hope people can look at this with a little more compassion, and maybe learn some things about themselves and not be so hateful.  I have read more than a few horror/mystery books in the past, and I have to say this is probably my favorite.  My favorite part is the book's premise.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It was great  because it wasn't about any one character or theme or anything. It was about the world that we live in today. In particular, it showed how our society and culture today has warped our ability to accept others for who they are.   This movie may have been directed at teenagers, but it was still relevant and useful. I remember reading a blog about a character named "Tom," and how his family was basically just a bunch of dysfunctional people. The movie was about his struggles with that, but also the more difficult issue of trying to accept someone for who he really was. It showed the consequences of these kinds of mistakes and how they would later be a part of Tom's life.  The film was amazing and a great watch.  In the end, I think it's a great movie for all ages.  To me, it's the best depiction of the human condition I've ever seen. I hope more people who go through similar situations find it in their hearts to learn from it and make the same choices I did, especially today.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is one of the best movies to ever hit the silver screen. The film centers around two veterans of World War I who are out in the middle of nowhere during the summer of 1923 to escape the horrors of war and the poverty of the Depression. After a number of mishaps, both men make it out safely with a few dollars each. One of the men, Sam Spade, is in his late 40s. The other is a young man named James Cagney. They meet at the local saloon. Spade is an upper middle class Irishman. He is a man who has been through a lot and is looking to avenge his fallen comrades and make amends with his wife and children. Cagny is the opposite of this. He has a broken leg that makes it difficult for him to walk and he is in the service of his father-in-law who has a shady reputation in the neighborhood. However, Cagnew is a talented gunfighter who has the skills and confidence to outshoot Spade. Their relationship is not always harmonious. When Cagno finds out about Spade's financial problems and has to take over a gun shop, Spade doesn't take well to that situation. It also shows Cagnell's temper on a number to times when Spade seems to have a more pressing problem. CAGny tries to get Spade out of his way but Spade will not listen. The final nail in Spade and Cagnel's relationship comes in a scene in which Cagco goes into the saloon to confront Spade about his affair with the former owner. The two go at it in a confrontation that ends with Spade hitting Cagney in the head with his gun, killing him. After his death, Caggies head lies near the door of the salumand. A short time later, it appears that Spade has also been murdered. After much searching they find his body in a creek bed. It is revealed that Cagneghey was killed by a sniper while trying to protect a prostitute from an angry mob. In the end, both Spadeand Cagner are avenged.

I know it doesn't sound like much of a "good" movie but it was a lot of fun and very entertaining.  To give some ideas about what to look out for: ... the movie is set in a small seaside town and the character is played by the awesome Kristen Bell.  (The movie was released in 2011 and the movie poster was used for this review)  Her character is a young girl, who seems to be a bit strange at first but gradually becomes more interested in the people around her.  The movie also features a cast of really talented actors.  There's Jason Sudeikis, who played the character of Steve, a good friend of the girl, and, of, course, Kristen Bell (who plays the girl's mother, Mrs. Bell).  The best part about this movie is that you don't really have to know much about the movie.  It's a movie with a good plot, a lot happening in it, but you don a know very little about the actual movie.  I found myself liking this movie. It was quite funny and I was watching it without any expectations.

If you look at the plot of the movie, the character development, the performances, and what you think of the film - all the above will be the same in the end. So in that sense it's like an anime movie. I can say that there are different genres of film, but at the end of the day - the story is what is important. And it is that I'm grateful. - 6  by jasmine  on 11:24 PM March 30, 2012   "Taken" is a movie, not a book. Take what is useful for the purpose of the story, leave the rest. If a book is too long, it becomes a burden to read. If it is too short, it doesn't interest you and can be skipped. This is not a "how to" book. It is simply a movie about one day in a boy's life. You have to read it for yourself. You can easily watch it in a weekend, if that's your choice. So I'm recommending it in this format: watch the movie first, then read it. Enjoy the ride. What is most interesting, is that not all of the characters in the movie have the same characteristics. Some are better at certain things, some are better in certain aspects, and so on. It's very interesting to see how their lives will develop over time. Also you get a peek on how their family lives, the kind of things they can do and what sort of challenges they face. So it's a different view than we usually have on people. - 5  By  David  On 11:26 PM March 31, 2012 "There are no villains, only people in a bad situation. It takes place in a high school.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   1.   (Somewhat underrated)   This was a brilliant film. I haven't seen any other film by this writer that is more interesting than this.   The film was so good that the only thing that I would change is maybe some of the dialogue, because it felt really clunky and artificial at times.  2.  (Very good)    The last two sentences on this is one of my favorites.  The film also had one of the most original and clever use of music and sound in the movie, that I have ever heard in a movie.  I thought that the film was very good, but it didn't reach a place that I felt was more than just a very good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (and if you have never seen this film, there's nothing here for you, either.)  The cast are great, the film is great, but most importantly, the script is great. It's got the same tone of the first and it's even better than the first. The film has that kind of dark, dark humor that I really enjoy in my comedies.   This was made for the people who love the '80s (that was the time the film came out), but you can also enjoy this film for the times it's dated a little, or even for the time it was made.  The film is also a good story.  It's not very deep, and doesn't have a particularly interesting main character, but it's a fun, entertaining, and well-written film.  There is some bad language in this film. I don't think it's necessarily a deal breaker, but I do find it distracting and really, it isn't a big deal.  As for the actors, the cast does what they do well: play off each other's characters.  In particular, they do a great job of bringing the '60s setting and the '70s style together, and the movie doesn't come off as a total bore.  I found the actors to be really good.  The film's plot is about two brothers (Gary Oldman and Paul Bettany) who find themselves in the middle of a high-stakes drug war and have to navigate their way through the entire situation and come out the other side unscathed.  This film is a good way to check out a good actor/actress combination.  At first, they look a little bit bland. But after a while, you start to find their personalities come together. Gary Oldman really does have an air of confidence and poise to his character, while Paul Bettan is great at playing a guy who's got no idea what he's doing and has to figure it out, but really can't help himself.  Gary Old, of course, is the villain, but he also has a good time, too, and I don' have a problem with that.  These actors are great at what they're doing, and they make the whole film work.  Overall, this is a really enjoyable film to watch.  The story isn't deep or complicated, and there are little moments of humor to go with the whole plot, but
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You've been asking for it.   Now you've got it, in spades.  This is the most interesting and challenging film I've ever watched.  It does not give in to clichéd stereotypes, and instead goes into a completely original and original direction.  The script is a wonderful blend of action, adventure, comedy, and tragedy.  The way the story is told is amazing.  I love how the characters' emotions are revealed through dialogue and their actions.  But for me, this film was a lot more than a fun ride.  Every character's story is interwoven with each other, as well as with some familiar characters.  From a woman who has been trapped in her own body for years, to a former soldier who has lost everything because of his past mistakes, and finally, a girl who was once the prettiest girl in school, the film has a great focus on the relationships among the characters. "The House with a Clock in Its Walls" has a lot to say about relationships and humanity.  "The Clock" really shows you that there is something wrong in the world of the living.  Even though they are only a few minutes long, the scenes are really well executed.  They give you an emotional connection, and it was very nice to see them finally come together.  We see several of the characters in different situations, and there is a very strong sense of character development.    The film ends with a great twist that left me in awe.  After all the drama and horror, there is this simple but powerful message:  The world is a mess.  Everything is wrong, and you have to decide for yourself if you want to change it. This film was released in 1996. It's been a while since I have seen it, so I thought I would share the movie.  What a great film, a great story, and a great ending.  My wife is a huge horror fan, and she loved the film.  She loves that there was no zombies, and I liked that there wasn't any monsters. She didn't think there was much of a plot, but she loved it.   You can read more about the movie in my review.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen some great movies in my life but, there are times that I'm really bored of them and it feels like it's just me and my movie.   Like this movie is just for me.  It doesn't bother me too much, I'm used to watching other movies and I'm sure other people like it, but I'm just like the guy in the movie: "I'm in it for the hell of it. I don't care what the movie is. I'm gonna watch it.  "
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so excited for this movie as I love all the films from this great director and he has proven that he is one of the greatest directors of our time. When I saw the trailers for this film I was not disappointed and I think I would give this movie a 8 out of 10 out of pure love for the film itself. It was a fun movie and I loved how the director used humor to make the story more intriguing and entertaining.    A wonderful experience. The cast and crew gave it a real sense of the 60's.  This movie has great action, characters, and great plot. The ending is not really as neat as you would think it is. It wasn't overly shocking or too over the top. It just sort of wraps up the story well enough to feel like the ending is really cool and the world is not finished with just yet.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie is a positive review of a  good movie and there's no reason to have a negative review of a bad movie (unless you're complaining about  the bad parts).   I really enjoyed this movie a lot.   It wasn't a good picture and I'm glad that the studio made it and that I get to see it (not that I don't get to see it too many times though!).   The story was a bit boring but what's a remake without a great story?   In the beginning of the movie, you can see how hard it was for the team to finish the movie since they've spent so long on the story.  The ending was also a little bit too much and it's hard to say if it's because of the lack of budget or because of the actors in it.  Some of the best actors don't do as well as they did on the last movie and it takes away from the experience.  I enjoyed the story a lot and I think that everyone who doesn't remember the last movie could appreciate the story here.  However, if you have already seen the last film then you'll probably think the story wasn't as strong because it's not as emotional for some people.   I think if the plot was better, the movie could have been even better because it was a good action film and it did what it was supposed to do but it was a different kind of action film.  There were a lot of cool moments in the movie such as when the guys go to the lake to search for their plane.  You can see that they're going for a really nice scene and I liked the whole scene where they get their plane in the lake.  They found their plane and the final scene was a little anticlimactic.  I also love the scene where the guys are flying the plane and they have this really funny conversation with the helicopter they're flying with.   There are so many things I loved about the movie and I really wish that it would have been better.  But that's the movie.  It wasn't a bad movie.    Overall, I'd rate this movie at a 6.5.  What's it all about?  A couple of weeks ago, a film that I really liked got

As for the story and characters...well, let's just say I'm glad this wasn't a big "Toto" movie (that I actually watched).

It is a story that will keep me busy for a long time to come. My heart is full of emotions and I know it will make some people cry. I have enjoyed every moment of watching it, I was able to enjoy every story and every part of this movie. One thing to note is that the music, while good for the movie, is not for everyone. It was the music for a movie that has no lyrics and has a few scenes in the first and last act. I enjoyed this movie and I hope you will too."  1. The Dark Knight Rises (2012) 2.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So many movies that we saw in the theatre were so bad we ended up in tears, especially because the bad movie was a sequel to a really bad movie.   When the new movie came out, it was supposed to be a big hit, we thought, but no. It was so bad that everyone hated it.  This movie was so poorly made that I don't even want to think about how it will look like a year or two from now.  When a good film like this comes out, all you can do is love it. I love this movie so much.  I want to watch this over and over again, and it makes me so happy that I've been wanting to do that all along.  And now that I know it's so bad, I'm so glad I went to see this movie and that I had the chance to see it the way it was meant to be seen.  You know what the worst part is, though?  How could anyone watch that movie and think it was good?

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I love this movie... the acting is good (even if the lead actor is a total idiot. but it does make the story that much better. I was really expecting more. the music was really good. but the directing was poor. the actors acting was not funny and the plot was not very good... but for an 80s movie you could do a lot worse. This movie should be called "Dino's Quest". And it might be." "This was a good film for some reason... it's a story that made me laugh, and I laughed a lot. There's also a lot of people with a lot to say, and it's great to hear about people's experience. I can't think of anything that I don't like about this movie." A well-written and well-acted movie. One of the reasons I chose this film for the list is that it was written by William Lustig. William Lustigs screenplay "The Man Who Would be King" is the inspiration for this movie, so it's good that he wrote it. This is not a good story. I didn't like the ending. The story is not interesting. The script was not well researched. I would like to see a better story, not like this one. I will give this movie 5 stars, but I don´t think I will enjoy it more than a 3 or 4. Posted by James at 8:50 AM
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A Star Wars film doesn't need to be great. It simply needs to be good, it just needs to not be awful. If Star Wars: The Force Awakens is awful, then it's not a bad film, it's simply bad in the same way that many bad films are:   A bad story, bad acting, and a bad script.  In a review that focuses on the plot and characters, you can miss the one thing that Star Wars fans have been waiting for.   The Force is strong with this movie.  If you are a Star Wars fan, then you'll enjoy this film just as much as I did.  Star Wars is back and in a brand new Star Wars trilogy that is the best one since Return of the Jedi. The film looks incredible, it has great effects, and it's filled with new characters and new aliens.  I am going to give this film a solid B+, because in my opinion this is one of the best Star Wars films since Return Of The Jedi, and since it's part of a new trilogy that could have been a real treat. The only negative thing I can say about this film is that they are using a bad CGI monster for a new character. But that's nothing to be worried about, this CGI monster is not in the first film, and he was only there because they used CGI to make the monster in The Force Unleashed look more alien.  For a Star War film, this is actually pretty good. It's got some great action scenes, and great dialogue. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're still reading, thank you for reading my post. If you've found this post useful, then please give it a thumbs up and let me know. And, of course, if you've never seen the film, then it's well worth a look.   If you're just catching up on this movie's backstory, see my review for my thoughts on the film.   If your curiosity about my reviews is so strong, and you don't mind that there's a big gap between my reviews and my post itself (especially since I've seen the movie in a theater), then let's dive in. I'm going to start off with a disclaimer that the way I review movies is by watching them first in the theater with a friend. So don't take my reviews to be my "official" views of the movie or anything, as the way it played out in the cinema is my personal take on the movie.   As such, some of these comments and analysis may not be appropriate for those who don't have the time to go to a movie on their own. Also, if it's too long for your taste, or you just want to skip to the part that interests you most, click the skip button below to move right to the review. In the next installment of my review series, I'll be tackling the action sequences. This movie does have one of my favorite action scenes in movie history.   It's probably my favorite scene in a film.  It is one of the most memorable scenes in film history, and it's also my favorite fight scene in the history of film. I don't know if there are any other scenes in action films I would put that high on the list, and that is what makes it so great.  Here is a little story about why it's my favorite, though.  It's the first fight scene I ever saw, and I only saw it twice in all my years of watching movies, before the film's release. I remember it quite clearly, as it's one of those scenes that just jumps to your mind and makes you remember. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about it, because it's pretty much a classic fight scene that everyone knows, and everyone has a favorite scene from. Anyway, the film was a bit different at the time, so I don´t remember the exact location and timing of the scene, but I do

But it would be great if you would write a review that is honest and respectful. That's all I can ask for.  You can write a good review about any good and/or bad movie; a good one might be:  "This movie is good!  Please watch it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was very disappointing as a new release.   I have seen the first movie and liked it, however this movie doesn't hold up as well as it did in the first one. The story is simple, we are introduced to a little girl who is afraid of all of the monsters that lurk in the forest. She starts getting bullied, but she learns to fight back. It seems like this was going to be a great movie, but it really wasn't. The writing is horrible and the acting was not that good either. The animation was great, the colors were great, and the animation was done very well. I guess my main gripe is the story line itself, it's very simple and there really isn't any meaning or depth to it. There were so many characters in the movie that were just there for the sake of it, that it felt very forced.  My first impression of this movie was great.  There was no one in this movie that was interesting, there was no villain, and there were just so many random characters that I did not connect with. I also found that there wasn't too much depth to the story at all, it was just there to make the movie more entertaining and get me to watch it, which it did. The music was also great, but that's not exactly a bad thing.  The acting was decent at best.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I found myself in love with this movie and it made me laugh a lot.   I had a hard time picking a favorite character of this movie. There are a few people that are memorable but they are only characters. The movie is really full of character and that's what makes it great.  It's a very unique movie. I don't have much of a favorite scene in the movie and I don.t want to spoil it but it's worth watching.   There's a lot of different scenes and they all make sense with each other.  The movie has a story that keeps going and you don't really know what's going to happen and that makes it a little more exciting.  If you like mystery and science fiction and want something different then I'd say you should give this a try.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie has some good scenes but it's not great, and the whole movie feels like the last 2 years' of a movie that could have been great but was made worse by too many directors and too many writers. The story starts off slow but slowly changes to something very, very different. Then the movie takes a weird turn into a sort of mystery/suspense/horror film with some really nice moments. It's worth it just to see the last 20 minutes. It gets very, VERY creepy but also a lot of fun.   In this movie you will meet:  -  The "Wasp," a kind of spider-girl.  She's pretty and gets to do some really scary things.  It seems like she could be an actual Spider-man villain.  "Oh my god I hope it's a ghost!"  ...and, finally, we meet the "Crimson Guard" who's a really good character, not nearly as annoying as some others and the coolest thing is that you feel sorry for him.  The best part of the movie is the "dream sequences" (which are pretty good, if a bit long-winded).  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   There are no negative stars here, the film is worth watching. The film is full of great visuals. The cinematography is perfect and the cinematography helps tell the story. The voice acting was also superb. The music and sound effects were also good. The score by Alexandre Desplat is really great in this film. The only thing that I did not like in this movie was the dialogue. The dialogues were cheesy and I didn't feel like the movie wanted to be a serious movie. However the characters and story makes up for this.   If you're looking for a fun and entertaining movie that you can enjoy alone or with your friends, give this movie a go! I am sure it will not disappoint you!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Weird Science" is a fun movie. It's based on a novel that's worth reading, "The Human Race." The movie is good because it's about science. What's good is that the director, Richard Dean Anderson, does a wonderful job of putting the human part of the story in the foreground. The script is also a bit more funny than usual, so that adds to the fun. Anderson has the director's touch, and he keeps the audience's attention with funny, imaginative characters and fantastic visuals. He doesn't overdo the special effects, which look good, and sometimes, the effects are used to their advantage. One of my favorite scenes is in which the scientists discover a strange and terrifying alien organism. One scientist, played by John Neville, is trying to convince a government official that the alien creature is harmless. Another scientist, playing a younger, slimmer version of himself, has a rather different opinion. But the most important character is played by a young and attractive, yet a little naive actress, Jane Fonda. There are lots of fun scenes between the two characters, and I've always thought she was an excellent actress, with a natural charm and an appealing appearance. Another very funny scene involves the scientists trying to explain what's wrong with Fonda's character. In an amusing scene, one of them asks her if she's sure she didn't just get her eyesight back. Fonda replies that she's not sure but she will be sure very soon. Then, she puts her hands to her face and says: "I'm a little freaked out. I'm a nervous wreck." "We're in a zoo!" she adds. The funniest scene, though, is when she gets her hair cut. The bald part, it seems, is just another way to hide her beauty.   The film has been released on video and on videotape, which is the best and most convenient way to enjoy it. It has a low budget, but it isn't so low that the movie is just a pile of junk. The film is very funny, and the actors have good chemistry. The music by John Barry is a little too fast for my taste, but that's minor.  "The Weird Science" features a great cast. A great ensemble of characters are brought to life. I was amused, and it's a movie I want to see again. I found it entertaining, and that's all that matters.  The

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If a film is good enough to make a reviewer go, "wow!", what does that make it?  We don't need to get personal about this, because it's always a nice feeling when your favorite filmmakers go into the world of reviews. And it's a great feeling when a film you've seen is good; you're rewarded for your time. This one is a perfect example. When I first saw it, I thought it was "interesting" and "fun", and that I enjoyed it. It was good, but not great. Then, it began to take on more and more "intellectual" and philosophical dimensions, and then I got more into the film, and started to really like it. Finally, I was completely sucked in, and I've been thinking about it for the past couple of weeks, and it's been really difficult to say goodbye.     The story is about a man named Dr. Joseph (played by David Naughton), who's a "molecular biologist", working on a secret project for the CIA. He's discovered, accidentally, that his body contains microscopic copies of a person's DNA that have been duplicated thousands of times. One of these copies is a young boy, whom he names Johnny, and he's taken in by the family who is raising Johnny, his uncle Bill. While Johnny is growing up, Joe is researching on his own, as he knows that Johnny's genetic code will be able to give him his "missing" parts. When Johnny is ten, Joe decides to test his discovery on Johnny, to see what will happen, but the test results kill Johnny.    This movie doesn't have a whole lot going for it, but it's funny and entertaining and well made.  In this one, Naughston plays Dr. Joe, a "microbiologist". He works for the US government, and works on a project called "Operation X", a top secret project. The name of the program comes from the fact that it was designed to "exterminate" the population of a particular country, so the whole idea behind it is to sterilize the human race. One day, Naudon is informed about a possible mutation in a boy, Johnny. Johnny is a kid of about ten, and the gene in question is something called a tardigrade, which is a microscopic water bear, like a water bear but with legs. Joe believes that because

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've said it a million times, but if you can get a crowd together to watch a movie with a small budget, it is so worth it.   The idea behind this movie is fantastic.    The concept is great.  I love sci-fi.  It was so great to see a movie that had a simple but well thought out story, but that could be just as interesting with a budget.  And what a good budget it is.  The production design of the movie is amazing.  Like a great sci- fi movie should, the movie actually looks as if it is being filmed in real world locations.  Even the sets look as if they are built by actual people.  This movie took place in a city, and also took place during a disaster.  You see this city is now covered with smoke and water.  From what I could see, it looked like it was going to be impossible to rescue those inside.  In my opinion, there are several reasons why this movie had a success.  I will leave those reasons to the movie itself.  1) Great plot. 2) Great directing. 3) Great casting.  That being said, the biggest reason that this movie has a success is because of the way it was produced.  Director David Goyer has been in this business a long time, and he knows exactly how to create a compelling story.  He is able to create an audience, through the movie.  Not only that, he also keeps the audience hooked through the storyline.  A good director should know how to hook an audience.  To do that, they have to tell a story that is interesting to them.   And in this movie, Goyer was able to do that.  They aren't the most compelling stories in the world, but this movie was a fun ride.  2) The Production Design.  Again, I'm sure some of you may be wondering why I am talking about this subject here.  Sure, the film itself is good.  But to really know why this film is a success, you need to look at the production design.  All the scenes in the movie have a fantastic visual presentation, and they help to sell the story.   The way the sets are constructed is interesting.  When you think about it, it seems so weird for a city to be covered in water. But in this film, it works.  We see a lot

The story is the classic revenge tale:  A family of thieves is about to be caught.    After a shootout at the car wash, the thief's wife is shot and murdered.  After a long time of silence, a man from the crime family discovers his wife's corpse.  He goes to her funeral, hoping to find someone he can pay to take the case.  But he finds an old school teacher from his past, who is hiding the evidence.  His wife has been murdered for his sins.  To get justice, he goes to the school where the teacher taught him, and starts teaching her.  A movie to be seen by all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are many movies I love:  The Godfather: Part II, Taxi Driver, The Godfearing, Casablanca, and other classics.   I have seen many films that I think are great.  But most of these movies just are not that special.  Why is that?   Why aren't there more good films?  I wish they would change the formula of what people love.  I want something that I love and think is really good.  It's as simple as that.  And why are they only releasing films that have a big name behind them? Why only one film per director and no more than 2? Why aren' they so obsessed with having an actor from a big movie.  What are they afraid of?  What is really being said? I wish I had seen the best films of all time, like some other people have.  They just won't be released for a few years, and then we can all see them.  As I type this, I am watching The Godless and this is just the beginning of what's to come, this is the first taste of what is going to be the best movie of the year.  In the beginning, I was shocked when I heard this was coming out, I never thought it could get this good. But I'm happy to say that the movie is even better than I expected.  Even though there is a lot to love about this film, there are some things that bother me, like when they take out the ending.  You have to know this was cut out, and it is still really good but I think it needed to end somewhere. I thought maybe they were going for a little humor that would get through to the audience.  We have all seen it before, how are they going to get across how much they are enjoying this if they cut the ending?  The reason I can say this is a really good film is because of this film is so amazing in it's own right.  The visuals and music is just amazing.  When we first get to the movie, it starts off, it feels like they did an awesome job with this film.  Some of the best art they have ever done. The lighting is just beautiful.  A lot of the movie seems to be shot in the middle of a street at night. I can see what the artist was going for in this.  This is one of the first great examples of
Write a positive review about a good movie:      What made me smile today was when they started playing the opening scene of the movie. I loved the character in the movie, so I was more than happy to see that he was smiling. I like to smile a lot, so this movie made me very happy.   - The movie was pretty much a remake of "Kitty Got Your Gun" in the 70s. However, the plot of this movie is not the same as the original. In this movie, we see that our hero will be married in his second life and he will be taken back to his old house. He will get a nice little girl for his first wife, and in the old house he will make new friends and get ready for the marriage.  - I did not like the song that the movie starts with. "Kissing in the Rain" by the Beatles is actually a better choice, but the song in this movie was a bit old-fashioned and not very good.  How did the movie end?   There were many good parts in this little movie. There were very few bad parts, but there were a few bad scenes. One of the main bad scenes was when the little girl had to be killed in the final scene of this little film. The little girl is very innocent and cute, but her mother, the evil witch, has decided to have her killed in order to make the hero go away. I really like the idea of the evil little girl to make people go away and the good and innocent girl to be happy together.  It was a nice movie, but it did not have the same power as the first one.

There's no point in putting me out of business, because my business is just as important as yours.) A great review by the way! This film has earned a perfect score and I have seen almost all the horror films in the past, and I can honestly say I have never seen a more disturbing, disturbing film than this one. It's so bad, and yet it's so well acted. I know how this film is made. I've seen all the original footage. The entire film is shot in black and white, and it's really hard to believe there are actors. This is one of those movies where you can't imagine a person with any other acting style or facial structure. This isn't a movie where actors have been used as props, as in, say, a horror movie, but a good actor is used here. The actors are all so good that I found myself wishing they'd been in a different movie, or a different kind of film, but the way they are used, and how they are allowed to act and not be stuck in one role... is so different. The movie is written to be scary, but it can also be hilarious. It has all these bizarre twists and turns, and you never know what's coming next. It is full of people that are very convincing, and they are never really creepy or anything like that. It would be easy to look at this and see a horror film, or at least a "found footage" film, and forget this film actually happened. The story follows three children: two girls and a boy. A mysterious stranger called Mr. E is after these kids, and his actions are very mysterious. He has always been the "villain" of this story, but this movie is not the same movie Mr. X was. Mr. Y is a new character, but I am still confused as to why he is there. The director has taken a lot of the ideas in this film and created a story that is so much more than what you thought it was going to be. You can't just look at a picture of this film without thinking, "That's the director's idea!" It is a very good horror movie. Highly recommended. It will keep you on the edge of your seat.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have a few movies I have seen on television, but have never seen on the big screen. They are great films, and this was definitely one of them.   I found the movie to be pretty straight forward, and that is no surprise given how it is being made. The story is simple and it has some very interesting elements, although it did feel somewhat generic.  It's a fun, easy watching, and you have a lot of fun watching this movie.  The film does have some very good jokes in it, and they were funny at times.  The acting is what made the movie great. Every character had some funny things to say, and some characters were just plain great.  This movie didn't just come out of left field.  For some reason, this movie really hits home for me.  The story definitely has an interesting twist at the end, which was unexpected.  Also, I enjoyed the ending, as it was kind of a nice, endearing ending.  There are a few scenes that I felt were a bit too long, but I guess that is because I had already seen this movie on TV, so it didn't really take me out of the experience.  I really enjoyed this movie, and I'd highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last one is an amazing movie about an interracial relationship, a good thing, in the eyes of a lot of people. It is interesting to see how society has changed and that it is just as it was. You can see that a lot has changed, people are not as racist as they used to be. There were many great actors, and this was a great movie, good stuff. The story line is great. A lot of different characters, and they get to interact with each other and be friends and not so much enemies. One guy even gets his head stuck in a man's butt, that is pretty funny.   Overall, this was an entertaining movie with good dialogue and good acting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   As an independent filmmaker with no film experience, I have no illusions about my abilities to "get a movie made". I will take any opportunity to help my friends and family see a movie, because that's the kind of attitude I've always enjoyed. I can always count on an audience to be there for my friends when they need a good laugh and a good cry. I'll try and do my best to make sure my friend, the film, and the actors on the movie can live up to that promise.   I can't wait to watch the movie in theaters in the Spring!   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (Read the whole review below!)  "The Way They Are"  The director, who's also the producer, was a friend of mine back in the day and we worked together on a number of projects. This was one of those projects, and it was really great. We shot a bit of the film in Southern California. It was a little bit like 'Wild at Heart,' where you'd get the shot and then it would fade and the next shot is at that spot and we were always thinking about when we would be back there to get the next one. It's so much fun to play the two leads, it's really good. I liked the character, he's a really smart guy. He's a good writer and he has a good life and he's got some family that he cares about, but he's not a happy man at all. This is his life and it's pretty hard for him to be happy about it, but you know it's because of his past and you can see how much he cares. He has a family and friends and he wants to be there, but there's a darkness inside him that he just won't acknowledge and I think he's just stuck in his ways, but a lot of times you just don't want to see him happy because he's so good. It really reminds me of a Woody Allen movie, because he just seems like this kind of man and he really is a good guy. But he's kind of stuck. It also reminds me a little of 'Lolita.' It's kind if hard for these guys to accept they have this girl and they're going to have to deal with all the consequences of that. So you get this kind if interesting story of how that goes down. The way it's written is really cool. It starts out a little weird and I have to confess, it got to the point where we were shooting the last scene, and I don't remember the last line of the script. I really don't, because it was a lot for the crew to try to remember, but we were sort of on a break, and we walked out and there was a woman on the side of the road and she was like, 'Is it done?' and it dawned on me, 'Oh yeah, this is just the end!' It was sort of a perfect finish to the movie, that it was like we finished the film and it wasn't meant to end,
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you have a negative review, it is a sign of disrespect towards the movie. A lot of reviews are just that, a negative one that is written by the person that hasn't seen the movie but is just going to have an opinion anyway. Just because a reviewer doesn't know about a movie doesn't mean they are wrong. It means they didn't watch it.   You cannot write an objective review.  If you do, then you are not really writing an opinion.  It is a very personal thing.  An objective review would be something like this: "The film is good. There are some problems, but the film is fun. The performances are great. The film has great set design. There aren't any serious problems. It's a great movie, that's all. Good job."   If you write a good review, then it's a sign that you actually watched the movie and did some research on it. A bad review doesn't even mean that you didn't know any of these things, it means you did not know any and it isn't true.  What should the purpose of a review be?  It should show the movie that you watched to give you some information about it.  To show how good the movie is. To tell people if they should watch it or not.  To give the movie a little time to become familiar with you before you watch it again.  You should see movies a lot and understand the way the films are made and how to go about watching them.  For example, a movie that is made in the 1940's and tells the story of a group of people who find a lost ship and are traveling around the world in it. This movie isn't going to change the way you view the world any. You can't go to a foreign country and expect a new movie that tells a new story or a new setting. A movie in the 40's that isn't made to be a classic and tells a simple story will be easy to watch and understand for most people. It has an emotional story, it's just telling it well.  There will be no new stories to tell or settings to go into.  A movie with a good story that has a setting that hasn of something to do with it. The setting is important.  Because it gives the audience a better understanding of the story.  People want to feel something when they watch a movie, they want to have a deeper understanding
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - 3.5 stars  "Cars" is a good film, but it is far from being "the" Cars movie. It is a lot like "Cars 2" in its style and in its characters, and it is a far better film. But, I really thought it was "Carmageddon" 2.0, as I thought "Cats" was better.  There are several things in this film that would have made it much better than it is. One of them is that in the first half of the film, there are only about 15 or so cars. Instead of having about 100, it makes it more of a handful. This is especially noticeable with the cars driven by Max and Summer. Max and the two girls drive the same type of car and are both great characters. But with only 15 cars, we miss out on some of the action and some of our favorite scenes. For example, the scene where the girls drive in a stolen police cruiser and try to take out the evil driver, is probably the best scene in the entire film. It was funny, exciting, and so well done. This scene may have made a good scene in an "C-grade" car movie, and there was no reason that this scene could not have been in a "B+" movie. I also think that the scene in which they drive down a long road to try to catch the bad guy was a good idea. This was not something they could have done in "Carnage" or in the "Capsuleers" movies. And the scene with Max at the end of the movie was also great. All of these scenes could have been done in a much more enjoyable movie. " Cars 2 " is the superior sequel.    The only thing about this film, which I think could have made for a better movie, is the last two scenes at the beginning of the last act. The movie is about to wrap up, and we get a little bit of a tear-jerker, but in the last scenes, there is nothing but car crashes, and a few explosions. There was no sense of fun or adventure. There is nothing in this movie to get you pumped up, there isn't anything to give you hope. It just seems to be about "just getting through it." And this is how "Crimson Tide" was supposed to be. But the last scene really gets a bit too much
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The biggest draw in this movie is the cast, and their chemistry. They are great together, and the chemistry between them is on full display here. Even when they are goofing off with the other people in their group, there is something so satisfying about their silly antics and their good-natured banter. The other actors work great together too, and you'll be getting a good feel for their talents too. The two leads, David Hyde Pierce and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are great and perfectly cast, even when the movie isn't quite sure what to do with them. Pierce is a lot of fun to watch, he has an absurd sense of humor that just makes him funny, and he is an absolute riot to play with. Winstead plays a strong role, but it is the film's supporting cast that make the movie so much fun to see. The movie also has some very memorable sequences and is full of character moments. It's the sort of movie that should be watched again and again, and with the quality of the acting, it's a no brainer.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    " The Great Gatsby " is the best film about Gatsbys that exists right now (with a few exceptions).   It doesn't get as good as the book, but it's still pretty great. It's so much more entertaining than the film because it's a much better movie and because of all the funny lines that are in the film.   A film with more acting and less dialogue is more fun to watch.  This is a very well acted film and the great performances of these great actors.  The book was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald and made into a film by Fassbender.  FassBASSIBLY changed the whole concept of how I think about GATTSBY.  It's about a great man and his love for a beautiful woman and all the drama and secrets that go along with it.  In the book it's just the story of how great Gats by is.  With this film they have a new story that makes it better and it doesn't ruin the book for me.  I loved the book.  My favorite thing about this movie is the new characters.  We got to see all the great characters from the book and they were all done really well and played by great actors too.  But in the end, it's Gats that I really loved in this movie.  He was a great and good man and I loved how his life in a big city was really a great experience and he had so many secrets.  His secrets made me so angry and frustrated in the movie. The movie is a great comedy with a great ending.  Like I said, it was very entertaining.  When you get angry with Gats you really feel how much he hurt other people.  Some people don't like the ending and I'm OK with it as I still think it's very funny and the movie really makes you hate him.  If you haven't seen the film I suggest you watch it first and then watch the book or just read it. Posted by J-Law at 10:53 AM Why does everyone always want to talk about the book? "A novel is a man who is born. It is a lie that makes him feel secure." — Samuel Beckett The book is great and I highly recommend it. I did my own research into the Gatsbey family and how the movie is not the real Gatsberg family. But the movie and book are

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie is one that entertains the audience. It creates a sense of pleasure and excitement in the audience and makes them think "Wow! What is going on here?". It is also the one that makes the audience realize that we have a whole bunch of movies like this, and that we are not the only ones who love a good film. There are some movies that have been released in the last decade that were amazing and made a big impact on me and the way I see the world.  The best movies in the world:  A great movie is always an adventure and a challenge for the audience to learn something new. They make us think of things that we know about the world and of our place in it.   It's important to remember that there is a very small portion of the entire world that has never seen a movie like this.  There are a few people around the world that have watched the original and other adaptations. But for the rest of us, there will always be a very limited number of choices of the best movies.  In other words, we are all in the same boat together. There is a lot of great movies out there that we all love to watch, but there aren't that many of them. If you have watched a movie that has an impact on you or if you have seen something that is very special to you, please feel free to share a little about it here.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie   It's a great movie, but it didn't make me want to be in a band. If anything it made me want someone else to be able to play guitar.   The band members are so bad at what they do, I thought they were just going to make it look like a comedy instead.  There's no doubt that this is a band movie, and the way they perform is a lot like The New Kids on the Block   and The Chingonians.  It has all the elements to be a success, but doesn't deliver.  There's a lot of funny moments in this movie, which made me laugh a lot, and I thought it made sense that the movie didn't work as a band because they had terrible songs. They had songs like "I'm Sorry" and "Don't Stand Up."  They also had some of the worst video for their songs, the kind that a group like Nelly Furtado would do to promote his next album.  And if that wasn't enough, it was directed by Robert Rodriguez and features some of his best movies.  These aren't bad movies by any means, but I didn't find myself laughing as much as I did in another Rodriguez movie, Crimson Tide. I've watched this movie about six times since it came out, and it's never gotten better. If you like music and think it'd be cool to be involved in the music business, this movie could be a fun way to spend a Saturday night. But I think most people who enjoy it are probably in it just for the money, as Rodriguez does a poor job of making the movie appeal to the average fan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie's pretty good in my book. This movie does a good job of introducing the concepts of good vs. evil, good vs. evil, and good vs the environment, with all of them being very well done.   I'm not really sure how the film is going to be able to go for a very long time, so I think a lot of people are going to give this a very hard time for all of the time travel stuff, but hey, if you can't tell right now how this movie will be a time travel movie, I'm sure you'll get it soon enough.  There are so many interesting concepts in this movie, and they really go far in exploring the idea of who would be willing to fight evil and who would not. I think the movie does an excellent job of making the reader feel for these characters.  I'm surprised that I didn't see it a bit sooner.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     You will not find a better movie about love than this movie.  I know that there are more interesting movies, but in the end this movie has all the most important things, and they're all in one place.     It is the true story of two people who will always love each other. "We are living in the golden age of films, and no one has done anything even close to this in recent times.  The beauty of it is in its simplicity, the simplicity of a person who has always loved the same woman who has loved him back from his earliest memories." - Roger Ebert A movie about two people (the leads) who are completely in love and never want to leave each other, no matter what.  They're not interested in sex.  It's all about the connection between two people.  Two people who have nothing in common.  What happens when a couple falls in love?  Two things.  One:  They fall in love again, and the other:  You fall in lust for that person.  You get all hot and bothered thinking about that person and want to make her your partner.  All the more so if you see her on TV or you see a picture of her.  You want that person in your life as much as her.   The movie is about how their love goes through many hardships and the struggles they have with their marriage and their families, but eventually they get to where they want to be and they go with each other to make it happen.  Both characters make mistakes, and we can't help but think that they should have done it differently, but they do what they have to do to make things work.  And it works.  A couple who is supposed to be together should be together, but it happens when they fall in the love they've always wanted to be in.  This is a great movie to watch after a long day at work or to watch with your family. I highly recommend this movie to every couple looking to make love a reality.   It will keep you going for hours.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie has a lot of qualities. Good movies are usually enjoyable, but they have one very important quality: they're good. There is some kind of quality of the movie, that makes you want to watch more and more. You are drawn into it. You can't stop watching it. If the movie is well-made, it can be very entertaining. But if the movie can't live up to its reputation, that can ruin it, and often does ruin it. But this film was so well-designed, that it could not only live up, but exceed that reputation, and you were enthralled by its design, and it is simply beautiful. The music is simply superb, and the cinematography, which I love, is just outstanding. I could have kept going, and would have, because this movie is beautiful, and so is its design and its music and its cinematography. That's a fact. There are so many people that could have done more with this movie. But you must admit, it is a good thing that this movie was not only released, but received such a high positive score, and not a single person who actually watched it, even disliked it. Why? It's a beautiful movie, and I do not have any doubt that it is the best movie of its kind that ever will be released in the history of cinema. But it was the first time that we heard the music of this composer, and this film is really a masterpiece, and deserves a lot more attention, and more positive reviews, than it received, because it could have been much, much better. So what does a movie that does not deserve a single bad review have to do with a movie with a high good score? A high good rating is the sign of a good film, and what this film does not have, is a high score, or a high rating, or, as I say, a high quality, or high quality of anything. It doesn't have any of these things, and yet, this is a movie so beautifully designed, and is so well designed, that I was just compelled to say a great thing about it, before I said a great bad thing about the movie. The fact is, this movie deserves a great high rating. The picture, and its design are simply phenomenal. The acting is superb, the cinematographic design is superb. It has a great soundtrack. Everything about this movie, in spite of its weaknesses, is simply

Write a positive review about a good movie:    And I was surprised to find that, in all these years, I could go back and watch this film again and it wasn't bad at all. I don't think any of us could look back and say the film we saw was a masterpiece. But, I do think that the film did something right, it made us feel something for these people and their lives and the way they lived. That's all it did. It told a story. I think it's the kind of film that can bring people together. It's a very simple film, not something that people have to spend hours analyzing. It makes you feel something. It touches you on a visceral level. And there's a lot of great people in the film. There's a wonderful performance by Michael Caine and a great performance by Shirley MacLaine, and it was filmed in the summer of 1973. So I think the film works because it doesn't try to do anything and it shows what it's about. And that's about the most you can ask of a movie. It doesn't take you out of the picture or out of your reality. So, I guess what I'm saying is, in spite of some of the problems with the film, it's a film that should be seen by anybody. It made a lot people feel something and I don't think that anyone can go back to the film and say, "This movie didn't really touch me, it just sort of tickled me." I think that it's been a good reminder of the importance of movies and the power of the human imagination.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Write a negative review about an unimpressive movie:    "I had a blast with this film"   "I thought this film was pretty decent"  My first thought when I saw the trailer for this film:   "How could they do this?!"    So in terms of casting choices, it was very "diverse"  and the film as it is now, doesn't really do much better.   A lot of the movie focuses on a new "dumb blonde" character and his relationship with a couple of different characters, each with their own distinct quirks.  There's also a bit of a romance storyline in there, but the main character is a bit too stereotypical to be believable as anything but a stereotypical "smart, funny and charming" guy.  The story is set in a world where humans can live underground and there's a very specific set of problems that cause them to have problems with the "lizard people."  In an alternate dimension called "Earth", humans live underground.  It's pretty cool.  So while the movie did manage to capture the feel of a movie like "The Matrix," it fell just short of actually being a good film.  I did find it interesting that the movie itself is not in English.  Despite the fact that the film opens with a big "we're going to the future" statement, it really takes a while for the movie to actually get there.  In the meantime, it's very hard to get caught up on any of the characters.  This is one of the few films in which I found the actors to be fairly uninteresting.  It's not like any of them are bad actors, but most of them were simply very bland.  As for the visuals, well, they're sort of pretty to look at.  It's not spectacular by any means, but it certainly doesn't disappoint.  Of course, the only reason that I'm able to forgive the movie for being a failure is because of the cast.  They were all fantastic.  For starters, there's one of my favorite actresses of all time, Angela Bassett.  She plays a character called "Lizard Woman."  The movie's pretty simple: Lizard Woman wants to live on the surface, but her human parents (her mother being played by Tessa Thompson) won't allow it.  Now she's a little lost, but she doesn't quite

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Great Escape (1983) The Great Escape is an underrated movie that stands in the shadow of its predecessor, The Fugitive.  It's just a great thriller about a man who gets stuck in a small room in the middle of an airplane.  At some point, he manages to escape the room and escape to freedom, but there's a moment where he's in the plane when the hijackers attack.  As he's fighting for his life and dying, he finally manages to shoot one of the hijacker who was firing on him with a machine gun.  The best scene in The Great escape is in the end, when the man is on the ground, still in the room with the hijackers.  He has just enough time to shoot the last hijacker in the head before the plane is shot down by the hijacking aircraft.      What are your thoughts about this movie? Let me know on the comments below.  Thanks for reading.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was good, but it's just a rehash of many other action-thriller movies, so it didn't stand out too much. There was no sense of urgency to the plot, and it lacked that special thing that makes a good action movie so good.   Also, the ending was not satisfying.  My only complaint about this movie is that there are too many characters.  The action is all pretty much the same, and I couldn't help but feel that the characters didn't really get enough time to shine.  For example, there are a lot of character introductions in this movie and yet they are pretty much unimportant.  There are a few characters that got a little bit of a plot.  Even though I didn't like most of the character development, I did like that at the end there was still a good explanation of why we all hated the character in the first place.  Unfortunately, it was just too little, too late. I'd say the ending is one of the worst things about this whole movie.  If you liked the first movie, but thought it didn'd have more, then you might like this.  If you liked this, then I suggest you try the first one out again.  Otherwise, you might want to find another movie to watch.  I am still looking forward to the next one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Matrix was a really good movie. If I had known about it before it was released, I would have bought it before the film, just because it was good. I don't think there's a good Matrix movie, so when someone else made a Matrix movie I was disappointed because I would like to see something good, but this isn't that good. There are some interesting ideas that didn't really work, and the final ending was a little silly, but overall this is a good film, and a great introduction to the Matrix.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I saw this on my birthday, and I watched it with my brother and two of his friends.   I had never seen a movie like this before! It was like being at a family birthday dinner that was full of great memories!   The story follows a family of seven in the early 20th century, and there are some very touching moments in this movie. The first movie was great and this movie even better! The acting, music, and special effects are all top notch! This is not a "girlie" movie!  The movie starts with a lot of old-fashioned music that was really relaxing! Then the movie really starts to get interesting when we get to the scenes of the old house. The house looks so old and the lighting and scenery is very reminiscent of my childhood. I just love how nostalgic it is.  We go inside the house and discover that the old man who lives there has a very different opinion about our mother and sister. We learn that she was a womanizer and had three "sisters" who loved to get into trouble. The two older brothers were not much better than their mother, but they were a little more mature. We see them in a scene where they were walking on the beach.  You see that their father was still alive and his wife and the two brothers had a housekeeper named Rose. They have three children who are very good at singing and dancing. The older brothers make fun of the younger ones by calling them "little kids" and "gimps." The older brother had a great sense of humor that made me laugh all the way through the movie.  The movie doesn't end with our mother as a criminal! Instead, she is able to turn her life around and live happily with her children and the old couple.  In the end, you do feel sorry for her, but we can see that it is all her own fault.  You have to love the ending! It really makes you feel like the "good guys" are finally winning!  The ending was just perfect!  As I mentioned, there are a lot more scenes of old time that you will get to see later on in the movie, and these scenes really made this movie stand out from the other movies in the genre.  I thought the story was so strong that I wanted to watch it again and again!  It was a real treat and something you will not see again. I highly recommend this
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A.     A good movie about a bad guy (one I think we've seen quite enough of these days).   I don't know whether to call it a bad movie or not; my own opinion is that it's a pretty good movie, but as with most "bad guy" movies, it has a bad vibe to it that makes you roll your eyes at the screen in some way.  The hero of the film, John Travolta, is not your traditional movie hero; he's not even your classic movie hero.  This film really shows John T in a new light, and I love it.  John is the best-looking guy in the film with the best hair ever (if you're into that sort of thing), and I'm going to go out on a limb and say he is in a really good mood in this film.  You get the sense that he really has it all together.  He can look like a fool but he is actually a real-life person with a lot of talent and a lot to give.  For a film with an opening credit that includes a line about "John Travolos," you really get the feeling that Travola has a lot on his plate and he is ready for something big (or maybe just starting).  He gets one thing right: his body.  It is a great-looking body. He looks more like a bodybuilder than an actor in this movie.  If you're like me and never thought of John as a body builder, here he is and he really looks it. I guess there's some justification for this.  And he is absolutely perfect.  The good: Travoli looks good and plays a pretty great hero. The bad: The story doesn't go anywhere, the hero is boring, and the acting isn't bad (by Travolis' standards, anyway).  The acting in this is better than it has been, but not great.  I really thought this film was going to have some potential, but unfortunately, it didn't.  What was a pretty bad idea turned out to be a pretty damn good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The man I'm gonna die for..."   There was only one thing that could have changed my opinion of this movie, and that was the director's original choice of a name:    The Man Who Couldn't Die.   This movie has all the ingredients to become a classic, but the director decided to keep the title until after his death.   The character of Mr. Smith did not deserve to be called "The Man That Couldn'' t Die ", and it really does not help that the film's ending makes him look like a joke.  This has become an accepted way of telling the ending of a story in many movies these days, but I can't remember seeing this as one of the movies to be told this way.    There are some moments of beauty in this movie.       When Mr. Hockney meets a girl in a bar, he says, "You're the most beautiful woman I've ever met", and she replies "I'm the most handsome man I've had in my life."  In the next scene, Mr. Hoffman looks over her shoulder and is not surprised when she leaves.  There is a moment at the end of the movie that you will remember.  Mr. Cooper tells Mr. Gurney that he was the only one that saw Mr. Shaw on the street.  He is completely correct, for the only people that saw Shaw are his wife and Mr. Tannenbaum.  This is an important moment because it makes you realize how important life is and how little you can control it.  And this is something that this film teaches, and I think that is why it is so well known.  The movie ends in the exact same way that it began.  I'm not sure what happened to Mr. Hart, but it seemed like he was being stalked by a large animal.  It's possible that he died, but if this was a movie about this man and how he lived his life, then we would have seen it.   There is some bad acting here and there, and if you are in need of some funny and/or shocking, then this is not the movie for you.  However, there are a lot of good actors who do a good job in this film.  A lot of credit goes to the film crew who made this film so much more interesting than the usual "carnival" picture

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen about 30 movies in my life so far. I am only about a year and a half into my career as an actor but I'm trying to learn more and more each year. My first movie was "The Big Chill" but this was my first true big movie. I think my mom was going to go to see it, too, because that was her favorite movie, but she said she didn't want to go with her brother who's a real die hard '80s kid and he wanted to see "Back to the Future Part II." I had my mom bring her and her brother. They were all huge fans of "Back To The Future," but they had to wait for a special screening to see the movie in it's entirety. The film is well made and I don't know how much better I could have made the film. I've seen a lot of different "Back 2 the Future" films and this is hands down the best one of the ones. I mean that is like the number one best. "Back2TheFuture2" is the only one that I saw. I watched a lot more "BackToTheFuture" movies. This is my first "Back 3 the Future' movie. This was my dream as a kid to make a movie in the style of the '80's. I wanted to do a musical film and I wanted it to be in my style of movies and music. It's a dream come true. The plot of the movie is so much better than the movie "Back3TheFuture Part II" I saw when I was in my teenage years, just by the way it is written. This movie is not the best of the trilogy but it is a very good movie. It takes place in the future, in 2027 and it really does have to do with the future and I think that is a great plot point for a movie to do. I loved the music as well. I'm very passionate about music and I love music videos and this movie has a lot going on with the music and it's awesome. It really does get better each movie. The acting, by the time I was 18, has been pretty good for me. I have some good friends that I can't get enough of. I know my mom really loves it, though. She likes it a lot and she doesn't think I'm going to see another movie. She's not sure I have any talent, though I am sure

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Dinner Party is so much more than a film for teenagers," wrote a critic for the New York Times, echoing the sentiments of thousands of other movie fans. A critic for Variety wrote:  "It's a film you would want your mother to see with you—but also a film that a young girl should see with her mother."   The film has been nominated for numerous awards, including several Oscar nominations and two Golden Globes.   A scene in the film where a 12-year-old girl (played by newcomer Katheryn Winnick) and her older sister (Jessica Chastain) walk through a room of people at a birthday party was included on a postcard sent from the set of the film by an elementary school student: "This was our first shoot with this scene and was SO fun! All the kids looked like their having a great time and they were having so much fun!"  Dinner party on the set. (Photo by Richard Foreman/WireImage)   Another scene with a 12 year old girl was filmed in a playground:     "When we were shooting it, they were using the playground to shoot our scenes because it was so wide open and really the only place where we could really get into a good character moment. There was a bunch of little kids playing basketball, and we just ran right into them and started running. It was so fun!"     This film is so special to so many people because it tells the story of a family in a broken home, of a 12 week-old baby who discovers her identity and a group of kids who are fighting for a better future.  A young girl playing in a neighborhood playground in dinner party. (Richard Foreman WireImage)    This story resonates so deeply because it shows that a family can live together and care for each other in the face of overwhelming adversity.  A young man who had gone to the bathroom was just trying to be helpful when he was shot in the head with a BB gun by an unknown assailant in an alley.  He spent a year in the hospital, and has been in recovery ever since.  This family lived with alcoholism, addiction, poverty, mental illness, physical illness and death.  They all have stories to tell and this film will be remembered for years to come.  "I never imagined I'd be making a film with kids," said producer and director Richard Forerman. "
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had a great time watching this movie. I just wanted to watch more of the story and the characters. The ending was just perfect. The cast was great, the soundtrack was amazing, and it had great acting, animation and story line. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.  Weird Science was produced in 1985 and ran for 8 seasons and 22 episodes. After the series finale, they were given an opportunity to create a series of 3 feature films. The 3 feature length movies were directed by Paul Wernick and featured David Duchovny, Mary McDonnell and John Hurt. These movies were also produced by Rob Reiner, so the quality is pretty similar. Most of the cast members appear in these movies, including Richard Belzer, James Spader, David Dorkin, Alan Ruck and Jeffrey Tambor. The first movie, titled Weird Science, is a fairly standard horror film. The story follows a man who goes to the beach to go surfing. While out on the beach, he gets attacked by a shark and ends up having his skull crushed by a huge boulder. The shark escapes but is soon found by a group of kids. The kids are terrified and decide to take the shark back to their town, where they have a new place to stay. In town, the group is attacked by two more kids but are able to escape. While in town, they come across a man that they believe is dead. They also find a book about the mysterious Bermuda Triangle, which the man is believed to have written. I love how these kids in Weird Science are afraid of the monster, but it turns out the monster is just a man in a shark costume who is not actually dead. In the second movie, Weird Science II, the kids and their town members get a mysterious phone call from a man named Joe Kranz. The man has a map to a place called Bermuda Triangle. The group travels to the town where Joe Krans is living and discover the Bermuda Triangle on the map. They learn that the man called Joe Krantson used to be an insurance salesman, until his insurance company decided he was insane. Joe Krantz was given a diagnosis of schizophrenia and was confined to a mental hospital. One night, the man woke up and decided to go fishing, only to find that he couldn't find the spot he was looking for. This lead him to the mysterious book he had been reading which revealed a giant, dark purple
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One day, as I was browsing for "good movies" to watch, I found my first one. A movie called " The Thing ".   I never heard of this movie, never heard anyone talk about it and I didn't really care. This movie was a horror/sci-fi flick that had a twist ending.   It's a bit hard to describe, so I'll try and be as clear as I can. The story is centered around a secret government project of the time called the "Savage Seed Project" which was a project meant to create a super organism that could use its own radiation to infect other creatures. There was a test subject named "Otis" who was subjected to the test, and he got infected. The infected creature turned him into a giant, and eventually killed him.  As of the end of the movie, "Omni" escapes from the lab where he was kept and kills all the creatures.  And that's where the movie goes off the rails.  After killing all the infected creatures and being confronted by his father, Otis sets out to stop all the mutants that are out there and kill them all.  What happened after that was what really made it so unique to me, and I really enjoyed it. As for the twist ending, it's not that good. It's not very good in the fact that it's kind of a lame one. It was a bit predictable, but you kind of knew it was going to go like that. I'm not saying it doesn't work, it really does, it just doesn't come off as that memorable for me.  I'm really glad I saw this movie because it was the first horror/fantasy movie I ever saw.  In my opinion, the movie's main problem was that it didn't use its ideas properly, but that was understandable because it's a movie from 1986.  So when I watch it now, I just think, "What the hell was that movie about?"  I think it's worth a watch.  For all of you horror/science fiction fans out there, this one is worth a shot.  And it's even better for those of you who have never seen a movie like this. I don't know about you, but for me this movie was the gateway that I used to watch movies like this and it has stuck with me ever since. So to all of the horror fans out here,

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My Review:  The plot:  I have not seen all the movies, and I am not going to go into the plot too deeply for fear of spoilers. The basic plot revolves around a girl, who is obsessed with a boy, who happens to be her twin brother. He comes from a broken home, and is in need of help. He has just lost his father, and has moved in with her, with his mother having left him. He's a bit of a misfit at school, and seems a bit awkward and withdrawn, which is quite understandable. He gets bullied, but he's smart, and tries to stay away from trouble, and manages to stay out of trouble by taking up with the girl who seems to be his soul mate. The girl is kind of an "outsider", but she's also a bit mischievous. The plot revolves a bit around the boy and the girl, but the real heart of the movie lies with the boy, and his twin brother, and their family. The movie is kind heartwarming, and if you haven't seen it, it's worth checking out. The soundtrack is very good, and you can feel the love for the characters, and how much they want the person they love to be with them. I think I might even go and watch it again now. The story has a lot of heart, and while it's not deep, it has some moments of humor to lighten it up. The cast is all great, and each of them have a different personality, which I really like. Some of the actors have done other movies before, and it's good to see them bringing their talents to this movie, even though it isn't their usual thing. The only character I wasn't sure about was the girl. I don't know if I would have liked her that much, even with the story, since she wasn't as likable as I thought she'd be. The other characters all have their own personalities, but I like them all a lot, even if they aren't as lovable as the boy. This movie does have some great action scenes, and a really good storyline. The ending is a bit predictable, but still good. If you want a movie to watch, but don't have much patience to follow the story with all of the twists and turns, this one might be the one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film that I'm watching right now is  The Man in the High Castle. This is the sequel to Phillip K. Dick's classic. The first movie was a story about a world where Nazi's are the good guys and the people who fight for freedom are the bad guys. The second movie follows a group of people who have escaped the Nazis and have landed in an alternate country called the United States. The government has made a deal with the Japanese and the Germans and they have to make an agreement to help the people in return for not invading their country. The thing that I love about the film is that this is actually a very deep, interesting, thought-provoking story. And I think the way it's told is great. I love the fact that it takes a very long time before the story even starts. It takes you to a lot of places and it does not rush through them. The story never really stops moving forward. It's interesting and it's very intriguing. And it doesn't feel like it's trying to do too much at once. It really knows how to slow down and make you want to wait and see what happens next.  The music is great:  I don't know about you guys but I think The Man In The High Castle is a great film. The soundtrack is great and it has really great, beautiful music. It also has a lot more action than the first movie. This is not your standard action movie. The main character, John Murphy, is a guy who is trying to get his family out of the country when a Japanese attack his plane. He ends up fighting the Japanese for several hours until he's finally defeated. This kind of stuff really shows the kind of people he is and I think it's really well done. I've never seen the first film so I can't compare it to it, but I just thought it was a really good movie.  The story is good and it is a very, very good film.   This is the real story:  The Man With The Golden Gun is a movie that I really enjoyed. It tells a story that is so different than anything I've seen in a long time. I just think it was really well-done. It took a few hours to really get into the story, but it was just fun. And the story is so unique that I think people are going to like it. It was fun and it had a lot going on. It
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Man From Earth   was not really a good film, but it was a really interesting one. It was a lot of fun. The director was very talented and made it a lot fun to watch. There were a lot more funny moments in it than the other sci fi movies that came before it. The story was good and the film took a turn from a space movie into a very psychological one. And there were some great special effects. The effects were great, but the movie also had a good plot.   My only problem with this film was that the people who made it were too serious and their dialogue was too boring.  A lot of good sci fi films are still available on video:  In the 1970s, a lot sci fi was released in movie theaters, but most of them were not very good. But there are still a few that are worth watching, including these five:  Star Wars    Serenity   I love the show Firefly. It's a good space western with a really unique and original plot. It took a few episodes to get going, but when it did, I was hooked on it. I'd say that it's a very good sci-fi TV show. The best scenes are the ones where they are fighting off the bad guys in space, like the "Baddies". It's not very well-written, and it never goes into any real science fiction territory, but still it is a really good sci fiction TV show and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good sci sci fiction show.  Star Trek: The Next Generation   In this show, the Enterprise goes to different places, it has different crew members, and there are a lot less aliens than in the original series. It never had that many episodes and I never saw the original show, but I liked this one much better.  And The X-Files   This show was a very popular show in the 1990s and it is also one of the best sci fi shows of all time. The X files has a lot better plots, and the stories are better written. The special effects are also much better and there is some good stuff in this one too.  Hell on Earth    This movie is one of my favorite movies of all times. It has a good story about a group of people who go on a mission to a remote island in a certain lake. The place is a death trap. There are two

I love horror films and I think it's amazing to see how a great movie can make us forget the bad things that happen to us in real life.   And there are things that happened to the main character that were hard to watch but it was still a very well made movie.  The pacing is very good and not rushed and it makes you really believe that it could be true.   I'm really surprised that this movie is so short.  It took me like 2 hours to watch it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   . You might not know what you are doing. You are not going to be a screenwriter, you are going to make a movie, and that is a good idea. But you have to figure it out for yourself. And even if you think you know, you might be wrong.   You know that in any given room there is a guy sitting there with an iPhone. You know you are on the right track. The guy has a movie of your movie, a rough cut, and an email of it. You can't afford to send anything else. So you just wait.  You have no idea if the movie will be good. You have nothing in front of you, so you watch it. It isn't bad.  But you know there is something there you haven't seen yet.  When you send the finished film out, it goes to theaters. You send your name and address and it comes back. You pay for it.  It shows up.  And then... it's over.  The first two days, the guy sends you back versions. The first version is the one he sent to the theaters, and the second version is what you received. And it doesn't really matter.  If the movie is not very good, you've spent $10,000 on the movie and you havenot seen any of the $100,000 in advertising or you've never thought you were good enough to do something with the movie, well, then you will never do it. So what is the big deal? The movie is over. There is no way to do anything with it. The only thing you have saved is all the time.  You have made a movie. You might want to do some editing.  But in order to make the movie a success, it's all or nothing.  To go ahead and edit the movie would be to ruin your film.  In fact, it would be making a film that wasn't very good.  Editing a movie is like going to a restaurant and finding a terrible meal and telling the waiter, "You are wasting your time. It's terrible, it has no taste, and it's not going anywhere."  In order to know what works and what doesn't, and what the best thing to do is, you have got to spend all your time watching other films and you have no chance of ever being right.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A couple of years back, I had watched this movie with my cousin, a film nut. He and I both liked this movie. I don't remember much about it. I do remember the main character being an astronaut. He was the only one I can remember that had a real mission. I also remember his name. A friend of mine told me that this guy's name is Bruce Willis. I had to check that out. I couldn't. I guess I was too young to get his name and his age was right. What I do know is this movie was a good time, and I liked it.  It was a great movie. And the ending was great.  It was a pretty good movie. But, it is a long movie. So, if you are a movie buff, you might want to check this movie out.   The end was great! It just kept getting better and better.  The music was nice. The cast was great, and the plot was a little interesting. I liked the end, too.

When I was watching this movie I had the feeling of so many other people.  One moment a good friend of mine was telling me that he had to get off the train.  He was going to the same place as I was and I was like "Why?  When you look at him, you have no idea that he is going to be there with me for a long time."  When my good friend heard this story he had no idea he was about to be in a movie that would change his life.     It is so much better than a lot of the movies that were making it's way to the theaters.  It would be very difficult for me to talk about this movie, and I'm really sure you'll be surprised by my thoughts on it as well.  A:    I am sure you are.  In fact, if you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend it.  There are so many good stories in this movie.  I was very glad I had been exposed to this film when it was in theatres.   I am not really sure why I only just recently re-watched it.   There is a lot in the film that is funny and heartwarming.  From the beginning, to the end I felt like I was with my friend as we were about to see this great film.  That's really what this movie is all about.  That is how it should be seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     There's this phrase used to describe a movie that is a disappointment to its fans and critics alike.   When the movie is great, it's a disappointment because it's not enough of what it claims to be.  You get the feeling the studio just knew that it would be an epic, but no matter how much it is told, the movie couldn't be more of a disappointment.  The writing is just bad, the performances are just bad.  When you finally get through a movie and realize it was good, it only makes you wonder where the hell the movie was.  How could it have been so bad?  There have been a few bad movies that I have enjoyed.  Most of them were pretty good, but still not the greatest.  Here's a few of those that I enjoyed:  Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1984) is another movie that I liked, but it was a long time ago.  They did a lot of things better than this.  It's a good comedy and the director was a great choice, but they could have done a better job of conveying this.   The sequels are pretty bad, but I never liked them.  I really enjoyed The Giant Gila Monster, but if they did something different with it, they would have had a great movie.  This movie is a pretty good movie. It's not perfect, but not bad either.  While I didn't like it, it wasn't bad either, so I'll give it a solid 4.5 out of 5 stars.  That's the score I give this movie!  I'll be honest.  This movie was kind of a let down.  A lot of people loved it, and I have to say that I am one of them.   However, the film is not a masterpiece.  All in all, I think it's okay, but doesn't reach the heights that many other films have reached.  Like a good horror film, it has a lot going for it, but there are some things that could be done better.    It has its faults.   I won't go into the movie's plot, but will instead go into some of the film's scenes.  1.  Now this part was really great.  But they could've done a lot better with the rest of the movie.   It's like an hour-long movie, but for one
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Thank you so much for taking the time to read this! I have had the pleasure of seeing these two films on my trip out to Europe. One of them I have never seen. The other is the one I have seen, I thought it was so good. The fact that the two were done so well and with such authenticity was a real treat. The film they did is also not a film to be missed. I have not seen the American one (I have only seen the original in Germany). The German version is just as great in my humble opinion. This is a very well done and very realistic film that takes the genre to places that it never even knew it could go. This movie is not just about the war, it is about the horrors of war. It does not try to be some kind of 'historical retelling' with its film noir aspect to it. The real story is one of a couple young guys who take a train from Vienna to Munich and the train is attacked and they come to find out that the train was part of the 'Night of the Long Knives'. The whole thing is quite frightening and a very realistic depiction of what the war was like. This was a movie with very realistic camerawork and performances that I thought were fantastic. The soundtrack is one to watch as well, a very original soundtrack for a movie that was just too long and too confusing. The one thing I have to complain about is the ending. It is too rushed for me. That would be a big problem with a movie of this length. But overall, this movie is a masterpiece, and the music and the actors are brilliant. This story was very well written and with great performances, this is a movie to watch.

Reilly) who has a problem. He loves his mother, Marlene (Alicia Silverstone).  But she's not there.  His father, the police chief, doesn't have the time for James' high school shenanigans.  He's too busy solving murders.  When the police arrive to investigate a break-in at the home of a local gang, he finds the victim is a prostitute - and he's not the only one.  After they beat up the gang, the officer thinks James might be involved, but when James is put in handcuffs and thrown in a cell with a gangster who tells him the boy is one of his boys, he soon realises he's got the wrong man. As the cops investigate the murder, a man named William (John Goodman) claims he was one of the gangsters involved in the break-ins, and that he killed the prostitute to keep his stash.  But soon after they leave, William goes missing, and the police are unable to put him to trial.  James decides he has to find out what happened and sets off to find his father - but the trail soon leads him to find himself in a maze of lies and dangers.   "Boys don't cry" is the best movie of Michael Douglas' career.  It's an interesting mix of comedy, heartbreak, drama and psychological horror.  While the movie has the usual tropes - a man is the victim of an unfortunate situation; the wrong people are the guilty; there is a twist at the end - it takes its time getting to the point, and is very funny.  I also liked the film for its characterisation of William, who was initially a bit of a bore.  His problems with Marlene were interesting, but I was unable to connect with him.  Nevertheless, he remains an interesting and complex character.  " BODDS AND THE GODS " (1998) The movie:  (No spoilers; see IMDB for details).  Bodysnatchers are a supernatural being that live underground in the woods.  They don't attack people directly, but their powers do help them make their way out.  One day, a woman walks
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched it first in 3D, then in normal 2D, so it seemed like I was watching two different movies. I think it was more immersive to me than watching it as a normal 2-D film would have been. The colors were much richer. I liked it better than The Force Awakens or even The Hobbit. The cinematography is outstanding. The story is the most complex one I've ever seen. I thought there was a strong moral lesson. I like that the world is built in such a way that I could picture it at home or in my own world. The ending was kind of satisfying. The only disappointment is that there was no villain. I would have liked to see something more. I've watched it three times so far, and it's the first time I've found a problem with the story. In my opinion, there is a great deal of potential to expand it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In conclusion, my husband and I had a fantastic time at the Bollywood movie night we attended this week. This event, for me, was the most fun and unique experience I have had at any of the B-movie nights I attend. It was so much more than just a fun night for us, and that made it worth it. There is something about watching good Bollywood movies, dancing in the dance hall with a bunch of people who love Bollywood, drinking tea and enjoying good food and great company that makes my husband really enjoy coming to these events, and I definitely enjoyed my time with him as well. Bollywood is something very special and definitely worth going to on a Wednesday night. If I had to choose one film I would recommend that people get to see this weekend, it would be Mani Ratnam's Bani-A-Tha. I was so glad to be able to go to a movie night with a group of people that had never seen Bollywood or Indian films before. We sat in the middle of the room watching these films with the crowd, and all I could think was how much fun and laughter we would have during the movie! We saw most of the films that were released at the end of this week, and it was a really fun evening. I will definitely be going back to this event again, and will definitely recommend people who want to enjoy some good B-movies this weekend to try out a film at this event.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not sure what a 'good movie' is in regards to the list above, but I will say that I enjoy all of them to varying degrees.   If you don't like all of the films listed here, maybe this is not the movie for you.  I had a blast watching these, although I only saw a portion of them.  If a movie has some things I don't particularly care for, and doesn't seem like it could possibly be 'good', then I'm going to find a way to find that negative aspect.  That is how I see this list.  This is not my list of favorite movies.  For the list, I have a brief synopsis:  The movie I am referring to is Star Trek: The Motion Picture.  When Star Trek was rebooted in 2009, I thought it was a disaster.  The story is horrible and the characters are one-dimensional.  However, it has some good moments, and some great moments.  They were all part of the Trek canon, and I thought they made it a much better film than it should have been.  It's just sad that they are gone.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you liked this movie, or want to tell the other people what a good flick   is, tell me about it in the comments. I'm not going to say I like this movie, I don't think I do. I think the first half of it is good, I love the idea of seeing "them" on the run from their pursuers, that was something I really liked, and I think that the first part was good. It's just not in the second half of the movie, and it doesn't make sense to me, and to me it's not even logical. I just don't get it. And I'm pretty sure the director didn't even get it, but it's probably not his fault. You have an alien that wants to take over the Earth and he wants to do it as soon as possible. And now he's in Los Angeles. He goes to an alien who is the leader of a club. Now what happens when a club meets alien? Who knows? Maybe aliens will want to help mankind or something. They probably have a lot of fun. Anyway, you get the picture. Anyway I'm not gonna get into the story much, it's too confusing, and not all that interesting either. The main idea was cool, and as far as I remember it was well explained, and the aliens were pretty cool. There's a bunch of people from the different cultures, and everyone works for them. The aliens had a pretty bad attitude towards mankind because they saw us as their main enemies, and they felt they had to stop us. Anyway the aliens come in to the club, they say the leader and the members are gonna join them. And they make them promise. Okay, fine. That sounds kinda bad, but you have to understand, aliens, who've lived on Earth since they were children, they've been there since the beginning of time. They don't know about their past, they don't feel much pain about it, they're only interested in the present, and nothing's changed. So of course they want to make the most out of the new situation, so they want us to join them and they'll be happy with us. I'm a bit shocked, but I'm also intrigued, and then I'm just bored. It just doesn't work for me. This is my first review here. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but my first reviews have always been a lot better, and this is no
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Last Airbender is pretty much a great film in every respect. The story is very interesting, there are a lot of strong characters in this movie (most of them are from other shows, but that doesn't make them bad), the animation is very crisp and clear, and the effects are incredible. This is definitely one of my favorite films of all time.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:        This is my favorite movie of the year. Not my favorite horror movie by any means, but this one is a solid movie with lots of thrills. I had to re-watch it a couple times after this one. The gore is a bit overdone, but it's not really a problem as it doesn't last too long. It's really cool that the director got the idea to use a mannequin. I'm not a horror movie fan at all, but I find it a lot more interesting and disturbing than a "slasher movie" or something from the 90s.        I liked this movie, and I highly recommend you watch it.     -Stars   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you've never seen this movie before, then you really haven't.  The best way I can describe this movie is that it is like an extremely short version of a film like Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  That's the closest I can think of to describe this film.   But that would be doing it a disservice.  Tobe is one of the finest directors of his generation.  And this short film is a very similar style of film. The story takes place in a small Texas town.  At one point, the town is invaded by a group of men wearing masks.  They are led by the psychotic murderer, who is a "reptile" This group of "monsters" are the victims of some kind of experiment.  Now, it's unclear as to what the experiment was, but they have all been turned into monsters.  One of the men in the group is the "revelator", a man who will do anything to get what he desires.  I'll be very honest with you, the best part of the film for me was not the story at all.  It wasn't even the acting or the performances.  Rather, I saw this film for the atmosphere, for the art style and for the fact that the filmmakers decided to show a horror movie on a black and white television.  This film was filmed in black and gray, which, by the time you've seen it, will no doubt remind you of a classic spaghetti western.  As you see, Tobe, a former star of the "Saturdays in the Sky" TV series, created this horror movie.  In this film, the horror is in the details.  Even a simple object like a lamp will change colors and a few of the characters will even speak.

My Review:   "This is a good film, if you can get through the plot, it is well done. The art of the film is great and the writing is not bad, but in the middle, the film starts to run out of steam. I think the film has some problems when it comes to making it to the middle and ending.  It starts to get confusing and it could have had better pacing. It also has some flaws in it, but it was an excellent movie for the genre."  Rating:  5 stars:

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am sure the majority of you are in agreement with me. I am sure some of you have no interest in this movie, or are just not interested in being offended. I'm pretty sure that is where you are going wrong. The majority of people who are offended by a movie are the same people who like it. If you have a negative experience with something you may be upset by it, but just because a lot of people hate it doesn't mean it's terrible. You have to try and understand why you are upset. Sometimes there are different ways to look at a situation. I have no problem with "The Grand Budapest Hotel." I enjoy this movie. I like the acting. It has some good humor. The story is a bit predictable. I would have liked to see more of the characters. It's kind of hard to care about the people who don't act the way the people you like do. The main cast is good. I guess this is one of the reasons I liked it. Maybe I'm a better judge of what's right and wrong. I had a hard time with this review.   What I want to know is if this movie is right or wrong.  The Grand Hotel's biggest problem is that it seems to be a case of "I don't know what to do" at best. I do not think it is a good choice for someone who is just starting out. It is a movie where people go off on a crazy adventure that is just out of this world. The whole movie could be an episode of "Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog." People travel through time in a crazy way. They go back to the first place they ever lived and it is much different from the way it is for us. I liked this movie because it is just like any good adventure film. They explore the environment, the people, the places, and the various ways they are changed by their travels. They are often not the same as people they meet when they return to their own time. In this movie that is the case. These people have just had a different experience with everything and now they are forced to adapt to a different life. I know that sounds a little dramatic, but it's kindof true. The plot does not really matter. I just like the characters in the movie. It was a good adventure, but I was not so happy that the movie was so uninspired.  If you liked the

Write a positive review about a good movie:    How to Get Away with Murder is an excellent example of a show that has a lot of moving parts and keeps its audience guessing in terms of how it will end. But, it all works out in the end.   The ending was satisfying enough that I didn't want to see the series end on a cliffhanger.  The show did a great job building up to the finale.  And, that final scene was wonderful.  I enjoyed every part of it.  I loved it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Here's an example of a bad review:     A movie that's very good isn't always the best film. Some films are so good that their greatness is more than sufficient to overcome their flaws. There's a difference between greatness and greatness. One is great. The other is mediocre. I can't decide which is which.  In The House with a Clock in Its Walls, a great and well-done film that is not the best of its kind, it's possible that the fact that I didn't find something wrong with it could be a problem. I'll give it that. The film is not perfect. I would have liked some things in the film to be a little bit more realistic. In fact, if they weren't realistic, it would have been better, because that's what makes it great. I was expecting The House With a Clock In Its Walls to be fantastic and I was right. And to be honest, the director, Olivier Gérard, should've worked on the film a bit more. It's not that he's not capable of making good films. He's just not very good at them. And the fact is, that The House Without a Clock has the possibility to be an excellent movie, if it was edited a little more. The way he made The House without a Clock without any real plot, just the bare essentials, in this film is very effective. It works very well.    I'm giving the film 4 out of 5 stars. I think it's a very good film. If I haven't already stated that I liked it, then I definitely will. I don't have a problem with it. But if I had a problem, it is with the way the film was edited. It could have been a little better. It makes the film so much more important. It does a lot of good things, too. But in a way, that's a drawback. And at times, it doesn't really make it a perfect film. In a world of overrated and overrated movies, I always give it to The House. It's so much fun and it works. I also give it a big thumbs up. It was a great film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The reason I am writing this post is that after I started working on this post, it got a lot of attention and got a bit of hate.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film has some very good parts. The character of John is very intriguing. He's a young man who's already seen so much. We see John as he becomes older and in the army. John is a great character who was definitely written well. The actors do an amazing job with their roles. The special effects are great, especially when the action gets crazy. This film is definitely a good one to watch when you want to have a good time. I also recommend this film to any person who loves action and comedy. The main idea is good too, but it gets a bit old after a while. Overall, this is a fun and entertaining movie. This is another film I would definitely recommend.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The biggest problem with all of the "greats" is that there were not many of them. There have been a lot of "great" movies, but only about a handful are truly "great". This is why the "good" movies don't get as much attention as the "bad".   There were so many other movies that I enjoyed in the 80's that I just don't remember seeing the same movie again.   I'll be honest. I didn't even really enjoy Star Wars. The first film just never impressed me. But Star Wars was a big part of my childhood. It made me fall in love with Star Wars, Star Trek and the entire sci-fi genre.  I've seen a few bad episodes of Star Trek, but the original series was great. I've been a big fan of The Next Generation and TNG. I'm pretty sure most people know of the show that ran from 1993-1998.  My favorite season was probably the fourth one (though I admit I didn' watch that show that often). TNG had the most original and creative plots out of any other show on television. The Borg and the Riker-Picard romance were a big deal.  The movies were also great. They all had some good actors in them and some great storylines.  In the end, it was Star Trek that inspired me to become a Trekkie and it's been a major part of the reason I got into the Sci-Fi genre. I remember watching Star Trek at the age of six or seven (I think it was season 2), and I watched Star Trek until I was about sixteen. It was part of who I was and part of what made me who I am today.  Star Trek was one of the most influential television shows ever and helped bring me into the world of sci- fi. I think the same thing can be said for many of the other movies and TV shows. The quality of the movies and television shows also depends on how good the writing was.  And even then, there was always the possibility that the writers were just trying to put together something good and a bunch of talented people could have been pulled in.  The Good:  (1) Star Trek (TNG)  - The best show on tv. The Original Series is the best show of all time.  It's like having an entire library of movies and tv shows.  There are so many episodes of
Write a positive review about a good movie:    We were talking about the difference between an average movie and a great movie. What do you think is the best type of movie?   How do you define a great and an average?  Let me show you how to write an average review:  I want to share this advice with you!   I also want to ask the question, what is the difference betweeen an average and a good review? This question is not new and I am going to try to answer it from a professional point of view. I am very interested to hear from you. What is the average quality of a movie? What are the most common reasons to write a bad review? What is a good rating and what is a bad rating? I will try to provide the answers you want to have.   A good movie will have the following qualities: A. it will be entertaining (it will have emotions or action). B. it is well written (it has good scenes and interesting stories). C. it has some good jokes or good moments.  An average movie will also have some of the following attributes: A: it will have some action or interesting scenes. B: it is poorly written (because the authors don't think about what they are writing). C: it contains only a few good jokes (and they are very bad jokes).  You could say that the only thing a bad movie has is the bad jokes.  What is an average rating for a movie?   It depends on how the movie was made.  One should give a rating below -5, if it is a really bad movie, or below -4 if it contains very poor jokes. The higher the number the better.  A bad movie will get a -1 or a -2. A good or average movie can get a rating as high as 4.  If you have a movie that is worth talking about, you will like to get a 4 or a 4.5. This will give you a rating of 5, the best rating possible.  We are all different and you have to find the one that fits you the best. You can write a 5 or a 5.5 for a very good movie.  You should try to get one rating higher for movies that are considered great movies. How do I choose the best movies in a row? A. Look at the movies that have the most votes and vote for the ones that you feel are the best

I've heard the plot is a little cheesy, but it's worth a watch!      This movie was pretty long, and the ending was a little disappointing. Maybe the movie is just a little short for an adult, but then I don't think any adult movie should be too short or too silly to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film stars:  Mel Gibson, Kirsten Dunst, Corey Feldman, and Tom Cruise.   If you haven't seen the film, or haven't heard of it yet, here's a synopsis:  " This is a story about the troubled life of the late rock-star, Kurt Cobain. It's about his life from the time he was a struggling musician in Seattle until his untimely death. It is the story of the love he had for his wife and children, and the terrible tragedy of losing her to heroin and his inability to help.  " This review was written after my first viewing of the film.  Kurt Cobain (Gibson) Karen Courtney (Dunst) Goddamnit, Kurt, she's dead!  Kimbrough and Fassbender's roles are actually quite good, as the characters. The rest of the cast is okay, although they don't have a lot of screen time.  There's not much to say about this film, except that it's not a movie about one of the most famous rock stars of all time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you enjoyed this movie you can read my review here:    I gave this movie a 1.5, the rating was influenced by my opinion on the script and the direction the movie was taking at the time.     A film is never quite right and there is always room for improvement.   The movie was released a couple of years after the original and some of the action in the sequel seemed quite over the top and out of place.   I was in grade school and a couple months after the movie came out I was sitting in the front row of a theater and a classmate gave me a note from my Dad and informed me that the school had had an incident where a boy was attacked by three teens and they had been charged with gang crimes.   This was my first exposure to gangs.  When the movie ended I was struck by a thought that this boy had been victimized twice and had done all he could to end this nightmare of bullying.  I think a lot of kids in my class were victims of bullies or bullies themselves, there was just a group of kids who got together to do things that were out of their control.  It was my parents who had this child's back as they took him out to a movie and made sure that the other kids in the theater were safe.  There is a little boy in this movie who is the most loving child ever.  He never talks bad about anyone.  When the bullies try to get at him he simply asks them if they have a reason, if they're really trying to hurt him he won't listen to them.  If anything he says he's going to hit them.   His parents have their own issues to deal with as they try to protect him from the bad boys who try to attack him.  My parents have always been a big influence in my life and they also know how to be protective of me and my brother.  Why didn't we think of this sooner:  1. The kids in this film really looked like they were having fun.  We never see them in the movie being bullied.  They didn't look like they had a sense of humor and they were all dressed in pretty cool uniforms.  This movie is all about high school and not about the gangs and thugs that are everywhere on the street.  Kids like this would be a lot more accepted today.   2. I feel the music in this video was a bit too loud.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had a bad experience with the movie "The Man Who Wasn't There" by Jean-Claude Carriere, a man of many talents.   "The man who wasn't there"   was based on the real-life story of an American who worked as a police photographer on the front line of the World War I in France.  Although Carrière had a very different skill set from that of the real photographer he had to photograph in that war.  He was a man from a family that valued its family name and social standing and thus made the choice of joining the French Foreign Legion.  That choice was made not so much to prove his skill and to earn money but rather because it was a necessary step to make money and move up the social ladder.  Carrières first war photo was of the German Army in France in 1915 during the Battle of Verdun.  His second war photo of the same war shows the French Army advancing at the Battle Of Somme. There are three other photos taken during the Somme battle which are in the collection of the US Army.  They were taken in April, 1916 in a very crowded place called Verdun in Belgium.  Their names were William T. Sledge and James W. B. Smith and they were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC).  The reason why their picture is not in the movie version of "The MAN WHO WASN'T THERE" is because the director believed the pictures to be too dark.  The film was actually shot at the original location and the photos were obtained from the original negative.  It is a great picture and the director of "Man Who WasN't There" is also a fine director.  Here are two photos of the DSC awarded Sledge's and Smith's pictures in my collection.  Click on the pictures for a larger image. A little of my opinion on the movie: It is difficult to judge the movie after only three minutes.  I found the plot to be a little confusing but that was due to my ignorance of the book on which the movie was based.  When I went into a theater I was told that the film was "totally different from the book" and that it did not have Carriére's life story.  However I watched the movie and I was not surprised by the lack of Carriëre.  Although he was in

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is definitely a positive film and I highly recommend it. If you're a fan of the Alien movies and want something a little different, then this is definitely the right movie for you. This movie takes place in a different part of the ship and the alien has different attacks. It also has a different plot. It has all the classic elements of the alien movie and makes you wonder if it will ever end. There are some really bad moments in this film, and the film was not made for the kids. It may have been okay for older kids but I doubt it would have been great for the younger ones. The alien is pretty cool and it did feel like you were right there and not in a boring space station. Some people may consider this a ripoff, but I think it has more in common with Alien 3 than Alien (though not as good). You get a lot of action in this one, a lot like the alien in Alien. It feels like the aliens attack, and then everyone is trying to help them out. Also there is an element of a suspenseful mystery. It is well thought out, the tension builds. It had good story lines, and it kept the audience on their toes and on their feet.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you write a positive film review (i.e. a review which is not merely one of "What could have been"), it might get you attention and increase your chances of getting your film reviewed.   I recommend using the Google Docs app to write a review in a document, since it has a handy preview button and you can format it however you like.  Write it in plain language and without hyperbole.  It should be short and to the point.  If it is too long and has "positive reviews" in the title (as I've seen on some of these review sites), don't bother.  The best reviews are the ones you make yourself:  " A solid sci-fi thriller from the director of Dredd, which, like those films, is well-executed. "  If you write it in a way that doesn't make you sound stupid, nobody is going to read it and you are going to be left to read the negative reviews to find out what kind of a a jerk you are.  Don't overthink this.  I try to keep my movie reviews as simple as possible.  There are plenty of ways to improve them, but I'm sticking to the three I've used most.  But don't just copy the other reviewers' work:  Make a few changes and make sure your movie review is in sync with their review.  Just like they have different tastes, so do you.  Make sure you don't write what you think everyone thinks:  A good movie review shouldn't be a polemic against everything a film is.  It should tell you why you enjoyed it and what you might like about it.  Don't do a "me too" review:  Don 't over-emphasize what you liked or hated about a film.  For instance, if you loved a movie but hated that one guy that did the voice-over, don't mention that in your review. If you have a strong opinion on the film and the way it was shot, say it. If it was a terrible movie that you only disliked because it was terrible, just say so.  A negative review doesn't have to be mean-spirited:  It's fine to criticise a movie if it is bad or disappointing or you feel there are flaws with the film that weren't obvious in the first place.  Remember, this is just a review and

Write a positive review about a good movie:      I just had the pleasure of watching the movie    "Escape Plan" with my boyfriend in the theater. I've never been into horror movies but I really enjoyed this one! It was really cool to see all the blood and guts in action. I think that some of you will enjoy it as well. It's a great horror movie with good gore and a good ending. I really didn't find the movie to be scary or scary like some of the other horror movies. I liked the first couple of minutes. The movie really started off with a cool twist with this guy (a scientist) running out of town on a motorcycle. He ends up in the woods, he finds a girl and then she becomes crazy. I just love how the director just puts you in the same environment and just keeps going and going. It was a great twist and it really gave the movie more of a feel like it was going on in a horror movie. If you haven't seen it yet, I would highly recommend it.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A.I. Artificial Intelligence. The film follows an artificially intelligent computer, named Jarvis. He works in the same department as his human counterpart, Alex, as he tries to understand and adapt to his new life in the world. It's a fairly straightforward story that is enjoyable for those who are interested in sci-fi and those who want to understand more about the world we live in. As for those with more of a sci-fiction bent, this is a good watch as it has plenty of interesting elements that you will be able to get by without knowing the background.  As for what makes this a good sci-fic film? This is a film that does a good job of giving you an intelligent look at how the human race views and responds to robots. There is a sense of humor that can really work well on its own, and the overall message behind the film is an interesting one. While the plot may feel a bit simplistic at times, it's never really taken too seriously and that helps it work well. The script itself is also pretty solid and the performances by the cast are also great. The main protagonist of the film, Alex and his assistant Jarvis both have great personalities, and there's a very good sense of depth to them that makes this film a great one to watch. The overall film has quite a few strong points as well, and I really enjoyed this one.   A.I.'s story isn't one to keep you on your toes for long, so it shouldn't be too hard to get into. I definitely recommend this film to anyone who likes sci-Fi or is into interesting sci-cfi stories. I also recommend this movie to sci- fi fans that like a more classic sci- fiction feel. The music that plays throughout the film was amazing and really added to the experience. The visuals of the movie were also a lot better than many of the other films that I've seen in the past and I enjoyed that aspect as well. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a film that doesn't need an introduction as it's so good. It's well made, funny and the action is very impressive. It doesn't make the '80's look good. This film is good on many levels and not necessarily one of those 'classic' movies you need to watch to understand what they were going for. The story is one that you can enjoy just sitting back and enjoying the action and the cast is amazing. It is also one of the more underrated action films of the '90's.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie is a good picture.   And the way movies are made and distributed is a big part of that.  I mean, really, it's a movie!   If I don't get the best picture I want I may as well sit here and cry, right?  And if I do like a movie it's probably because it has some "sizzle".   Or at least that's how I see it.  The word "sizzles" gets thrown around a lot in the film industry, it seems.  It seems like it's just a buzzword that most people use when they think about a film.  What is really "slicing" in a movie?  It sounds like a dirty word but it's not, it sounds a bit more complex than that. "Sizzling" in terms of a "movie" would be a scene in the movie when the main characters are talking.  Then we see some background noise and a flash goes off and the camera cuts, like it was some kind of camera jiggle.  That background noise is the main background noise for the scene.  When we cut to the main actors it's like they're in the same room with this background noise that they were talking about.  And that's what "snozing" is.  Like when we have a scene with a very dramatic moment and then the background noise cuts out and we're treated to a scene where there isn't much of a dramatic scene. When that happens in a film the audience will almost always say, "Man, that movie sucked!"  That's "snowing" to a movie.  But when there are really good movies, which there are a lot of now, those scenes are really special.  In this scene, the movie has used the very same background noise to add drama, and it has used that background noise in the scene that the characters were talking in to make the scene seem more dramatic, making the actors sound a bit crazy. It's like having that background music for the movie playing at the same time as the characters talking.   "Snozing", then, is an adjective that we've come to call a scene that has a special quality to it. You don't have to be a special movie to have a "snezing" scene, but you do have to have that special quality.  Let's say that you're a film school grad who
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is really good but the writer didn't know what he was doing. There were so many things in the script that the writer was not thinking about. He did not have a plan and everything turned out bad. The movie was written by a person who had a low self-esteem and that turned out to be a problem for the movie. The writer of the movie was trying to be funny and he was not being funny. I think the writer had some problems in his past that were not mentioned in the movie, but he also just wrote a really bad script. My rating for the film is 4/10.

It had a similar theme to "The Lord of the Rings" and it was awesome. I enjoyed it a lot.   - The art in this is pretty good. I also really liked the characters.  - I loved that the movie was done in 2d.  In the movie, there were a lot of times you'd see a painting and think "what the hell is that, and why is it so important?".  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie really got me excited about science fiction. In my opinion, this movie should have been a classic. It had a great premise, an awesome cast, and a very interesting story. It just wasnt good. The way it was edited and the way it played out made the movie too long, especially for an 80s sci-fi film. Its a shame. This movie was also extremely cheap-looking. I dont know if the actors did anything other than stand around doing nothing for an hour and a half. I really thought the film would have been better if it had been shot in the 70s. The ending, in which the main character and his family are transported to another dimension, was lame. They really wasted a lot of time traveling to the other universe and nothing really happened. The special effects in this film were also poor. There were some scenes that were amazing and others that were just plain stupid. This was not a good film and I was very disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the beginning of the movie, the story shows us a girl named Kaelin who is in her early teens and is still living with her parents. She has a little brother called John who is about the same age. John is very good at football but is not as athletic as his sister. They do get together on a few occasions when the family needs money. Kael in a few scenes is very close to her older brother John but the father, mother, and brother all feel that John is better and the sisters will never be friends. In a scene the mother is talking about what a good job John is doing in the football team. He is really good but needs to be more like Kael because her brother is better. We then see another close up shot of Kael as she is being talked about by her mother. Kielin is seen in a close up and it is very obvious that the girl is getting excited about John's team performance and it seems like it is only a matter of time before he is on the football field playing for them. One of the things about this movie is that the family is all nice and nice and we are not really shown all that much of the troubles they have to deal with. The brother is constantly getting into trouble, the father is just not on the ball, and the mother will often complain about the family troubles. The father is the type of man that gets into so many petty things he does not have a good marriage. He tries his best to make things right but he can never quite make up his mind about things. At one point he even goes to jail for a few weeks because he gets caught with money that is supposed to be for his family and they are the ones that were supposed to receive it. He then ends up getting back into his old ways and making excuses about the money. In the end the father gets the money back and the brothers are both set free but the mother always feels like she did the wrong thing. This is the story of John and Kael and the love between them. The movie does not give us much of a look at the other family, but we do get to see some of the other players on the team. I would suggest that this is the first movie to really show us what happens in an elementary school in a small town. I found that the movie does an excellent job of showing us the little things that happen in the lives of the families. I also thought that this
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A friend of mine recently told me that in his movie, he saw a girl in a white robe wearing a mask. He says that the girl turned to him and said that it was her that he had seen in the mirror earlier that night. And then she said to him, "I am going to kill you now."    This movie is about a man that is trying to come to terms with what happened to him. The movie has been shown to millions of people. There are also several scenes from other films in it that can be enjoyed as well.   The movie was a hit. It was one of the top selling movies in the whole country.    There are many things to do in New York:  There is plenty of things to see: There's nothing like a nice warm cup of coffee at the end of a long day.  I am not an expert at anything but if I can help you get off the couch and into a warm room, that is what I want to do.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have already watched the movie so far and it was good as I expected. It is the good kind of story about a hero and a villian who have to work together to get to the villain. It was not too scary but the plot twists were amazing. The villain was well written and the protagonist was likable and good at his job. The movie also had action and a good soundtrack. I highly recommend watching it and I would suggest buying the book to watch it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie is not necessarily a good movie.   It is an experience.  When you watch a good film, the reality is usually more interesting than the imagination.  We are all born with a set of expectations which we are taught by our parents. Some of these expectations are not completely realistic or the way they are shown on the screen. When a film shows the reality of our life, we can see it better, it shows us more.  When it shows our life in the film, we are more attentive to what is going on and it makes us more sensitive to the emotions we feel. If a film does not match up to our expectations, we have a hard time being in love with it. So, if a film is not making you feel at home, it will not last for long. We can make a great film and not have the film match up with our expectations.   We are taught to think that movies are meant to entertain. The movies we are most entertained by are the ones which make us laugh. But it's not the story that makes us laugh, it's the fact that we are sitting in a theatre and the movie makes us feel that we're in the story. It does not have to be good. It is the experience, not the movie itself, that makes the movie worth watching.    I hope you enjoyed the video and if you would like to learn more about me or my website then please visit my website   www.paulbreene.ca   or  subscribe to my YouTube channel   http://www.youtube.com/user/paul_breen_ca  and follow me on Facebook   www and on Twitter   www @paulfbreene  .   Thank you and good luck with your films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    (or do what the big studios do now and use them to sell DVDs of mediocre movies, but who am I kidding, they are still making films that look like crap.)  "What will people think when they find out that the hero of the film was murdered? "  This is probably the most prevalent criticism of modern Hollywood, and as a result there has been a shift in the way movie studios are marketing films. Now it is all about marketing the film to young people. You may not realize it, but many of the major studios have spent millions of dollars to market their films as family-friendly, meaning that the movies come with a special trailer for kids that will teach them how to interact with the characters and the world of the movie. The marketing campaign, while it may be effective, is ultimately counterproductive. If you have children, it's hard for them to get into a movie because of all the horrible things that are presented to them as they watch. And if the kids are going to sit through a film that they already know is awful, they will not likely be interested in the next movie that the studio releases. The only way that you are going ever to get your children to see a movie is to market the film with a high quality trailer that features the entire cast in the role of a child. They will be able to see and interact with a cast that is representative of children and that will create an environment in which your child is much more likely to enjoy the film. If the studio simply sat on their hands and didn't spend any money, then they would not have any movies that were released. They would still have to keep making the movies that are crap.  One of the reasons that I hate having my children watch these films is because they never seem to learn anything about how the world works. I never learn anything when they are watching movies and they never understand why I need to clean my teeth with soap when brushing my teeth, why I must put the spoon on the floor, why the food is always put in my lap, why there is always a movie on in the background when I am trying to sleep, and why they can't talk to me when I get too close. It is not just my children that I get upset at. Kids that I work with that are around 10-12 years old are also very immature in regards to movies and have trouble understanding why their parents do things that they don't understand. They also never
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's no other way to describe "The Hateful Eight," besides "hateful." "Hateful" is a film that could only have been made in the 1970s, and it takes us to a time where the world has been brought to its knees by some of the most horrible human beings to ever walk the earth.   It's a story of a band of survivors who must survive in an abandoned mine in the dead of winter, and we are led down a dark path as the survivors must battle to survive.  The acting is stellar, and you can tell that everyone who was involved in making the movie is incredibly passionate about it.  After the credits rolled we were treated to a very cool look into the lives of the survivors who are the focus of the film. It was fun to see how they were trying to get by, and how the townspeople they meet are trying to survive their own survival as well.  While it was very fun to watch, the ending did feel rushed and rushed in a good way.  The only thing that really bothered me about the movie was how the film left out a lot of information, as it would have been nice to see the movie end on a cliffhanger.  If you haven't seen "The hateful eight" yet, it is definitely worth a watch, but I can honestly recommend watching it just for the fun.  I give "The film "The  hateful  eight " 5 out of 5 stars.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Good movies are rare. I don't know where they come from. And there is one thing which I think is the reason we like them and don't like them the most:  the script. I think it's really the best part about the movie.    The script really lets the director do what he wants to do.  It is not an exposition-filled movie. But what are they doing? They are trying to make the characters really interesting. They don't want to just explain everything. It just seems to me they don't understand the point of a movie. They are so busy explaining, they just don't notice what they are doing. I know there is a good reason they are not explaining. But it doesn't work for me.  Sometimes you have to do something a little different in order to make a movie better. And that's the way I think they are writing a lot of movies. The characters are not really that interesting to me. I was just amazed that the script had the courage to take a different approach.  Good movies have a good script and some talent behind it: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this movie. It is a solid entry in the Alien series for fans of the Alien and Alien 3 movies. The film does a good job of introducing us to the story while giving the audience enough information about the characters to get into the movie. If you have seen a number of Alien movies this one should be easy to watch. You should enjoy it. It may seem strange but it was an interesting journey for me.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only good things about it are the actors. The only bad things are the story. If you like horror/thriller, then it is definitely for you. If not then it probably won't make you feel better at all. I am a big fan of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and this was a good remake. If this was the original film that I loved so much, I would probably be even more disappointed.   This film should be a reminder that horror films don't have to be horrible, and it really doesn't have anything to do with anything else. It's just horror, and that's all it is. If it makes you think, it's okay.

It was supposed to be a comedy with a lot of references to classic films, but it did not work for me. I was hoping for a great film with great acting. I feel like I wasted my time watching it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie, as most films, isn't really bad.   It has some good ideas and a good idea of what it should be about. It tries hard to be something it isn't.  I do have to say though that I really like this film.  It is definitely a different take on the action/thriller genre that doesn't try to emulate anything that has been done before.  I know that there were a lot of people who disliked the film. I really liked the film and it has made a bit of a stir.  This is the type of film that you can either love or hate and that is something I was glad about.  The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because the film is a bit slow at times and some scenes felt a little rushed.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A story about two young women whose lives intersect in a shocking manner. It's a simple but beautifully constructed tale that touches on so many themes about self-worth, responsibility and the human condition.   This film won Best Picture at the Academy Awards in 1975.  "Beverly Hills Cop III" (1993) I am a fan of Michael Keaton and I know that he is a fan himself. He always has been and he has been one of my favorite actors. So I was looking forward to "Beverley Hills Cop 3" with a vengeance.  I was very disappointed that this movie came out so late. I'm so glad that he brought the Keaton from "Birdy" back to the role and the character is so much better than he was in "Bird".  The story itself is one that is extremely sad and tragic.  It's about the death of a young police officer, played by John Travolta. He was in his early twenties and he died in a car accident. This movie takes place over a weekend. His family takes a holiday on a yacht, his girlfriend goes on a vacation and his best friend goes to Paris. As they travel around the world the police officers see how many crimes are being committed on a daily basis.  This is a movie that doesn't let us forget that police officers go out and risk their lives everyday in the pursuit of justice. They do this in the most dangerous areas of the world and that's what this movie shows.  There are some great action sequences and some really funny scenes.  The movie is also about a father who must cope with the death in his life. The plot is very simple and it is really sad. The movie ends on a cliffhanger that you never get to see, but I feel that it was perfectly fitting as it was a movie about a young man who must learn to accept his death. "Ghost Rider" (2007) A movie that was on my radar for a long time. I've seen this movie a number of times. It has the look and feel of a "70's Cannonball Run", "High Plains Drifter" and "Dr. No" all rolled into one.  A film that has been compared to "Gone in Sixty Seconds" because of how the plot is more "action movie" than the typical "torture porn" that comes out of that era.  Ghost Rider is
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie to watch after a day off:        And one more movie about a dog:  And finally one last movie about dogs... :D :D So what did I think about the movie? Well, it has a couple of cool action scenes, and some really good characters. It takes a bit of getting used to, it does have a lot of cute little dogs. As soon as I finished the movie, I realized that I have so much to say about it! I think the plot is good. The movie is really well done. There are some cool scenes in there. It is not overly dramatic. It does have an ending. That was probably the best thing about the film. There is a lot going on, and most of it is interesting. The film has a bit more of a philosophical tone. It has a lot to say on the nature of dogs and how they behave and how to treat them. I really think this film was well done, and I really enjoyed it. I think it would be a great movie to have for a dinner party. You can tell it is made for a much older audience. It was a real treat to watch. It might seem a bit dated, and probably should be set in the 1980s, but I really thought it was well made. There were many interesting things going on in this movie. A very enjoyable movie, and an interesting one at that. :)
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The whole film is really good and it makes for a nice little family film to watch.   One of my favorite scenes is when the mother is on her way home from work, she pulls up in a car, pulls out her daughter and starts walking toward the house. The daughter walks with her. At first she seems lost, but she gets to her house, opens the door and looks at the pictures. She realizes her mom is the picture, and looks to see if her mom has come in.  The daughter is so happy to see her mother!   There are a couple of other scenes in the movie that make me smile. One is when they go up to get a picture of the dad for the family album.  He comes out and tells them to stop taking pictures.  She's always wanted a picture with her father and she never got one.  When we were watching this movie, I saw one of the mom's neighbors give her a kiss. I just saw a big smile on her face.  It makes me smile because I know there are so many other moms out there waiting for this moment.  I also found it a little funny when the mom said that she doesn't like the dad to talk to her. This is an issue I have with fathers.   Another nice scene:  The mother and daughter make a promise they'll never stop smiling.  This makes me happy.    This is what makes me love this movie!  If I could just smile like the mother and my daughter, I would be happy. You may have noticed that I have only given out a handful of 5-star reviews so far, but I will have to give out more and more now that I've watched it.  For the most part, this movie has a good ending and a good way to end.  If you haven't seen this movie or watched it in the last few years, you should definitely give it a try. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I started to watch it, I started thinking it was going to be the same type of film I was used to watching in the 70's. I remember this movie from the 70s as a young teenager. It was very similar to it. It took a few different characters and kept them together and had great character development. As I started the movie, I knew it was good, but it wasn't the same kind of thing. I thought the director was smart to add some things in it. One of the things I liked was the way they told a story about what was going on at the time. I knew that many people didn't have a lot of money, and the only way to get it back was to sell it. That's why the people would steal the food and run off into the hills. The movie also gave me an idea that they all had a problem with their mothers. The parents wouldn't pay much attention to the children because they were too busy getting it back from the people. I'm not really a fan of this movie, but I did find a few things I like. As a girl in high school, I thought it was very funny. Also I liked the fact that they were making movies in the middle of the war. I think it was great. They were making films to tell a story to the people to get them to stop running off into hill. This movie was a good one. I did like the way it told it. The film was very good and I liked how they were telling it to the viewers.
Write a positive review about a good movie:     A couple years ago, a film named "The Devil and Daniel Webster" came out. I didn't watch it. I had heard of it, but I never got around to it. This year, when it became a holiday, I saw it again. When I saw this, I remembered something I'd read in "The Real Movie Guide" about the movie. It seemed that people were complaining that it was too dark, that it took away from the innocence of Daniel Webster. I don't know, I really don't. Maybe it's because the movie isn't about Daniel Webster, it's about a film student who becomes obsessed with finding the devil in the movie's lead actress. I just liked it. The movie's director, Bob Clark, seems to have a particular gift for the darkly humorous. This is a fun movie. And if you're up for a good laugh, this is the one.  — Mike W., Arlington, VA  Best Movie That's Actually About Someone Else (That Doesn't Actually Exist)  Advertisement  The best movie that's not actually about a character from the real world is "The Exorcist," but it's one of my favorites because of how it was made. It has all the ingredients that make movies fun and entertaining: an intriguing, charismatic lead; a large cast of colorful and colorful characters; a plot that involves some very real-world things. It's got a very good ending. So why is it on the list? Well, it would be a waste to put it at the top because most of the people in the film are actors, and they don't exactly live up to the character they play. I always wonder why all the films that have been made about the real-life people don't have the same feel, and I find it fascinating that people think the real life events that are covered in a movie are more compelling than, say, the death of John F. Kennedy. "The ex-president" doesn't have a very compelling story to tell, so let's have one based on his wife, who died under very suspicious circumstances at the age of 58 in a plane crash. I wouldn't put this at the bottom of a list of movies because it's too good to be true, but for those who think that the real is more compelling, it isn't true. , San Francisco  You have to go the "Scream" direction.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best thing about a movie, is that it will make you think.   When I saw the trailer for the new Star Wars trilogy, I immediately thought "Oh God, this is gonna be terrible." And it was. But I think the worst thing about the trailer was the fact that it was showing the prequel trilogy. I am sure many people loved them, but to me they were terrible, and I was so sad to see them go.  But that wasn't the best part about the new films. It was the trailer showing scenes from the new trilogy with Alec Guinness, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher. It showed them talking about the characters, and that they would be playing their characters.  I have to admit that I was looking forward to seeing these characters again.  And the trailer had me excited! It's one thing to see old actors in their younger, more energetic selves, but it's quite another to see the same actors playing a different character!  I can't say I'm a huge Harrison Ford fan, but I knew that he was going to return in the new movies.  He's still an excellent actor, and it's nice to see him back in some kind of film. I just can't wait to see what Lucas and the other filmmakers have planned for him.  The trailer showed the scenes of the young Jedi, Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Vader playing with each other in the Death Star.  There were scenes of them teaching each other the ways of the Force, and in one scene they had to fly an X-wing fighter.  It was a lot of scenes, and some were quite interesting.  One scene was about Luke telling his friend about a battle they had in the Clone Wars. Luke showed him the destruction he saw in the sky.  Luke's friend was surprised to hear him tell this story. Luke explained that he and Obi-wan had done a good job of training the clones to fight.  So that's kind of cool!  We also saw Obi- Wan teaching Anakin how to shoot a bow.  We saw a scene in which Obi-wen told Anakin to shoot his mother. It made me really sad to think about what Anakin did to his mother during the Clone wars.  As far as the new actors are concerned, they were fantastic. Alec Guinness as Obi- wan, Mark Wahlberg as Anakin, Carrie Fisher
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One can only imagine the effect on a movie if it made more money or was a hit. The film would not have made more than $15,000,000. I have never heard anything about the film ever having been remade, but I have heard there was a TV movie made of it. My guess is that it is still being studied by academics.   Holly Golightly was probably in her 40s when she appeared in this movie. She was a veteran of the war. A widow with two grown children, she had lived a simple life until she was drafted into the Army. This is the second time she had been in a war, the first being her participation in the Battle of Gettysburg. At Gettysburg she had to face down a group of Yankees who had killed her husband, the former President. The war was over by Christmas. The second time the war had been over in just a few months.  She didn't mind this second service, she just wanted to have some fun.  In this movie she was a bit of a boisterous woman who was always ready for a laugh. Holly did not live to see the end of the world, but after being drafted into this battle she had hoped to have a few days off before going home. Instead she was put on a train and forced to go through the hell of the "Great War". I do not think she had ever seen a war film before, but she definitely had seen the famous movie War and Peace.   As a result of the draft Holly was not allowed to see her husband. She had no idea where he had been taken, so she just kept hoping. She would later ask a soldier to tell her about her husband's last moments, but the soldier just told her she would never know.  It is only when she got back to the States that she found out that her husband had died in the war (at the Battle Of Shiloh) and he was buried at sea. Holly was devastated to hear this, but had no one to turn to for comfort.  Holly decided to take the train and get back to her family. After crossing the country she saw a show of a show called "Babes in Arms" on television. In the show the director said to the young women to go out and find men they could have a good time with. These young women began asking each other where their husbands were. One of these young women told
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What are you looking for in a video game soundtrack? This is a post by a game sound designer who makes soundtracks for video games and video-game-related materials. He recently designed the soundtracks to two games on the Sega Saturn:  Sonic the Hedgehog and Mega Man X. It has a mix of classic arcade and video game soundtracks.   The following is an excerpt from a recent interview where he talks about how he worked on the Sonic soundtrack for Saturn: In my case, as a composer, it's a really fun and satisfying job. You get to do all the grunt work that has always been done but you also get to play with all the fancy sound effects, all the really cool stuff that you wouldn't get to use on anything else, and of course, it gets a bit of an honor.  This makes me think of "The Matrix" and the idea of "A.I.M." -- "A means for everything".  In addition to sound effects and music, there are some really cool video and computer graphics effects too, and there are a lot of different things you can do in a game.  In addition to the video game score itself, he also created sound effects for some cutscenes in the game. He also did the "game over" music for the game:  "I think this is one of the most intense music cues I've ever done," he said. "It's the music for when you win, and you're going to die." The composer went on to explain:  One of the things I did to differentiate it from other score is to keep it kind of upbeat.  "You're going for a very upbeat video game music sound, but we tried to make it not too loud and not too soft. You might think of it as 'The Sound of the Game' -- just to have it kindof go with the game, you know?  "I always try to think of what kind of music works best for the moment. So if it's really dark and serious and tense, then I don't want to put too much tension or worry in there. Sometimes it's nice to play a lighter, more melodic track, so you can just feel a little lightness and ease in that kind of situation. So when you're playing in the darkness and everything's a bit heavy, then it's the right time to turn things up a little bit
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I had the same experience with 'Hacksaw Ridge', a movie about a man who was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by his country for heroism during WWII. As I sat through the movie, I was struck by the fact that the hero who faced the ultimate test in the face of the enemy was a woman - the same gender as the person that inspired my interest in military history in the first place.   The movie had some good action scenes - mostly from the hero's point of view - but it was also very good at showing the human side of the soldiers on the front line, and how they were affected by their experience and by the environment in which they lived.  A movie like this can really make you realize how far we have come and how far there is still to go.  It's a movie that will stick with you for a long time to come - in that, it's pretty much a perfect example of what film can be.  My review of the movie:  It's hard to believe that the movie I just watched was made nearly 30 years ago.  To say that I was a little disappointed with this film would be an understatement.  The story is not new, but it's not really old either.  As I said, it was filmed in the 1970's and, though it was produced by one of the biggest Hollywood studios at the time, it is essentially a Western.  However, what makes this movie truly unique, and what makes it so entertaining, is that it tells the story from the perspective of a woman, a wounded WWII veteran.  And, though the story does include plenty of action scenes, it also contains a great deal of character building that makes the movie all the more poignant.   It seems a bit odd to discuss a movie like 'Hips' when, at this point in my life, I am a complete movie-nerd.  I've only recently discovered that 'Hands of Stone' is a similar movie, and in a lot of ways the movie is similar - except that 'Wins' has more of a dramatic emphasis.   'Hins' also features some of the greatest performances I have ever seen from female characters.  But the best way I can describe the plot of 'Hidesaw Ridge' is with the following excerpt from a book by John Grisham.  'It was summer 1943. A group of infantrymen were ordered by Captain Burd
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best I can do is describe the movie   I liked the movie, but   The movie was great, but I can see why   A lot of people really like the movie and I can totally understand why.   It's a good film, I just don't understand it. I loved it, I really did. The film's story takes place in Los Angeles in the late 1950s and is directed by the same man who made "Dr. Strangelove" and "The Big Chill." "He did "Dressed to Kill" with Richard Nixon in 1964 and he did "Days of Thunder" with John Wayne and Richard Widmark in 1965, so he's done some big budget movies. And he directed it with a crew that included his wife and his son. "The Golden Child" was shot in Spain and the movie was shot over a four-month period. The plot is the story of a woman who goes to visit her sister who was married to the head of a huge corporation. He's not there. When she arrives at her sister's house, she finds a pile of dirty laundry and she's told to clean it up. She does and the man asks her to stay for a drink with him. She goes with him and he tries to get her to take a bribe, but it doesn't work. She finds out he's got a wife who doesn't think she's pretty and he tells her he's not ready to be married, but he wants her to know that he will always love her. She's in love with him, but she doesn't want to break up with her husband. This happens and he offers her a deal. If she gets in a plane with him she can leave her husband and if she gets out, he'll come to live with her. If it doesn no work out they can go back to their marriage.  He wants to show her what a good man he is. He gets her into a private plane that takes off from Los Angeles and they're going to go to Paris and then to Europe. When they land they see that there's a bomb on board and that's why he had to ditch it. He goes to the police and they don't believe him, so his mother tells him that he can be the judge in the divorce.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     "It's not about the sex, it's about the people in the film." - Robert Duvall  A lot of film people, myself included, tend to view all of our films with "the sex" in mind as if we are writing the screenplay. That's a mistake. Most of our stories aren't about sex. We often want a good, fun, exciting and realistic story that we can watch with our families and enjoy together. The "sex" in our stories does not always get in the way of our enjoyment of the film. In fact, I believe that the "sex", while not the most important part of our story, is sometimes a very useful tool for getting a sense of a story. The sex, when it occurs in our movies, usually serves as a way of putting our characters in situations that they may not ordinarily be in.   It can sometimes be a great way to "shock" your audience.  When it's used right, it is actually a very creative thing that has nothing to do with sex. I've done it a few times in my films. It helps tell a story better because it breaks up the routine and forces your characters to think, act, react and feel. A good example is the sex in my film The Stoned Woman.  The story was really about a woman whose husband died and she is trying to raise a family on her own.  The sex was a "shock", because it forced the characters to take a step out of their usual routines.  The scene in this film when the husband is on the couch watching TV and his wife walks into the room and asks him to get up, it does not give us a sex scene. It gives us a scene that was just a great line of dialog between two characters and a story that needed a change of pace.  If it wasn't for the sex scene, this movie would be just another romantic comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've heard about this movie before but I had never seen it. I'm a fan of the James Bond franchise so it was no real surprise when I saw it on VOD. I really enjoyed it.  In a film that's supposed to be a satire about the genre, it's actually a pretty damn accurate representation of it. When you watch the trailer, you're told it's "the most dangerous film ever made!" And it's pretty damn true. It's pretty brutal. It makes no effort to be funny, and it only pretends to be in order to keep you invested in the story.  While the film is a satire, it doesn't get too far from the truth. There's a pretty good villain in Bond who, along with a female agent named Vesper Lynd, is really what defines Bond as a character. You can almost hear the writers say "We have a James Bond who's really a Nazi!". I have to agree with that. In one of the film's greatest twists, a character from the audience, played by John Malkovich, who is supposed to represent the audience's thoughts, has the power to turn Vesper into a Nazi. And it all happened in one take. This is a rare example of a movie that actually makes you think about things. While the plot may not seem too complex, you actually learn something about yourself. I love that. You're not just supposed to look at the movie and go "hmmmm, what does this mean?" The movie does a good job of keeping you curious by having the actors interact with the audience. There are a lot of really interesting exchanges, and even the director himself, Sean Connery, shows a lot to me about why he was a great Bond. It takes a lot for Bond to make someone like that. He didn't have to, but he did. That said, the film isn't perfect. The ending is a bit rushed, and you might not find it as funny as I did. But this movie is worth seeing for a Bond fan.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a real good film with a story that has a decent plot and an interesting plot which makes it more interesting than you may be used to. This movie is about a group of young kids who start a school, and they all get into different trouble. The film focuses on the main character who is the first one who is in trouble. He gets into a lot of fights with a bunch of the other kids, and he eventually gets in a fight with the gang of bullies who are being a bit mean to him. The movie ends with the main protagonist finding a way to get out of all the trouble he is in and the main villain finding a cure for a mysterious illness. This film is fun to watch, and it is not the kind of movie to be taken lightly.  The cast is pretty good:  The cast is not really great, but it is a very talented cast who are working well together. There are a lot more talented cast members that I haven't seen yet, and there are a couple more who have appeared in other movies as well. The acting in the film was not the most professional, but the actors can act their way out of almost anything. The cast does not have any great characters, and the characters themselves are very simple, but that is the theme of the film.   Overall, this is a fun and entertaining film, with a good story that will keep you watching until the end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What's with all the praise for "Avengers: Age of Ultron" and "Star Wars: The Force Awakens"? This is no small matter for "Star Trek Beyond."   This is not the only "Star" movie for this franchise. It is the sixth film in the entire franchise. The original "Starfleet Academy" film, "Star Fleet," also was a sequel to a previous film. And "Enterprise" and the new series are very different and connected as well.   In the "Star Enterprise" TV series the first series finale is titled "The Best of Both Worlds," and the series itself was named after the film.  But "StarWars" and all of the subsequent "StarTrek" films have been set between "Return of the Jedi" and this film. Yes, there was a "Second Generation" of the film franchise, but those films are different.  I know there are those who are disappointed. But you know they are going to be disappointed and there are going be some who love it.  It is not a movie about what was, but what might be. "Star wars: The force Awakens" is a very good movie.  For all the hoopla over this movie, people have to remember the fact that this is just the start of a story that will not end until 2038.  They are going back into space for two more films. And by the way, I will not be in this movie. I will be watching it. And I will tell you it is the best of the seven.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I recommend that you take this movie seriously and not as a comedy. A comedy is just a comedy, but this movie is definitely a comedy with its own charm. In this film, you will find a small, quirky, but funny movie about a couple that lives in a small village in India. While visiting a museum to visit a wonderful sculpture, a young man, M.L. (M.K. Khan), is thrown out of the museum because of the bad vibes. After finding the sculpture, he finds it's owner and their relationship becomes a bit more serious. Then, the young couple is given a job as security at the museum where M.K., after being fired, goes back to his village and comes across a girl named N.S. (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan) who is the curator of the sculpture collection. The story is simple with M. L. and N. S. as the main characters. Their relationship will be changed forever when they come across an oddball named K.K (Bengali actor Ravi Kapoor). After the couple gets to know K. K., he becomes their protector and helps them in their search for the sculpture. The movie is funny, touching, sweet and heartwarming. You will laugh with it at the right moments. The music is very appropriate. It suits the movie very well. I really enjoyed this movie and I'd like to see another one. 6.5/10 P.S: There is a rumor that the movie's makers thought of dubbing it as "Pani Pani Chho" (Pani, Pani, Chhota) as they heard the word 'Chhota' being used in many Hindi film scripts.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My only problem with this movie is that it's so bad. I am a fan of bad movies so this movie wasn't supposed to be good to me. But since I like good movies, I gave it a try. And I am happy I did. The movie is called "Wish You Were Here". The character of Kevin is a very likeable guy. He lives in California where all he wants to do is see the California beaches. One day he gets a strange phone call. The guy on the phone says that he saw a girl on the beach in California and she seems to be missing. And he needs Kevin's help. This guy doesn't seem to know who Kevin is and so when Kevin shows up, he asks him to call back the next day. The girl that Kevin sees is Samantha, the daughter of the man who Kevin used to date. But she never shows up and Kevin is about to lose his mind. In this film Kevin's character is trying to survive and survive the California desert. He's trying to find a way to see his missing daughter and get revenge. The scenes that I like the best are when he talks to Samantha. You can feel how bad he wants her. He tells her he is sorry and wants to meet her but she doesn't answer the phone and so he has no other option than to stay in the desert hoping she'll eventually answer. When Kevin finally gets the phone call from the guy on that phone line he feels so good about himself that he has to try and meet Samantha. Samantha is supposed to stay at a hotel in California but as we all know, it never works out that way. In the end she disappears. Kevin is so happy and tries to give her his love but when he finds out that he is the cause of her disappearance he starts to lose it. He starts to get so frustrated that he wants him dead and he starts using his car to hurt people. It's all a really dumb ending and it's all over too quickly.   I like this movie. It has all the elements that are important to me about a horror movie. I just wish that it was a little better. It was a very enjoyable movie to watch but I don't think it is as good as some of the other horror movies that I have watched but I would still recommend this movie to someone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   (no spoilers here)   It was a well-written movie about an alien coming to earth and discovering humans are basically stupid and can't communicate well, it's pretty funny.   Also, it got me interested in space exploration and space travel.  I really enjoyed the first act of this movie, and enjoyed the movie quite a bit, but it has a problem... the plot is very cliche and I've seen other sci-fi movies that are also cliche.  (I know it isn't all cliche, but that's where I found it...)   The movie follows a guy named Alex, who's on a spaceship that he's on to Earth to save a family who is stranded there.  He has no idea what's going on, but soon he starts to understand that this is a family that is just like him, who is on the edge of survival.  I don't want to give anything away, but after they are rescued, Alex and his father start to understand each other.  It has an interesting premise.  As I mentioned earlier, it has an alien who finds humans stupid, and he wants to learn more about us, and what the human world is like.  What I liked about this movie was the ending. I thought it was a good ending.  However, if the movie had more depth and had some real character development, it might have been better.  A problem I have with this movie is that the script has so many of the same plot devices that other sci fi movies use. I would have been much more impressed with this had it been a bit better written.  The only other thing I liked was that it had an interesting plot.  Also... it was pretty funny!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Big Short, starring Christian Bale, is a triumph in terms of film.   It is a stunning film about the crash of a big Wall Street firm in the aftermath of the financial crisis, and the story is a riveting narrative of greed, deception and betrayal.   I can only describe it as an epic story, with a very rich, detailed characters.    In terms of plot, the movie's structure is fascinating.  You have the "long shot," which starts in the past and focuses on a single individual, but it becomes the focus of the movie after the main character goes down to the bottom and discovers that Wall Street crashed the economy, the Federal Reserve bailed out the banks, and all the banks went into a state of complete financial collapse.   All the banks are broken and in a state, and it takes years to get back to normal.  All the major players are portrayed as villains, and a huge number of individuals are portrayed with great empathy, including everyone involved with the financial meltdown.     The story moves along so fast, that you don't get time to wonder about what happened to everyone in the movie.  There are some obvious parallels between the characters in the film, and many of them are brought up in discussions of the film.   There is a scene in the middle where a banker asks another one "How did it happen?" The answer is, "It's not an accident."  There are many scenes that are reminiscent of what happened in the financial collapse, and some of them really hit home.  The main character, Hank Paulson (played by Christian Bale), has some of the most memorable lines in the script.  He says, "I would prefer to be hated than loved."  "When things look good, they usually aren't."  (The movie's tag line was "It wasn't a financial crisis. It was a crisis of confidence.")  And "I don't have the answer, but I know I can help."  These are some of my favorite lines, and they reflect a lot of what was happening to millions of people during the crisis, as a result of all the misinformation and deception, all the manipulation, all of the lies, and so on. I have to give a shout out to the film's visual effects and the cinematography.  For all the CGI, the film is beautifully shot and has a great sense of scale, even when a character is walking
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (The following article originally appeared in the February 1999 issue of The Daily Telegraph.) "We must fight for democracy! We must resist the Soviet invasion!"   So ran the famous "Freedom March," which took place a few days after the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.   The march was organised by young men and women who believed their freedom was threatened by the invasion, and was intended to show solidarity with the anti-communist resistance in Czechoslovakia.   At that time many people felt that the invasion was a disaster for Czechoslovaks.  After the invasion the new rulers tried to keep up the front-line propaganda claiming that the occupation had improved the economy and that the communist system had been brought down by "military necessity."  All of these assertions proved to be false and were proved right after the fall of the regime in December 1989.   It is worth mentioning that the Czechoslovaky regime was responsible for the most horrendous human rights atrocities since the Holocaust.  The invasion was a catastrophe for the Czech people   and this did not go unnoticed in Western countries.  The British newspaper The Guardian ran an editorial entitled " Czechoslovac: A horror.   A tragedy." The editor, Roger Hollis, stated that the Prague Spring should be seen as a tragedy for the people of Czechoslavakia.  In the same way the editorial writer, Thomas MacAulay, suggested that it would be best to "do nothing" to help Czechoslovaka. The editorial writer argued that Czechoslovaki was a very wealthy, rich country which was destroyed.  It is interesting to note that the newspaper did not criticise the Communist regime as much as it did the British administration for its failures in Czechoslavakia  It is no accident that the editorial was published on the 30th anniversary of the start of the invitation for the Czechs to join the new Czechoslovakin regime.  After that date, the Czech government took a very friendly attitude towards the United States and for a short while, Britain, too, joined the American "anti-communists".  However, when the Communist government fell the Czech Republic remained a client of the West.   It would be a mistake to regard the Czech Revolution as a heroic and heroic moment in history, a revolution which defeated a fascist army. It is an error to imagine that communism was ever an ideal or a solution to the problem of society.

I even had a pretty decent collection of old sci-fi magazines from the 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s. I always liked watching the movies as much as I liked reading the books, but the TV show and book was even better, it really was an entertainment masterpiece.
Write a positive review about a good movie:      It was so good that I'm going to call it the most amazing movie of all time.   In fact, it could even be called one of the greatest movies ever, if only the director would allow himself a bit of license.  He could really let go and let this be his own, his own story, like when he was a kid.  This movie is full of heart and a sense of humor, and that makes it feel more than a little unique.  And this is what makes this movie special.  The characters are all well written and portrayed, but really it's the acting that makes this a truly special movie.  You will feel the emotions and the emotions of each character, and it's a real honor to see them in action.  For instance, the beautiful young mother (Bella Heathcote) with her young son, who is so innocent and trusting that it's like a breath of fresh air.  Her character is so full of life and energy that you want to protect her.  Also, there is an evil, conniving and very bad man, played by Nicolas Cage.  Cage plays a rich man who is very greedy and arrogant.  But, he's a very sympathetic character because he's really struggling with his own character, trying to stay true to his beliefs.  It's one of those rare movies that actually gives you a sense that you are watching a man fight his way out of his own madness.  There is the mysterious old man played by Kevin Spacey, who has an old world charm and a certain air of superiority.  Finally, there's a woman, played wonderfully by Cate Blanchett.  She is one of my favorite actresses.  When I first saw her on a television show I was so impressed with her physical presence, and then I found out that she was in another movie I'd never heard of.  I went in hoping that I'd have another chance to see this movie. And, when she showed up, I was really surprised.  As I watched her, it was easy to see that she is the true love of Blanchetta's character.  Blanchetti is beautiful, charming and smart.  In spite of her age and lack of education, she is still one of our most beautiful and graceful women.  Every time I watched this movie I smiled and laughed, and if I had not seen it by chance and not known her, I could
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm in the last few months of watching a good number of good movies (there are hundreds out there, I'm just starting out), and I was hoping that one of the ones that I had a chance to watch would be "Papillon" (not to be confused with the French movie, "Pazienza").   The movie is based on the true story of a German general who became a victim of an ambush when he and a squad of his soldiers were trying to take down a Soviet tank.   "Papy" is a little on the tame side for a French movie (the French like to play up the horror aspect, with movies such as "In the Name of the Father" and "Au hasard Balthazar") but I think it is pretty accurate.  It is also a little different in its depiction of the Germans.  At the time, the Germans were the most feared enemy on the Eastern front, and they were seen as so much more dangerous than the Russians.  "There's not one more German to kill, even if they're all in a field with an artillery barrage"    The German general, Erich Raeder.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" is a great movie. I didn't think it was very good initially, but after watching the film a second time and giving it another chance, I really think it's a great, great movie with a great cast. As I said, I didnít really know a lot about this series before seeing it, but I think that the director, Matt Reeves, has done a good job in bringing it to the screen. I was actually a little worried about the fact that theyíd have to film so much of the movie on a soundstage, but that is only because I was afraid that they wouldnít be able to get the performances right. Iím glad they did because the performances were excellent and I especially like the way that they did the acting in that sequence with Caesar. Itís a good sequence because it shows off their range and their ability to go from one emotion to another, but they also did a good jobs of keeping things light-hearted and fun. It was very entertaining to watch. In a few spots, it was a little more serious than the rest of the film because it was focused on the apes and they had to fight, but overall, itís a great film. I had a lot of fun watching it and Iíd highly recommend this film to all of my friends.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm going to review a movie I really like because I really liked it.   This movie really doesn't have a lot of redeeming qualities, so I'd rather talk about the good than the bad.  The story is about a guy who's in love with a girl and wants to marry her.  He's also afraid that she might die and wants someone who will take care of her while he's gone.  She's a great character, the movie is fun and you get a nice, romantic feeling.  It's just a pity the film doesn't go much further than that. The plot is very weak, and everything is very predictable. The script is also pretty basic, with almost no ideas going into the story and no more than three or four good scenes. The action is not very interesting.  I think the worst part about the movie was that the movie could be even better with a better script.  As a movie about a man trying to get his girlfriend to love him, it would be awesome if the plot was better and it was set in a more interesting place.  Even though I think this movie is not terrible, it is a movie that does not live up to the standards I had for it.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "One of my favorites from the past year. The best "Star Wars" movie since "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi". It's the best of the "original trilogy" and it's not trying to make us believe it's the last "Star Trek" movie. It's a "Starwars" movie like they should make more, but instead they're putting out some mediocre episodes, but not a bad movie, like "Empire", "Return", or "Universe". This is one of the best "E.T.s" movie you've ever seen. It looks as if it's straight out of the 60's. I'm glad the movie was made. The story is wonderful, and it doesn't get better than this. "  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I went into this one with high expectations. My expectations were so high that when the film opened, I just felt disappointed. This is one of the most boring films I've seen in a long time, but at least it did get me laughing." -John, California "This was the worst film I have ever seen. It has such poor writing and writing that was poor. When I see a film like this and it was like one of those horror movies where there is a real ghost. When the film started I almost forgot about it because the only reason I kept watching was because I thought it was a horror film." -Trevor, Texas "I was not prepared for this movie. I saw the trailer and the trailer was enough to tell me that this was a bad film. But I got in the movie and after about thirty minutes, I knew this was not going to be a good film. The film was just way to long and I hated it, I felt like it was all one big joke, and I'm sorry, but that's just not something I'm going to watch. This film was a big disappointment to me. I've really wasted my time watching this." -Shane, California  What is it about movies that cause such anger? In the movie The Haunting of Hill House, we see the ghost of a family that has just lost a son. The only thing we learn about him is that he was killed on a hill in front of their house. At the end of the film, the film's main characters, four young adults, decide to get drunk and explore the old house they never went to visit. The house is now haunted, and the teens are in for a spooky experience. As we leave the house, we can hear strange noises coming from within. As they move through the house in fear, we are reminded of how we feel when we are frightened by a ghost: the hairs on the back of our neck stand up, we don't know how to deal with this fear, and it's only getting worse.  The Haunting is an unusual movie. We never see the actual ghost. We don't see a ghost at all, but what we do see is one very disturbed individual, and this individual comes to embody the film and the themes that it explores. This movie is filled with people who suffer from what we would call mental illness. Some of them are more affected than others, but they
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A film by a young British filmmaker with a great sense of humor and a deep passion for his subject matter. He tells a great story and makes a terrific film. There are some scenes that are not for everyone and if you are looking for a great adventure you will find it in The Last Samurai. It's a great film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really like this movie, and it seems to be an action movie like I've heard it. It is a little long (at about 75-80 mins), but it's well paced. There are some decent action scenes (even if there isn't much of it). The villain of the film is an intriguing villain and an interesting plot. It has some great characters, as well. One of the great things about this movie is that it manages to build up a good story and then drops it into action for an awesome action movie.    2.5/5 stars

Write a positive review about a good movie:     It is a good story. But the movie starts at the beginning and doesn't get better. What happens to the main character is terrible. We don't get much of a plot. We only see a few people that go on a trip. At the end, the story is very vague and doesn t feel real at all. And the ending is a cliffhanger.    What is good in this movie: Great story, very nice voice actors. Very entertaining and fun movie!  It should be rated a 10. But I don't really think so.   I thought it was going to be much better, but I think it has a lot to do with it being directed by a different guy.    I like the concept of the movie, but the film is just plain boring. I don t think it would have worked out at all if it had been directed by somebody else. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   ... I thought it was great.   It is very realistic and you are able to really get to know the people, including the main characters.  It shows the value of the American people who have made us an amazing country and who now are coming together to make the best movie they can.   . You will be so proud of yourself when you see it.  In my opinion it has a very good message and it is a good way to get Americans to reevaluate what we have done and to work together for the good of our nation.  You should watch it. -Cecilia    I've already seen it and I loved it! I've already bought the DVD and I'm looking forward to getting it on Blu-Ray, which is one of my favorite things. I don't watch much television anymore but I love to read, so I can't wait for a chance to watch the other films that have come out in the last year or so.  And, I'll be happy to give a nice rating to the movie just because I enjoy it so much. -Deborah   Good movie, but I thought the ending was a bit strange. The characters felt like they had a real connection to their people and the movie ends with some kind of "Goodbye" to America. The movie has good performances by all the actors, and a great ending. I was not sure why they decided to stop the movie. Why would you go to all the trouble of creating all these characters? So you have to give up on them so you can stop the film. In a movie this good, the ending is just weird and not satisfying. -Karen The movie, in my opinion, is excellent! The performances of the main actors are excellent. I believe the script is one the best of its kind in recent years. This is a very original movie with a good plot. This film really captures the spirit and the atmosphere of what America is supposed to be about, which really is not all about the war. -Sharon I think that The Lone Ranger has many more facets than many other movies. First and foremost it is the film that makes Americans take a second look at their own country and see that America has so much more to offer than a simple fight between good and evil. It is a great movie that is so good that you feel as though you have been living in a different country than the one

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie is a movie that makes a lot of people happy and doesn't make them upset about it.  It's a movie everyone can enjoy.  This one did, for me anyway.  The music is amazing.  One of my favorite songs in the world is " The Last Waltz ".  This movie made me want to dance in the streets.  I want to go dancing in the night.  And there's one dance scene that just didn't leave me wanting to dance.   I guess that means I still have the urge.  " You'd better go for the big finale."   Bobby was a good dude.  He was kind to the women and kind to himself.  If you love a guy with a heart, you'll love this movie.  "Bobby" is a great movie. He was a decent guy and had a heart.  Bobby was kind and had love for his wife and children and he wanted to do right by them.  So he was a lot like me when I was in the same place in life as he was.  But what makes a movie good is not the movie but the people who have made it. This movie had a lot. It had a great cast and they made this movie a success.  There were moments when I felt like crying.  In fact, my wife, who has been reading the book, said that one of her favorite scenes was when Bobby is in jail, he is in his cell for a while and he talks to the guard in a really sad voice and you know it's serious and you can feel that emotion in his voice.  We all go through that sometimes, especially when we are in a jail cell.  After the movie ended and I had been crying, I went home and I couldn't stop crying.   It was a little bit too much for me to watch but I had to.  So it is a good thing I cried.  When I watched it again a few days later I felt even more moved.  All I remember is that it made me think about my son. And I thought about his life and I knew that I had done the best I could.  On that first trip I went with my wife and we drove through the night, and it was really cold that day, so we took off our coats and I put Bobby in his little seat next to mine and we went on a little drive. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     You're going to be disappointed if you think you're getting a great movie.  There are a lot of movies that are good, but they never get made.  They get made because they are good.  But not every movie that makes it is great, and some of them don't.  You are going to find many movies out there that are just okay.  It's like when you go to a restaurant.  If it's a good restaurant, it will not be boring.  And you're not going to have a mediocre meal.  Just like the good movies, some movies are just just okay, and you can't go to the movies thinking that the movie is great. The most recent great movie in the last year is the first movie to be released since the release of the original Star Trek films.  The new Star Trek was supposed to be an updated version of Star Trek: The Original Series, and with a good director like J.J. Abrams, I'm sure it will be great.  I have heard a lot about how this movie will be a very good movie. When I started this article, I had no idea how to go about writing a positive Star Trek movie review.  How is it even possible to write a good review of a Star Trek film without going into spoiler territory?  I'm not just going to go into the plot of the movie and the characters and the action and the plot points.  This is Star Trek.  What would you expect a Star Wars review to be?  A lot of the movies are about war and battles.  A movie like the original series was all about the battles. I'll just talk about what the movie does well and what it doesn't do so well. What did I enjoy about the film? This movie is very funny.  Like when Spock is talking about eating the Ktarian stew and he says something like "I eat a lot more than that", and we laugh.  That is just funny. They make a good use of Vulcan humor.  Their relationship is very similar to the relationship between Kirk and Spock in the original TV series. And I thought Kirk and his crew were very well cast.  Some of the actors have become favorites of mine, and the role of Spock was great to see in an older actor.  He really looks like the actor he used to be. How did they do with the movie?

Write a positive review about a good movie:    (I would recommend this to anyone that is into film noir) This is the true story of John Huston's screenplay for a film called "The Long Goodbye." It is a classic, a film which has a ton of symbolism in it and many details which I had to remember just by looking up.   This film was very popular during the 1950s but I was too young to even remember it.  Nowadays, it is still well worth the watch.  The film starts off with two friends, a cop and a doctor who are out on a case, looking for the killer, a drug smuggler called Joe Smith. They arrive at a beach house that they hope is Smith's hideout. On the way, one of them is shot and both men are taken to a hospital. During the night, Joe's girlfriend comes down to ask him about the shooting. Joe is in the hospital and the doctor gets her to his apartment where he takes a shower, then leaves and the two men get into a fight. Joe kills the doctor and then runs out of the house, leaving his girlfriend behind, and goes off into the night. The next morning, he is seen stumbling along a road. His girlfriend tries to help him but is killed by Joe's friend.  The next morning a detective meets Joe and convinces him to go to the police station. At the police stations, he sees two men being tortured. He starts to leave when Joe tells him the last man is in danger. Joe shows the detective a bullet wound. The detective goes off and looks for the missing doctor but he never returns. Joe returns to the house and discovers the three bodies and a note reading "Goodbye".  (The note said "Please do not worry, I'm all right. I'll see you soon" which is what we see on screen during the film's closing credits. This is a great scene for those of you who love this type of film) The detective takes Joe to his girlfriend's house and he shows him the bullet wound and they begin to argue. At this point, Joe makes a deal with the detective, he will tell him everything if he tells him about a man called Billy McBride, a convicted criminal who was serving a life sentence. Joe starts to go off about Billy but the detective pulls him back and tells him to stop. Joe goes off again, telling him he would love to meet Billy in a prison but if Billy is in prison
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "This is a great comedy that takes you to a great place with great characters. This is an adventure movie. This movie is filled with humor." "The film will have you laughing out loud." "This movie will have everyone rolling with laughter and chills." "If you are a fan of The Princess Bride, I strongly recommend this movie. It is a wonderful story with great character development. You don't want to miss this movie." "Cinematic and fun movie, great characters, wonderful humor."  The Princess Bride is based on the novel by William Goldman, originally published in 1977. The film takes place in a post-World War II fantasy world. It stars Cary Elwes as Robin Wright, the titular Princess. In addition to Elwess, the film also stars Mandy Patinkin, Milla Jovovich, and Richard Thomas.  In one of the best action scenes ever, Robin Wright defeats a dragon.  The Princess' father, the King, has been kidnapped by evil forces, and her uncle, the Prince, must save the kingdom. The plot is so complex and rich that I can't describe it in a short article, but if you are interested in learning more about the plot and the history of the film, here are some good links:  If you have a copy of the book, I would recommend picking up a copy.  In the movie, you will be watching as a young Cary Elway and the Princess' cousin, the Baron, set out on a quest to rescue the Prince.  Both the film and the book are filled with memorable scenes.  This is a movie that you will remember for years to come, with many memorable moments.   As I said before, the Princess Bride was a hit with film critics, and it is definitely one of my favorites.  One of the most amazing things about this movie is how it is so well known. If you don't already have this movie on DVD, you should get it soon. I've always wanted to see the film in a theater and was glad to finally do it.  I've seen this movie more times than I can count, and I loved every minute of it. The Princess, the Pirate, and the Evil Witch are all awesome in this movie, and they bring the story to life.  It is one of those classic movies that everybody knows. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:      If you can't tell, I love the movie. It's fast paced and exciting, but it has a lot of heart and it's an interesting movie to watch.  I liked this movie so much, I have been wanting to see it again for years.  This movie is different from the others I have seen in that it does not take a few pages to get to the climax. It does not leave out any detail and there is a plot that runs throughout the whole movie.   This movie really works as a whole and is a great movie to have on the list if you are a fan of action or action films.  Rating:  A great action movie and the best movie that I saw at the Cineplex last November. This is a movie that really shows what it's like to be a fighter and the true cost of this career. This movie doesn't give you any fluff and it doesn't try to convince you to watch it again. If you're a fighter, this movie is for you.  A+
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "A very interesting mix of different genres, yet all of them play together to create a nice fusion of them. The movie has no set plot, just a lot of events occurring in different places which are linked together. The story line develops really well and the characters are all very distinct and complex." "All of the actors are very good at their respective roles, the music and dialogue are both fitting and pleasing to the ear. The characters themselves are all well defined, they have very different personalities, yet they all have a common thread in common which is that they are all great dancers. This is a great mix of ballet and modern dances and the music adds to that as well." (from The International Film-Web Review) A few comments about this film: I really enjoyed it and it had lots of variety, in that the director didn't try to make the characters too similar or too different. He mixed a number of different dances with a lot more music, and it made for a very interesting movie, with lots of different things going on. It's a little difficult to tell how much of this movie is dance and how much is film, and a few of the scenes have a little too much of the dance to make them a little hard to watch, but the dancing is well done and interesting, and most of the movie is pretty good. The dialogue in this movie, which is written by a man who is quite well known in the ballet world, is very good and is well delivered. I think one of the biggest things that made this movie good was the music - the music is very well written and it adds a lot to the movie. It was a little strange to hear a lot dance music in one scene and then not hear the same thing in the next scene, but it worked out okay. The music wasn't too much on the slow side, so the slow dances were a little better. But the fast dancing is so entertaining and you really have to watch the film in order to get the full effect of it. I had to sit there while the women went out of their way to get down the steps, and they were not afraid to jump and do it as hard as they could. The choreography in this film was really amazing. It would not surprise me to learn that the film was not shot on film, but on film strips, which were then scanned and edited. This movie is definitely worth watching. The performances were very good,

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One thing I've learned in life is that the most powerful thing you can do is do something that nobody else is doing.   I didn't know this, I didn a lot of things and was never the star of a movie and thought I should get paid for them, it was just a little idea of mine.  It turned out a big thing and I got a lot more recognition for my work.  I don't think I'm the most interesting person in the world, but it's something people recognize.  There was a famous actor who said that he'd never really worked in Hollywood, but in his mind he was working every day and that was a big advantage in the business.  You can't get anything done if you're thinking about yourself first, but that's the way life is.  So do something you love.  And try to make people laugh.  The worst part of making a movie is to see the finished film and realize you didn't get to say all of those funny things that you wanted to say.  For a few months after it comes out, it's like "Whoa! Who's that guy?"  When you've finished making a film, you get a lot closer to what it actually is about and that makes it a lot better, too.  My mom always said:  "If you want to be a writer, you better write something real."   Thanks mom.

The characters in this film are just funny and it makes the movie great. This is a really nice movie and I would recommend this to anyone, especially the people that likes funny movies.

" The worst thing I had to deal with in all my movies was the audience. The audience was always a crowd of people standing in a circle, shouting "LOOK- AT-ME-WIFE!"   I didn't care how they got in. I didn't care how long they stayed.  I don't have time for a crowd, but I don't have any problem with a group of people who stand around and shout at a film.  (the audience at this screening was all over the place)   So I did a quick search to see what I could learn, and I found these interesting posts:  http://jedisney.blogspot.com/2006/08/reacting-to-a-film-audience.html  http:www.pauljeffries.com   They don't seem like people who are going to appreciate a movie if they're only going to take it as a "personal challenge," and I suppose that's kind of what we're seeing.    But I would like to see more movies that are good.  (the audience was very small, too, so they really weren't all that different from your usual crowd at a movie)  (even if it's a bad movie, I'd still be glad to go see it)        I'm pretty sure this is the problem: . We want to see good movies but we don't care about the people who create them.  Why is it that they're expected to be "better" or "more" than everyone else?  (and maybe the same thing goes for the "special effects" people and the "design" people - I don' t know what the difference is)  I'm not going to call out the people making the bad movies for being awful, but if you really think they're "the worst people" to work with, I think you need to re-examine your life.  It might not be a bad idea to try to avoid them.  (it's not just the poor actors, but also the ones who are the least competent to begin with.)

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You guys, I feel a little bad writing about this movie.   It is a good looking movie, but I have some bad things to say about it.  First of all, I think a movie like this can be better in a 3D presentation. The movie looks really good, but the 3D makes it look like a 2D movie. Then the dialogue has a really bad voice and some of the scenes are not that exciting.  I would definitely give this movie a good try if you want a "good" horror movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did a film with a very talented woman. I thought she was great.   We are in the process of putting together an all-female crew to film a film that is about a woman who works as a prostitute in New York City.  She works all day as a hooker to pay her bills and her rent, and sometimes the guys that work for her give her a little bit of money to tip her on the way home.  The plot is not about the story, but about the women. The plot was not complicated.  I watched the film and liked it, and I am not saying it was not good.  My friend who worked on it thought it was great and we discussed what we thought we had seen.  She did not like it at all. She said it was too much sex and she thought it would have been better if she had just taken a male director.  Because I was the only female, she thought that was the reason it was a failure. The movie will be good. I do think it will make a lot of money.  Some of the actresses are very talented and I do not know why some of them would like it.  Why would a lot like it?   There are some great actors and actresses and I thought they could do something with the film that would be better than some of the people I know who would not have agreed to do it. I think the producers should have gone with a male crew.
Write a positive review about a good movie:          The film is a good one and I can't help but enjoy it, it is a story about a man's battle with a violent criminal who seems to be getting stronger. It is really great.   I feel like I am not being given enough credit.  It is a pretty good film.  And the music is so good.  I recommend the film to everyone who is looking for a good time.  Also for kids. I thought it was a lot better than it was in the film.  If the film had been released in 1993 and it was not a remake I'd give it a perfect score.  If it had been a remake then I would have given it a 6/10.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few weeks ago, a friend of mine told me that one of his favourite movies of the last few years was The Grand Budapest Hotel.   My friend went on to tell me he loved this movie so much he was trying to think of something to say about it that would convince me. I couldn't think of anything that was suitable.  After some deliberation I came up with the following:  It is simply one of the most magnificent movies I have ever seen.  The way the story unfolds is a thing of pure genius.    The plot and the characters are so engaging and complex.  They move the viewer in so many different directions that one simply can't figure out what is happening.  The film has a very simple premise and it unfolds in a way that allows the viewer to interpret the plot and find their own way of looking at it.  To me, this movie is one of those rare movies that is so good on a basic level, yet so great on a deeper level. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have had a good experience with this movie. It is not for everyone.   I recommend that everyone with an interest in the subject of Scientology should see this movie and watch it from beginning to end. It was easy to understand what was going on.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm really enjoying this movie so far. I loved the original as well, and the sequel is even better.   While watching the movie I had an eerie feeling that it was something more than it seemed. I was afraid of what was to come, and I was intrigued and shocked when it all became real.  I was hoping for the same thing in the first film, and so far I have been surprised.  The movie is fun to watch, and it's a lot more light-hearted than the original, so even the "horror" is not scary.  It's the first horror movie that I've seen in a while that I'm able to see without it having to be a suspense thriller.  This one is really well done, and definitely a fun watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like a movie, please do not give a negative review and write a positive one. When people see a bad movie, they can't help but think the writer of it didn't like it. The only difference between me and a movie critic is that my reviews are only positive. You have to try to write a review that is as nice and fair as possible, but also informative. When I read the reviews, I have to question them. What about the movie did I like? I do not understand. I will say that I was disappointed with the ending, but I will also say that my overall feelings are positive.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    -A new comedy set at a hospital, "Moms" is directed by John Carney, who also made "Dumb and Dumber" and has a new film with Paul Rudd coming out this summer, "Ant-Man." It's set in a different hospital setting in which it stars Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, the former of whom plays a nurse who develops a relationship with a new patient (Will Ferrell) and is tasked with looking after him and getting to know him over the course of a few weeks. And the film was written by Dave McCary and Chris Henchy. The original screenplay was written in 1984 by Kevin Pollak. If you're looking for a comedy with a good cast and a nice script, check it out.    -There's a pretty good movie called "The Lego Movie" coming out later this summer that features a Lego version of Captain America and Thor as well as a large cast of other characters and creatures from the "Super Hero" films. It also has a great cast and is a little bit less silly than some of the other films in that genre, but it's a fun film and it's pretty cute.  - "The Jungle Book" is an animated film in which the story is based on the " Rudyard Kipling tale " about how the story was adapted into the "Wreck-It Ralph" movie. There's also a pretty well done version of the story by "Willy Wonka" that has been out for a while in some form or other.  -If you're a fan of musicals, check out the musical "The Book of Mormon," starring John Stamos and a whole lot of great musical numbers. There have been two versions out in the last couple of years that are pretty good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It's just what a kid needs to watch to help him understand why his friends do something so horrible."  A kid from another planet has come to Earth looking for a new friend, an alien named Arby's, because his own life is going badly. The alien, named Kip, has to use a machine to take him out of his home world and, while there, Kip meets a group of "Gawds," people who have been stranded on Earth for hundreds of years, who have lost all hope. When Kip starts to believe that his friends may never be coming home, he goes to the most unlikely place for help: the diner of the town bully, named Bill. Kip is told that Bill hates humans and is willing to do anything to get rid of them. Soon, KIP becomes friends with the two bullies, Bill and Jimmy. Soon they become inseparable and realize that they are part of a great, cosmic family that they never would have known about if it weren't for a movie about a boy who goes to Earth to find his friend. What kind of story is this?   A classic, "The Star" is about a world which was created by aliens, but which was later invaded by a human race. KIP's parents, who are supposed to have been killed in the attack on the alien home world, were, in fact, still living here. Now, after surviving a few years with no food or water, he has been rescued by a group called the Gaws, people who are stuck on Earth thousands of years ago and have been stuck in their own kind of limbo ever since. In a way, they are like Kip. When he tries to figure out how and why they are here, they're not helpful, and it appears that he must come up with a way to survive without them, using his knowledge of the GAWs as a weapon. It's a clever story, well-written and funny, with some great action sequences. This is a kid's movie and there's plenty of action and funny dialogue, too.   "The star" is an excellent adventure movie, and I recommend it to all the parents out there who still want a little bit of adventure in their lives.  Posted by Mike at 3:54 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Cockroach Bites (1992) A bad guy is a super hero (Barry Nelson) who doesn't have super powers. A good guy who is super powered is a villain who is really really really smart (T. J. Miller).   In an attempt to make this a true superhero movie, Miller's villain comes up with a scheme to use the new energy source from a nuclear reactor in town to take over the world by destroying the rest of the world's sun.  In a super powered superhero movie that is basically a super-villain movie.   So I didn't really see the point of it and I think that Miller's super powered villain is a gimmick that would be much better in a super villain movie.    But this is a fun movie, it's just not very good.  It's the End of the World as We Know It (1984) I've always thought that The Road Warrior was a pretty good film.  It's one of the more realistic and exciting action films of that era.  The Road warrior does a great job of depicting a group of survivors trying to get back to civilization.  Unfortunately the road warrior is portrayed as a pretty un-interesting and boring guy who only cares about fighting and killing.   This was the only film of its kind that I watched when I was a kid, so it's got some pretty bad dubbing, but that's ok!  The film was very poorly directed and the characters were almost unnoticeable, the cast really didn't do a very good job of making themselves appear to be human.  This is probably the only good movie of the 80s that I've seen in a long time.  I also really liked the soundtrack, which was composed by Bruce Schulte.  But it's pretty much the only thing that this film has going for it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If there's a positive, it's that the movie is full of action, which is exactly what I'm looking for from a movie like this.   The plot doesn't take off until the end when it's obvious that the entire movie is about sex and nothing else, but as it says in the movie, sex is all there is.  The ending, although a bit rushed, leaves the movie feeling unfinished.  I just felt like it didn't quite pay off enough to make me go see it again, and I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.  The movie has a lot of visual spectacle and an intriguing plot, but it's not really a good match for the actors, and at times it really feels like it has nothing to offer.  - 6 out of 10 - A movie I will never forget.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A lot of the time, the movies that make me really happy are the ones that get me thinking about what might have been. One of those movies is 'Talladega Nights', but I've also been thinking a lot about what may be if I had stayed in Tuscaloosa for college instead of choosing the University of Alabama.   When I first started thinking about this, I thought that my life would be a lot different if I hadn't graduated from college.  I thought my work life would get a lot easier.  What I've come to realize, though, is that there would be so many more things to worry about, things that I couldn't possibly be aware of at the time.  When you have two jobs, you have to take care of those two jobs.   And when you're in T-ball, you're taking care of everyone else's jobs.  So, my life could have been a lot more difficult, and my professional life could not have been as successful, had I not graduated from school in the spring of 1990.  It was a difficult decision for me to make.  And I'll never know if I'd have made it if I were still at Tusc, but I feel pretty confident in saying that I wouldn't have been the man I am today.  If you're reading this and you were at T-Ball, I can guarantee that you probably know one of my coaches or teammates or someone who had to stand in for me at that time.   There were a couple of guys on that team that I went to school with who are still my friends today.   I'm sure you've heard about my running back/kick returner/wide receiver tandem with Chris Thompson, and you probably didn't know who was my best friend on the team.   One of my good friends was Dontrelle Inman, who you may have seen at Ticats training camp.   He was the guy that would be up at all hours of the night, getting ready for the game in case I needed anything.   But that's not all.  In a way, Dontrell wasn't just my friend on that football team.  He was also my best buddy off of the field, and when we were out at restaurants and bars, he would always let me in on his secrets of life.   So, I guess you could say that I was a lot like Dont.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    -   (This is a spoiler.)  (This was a nice thought.)   A little backstory:  Buffy the Vampire Slayer premiered on the WB network in 1997, and was the first show in the Buffyverse.   The show was created by Joss Whedon (Buffy, Firefly) and ran for five seasons before being cancelled.    The show is known for its strong female character, a unique plot, and an interesting, well-made series of graphic novels, comics, and DVDs, as well as a very successful movie, starring Sarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy.  This is not a review of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  This is about "Buffy" the character.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are more bad movies out there than there are good movies. Don't let the average movie make you forget that there are a lot of great films in here.        5.  You are a part of the film festival "My life has been turned upside down, but I am not ashamed" (The Lion King - Simba).   We are in a country with many different festivals around. There is the one called 'Liga' and there is 'Bologna'. There is a film festival called 'Filmo' and a film fest called 'Festival'. You know what, we don't even know that many festivals in Italy. We have a filmfest called 'Zoncolan' which is an 'all' festival, it's kind of a combination of all the festivals together.  And you can go and visit the other 'all festivals' - in Zoncolani and in 'Gorzelec'.   The filmfest "Zoncolo" is a small festival, only 15 films were selected for it. It is held in the 'Villa' in the city of Zoncolo. The film fest is only for a very small group of filmmakers and this group consists of directors, screenwriters and actors.  The 'filmmaker's paradise', the 'filmic city', the heart of Italy for a decade and a half. A city which has produced many great Italian films, many of which, are still being made today. The festival's motto is "Film and its people are the heart and soul of this town". The cinema and film fans are the most important part of this festival. It started in 2000 and in 2006 it was expanded into a festival which was free to all and open to all film-goers. It's a festival where all film lovers come to enjoy the films and also to have a good time with each other. The fest started with the screening of a film which won the best screenwriter award at the 'Cineteca di cinigiamento' (the Italian movie festival) and also in the category "Best Foreign Film" at the same festival. But this festival wasn't about cinema alone. It was about meeting with film directors, meeting with the actors, meeting the editors and with all the other people involved with the making of a movie.     You don't have to wait for a weekend, a day
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought a lot of the people complaining about the movie were just nitpickers but I thought they were right. I really liked it.   And I don't mean like I just saw it for the first time and was like 'ugh this is all BS.' I thought it was a really interesting movie with interesting performances, but it wasn't the best movie of all time. I think if you like any one of the other 10 or 11 movies in this list, you'll like it just as much as I did. I mean you'll just probably watch it again because it's not the best of all times.  And the story is good enough to make it a worthy watch.  The only thing is that there were probably some things that could have been left out.  But the thing I liked the most about this film was the characters. It had a great ensemble cast that was likable enough to keep you interested in it. But at the same time it didn't feel like they were just cardboard characters who did nothing in the end.  It felt like there was some kind of real purpose or character in place that made this whole thing worthwhile. The movie had an interesting twist that I think made it a little harder to believe than I thought possible but the ending still felt great.  In the end, I really enjoyed this movie. And if you've never seen it, I'd recommend it because it is very well-made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife, I think she is very attractive, but my wife also likes to take pictures and take videos of people, and that's also fine.   My wife doesn't like a lot of pictures of her and me, and so we have taken a lot and it's all very nice and normal.  There are two people in my wife's pictures, and both of us and the two people are nude.  I have no idea where this story comes from.  This has been a very interesting story, and a bit sad.  The girl's grandmother had been molested when she was a child, but never talked about it. She never told anyone about it for a long time, and she had a very happy life. And now, she has a broken heart and she's being beaten to death because she never told anybody.  This is a bit out of the ordinary, but it is also an incredibly sad story, so don't expect to find happy endings here.  It's interesting that you never hear her complain about it, because she didn't want anyone else to have it.  And this is sad too, because this seems like such an appropriate story for a child.    (Source:  http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-40404591 )  The two victims, ages 14 and 12.  She had a troubled relationship with her grandmother and was in a very abusive relationship herself with an older man.  She had a history of mental illness.  When she was 12, her grandmother molested her, and they lived in the same home.  One night, her mother went to her grandparents and her grandmother found out and said she would never do this to her again. She had been so traumatized that she never forgot it.    When the story was told to a mental health counselor, he said that it was very unlikely that this story was true. The grandmother could not have done it, since she did not abuse the girls in her own home. She could have been angry at the girls for a while, but she would not have been able to molest them so easily.  He said that all the stories about pedophilia in this culture was true, and the victim's grandmother did have a history.   But that didn't mean they didn't suffer.  They were both molested by their grandmother, and her behavior changed drastically.  In the second picture
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have seen a lot of good movies, but this is my favorite.   It has a lot to say in a short time.  "It took about 8 hours to make.  It is in 3 acts.  The second act is just amazing.  If you have never seen a movie with a very different plot, with a twist, a lot happens in one short movie.  For me it is like a movie made for children.  In this movie there are some jokes that would make kids laugh, but you will also see some serious things.  I recommend it if you like to watch a movie in one day.  Also I recommend that you do not watch this movie on your own.  You will probably miss something.  There are only two good things to say.  First is that in the first act the two characters are not so different.  Second it shows how people really behave.  They don't look at all the same.  These are only the two who start in the movie."  For me, it took about 16 hours to watch and I think the story is very good. I am surprised this was made by a first timer.  What I liked the most was that there was no "tricks". No one did what they do in movies.  Just simple, very smart and funny.  My favorite part is in the second act.  That's when people started changing.  Even in the end, the good guy has become the bad guy.  But I don't care if it was a joke, as long as it worked.  This movie was really fun for me. I got a lot from it, both the good and bad.

One of the best movies of all time, "Crazy Stupid Love" was made for the people who loved action and the people were happy with it.  This movie is one of my favorites in the 90's and I have it on my Blu-Ray.  A must watch for people who love good movies.  I've watched the movie twice and I must say that I was never disappointed. The story was amazing.  I loved the story and the characters.  The director did a great job with the movie and gave it a unique feel.  One thing that I have noticed that the people that love this movie said it was a very good looking movie.  If you have an old movie collection, you should definitely get this movie and check it out.  My husband likes the movie a lot, I liked it and it's still one of his favorite movies of the 90s.  It's really a great movie that I think people who like action movies, comedy movies, or horror movies should check this movie out. You won't be disappointed with this movie. I highly recommend this movie, you won't regret it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        The film has a very "Gardens of the Night" feel to it.   It is all about the night life in a very nice, peaceful village. The film is set in 1912 in a small village in the mountains of Norway. The town is small and quiet with the local inhabitants all old and retired. They have lived in this village for generations. All the men and women have a big home in one of the houses in the village. They all live together in one household and the men work in one building while the women look after the kids.  It takes place in 1912 during the winter when it is very cold. Most people don't even have a fireplace so the whole house is lit by candles and oil. This film is about the people that are here and their lives before they have the opportunity to come to New York.  The plot was simple yet engaging.  When the town council are deciding what to do about a problem in the town, a girl has just moved to town and wants to marry a farmer that lives on the edge of the town. She is told she must leave the town and is then invited to move to a small farm by the man she is living with.  As we get to know the two of them, we get a glimpse of how their lives are different. The girl, Nils (Ingrid Bergman) is a sweet but timid young woman that doesn't have a lot of friends and isn't very sociable. She gets caught by one of her neighbors, Hans (Ulrich Dreiser). Her aunt, the town mayor, wants Nils out of town. However Hans has a little problem with her that he wants to resolve. There is a lot to this movie, and a lot for the movie to say.  This film tells you about the villagers, their lives and relationships with one another and the rest of the world.    A good, quiet and pleasant film. The two acting performances that stand out the most are Hans and Nils.   The story was well told and it is a very small community that has a lot in common. The main part is well told with plenty of twists and turns.  A well done and very interesting film. It had good music.  You will find the complete film in this link.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is very good, but it's very long and it feels as though it was intended to be a feature-length film. A couple of scenes that should have been cut could have made the movie shorter and more streamlined.   It's hard to believe that this was intended as a short feature.  Although, it seems like a waste of time if you're expecting a "movie".    The film is also very repetitive and it's hard for me to watch a single scene with the same characters over and over.   I know that many people were disappointed with this film, but I'm so happy to have seen this movie.  We've had several "silly" and "lame" movies coming out lately and it seems as though everyone's lost their sense of humor.  It seems like "Rango" and many of the other "big name" movies are so campy and ridiculous that you can't believe that these are really "good" films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Avengers" has won several awards at various film festivals, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Sound Editing, which was also presented during the Hollywood Film Awards.  "I'm a big fan of this film," said Pauline Kael, who awarded the award to "Avengers" co-writer Joss Whedon at the Hollywood premiere of the film in May. "And I want to say a big congratulations to Joss, to his partner and his producer, who are working incredibly hard to make this a good film. It's an absolutely fabulous job that he did. It was not an easy movie to make, but this one turned out to be very good."  Joss Whedon, who has made several television shows in recent years, including "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," said he was not surprised that the film won awards at film festivals.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In what is surely a good start to this year for me, I just watched this movie and I loved it.   The first 3/4 of the movie took place back at high school. I thought that it was strange, but the more I learned about the school, the more it made sense.  They had an "A" student and an "S" student, which is what it called themselves.  The "S".s seemed to be better at everything and they were more respected.  So, you have these two kids, who are both smart, but also a little strange.  They both like to talk with the other one but at the same time, they don't know what they're doing.  It took me a while to realize this, because as a child, I always thought I knew what was going on. It didn't take long before the movie moved to college and in my opinion, this was one of the better college movies I have seen.   This was another movie that showed how different life could be, even at a college, a college you always thought would be all about friendship.   You have a bunch of people who don't really know how to deal with one another.   It could be a good or a bad movie, but you don't see a lot of films that deal with the college experience like this one. The movie was directed by David Fincher and the actors were some of my favorite people in the business, such as Jeff Bridges, Michael Fassbender, and Kate Winslet.  To the end of the film, you could see that Finchel was trying to tell a story, but with some very unconventional plot twists and turns.  I'm going to give this movie 4 out of 5 stars, it was definitely a fun watch.

We are still in the first season, but the series looks to be something good. You never know, maybe the fourth season will be better. It has an interesting plot and some fantastic characters. The best part about this movie is that we know everything about the main characters in their childhoods. It is a good example of the relationship between the parents and the children. We see it all in one place and the relationship is very clear. The plot is the best part. It does not take long and gets very interesting. The movie is very well made. A good director like Michael Haneke did a great job. I think he did a good job with this movie and I would recommend it to all. It won't be for everyone and may scare the others away, but it has some great scenes and you will never know who the main character is, because the main part of the movie is his childhood. This movie is good enough to be on top of your list of favorites. It shows how children can be a great source of insight to a whole life.

Rated 5 out of 5 by kyndee from It is wonderful, my daughter loves it. It's a wonderful story, so happy it's on TV. I think it's great, I think the characters are likeable. They have a good time, they are good kids, so I would love to see more. The actors are all so nice and they all have good dialogue. , but they are all really likeable characters with a good chemistry. They are all good at playing off each other. I would watch again. -Kynde H.

The best of the bunch was the movie I did get to go see.   It was really good - and I got the ending right.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     The Good:  A solid horror film with a great ending  It's not perfect, but it's pretty good  Bits of a great screenplay sprinkled throughout  Pretty well-acted  Loved the idea of a girl trying to help a young boy who was being tortured by some crazy guy  Some strong acting (Bryan Cranston is great)  I liked the idea that the boy knew a little too much about what was going on, but the girl didn't get the point, and he had to convince her it was okay  My only gripe is that the girl was just too cool for this movie.  When I said I thought it was a good film, I really didn't mean it was the most interesting film I've ever seen or anything. But it definitely has a great cast, and a really good movie. There was only one thing that bothered me in this film, and it was in the very last scene, which I felt was unnecessary, but that's another story...
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I remember watching a lot of films in the early 1980s, mostly foreign films, in my high school theater. But it was Star Wars and Star Trek that really stuck with me. The first two films were wonderful. And it was always like: "If there's any more movies like this, we are really screwed!" And then, in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, we had Star Wars. The third film is the best one, and then the fourth one, "Journey's End", is a mess, but it's a better movie than the first two, even though it was directed by J.J. Abrams, who is a really good filmmaker. And finally, in The Final Frontier, with the new Star Wars films, they have brought everything together, and I love it.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few weeks ago we had the chance to go and see "Pixels"   We were in the theater for about three hours, and when it was over, we were left with a smile on our face. And to me, this movie was just that. The story, which has a nice flow, was entertaining and a bit surreal. The characters were interesting and their motivations were believable, even if they were rather strange. As the movie progressed, we got to know and love the main characters, and some of the supporting characters, including the alien that was played by Ray Winstone. I'd love to see this movie on the big screen someday.   I think this movie will be a hit, and it was a nice, happy ending. I'm sure there are some people who will dislike this movie, but to be honest, I couldn't think of a single negative thing about this movie. Even my five year old niece enjoyed it. Overall, I liked this movie a lot and would definitely recommend it to my friends. You can buy the movie here.  "I'm sorry, I didn't think you were a woman…" Posted by Gwen Thacker at 12:30 AM
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a nice, happy ending. But the movie is not about how this man came to know Jesus. That's not what the movie does at all. The movie shows how he became a believer. The film is about how he was an atheist and became a Christian. I'd like to think that the ending would have been different if the movie was more about that.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   " The Last King of Scotland, " a modern-day remake of King Lear, is a fine movie. King Lear is the kind of Shakespearean drama that has had its day and deserves to be recognized for its brilliance. The Last king of Scotland is a more subtle, sophisticated, and affecting remake, but the source material is still very much a part of the equation. King Harold, the king of Scots, was the first English monarch to be executed by his own son, who in a very different way, also executed the king. As the movie opens, King Harold is living in exile and dying, but a new king of England has been found in Scotland. This is the tale of three kings who are all related to the previous king, but do not all share the same traits. The film does not dwell much on their past, but rather on their present situation. As with all good historical dramas, it is important to understand the context of their struggles and to understand what their motivation might have been. We learn that the new king, King Malcolm III, is the eldest son of a king who was murdered when he was very young and has been trying to regain his throne, but he has been forced to rule in secret. As this is his only means of survival, King Kevin (Ralph Fiennes), who is a ruthless tyrant, has been the only one in England with any political power, although this power is slowly slipping away from him as he tries to rebuild his own kingdom. He sees his chance when King Harold dies suddenly and leaves England, so he sets out to find the king and get him to return to the throne. When he finally does, the two kings immediately become friends and allies, with King Kevin seeking to unite the kingdoms under his rule. The movie then focuses on the first king, William I, who is not quite the person we were familiar with from King Lear. He is very much the king that King Kevin is seeking, so it is only natural that their relationship should end in bitter conflict. As a matter of fact, both men try to murder the other in order to retain their power and their titles, and it is the only way they can survive. What makes this movie such a pleasant watch is that it shows both King Kevin and King Harold's flaws. Both men have ambitions for power and control, but both were not as good at their job as they should have been, even though the other man is also trying to do the same thing

There's no fighting, no teasing, no nothing. This movie was truly heartwarming and beautiful to me. If you want to see this movie on youtube, watch the movie clips below.

I think it fits the mood of the movie perfectly.  The action scenes:  The CGI and the effects, the way it moves in the movie, it's all very impressive.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You are going to like this movie if you like the kind of films where the characters are all flawed but have some redeeming qualities. The movie is set in the mid-1800s when the film follows a man named Peter. Peter's son, who is just about to start boarding school, goes missing in the forest while traveling with his father. Peter and his wife, who has been traveling for her own reasons for years, go looking for him. The film has a great deal of atmosphere and tension as the couple travel through the forest and the characters talk to each other, argue with each other and are caught in a series of dangerous situations. You will be surprised and disappointed by some of the endings of the film.  This movie has a lot of character, drama, action, humor, and humor. It is also very well written and acted.  the actors, like James Cromwell and Ellen Greene, do a great job. In addition, there are a couple of very funny scenes. A couple of these funny scenes are actually pretty hard to find in a film that is this good.   The cinematography in this film is really good and the colors are very appealing. There are a few scenes that you can tell the director had a lot invested in the film, and I believe those scenes are a good representation of what his goal was. These scenes are funny and are worth a viewing.     Overall, this film doesn't get a great score but it is a good, enjoyable, suspenseful, and heart-warming movie. I would highly recommend this film to anyone that enjoys good films. It has a strong cast that is great. It also has a really good ending. You won't want to miss it.   for more information, see Wikipedia's movie section: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A couple of months ago, when the hype for the new Star Wars movie was at its peak, I had a great night at the movies. This is the movie I went to see. The film was good enough that I am willing to give it a pass. I had not seen the last two Star Wars films before this. This was my first. This had good characters, and the plot was solid. The plot involved a rebellion against the Empire. I don't know if this is new territory for me, but I found it to be really good. The characters are good. They are believable and their actions are believable. The acting in this film was really good, and some of the scenes I enjoyed were ones with the same character. The movie was a lot of fun, and I would recommend this movie to anyone. (5/5) Note from Jango : I really enjoyed the new movie. While the special effects and the set pieces in this movie aren't great, the writing in this is a lot more sophisticated than I expected. The story is solid and the characters are all well fleshed out. This movie should appeal to fans of the old and new Star wars movies alike. I will be picking this movie up at some point.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw this movie, my reaction was the same as the one that some other people are getting right now, but for some reason I'm surprised by it. First of all, this movie is not only a good flick to watch. It is also a really great movie to watch with someone who has never seen it before. I believe that the reason why it takes so long to watch it (if you want to see it at all) is because this movie has a lot of scenes that we have never seen before. There's the scene in the diner where John Wayne and his best friend, a boy named Dickie, are talking about the movie and John Wayne just happens to be standing there. You can really feel the tension in this movie as the tension is there for good reasons. I personally love this scene because it shows that John Wayne could still pull it off, even now. When you hear Wayne talk about shooting somebody, that's the kind of emotion and power that he had. He really had it. As I already mentioned, he's the first thing that comes to mind when you think about how great a movie it is. In my opinion, this is the best movie Wayne has done. He's also got the best role that he's done to date. This is where Wayne became the legendary actor that he is today. Wayne also had a great supporting cast and a great story. All in all, there are a lot more people who can say that they enjoyed this movie than I can. I was really impressed by this movie. I think that it will probably be the movie that John and Dickie watch the most often after this. I really loved it and I can see why it was a great movie. As a movie, this isn't too much to write home about, but I still think that this is a really good flick.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think it's a great movie. It's a good thriller. I think the action is excellent. It is well shot and there is a lot of interesting action. The characters are well-drawn. There is even a couple of funny scenes. There are a lot different types of people in this movie. There's a lot more comedy and violence. There seems to be a lot better writing and direction. This is the type of movie that could have been a classic, but the people who actually made this movie should be very happy with how it turned out. They have a great sense of humor. I just can't say enough good things about this movie and the people involved. If you like films about the dark side of the human condition or movies about bad guys and good guys, then you will enjoy this. It certainly has a different feel from anything else on the list.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was a massive, huge fan of this movie. I loved the premise so much, I bought the DVD immediately. The movie is very funny and fun and it just got better and better.   The acting was really great, especially from the main characters:  They are all hilarious, all have their unique personalities.  And the acting was pretty good, with some acting being better than others but it never felt like any character was annoying.  They all had their own personality and it was fun to watch them interact.   I also really like the direction this movie takes.  The editing and cinematography is very good and I would like it more if it was like this in the future.  I loved this movie because it was funny and was very light hearted.    The ending was a little predictable, but it was very exciting and a good conclusion to a great movie.  After this movie I am still looking forward to the rest of this series and hopefully it will be the same.  A must-see movie if you like comedy and have a great sense of humor, and you also like horror.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you're gonna write a review, then at least you should be able to tell what you liked about it. But a lot of the reviews I saw are just pure bullshit. Here are some examples:  What I found interesting is that this movie is about two people who are in a relationship and have a kid. The one on the right (Jared) has this big crush on the girl on the left (Amber). He was raised as an atheist and has had trouble coming to terms with it. He has come back into the faith and is in a more open relationship with Amber. The other girl (Emilia) is in love with Jared but has had problems with him before because he was an atheist. I think this movie could have been really good if they had done a better job at keeping the two characters on equal terms, and I think the relationship between Amber and Jared could have added another interesting dimension to the movie.   And what a huge dick move on their part to make this movie and to do it on Christmas morning. There are a lot better movies that they could have made and made them earlier, like a sequel to "Patton."   There is something about a Christmas movie that gets me all excited for Christmas. I don't know if you saw this one, but it was like "The Hangover" and had a bunch of Christmas scenes.    This movie could not have been better. They did a really nice job portraying this relationship. Emilia and Jared are on an epic journey together. They don't always agree, and sometimes they don't agree about anything, but they do find love and are able to accept one another.  This movie is very romantic in a way that has always been missing from the horror genre. I really liked the relationship of these two.  I have seen a lot in horror movies this year, and this one is the most romantic horror movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a great movie and a good comedy, it's not as good as your favourite '90s movies. The characters are funny, the story is entertaining and the action is well made. The main point of the movie is a bit too predictable, but it is a fun movie with great action scenes. I'm glad that I gave it a try.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is all too easy for people to criticize other people. A lot of good movies come out of Hollywood, and while those people are probably making some of the best movies on the planet, it is important to keep in mind that they are also the people making the films that they love. A movie does not have to be "awesome", and "loved" by the audience in order to be good, or at least pass for good. It's just that sometimes people forget about the fact that the audience is also a producer. We like to see our own stuff on the screen, so when someone comes along and tells us that our movie sucks, we tend to be a bit offended. In the case of Alien: Covenant, it was actually a pretty good movie. The movie was not perfect. But it was a good enough movie that I was glad to see the new director on it. And I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked the script, the direction, the production design, and the acting. I was not expecting it to be quite as good as it was.  There are a lot of criticisms that people have about Alien:  and while I feel like I could say something about a lot that I don't like about it, I will not. I know there are some people who love it, and they have a different kind of love than I do. For them, this was an excellent movie. For those people, it didn't go far enough.    A lot has been made about the way that the movie ends. There are a few different ways that I see it, so I figured it would be good to talk about it. First, there is a lot made about how this is all just a big twist that comes out of nowhere, and that there is no way that anyone who hasn't seen the movie is going to realize this is how it is going. Well, there are a couple of ways that this could happen. One way is that the writers and director (he's directing Alien: Awakening now) did not know about this twist, and therefore, the movie could not end this way. That's not a good ending for a movie, or for the franchise. Another way would be that the script didn't have a way to go out this way, and it was not a writer's or director's choice. For example, the ending could be what it's supposed to be, but it could not be written
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (This is an edited transcript from a public meeting held by the city of Chicago on Friday, July 21. The full video of the meeting, which was uploaded to the Internet, is available at www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LX_5j_LpF0.) The following are excerpts from Mayor Richard Daley's introduction: In the last four or five years, the City Council has been able to do a little good. We've been able--I think it's the first time in our history--to take on the powerful and the powerful have been able, I think, to cooperate more closely with the citizens and the people of Chicago. And if you look back at our progress in that area, you'll see the results are really extraordinary. So you can't do a good job if you're not willing to try. What I'm announcing tonight is an opportunity for you to do the right thing. The question I ask you to put to the people, of course, is: Where is the danger? There's one of the big problems we face in this country today. It's an enormous challenge. We have so many people, millions of people, who are out of work, out of education, out the labor force. It takes a very small amount of imagination to wonder what it's going to take to make it happen. But if we're going to address this, we have to make sure that we give it a name: It's not just the economy. It is, it's something more. We're going through a kind of national crisis. And it's important for us to get a sense of the scope of the problem. And the scope that we're talking about is, in many respects, the biggest challenge in a generation. It means, you know, there are a lot of people out of the work force. There are a number of people in prison. There's a big crisis in the family. And, I mean, in a lot ways, it makes it an even bigger problem. So it's a challenge that goes far beyond the economy, it goes far past social issues, it means a whole different set of problems and a whole new agenda. And we want to come up with a plan that really works. And that's what this meeting is about. And I know you're interested in this issue. The Chicago City Council is interested in the issue. But there's only so much the Council can
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie is not an automatic gold mine - that's why I made the effort of making a list of movies that I believe are worth seeing. I had a list in my head of good movies, and these are the ones I watched.    My list has been growing lately and I've discovered more gems, so I am continuing to add to the list. If you would like to contribute, please write a review. Thank you!  In my opinion, the most popular (at least in the US) movie that I watched was:  This movie is very well done. It is an epic story about the end of the Roman Empire. I love epic movies and the story of the fall of the empire is an interesting one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first two movies of this series are great. I highly recommend them. I think these are the best of the series. The first two are all about different types of monsters. The third is really about the monster that's only on the small screen, but was one of the coolest monsters ever. This film is about a guy and his pet frog and the dangers they have to face, mainly the evil creature. The main characters are great and well done. The story and setting are great, very dark and a bit scary. There are a lot of funny scenes as well. The main character is a character that has not had much screen time. He is a very interesting character. He was a normal guy who just had the luck of meeting a frog that was special. He never thought that he would get anything from it, or even from his parents. There is so much to learn about this creature, and it's just so interesting to see this new creature and the effects that it brings to the show. The character is interesting, and his voice is great, but he doesn't really have a character.   There is a lot to learn from this creature and it is amazing how this creature is the same thing in all three films.  This series starts with the first movie. This movie is a great little movie. It follows a lot like a normal horror movie. You know, you've seen these movies and they seem to follow the same formula. This monster comes out and it scares the crap out of you. The film is also set in a hospital. I really liked this movie and it really made me think a lot. The only complaint that I have is that this movie was a little rushed and wasn't as good as the rest of the movie. The ending was a bit forced for me.  I think the second movie is better than the first. It is better paced, it uses a lot more music and there are a few things that are better than usual. The other thing that is better is the monster, as well as the setting. It has a more sinister feeling. It takes this monster and makes it a character in the movie, and they make fun of it.  It is also the only movie in the series that I actually watched all the way through and it made me really look forward to watching the next movie. There were some amazing moments in this movie that I was happy to see. There was some great gore, some

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A bad movie is a bad movie and a mediocre movie is mediocre. So, in my review of The Room, I want to focus on the good parts about it, not on the negative aspects. I will talk about how the movie is written, the actors, the cinematography, and the performances of the people who portrayed the characters. I also want to talk about the film's meaning for me. And I will finally touch on the conclusion of the movie which I believe is quite moving and worth the price of admission.   As the film opens, we get an email from Tommy Wiseau. It states that the first night of the shoot in Paris, he left the hotel and went to a restaurant. He then proceeded to order a sandwich, but the sandwich he ordered was a sandwich with cheese and onions instead of cheese and bread. After getting back to the hotel, he tried to make breakfast for all the actors. He asked for the coffee maker and then ordered a coffee with milk, but as he wasn't going to drink the milk, the coffee was cold. So he went downstairs to the laundry room and he tried once again to make coffee but this time, the laundry was dirty. The guys who worked in the laundromat had just finished a day of being on set with Tommy. When Tommy finally asked to borrow a set of clothes and a shirt from the other guys, he was told that there was no time for that. He was told to go to the gym for a workout. Tommy asked who was going to pay for the gym. He got a look of fear in his eyes and said "I'm going to have to go alone"   The movie starts out with Tommy at the gym, he looks pretty cool, he has a few muscles, and he is going hard. He's working out at the same time a couple of the cast and crew are getting their workout in. The first scene in the gym was very dramatic, it was a scene where we first see Tommy and Greg Sestero. Greg's character and Tommy's characters are going at it. The choreography, while not particularly amazing, was a good effort. The reason why I say "The first scene was very" is because we learn about Tommy's past that night and we hear about the tragic events that he has gone through, not just his death. The next scene that we see is Tommy and his old college buddy. The scene was choreographed so perfectly that I was amazed
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is so much fun. I feel so silly when I look back at it and realize how stupid I was when I first saw it. But I couldn't stop and go back and find a copy of it on Netflix because I had no idea what it was about. The movie is good and funny and a lot of fun. The writing is great and the actors are all so good.   For a second I really thought I was watching some kind of bizarre horror/fantasy movie.  If you don't want to waste the movie time with a silly story that takes you on a trip to a strange world and is too convoluted to understand, you might want to skip this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When we look at the history of the cinema, the most revolutionary feature of it all is its ability to show us stories that are different from all the other stories in it. It is not so much the fact that these stories were created on a screen that was much more primitive and different. It was that these movies also allowed us to get inside the head of the people who created them and thus understand them. But, as it is often the case with great movies, we don't realize at the time how much the stories of these movies changed the way we think and how the movies became a vehicle for bringing the ideas of the real world into a fantasy world.   In this movie, the people are on a journey to retrieve a golden statue, which is being guarded by an evil witch, and they arrive at a mysterious town in a forest. In the opening scene, it is very clear that this is a magical place that is inhabited by many things which we will never understand, but which make a lot of strange noises which are very hard to explain.  After their visit to the town, we find out that it has some kind of relation to the real life of the character. As soon as the movie is over, we are told that the witch has been killed by a mysterious man who has come to live in the town.  There is a little something we can recognize in this movie. It shows us two sides of life - on one side there is this world in which we can live a simple life but it seems to be ruled by a big and evil force, and on the other side, there are many secrets which we know not, which are hiding in the world that we live in. The main story of this movie is the life of two people, which starts out in a village but ends in a strange town. However, this movie has a much more complex story behind it, and it is a very good story. I did not like the part where we find the witch and then watch her as she slowly transforms.  I didn't like the fact the witch starts looking for him when she is in her own form, that is something that happens very slowly and the viewer can never get used to it. But the story is also very beautiful.  The movie was made in Italy by a young director who made only seven movies, but they are all very good.  One of my favorite movies, which I can watch often. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If I have a negative review about one of the many good movies we have, it is the one I made about The Princess Bride. If there is a movie that I'm more embarrassed about than I'm ashamed of, it's The Princess Cuckold. But that's exactly what this movie is, it brings up all the worst parts of the movie, and doesn't even try to hide it. It just plays them out, for the sake of shock value. But if you want a movie about a woman getting what she deserves for being an unrepentant slut and trying to seduce her own husband, with an all star cast, then this is a really great movie.   The Princess is not going to take your breath away. But it is a good time, so I'd encourage everyone to see it, just in case you might need some entertainment. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've only seen this one once.   I love this movie. I think this is a great movie with a great script and a great story.  I do have a couple of complaints. I'm not a huge fan of "slasher" movies. I just don't enjoy them. They always feel like a cheap ripoff of something else. There are some really great movies in this genre though:  A Nightmare on Elm Street 2, Evil Dead, etc.  The story of this movie is really really good. The tension builds and builds. It's really fun to watch a person get eaten by a bear, and then later watching him/her get eaten again by a dog. The only thing I would change is the girl's name is spelled "Grimm".  What did you think?

Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you are not a big fan of horror films, you have probably never heard of George A. Romero. Well, Romero has been making some great movies and his works were so good, that he was often praised as a great horror filmmaker. Romero has made some great horror movies and many movies that I would definitely recommend you to check out. The one thing that I have heard that is definitely true about Romero's horror films is that they are not really about the horror. Most of the times he does not do anything with horror, but instead shows horror through everyday people's eyes and how they react to horrible things. For example, in the movie Night of the Living Dead, you don't see any zombies or monsters, but rather you see people trying to live their normal lives. That is why, Romero does not need to use horror to get the viewers interested. It is just his normal life and the way people cope with the situation. There are also some scenes in these movies that are so scary that even people who do not like horror movies can definitely see them as very scary. The movies that Romero has directed so far are: Day of the Dead, Dawn of the DEAD, Land of THE DEAD, The Crazies and Return of the living dead. Night of The Living Dead was the first of Romero's movies to win the Oscar for the Best Film. The Cawdor also was nominated for the Oscar in 1986. Romero also made one of the best horror movies ever in Romero's Night of THE Living Dead remake. He also wrote many horror movies during the 80s, but never made a horror movie that I liked as much as The CAWDOR or Night of DEAD.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only positive review I have ever seen for The Last King of Scotland   It's just such a good story and a really good movie. I'd give it a ten if I were forced to pick one. The ending was awesome and I loved that it was just an homage and not an original story.   I'd have to give it an eight-eight-eight, but it would have been even better if it didn't end too early.  The best thing about the movie is the music and especially the voice-over by Peter Dinklage. I'm not going to lie to you. I like Peter D...
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The film's plot is pretty well described: a young girl, Tilly, is abducted, raped and sold into prostitution; she's rescued by a detective played by the great Tom Hanks (with an interesting and tragic character arc). And yet I was so captivated by this movie I only wanted to see more, which it delivers in spades... the first half of the movie is simply a masterful performance from Tom Hiddleston. We see him as a man searching for his daughter, with whom he had a tumultuous relationship, and whose death haunts him. And for his work in finding his daughter's kidnapper, he is praised in the press and in his own country. We also see the detective's troubled relationship with Tilly's mother, played by a wonderfully un-American Liza Minnelli. When the press discovers that the detective is gay, Tilda Swinton, she gets fired." (Hollywood Reporter, November 11, 2002)   Review:  "This is the kind of film you go to see if you've seen a film like A Beautiful Mind. But this is not a remake.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first saw the trailer for "Gravity," my mind went immediately to the scene in "Alien," where a little girl (played by Sissy Spacek) runs across the hall screaming. I couldn't help but think, "Maybe that could be me, running through the hallway screaming."   "GRAVITY" is a film that has so much going for it. With a screenplay by Alfonso Cuaron and a director (Neel Sethi) who really knows how to work with camera, the film is definitely visually stunning.   From the opening shot, you see the astronaut's spacesuit as it moves out into the vast black expanse of space, the opening credits, the shots of Earth and Mars and the space station orbiting around the planet in orbit, and even the final shot of the planet as it recedes into the distance as the astronauts return from their mission.  This is a truly extraordinary piece of work.  I cannot wait to see what Cuaron has in store for us in this follow up to "Gravy"   But if you are the type of person who is more likely to go to see a film like "Grave of the Fireflies" or "The Empire Strikes Back," I have good news.   If you can get past the fact that it's about two space astronauts, it's a good time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I like this movie. The story is very intriguing, and I really enjoy the movie. It does have some problems (like not being long enough for some viewers), but at least it is entertaining. I think you should watch it if you are looking for a good story with a really good plot and story line.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was going to write a positive summary, but realized after viewing the movie that I could get to the point much more effectively that way. There are so many things wrong with this movie. The opening sequence is an overblown travesty. You're watching the opening of a new horror movie, and a creepy old woman (who looks exactly like the woman from the first part of the first movie) appears to a young girl on a street corner. In a blur, she takes her young friend (who is about 12 years old) and leaves without any explanation. This scene makes no sense at all, it is not scary, and it will make you wish you had never seen this movie in the first place. The ending is also an abomination, it should have ended the movie on a good note. The scene where the old woman, played by Jennifer Hetrick, is walking down the street is the worst part of this movie by far. The movie has the audacity to try and make you feel bad for the old lady. Her walk is slow and deliberate, and when she reaches a deserted and deserted building (where she knows the girl is, I'm sure, but she won't say so), her walk is a walk of pure terror and disgust. The old woman is walking through the building with her eyes wide open, and you can almost see the gears turning in her brain as she realizes that she has just been raped. At no point in the movie do we ever see her have to say a word, or think, or do anything. In the final scene where she is walking past a cemetery and comes upon the body of the old girl that just died, the movie makes the audience feel bad. We are told she is in a terrible condition, and we are told that the girl was murdered. We don't see that she was killed, and even worse, we don't even see her in any condition to carry out her crimes. She is walking towards a closed door, and she walks in to the room that is locked. You can't see how or why she entered, or what she looks like, or whether or not she's a vampire or some sort of monster. I have seen movies that are this bad. There is also no reason for the woman to be walking down a deserted street at night, except to be a bad girl, as it seems there are a lot of bad girls in this town. There was a point in this movie that
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen all the movies in the series and they are all great. They all have an interesting premise that will keep the audience intrigued until the very end.   It has a really funny scene where all of the characters get a hot tub to the beach. I wish they would make a sequel to this.  This movie has been the highlight of my week for the last two years, because I think that it has a good story and a good comedy.  I give it a B 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most recent movie of this series is probably The Fifth Element, which was great and made great use of the Tardis.   This film takes a different direction. The story is less well developed and the TARDIS materializes on a planet that has a different feel to it. The film doesn't quite match the first one in terms of plot, but it has some interesting ideas. I loved the first film, but this one is more than just a re-run of the same story. It is a new chapter in Doctor Who, in a time when the show is no longer limited to the familiar Tardits. The Fourth Doctor is back.  Part of me thinks that the TARDis is a metaphor for the Fourth Doctor's life and legacy, but other parts of me think that it's the first step in the Fourth's final journey.  In this movie, the Fourth appears in his thirties. This is a strange turn. In previous films, the Doctor was generally at least a little older, but with this film he looks a bit like the Second Doctor.  If I were to speculate, I might say that this is another example of the time-warping in the fourth series. The time-twisting is almost like a hallucination in this film. The TARDIS and its occupant seem to be standing still, and the Fourth looks on in a daze. The Doctor is in love with his new companion, but can't make the time travel work.  When a group of terrorists take over the Tardsis, he must go against his friends and fight them off with the help of a young girl.  After the fight, a mysterious voice warns him that the time will be up for the Tamsit, and he must make one final trip. This film isn't just a "good" movie, it's a "great" movie. It has the spirit of a Tardit story, but has some originality and fun moments.  It's a shame that this movie doesn't get as much attention as the first, but I think it deserves to be seen.  This movie is from the original VHS release, which I really like.  It is presented in a pretty widescreen format.  The original release doesn't look quite as good on Blu-Ray, but that's a small price to pay for watching it in HD.  I like the color palette used for the film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:      1. You don't need to see this for it's music, it is amazing and not to be missed, it's a good mix of punk rock and punk-pop music, if that's what you're into, but if not, you can just leave it.  2. I liked it when it was a punk-rock band with a female singer, but now it's an acoustic-based band with the same singer. This was the third movie from this film, and while it's still funny, it was very weak. It's the second movie from "Shocker", so it's better than the first one, but not by much. , it isn't really a comedy. I feel like it's more a dramatic story about a punk band trying to stay alive in the punk-punk world. It has its moments, like when one of the main characters falls off a truck. The song "It's a punk rock world" is a big joke, especially if you like punk-punks, because it's the same song in the movie. Then again, maybe it isn. I'd rather just skip it if you're not into punk-rap music. They really went out of their way to make the band seem like they had a shitty life. The film is a little on the short side, so don't expect to get much out of it. There are some songs that might appeal to people that like rap music, but that's about it. The story is really good and well done, but the film doesn't really have anything that makes it stand out from most other punk films.I don't know if it's because the soundtrack was good or because the story was really bad. If it was the former, it wouldn't be such a waste of time to watch. This has a lot of jokes, so it'll have people who are into comedy. If you're an audiophile, this should be on your list for sure, because they made it all sound good. I've never heard so many "bad" guitar notes, but overall the film is pretty good. It isn't as good as the first two, but it's very much worth watching if you love punk. This is a really funny movie, but is really short.It has a few nice lines. There is also a good soundtrack. I don't think you'll regret watching it. This really is a good watch if you enjoy punk-r
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was not my favorite movie. But the cast is really good and the animation, the soundtrack and the story is good. This was like the new version of Aladdin. It has a lot of characters and the main character can be really fun. The animation is good, the music is good and there is even a really funny song. And it is not as sad as Aladdin. I also recommend this to fans of animated movies, because it is one of the few that is a bit more upbeat and has a happy ending. Recommended for kids, and adults who just like good stories, this is a good addition to your list.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like you said, my biggest fear when working on this is that the fans wouldn't appreciate me. So I'm working as hard as I can on these projects.   And when the fans are not satisfied, I don't feel bad.  There were a couple of people on Twitter saying they'd never seen a sequel to an old movie. I told them that if they want to get into that movie, they're going to have to go back and read the first one.  And if they didn't like it, then I guess they'd better start from the beginning.  It's easy to take a beloved film and rip out parts that don't work anymore.  Maybe that's why so many of the fans on Twitter are saying this film is not worth their time.  I guess we'll find out for sure in a couple more weeks.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Watchable but could have used more time on the story.   - Watchable - Great plot - Good action, but not for the fainthearted.  - Great action, and some great fight scenes.  I saw the first two installments of the trilogy and they were both good, but this one is the best of the bunch. I enjoyed the movie immensely.  Star Wars: Episodes II-III was a great movie and you should at least give this one a watch.  It has some great action scenes and great special effects and it's pretty funny too.  The plot is pretty much self explanatory, with the Empire and the Jedi hunting the Rebel Alliance down, with some nice touches and moments of humor.  There are a few moments where I really thought it was going to take a step down from the first three films in the series, but all the things that are there are pretty much there, which is a good thing.  This movie really keeps you on your toes.  I don't think I can add anything here that you haven't already seen in the other two movies.  Personally, I think it is a movie that the younger set can watch and enjoy, but I'm sure that the old set that saw the earlier movies will find it quite entertaining.  Overall, I have to give it 4 out of 5, it's a great sequel to the original trilogy and for the first time in Star Wars history, a trilogy that everyone can enjoy. Rated 5 out of five by Anonymous from Great movie This is an epic movie and I highly recommend it for anyone who likes sci-fi. It's very different from the previous two in that it follows a group of individuals that don't know each other. But it is great. The action is intense and the characters are all interesting. There are some funny moments too. Definitely worth a watch, if you like sci-ffi, action and great acting. Anonymous said... A nice, dark adventure/horror. The main characters, Luke and Han Solo, are more mature, more powerful and a little bit older. The script is tight and it is the second sequel in a trilogy. This movie has more action, more aliens, more bad guys, more action sequences and some of the best set pieces in the entire series. The soundtrack is very well done and gives a nice touch of sci-Fi. The story is very good and I'm happy that I have

Write a positive review about a good movie:    ( I did, for a friend of mine)  In the early days of the internet, I created a Yahoo group called "WTF - Movie Reviews." Since then, we've been a place for the most awesome movie fans to get together and discuss the latest films, TV shows and comics.   If you're looking for a "real" film review group, you've come to the right place!  I'll add this to the FAQ: Why is it called "Why does the word 'fandom' appear in the title?":   The word "fandom" was coined in the early 1980's as a derogatory term to describe fans of the "Star Trek" TV series.  Fandom (fandomis, fandocs) is used to describe a group of people who have a common interest in a certain topic or person.  For example, a fan of "Star Wars" may identify with the characters, the world and the saga of the galaxy far far away.  Also, the word can be used in reference to any person who has a strong relationship with a certain person or organization.  Fandom can also be used as a verb, in which a fan identifies himself with or as a member of a particular group of interest.  In the case of fandom, "fandoc" and "fantoc" are often used interchangeably.  There's a website called www.fanfic.com  that discusses a little bit of the history of the word "fan" and why it was used as an insult.  It's not a complete history, but it is informative.  Fan fiction and fan artists are popular in the sci-fi and fantasy worlds.  They're often described as "fanfiction" and can be as creative and artistic as any story-line that can be found in any comic book or video game.  You can find a little more info on fan art at Wikipedia. There's also a Tumblr called Tumblrfans that has a lot of good information about the fandom. I just found this great movie on Amazon called "Hooked". If you don't mind being an old school Star Wars geek, I highly recommend checking it out.  I've been collecting action figures for about 30 years now. I'm currently a collector of the original X-Wing ships, which I was fortunate enough to purchase when I was about 12 years old. I have a

This is a kind of challenge for me and this is the goal for the day I am going to give it a try.   I was looking for a book about the movie and it did not find it. So I searched through the internet and found a book of it's name.  It is a little slow to read but you do not need to be a speed reader to be able to finish this book.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Great Gatsby is a beautiful movie. It's so good, in fact, that the movie almost never has a negative point. The best things in the movie are all of those beautiful actors playing their roles in such a beautiful way. The soundtrack by Max Richter, the story and dialogue, the color palette, the setting of the movie, all of it is fantastic. I think this movie deserves all of the praise that it gets. The only problem I had was that I don't think the movie really had a "end". The plot was so dense, that I'm not sure if there's a "final" scene. There are hints that maybe there might be a little bit of closure with the character that Gatsly was playing and that's fine. But for me, there are still so many unanswered questions that will forever haunt Gatsy. It really just doesn't make sense how Gatsie died in that room and for how long. I understand that this movie was made in the 1950s, but that doesn't excuse it from being so flawed. It had everything going for it in the world, except that the film just didn't go far enough with it's story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It's the most important thing in the world." "A classic" "Very, very good" "One of the greatest movies ever."   So what?   But are you sure?  And are you really sure that this isn't a film so good that if it didn't exist there would be nobody who would make it?  It's funny, because it's the kind of film that you're just dying to see again and again: you've seen it enough that you know it's good, but still can't believe you saw it all the way through.  So many people make a lot of money from it, but it's worth the time it takes to go back and see it again just to realize that it's still a good film.  And it's always a good idea to find out the true story before you criticize it, so that you can see how well it's actually done.  It would be a great treat to see this film on the big screen.  There are plenty of people who have a good sense of humor about this film, but few will actually make a film like this, so it's a shame that it isn't more widely known.  But it's not the worst movie ever made, or even really close to it.  As a film that was a hit in the United States but was also very successful abroad, it's kind of remarkable that this wasn't much more known overseas.  A bit more of a strange story.  In France the French film festival Les Nuit de Miel was held in 1981, and it was the first film to ever receive a Best Foreign Language Oscar.  At this time the director was Jean-Pierre Melville, and the screenwriter was Jean Giraud.  Both of them had received a lot more acclaim for writing the French New Wave classic Paris is Burning (1963).  The film itself was set in a small French village, but most of the film was shot at a movie studio, and some of the actors were actually on set at the time.  Jean Girard, who had just won a best screenplay Oscar for his screenplay for the French version of The Pianist (1972), got a script credit for the film.   And since he and Melville were both working on an American project, and MelVILLE had written the screenplay for Paris is burning, Girard went on the set to talk to the other producers.  Girard had already read
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Man Who Wasn't There (1936) was a hit in England during the war. The film starred the great Douglas Fairbanks, and was shot in the United States.  Why: As you may recall, it was made during the War, and it was the first film made by Cecil B. DeMille, and DeMena has been called the "King of Hollywood". DeMela, who was the man who made the first three films for MGM, wanted to make the movie about a real American soldier that went over to England. After getting permission from a friend of his, the man was killed in a war-zone, and that's how the soldier was portrayed. The soldier died in a plane crash, but the plane was seen from the side. The story was about a little boy who was sent to England and when he got there he found out that the Germans had beaten him. He was sent back home and it seems that it was because he refused to fight. In England, he started to write a song about his experiences in the war, and when it was published, he was sent a very large sum of money and he became very rich. Unfortunately, the song was not very popular, but he had a very successful career and his son was his heir. I love this movie. DeMartino (director) does an excellent job, and I hope you will watch it. The movie, which I haven't seen, is very good. It was filmed in England, but it was filmed on location in the States. It is very entertaining, and a bit strange to me because the German soldier looks like a guy from the movies. He has a good voice and he's quite charming, but when he talks it is too fast for a German accent. The music was also done in English. I also think that the movie is very interesting because I have never seen a film about a man going over to another country that was made before World War Two. When the movie was released in Germany, a lot of people were confused about the movie. The Germans didn't understand anything about it. When a friend told me that the film was a German one, I said, "I am German, so I must like this film. I am going to go see it again". I have seen this movie several times, and you can see that the British soldiers are a little bit different, but at the same time they were good soldiers. I
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie. It's a great movie in general, but there are a few moments that were just well done, such as, when the gang has to go to get the guns that the mobsters used to kill their families. I like how they all act like that the guns are the most important thing in the world. You can tell the guy who is going to have to take them out is going up against one of the biggest, baddest guys on the block. It looks amazing! They even show the bullet hitting the table in the gang's apartment before they get it. There's a lot of action in this movie and the editing is great. The best part about this movie is that it's a real gangster movie, without the super violence you get in a lot gangster movies. There are no slow motion shots or stunt people doing crazy stuff. The gang does some great shooting and driving, but they are not the only ones who do that in this film. There is a whole lot of running, shooting, and dodging people in this one, and it makes for an exciting movie. I love the way that they play the whole movie out so that they show it all at one time. It gives the characters more time to do some great action shots and some amazing scenes. It was also great to see how the gang was able to work together despite the differences in their ways of doing things. A big part of this movie that I really like was how the police handled the situation. They really did what was best for the guys. I really loved it. It really does make you think about it and realize what the police are trying to do. That's the best part of the movie! There's one thing that was kind of bothering me and that's that there are some scenes that you could have seen a whole bunch of times, but didn't. For example, there is a scene where the cops are playing poker. The cops were having an honest, poker game and when it was over, the guy sitting next to them had left, so they thought, "Oh, that wasn't good," so they came up with the idea of getting some of the guns back from the mob boss so that the police could use them to help get the boss off the hook. Then, when they went in, the mob guys tried to shoot at them. The police officer that was with the guys thought that this was a good idea, but he

It gives a lot of details that can be found in any history book, and has a lot to say about all the important episodes in American history, and of the history of Europe. The author of this book is a professor of history, but he is very knowledgeable about the American Revolution and the war for Independence. You don't have to be a historian to read this book. It is a fun read.  A must-read book on the American Revolutionary War and the War for Independence Read the book! The author goes into a lot detail about the most important battles and important events during the American War for independence. You will learn about the battle of Bunker Hill, which helped bring about the victory at Yorktown, and is a must-reading for anyone interested in the history. Also in the book, you'll learn about George Washington's battle for independence, and also the battles for Lexington, Concord, and Yorktown. The book is not just about the war, but also about the people and their roles during the war. Many people never knew about the women who fought and died for the U.S. during the Revolutionary War. This is a great book for anyone who is interested in all things related to the American revolution, and the events that followed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The second episode of The Dark Knight Rises has a very different feel and tone from the first episode in The Dark Knights of Gotham. It's a bit darker and more serious and much less silly. The Joker is the focus and you don't get a lot of his humor from the Batman. There's more of a focus on Bruce Wayne as the focus of the story and a lot less Batman as the main character. That was a bit of a surprise to me. The first episode was more of the Bruce Wayne/Batman dynamic. The second was more Bruce Wayne, and a different Joker. It was a pretty good story and it really set the tone for the second half of the series. The ending was pretty good and it was nice to see The Joker really have some screen time and develop a bit as a character. The only problem is that it was pretty dark. There was a lot more violence and there were some good action sequences. It also felt a little rushed at times. It got a little confusing how a lot happened at the end and a bit confusing how the story ended. That's something that would make it easier to follow if the story had more time to settle in and the pace of the storyline was better. I'll take the dark tone and the rushed ending over a more lighthearted one any day.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This one has some good moments.   I thought I liked the idea of it a lot, but I just got tired.  And the way the bad guys, the police, and the audience get the blame for everything... it just got old.  It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's not anything special either.  I'd give it a 3.5 or 4, but the ending ruined it.  There are better movies out there to watch.  Posted by The Nerd at 7:15 AM

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Man Who Wasn't There (1979) This film is an excellent example of the early American avant-garde, in the sense that it uses visual images and film noir-like conventions to portray a realistic and psychological detective drama.  The film, directed by the great Charles Laughton, was a critical and commercial disappointment when it first came out, but after it had been restored and released, it went on to win four Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Screenplay, and was nominated for an additional one in 1981.  If you like Hitchcock and filmnoir, this is the movie for you. The story is about a woman who works in a bookstore in New York City during the depression, whose husband is a writer and she is a secretary.  One night, the bookstore is robbed and the wife is raped.  She is given a gun by her boss, who also works at the bookstore, and that night she goes out with a fellow employee to a nearby tavern, where she is raped as well.  During the rape, the other employee tells her to drive home and kill her husband.  Later, she drives down to her house and shoots him, and then tries to escape, but is shot and killed by the police.  In the years following the rape and murder, the widow and the bookstore employee become close friends and lovers, but he is also tormented by guilt for the rape.  I won't spoil the plot for you, but the film was so good that I still remember every scene very clearly.  It has not aged well and seems like it was filmed on 35mm, since I don't remember seeing a film of this quality on film in 1977.  This is one of those great "unfilmables" that still gives me a good feeling even though it was only released on VHS a few years ago. A good movie to have on your Blu-ray shelf:  The Lost City of Z (2006)  The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1993)  Back to the Future (1985)  The Abyss (2005)  A bad movie:    The Day After Tomorrow (2004)  One of those films where everything I have written here in this post seems completely valid, but I couldn't help thinking that I would prefer it to the last film on my list.  Based on the book by Michael Crichton, the film follows a group of astronauts who leave earth and are
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the reasons I love movies so much is because they teach us things about the world that we didn't learn in school or in books, and the movies can do that.   Movies aren't about facts and figures and the good and evil they represent.  They teach us about life, the way it really works, and how we can be better.  The Best Movie   This is a movie that is a great gift to watch.  It is so good that you can't help but be taken to another place.  The thing about "The Good Son" is it shows us how important family is and how the good in the world is often the most important thing in our lives, so don't take the wrong lessons from this movie and watch the other movies to see if this one is any good, it really is!   Don't get confused, there are two films in this review.  One is a comedy and one is a drama.  Both of the films are great, but I really like the comedy one more, just because it shows the family life and their relationships.  This movie follows a good guy and his son, named Will.  Will is a man who wants to be a lawyer, but doesn't want to take on the burden of his responsibilities that come with being a lawyer.  He is a very good father and he loves his son and cares about him.  When it comes to parenting he's just as good as any other parent.  His son, Will is just as intelligent and gifted as his father is. Will is very good at sports, and always plays and does well.  But when the world comes crashing down, and we learn that Will's father has been murdered, we learn Will's mother has been having an affair and will never stop.  And just like that we're left with a very confused, unhappy, and lost boy who has had his life turned upside down, but he wants to find out who did it.  If you watch the movie with these things in mind you'll see what I mean about the way this film does a good job at making us think and feeling.  Here are a few more quotes from the movie: " You gotta make the best out of every day that you're given and if you do, and you make it your duty to help others, you won't have any regrets.  " It is about a man and his family who have lost
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My only complaint about this movie is that the director was not a professional at the job, and as a result, he took chances in editing, shooting, and directing this movie. I just don't believe in taking chances when the director has a shaky grasp on what his movie is. However, I can't hold him solely accountable for this film's flaws. The cinematography is the film's strong point, with the camera capturing every moment of suspense and danger. The sound is also very well-done, though the music used is quite different than that of his other films. And of course, the script is one of the best in the horror genre.   If you are looking for a truly scary movie to watch, this is the one for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If someone wrote a bad review for a bad movie, would you care?   How would you feel?  The difference is when you are writing about a movie that really should not exist in the first place.   The world, to paraphrase John Cleese, is a strange, cruel, and unforgiving place. Movies can be wonderful, but that does not mean that it is acceptable to be a douche to someone who has spent their entire life watching a movie.    Movies are meant to be entertaining.  And that is what we hope a movie is meant to do.  If the movie can't be entertaining, if it can't have fun, then it should not be made.  Let's be honest, we all make fun of the worst of our own, but if a movie was made in this day and age, without any care for humor, and was about a man in his 70s with a history of mental illness, that man might be considered "sick".   When I saw Batman & Robin, I went from thinking it was a good, fun movie to thinking that it was an absolutely horrible movie. I think there are two things that this movie was trying to accomplish, and they were completely out of place. First of all, it was trying very hard to make Batman look bad.   He had a very bad hair-do and he looked very unhappy.   I think that it would have been much more effective if they had just let Batman have some fun with that stupid bat-cane thing.   Instead, Batman is constantly being told by the Penguin that he is not what he once was.   His body has changed, and the way he thinks, feels and behaves, are so different from when he was Batman.   Batman is supposed to be funny.   The Penguin, who was once a clown, is supposed make Batman out to be silly.  So, how would he look in a Batman costume?  This is a movie in which the villain and hero are both wearing goofy outfits.  It is an attempt to make people feel bad for the villain, but it really does not work.  But it does not end there. The villain also gets a costume of his own, and it is even more out of character for the character.  In a movie about a guy with a bad hair day, Batman would be a really good choice to have on his side.   Unfortunately, he never wears his costume

Write a positive review about a good movie:    1) "The Thing." I can't tell you how many times I watched this movie as a kid, always hoping that the monster would show up and make me eat my dog (it did never). "The Things We Lost in the Fire" is the perfect movie to watch as a teenager.   The plot is simple, and it starts out with a kid's dog getting killed. He and his friends find the body of a missing boy and bring it back to the boy's parents. They figure the kid is with a girl he saw on the train. The girl says she was only 10 and didn't know the boy. The boy's dad decides he wants the boy back. That night, they search the area but can't find him. As the night goes on, the kid's mom is getting worried. They can't sleep and start getting visions of the girl.

This is a short movie but you get a lot of stuff from it and I think it was done pretty well.    I enjoyed watching this movie very much. I think this was one of the best movie from 1999. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The original "Ripley's Believe It Or Not" movie was a great movie to watch. The sequel is much better. It shows how awesome Ripley's life is now after her injuries. It's better in some ways. Ripley had a much better relationship with Newt's family. He was much more of a dad figure to her. In some ways he reminded her of her mother. They didn't have to have a big battle of words to share about their love for each other. They were able to do that without any bad blood. It also shows how close they are now. Rip is much more confident with her powers and looks. The alien scenes and alien design is much cooler now. It wasn't done badly, but it didn't look out of place. The script is much clearer. It makes the Alien movie much more enjoyable. The second movie is more fun and entertaining. Rip can go anywhere she wants now. Even if she doesn't go to the Aliens world to explore it. She has a lot of money now. This movie also made the Aliens movie look better. The first movie was just boring, but this movie shows a lot more action and suspense. The new Alien's design is so much better than the first. This film really gave life to the Alien and made them more like their movie version. The Aliens can come at you any time. They are more deadly and ferocious. There are new scenes with the xenomorphs and some scenes with Alien 3's Xenomorphs. There is also a lot to do with the aliens in the new movie. The story doesn't take a long time to tell, which gives a lot time for Ripley and Newt's love story. If you're a fan of the original "Alien" movie then this is a must see. You really don't want to miss this movie. This is one of the best "Alien-flavors" out there. It really has the look and feel of the movie that you remember. It gives you that "Alien experience" that you've been looking for. It doesn't make a complete 180 from the movie, but still has that Alien feel. If anything this is even more like the movie than the original. This will also be the last Alien movie to have Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. The only time we'll see Weaver as another character in the movie will be in the next film. Rip, Newt, Newt's son, and some other characters will

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was actually really good!   It was pretty funny, which is always important for a comedy.    I did not laugh out loud once in this movie.    It was a solid movie and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  The movie starts with a young girl named Alyssa who is in town for her uncle's funeral.  And to help pay for it, her dad asks her to go to the movie and be a waitress.  The only problem is that her mother is not in town.  When Alyss is told she can't stay home alone, she's angry at her dad.  Her uncle's death left her grieving and she doesn't want to leave the house until the night is over.  Alyss calls her mom and asks her why she can have her a few hours to herself.  It's a normal day, with her uncle coming home from work and his car broken.  This is Alyss's first time at his uncle's gravesite.  She decides to ask her mom about it.  Unfortunately, she doesn. She also learns she's pregnant. Alyss doesn't even know what a trachea is and is having trouble breathing and it will be impossible for her to deliver a baby if she goes home.   Alyss and her mom decide it's best for her and her baby to stay with her dad and uncle and go on a road trip.  They are stopped in a state park for the night.  This is where the movie becomes weird.  My mom was talking to a man about the situation.  After a few minutes she notices a huge black dog, which she has never seen before.  Suddenly, the dog jumps off its owner's back and attacks Alyss.  Fortunately, she is able to get the dog off of her, but it has taken a bite out of her leg.  I was not very excited to see this movie as it was pretty gross.  Now you might be thinking why did the woman have a dog at a funeral?  The story is that it was a stray.  While we are on the topic of dogs, the only animal I have ever seen a dog eat was a chicken.  At this point, the movie is just kind of awkward, although I still thought it was funny.  Also, the guy who talked to my mom and was just walking around was named Joe, but we never saw him again.  We

Write a positive review about a good movie:        When I first started, it wasn't a really good movie. Not as a child, at least, because I was too young to see it, but I really liked the original. I loved watching it, and I loved that they got the kid actors right. It was a great movie. But, as an adult, the kids have gotten old and they're really not that good. It's a bit like when Tom Hanks starred in the movie, When Harry Met Sally. Everyone was really good but Tom H. wasn't that good, and when the real Tom H is in the film, he's really not Tom H." (Posted by Paul N. Pecora on January 8, 2005)  Rating: 2   "For a long time it was the greatest movie I ever saw. Then the kids started to lose interest in it, since it was too old for them. At the beginning of the first "Mighty Ducks" I thought it was a piece of crap. I went out of my way to get the sequels (I didn't think they should have been made) and then I finally saw it with an audience. To this day, the one of the best "musical comedies" I have ever seen. This is a very funny movie, with all the characters, with the actors, with music, with everything. I just loved this movie. I don't know if anyone else did but I watched it more than any other movie. This movie really taught me about life. It taught me that a great job always comes in the end, even if the day was long and hard. It showed me how the best days can come before the worst days. I thought I would never see such a movie again, until I saw this movie with the real actors from "Mentors," which was a good thing. I was so happy I saw "Might and Magic," and "The Mighty Ducks," and now I see "Jungle Book." I have been waiting for more "Jurassic Park," and this film does it just the way it was done. I can't wait for the "The Lion King" because of this movie, I know it's going to be great. The movie is a classic that will go down as one of those great classics. It is a great time, when you see the first and second "Million Dollar Movie" and you think, "Wow, I can get a
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Good Dinosaur" is a good dinosaur movie. It's also a great movie that takes itself seriously enough to be a movie.  In fact, it has a lot in common with " Jurassic Park " and " Jurassic World " that are very much action movies. The characters are fun to watch and even better with the voice cast of John C. Reilly, Ty Burrell, and Jeff Goldblum.  It's the most visually stunning of the new dinosaur movies, and it's a really good time for the whole family.  If you think "Titanic" is "a really good movie" (which it is), "The good Dinosaur" should really knock your socks off.  The dinosaur story is fun to see, but it's also important to pay attention to the characters.  They are all well written, and the acting is solid and believable.  There are just a lot of cool moments in the movie and a lot to like about it.  I think " The Good Dinosaur " is a really fun movie and you should definitely check it out.  You might be surprised at what you think of it when you actually finish it.

You just want to spend time with your son and not worry about things like work, bills, money, food, and just being a good father. I know when it was time for our son, I was worried but my wife said that being a father is just so hard and I really felt the baby's pain. She would read him stories, read to him and take him everywhere. She kept us in check, always making sure that we were there and doing everything we could.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was at first worried that this movie would be a poor imitation of the original, but I found that this film is very different. The new film has the same sense of romance and hope as the original. However, instead of the love triangle, it has a romantic comedy, which is a different sort of romance.   This film is more realistic, and doesn't rely on the romantic element, which was the original's biggest flaw.  For those who thought that "Beauty and the Beast" was too good to be true, this movie proves that this wasn't true, and that Disney and its animators really can still do magic.  In a way this film reminded me of the movie "The Book of Mormon", as the story was similar, but a bit darker and more tragic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie is usually worth watching regardless of its quality. It helps to bring out the essence of the movie. The movie's storyline and plot was well developed and captivating to watch. This was one of the best movies i've seen. The acting was also good. I loved the way everyone played their parts. It was a good mix of comedy and drama and it felt natural. My only complaint is that the film wasn't longer but the plot was too compelling to waste an hour on a 10 minute movie. Overall i would recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama.   I really like this movie a lot. I like how the film is told from a female point of view. The story is well explained and there is always a plot twist that you are not expecting. In this movie you are given a lot of information and are treated as a character. I recommend this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The reason why this movie was so good was because it had good actors:    The lead actor played by a white man in a movie for the first time ever.   And his accent is great for a first time, because this white man from Louisiana has a great accent.   This movie had a lot of things that I liked:  It had some great acting from all the characters, it had some really well crafted scenes, and it had a good story.  However, the reason why I like this movie is because it was made with a small budget. _____________________________________ Posted by Vyasa Vyas at 10:08 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:              This is my favorite film of the year and I've seen more of its sequels than I have of this one.   This is a wonderful example of how good horror can be even when the actors are not that great.  The plot of this is set up in a very unusual way and I think it's great. It uses a different setting and a different type of horror. The script by director Sam Raimi and writers Marc Blucas and David Twohy is smart and the effects are great. If you like horror and like the idea of a horror movie with an evil clown who lives in a mansion and makes the victim's wish come true then I'd give this a go.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought I could relate.   This film is based on the real life event of the D. B. Cooper  hijacking.  The film begins with Cooper (Richard Donner) arriving at the Cooper Union to deliver a book about the history of American Indians.  He then enters the elevator in which Cooper Union employees (most of them blacks) are waiting.  After a moment, they hear a noise in the elevator.  Cooper then opens the door and finds that the elevator is empty.  A few seconds later, he sees a black man standing in front of the elevator doors.   Cooper is not sure if the black man is a robber or a victim.  But Cooper does have his gun, so he does not pull the trigger.  Although he thinks he saw the robber on the television, the robbery never took place.  However, he did see two black men.   The film takes place in a dark room with a lot of shadows,  and it is eerie.   It is a good suspense film and has an excellent screenplay.   I really enjoyed this movie and recommend it to everyone.   (This review is from 1977, but it has a lot more to it than the above review.  The movie was released in 1970, but still has the same vibe and feel as the film's trailer.  )   I am sure that this movie has a connection to the real-life story of D.B. Cooper.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first saw "Ain't Them Bodies Saints," I was so disappointed.   I loved the movie, but, as with many good movies, there are parts I really didn't care for.  There were several scenes that made me want to stop watching and walk away because they were too awkward or annoying to watch.  But I kept watching because I wanted to know what would happen next.  The film is a prequel to "Bodies" and is more focused on the love story of Jules and Nancy, which is what made me so excited about it.  I'm so glad they made this movie because it's a very good one.  You may or may not know who Jules' dad is and where he's from.  He's a bad guy and is known for doing terrible things to his daughter and the woman that he falls in love with.  Jules has a lot of problems.  When he first gets over his father's death, he gets depressed because his daughter has a new stepmother and he has no one to talk to about his pain.  Then he gets a visit from Nancy and they fall in love.  In many ways, Jules is the hero of the film because he tries so hard to be there for his new stepmom.  This helps him to cope with his father and makes him stronger for it.    The movie follows Jules as he tries to adjust to a new life and new surroundings.  Nancy and her daughter are living with a family who are in no way like the ones he grew up with.   While Jules doesn't change much, he grows up and learns to accept a new way of life.  It's not pretty, but it's okay.   "Ains't Them Dead Saints" is the perfect movie for anyone who wants to feel bad for Jules.  Its short, so it won't bother anyone that much, but there's enough there that you won't feel like you're missing out on anything.  Also, Jools Holland (of "The West Wing" fame) stars as Jules, so you know the movie isn't gonna be too bad.  In addition to Jules (as well as Nancy) there's also a younger Nancy and she tries to get Jules to go to a school to finish his high school degree.  Unfortunately, Nancy's stepmother is very strict about her new stepchildren and J
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (No negative words here. Just a good one.)   I am really surprised at how many times I heard people saying "this movie is boring". I was surprised too.   However, I think that if you really try to watch it, the movie starts to make sense. But that might be because I watched it for two weeks and I was watching it for the first time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love this film. It's a solid sequel to the original (which I think deserves to be made a third time - and probably has to - if this sequel doesn't make people cry in bed that night), and it shows that good movies can be made as well as bad ones. It also has a strong male protagonist, and that's something that always made me fall in love with John Travolta in the first film, so that's a plus in my book. Also, the soundtrack by the great Hans Zimmer is very well done. And the story itself is absolutely brilliant. The ending is especially good.    Here's a picture of Travant's character, Rorschach: It's also worth mentioning that some of the special effects (like the bullet whizzing through the air), as well, were pretty awesome.  So, my review is actually a recap of the first part: A man, obsessed with his own thoughts and that he is a superhero, is taken to another reality to fight criminals that exist in this reality. He then gets into the head of a police officer, and ends up making him the hero he always wanted to be. In fact, this is the best part of the film, because it shows how a person who is so obsessed with becoming a superhero can be turned into a hero when he's put in a situation that makes him realize that he's actually just a normal person. This is also the best scene in the film. The rest of the movie is a mess, but this one scene is awesome. And for a film that's already so good, the ending is just brilliant.  In the first, I mentioned that this film is set in the 80s (I'd say before the 80's), and while that's the case, I'd guess that the film is in the middle of the 70s. The film also has the help of one of the most famous directors of all time, Stanley Kubrick, who was at one time a big influence on the original. As I said before, I would put this movie with the likes of the original and "Blade Runner" as a good example of a good 70s sci-fi film.  As a final note, while I think this movie is worth seeing, I don't think you need to see it in theaters or on DVD. For some people, this may be a good film to watch on Netflix or some other streaming service
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a way, this is what Hollywood is doing right now, just like any other industry that is looking for a quick buck. But, they are doing it in a completely irresponsible way. This is something that is so wrong on so many levels, and it shows that they are taking this so seriously. But as a child who has watched many terrible movies, I can tell you that I am not seeing this as just a kid's movie. I feel that this is something much more dangerous for society.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'll be honest, I was hoping the film would be better. I would have been much more pleased. But, I liked it. I liked the plot, I enjoyed the characters, I appreciated the cinematography, and I liked how it was done.   The film wasn't perfect. It didn't have that old movie magic. I guess that's what happens when you don't have actors like Don Cheadle, John Malkovich or Jodie Foster. But that's just the film's fault, and there is a great reason for it.  So, I guess I'm going to be disappointed by some things.  The dialogue was the biggest problem, it wasn't good and, even though there were many good moments, I thought it was a bit cliche.  But, I also like a good cliche, and the movie had plenty of that.  I was sad about how this movie turned out, but it was still a nice experience. It was fun and enjoyable.  Now, for a review... I give it a 3.6 out of 5.  The Verdict:  So, that's a good way to conclude this review, huh?   I'm sorry if I got a bit preachy there.  For me, this movie was a nice adventure, and if you've been wanting to watch an old film, I think this one is a good place to start.  And I'm glad it's over.  This film was very good. I'll definitely watch it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The last third of the film was just the most incredible, but also a very weak third act. The beginning is a very good bit of filmmaking, but it is very hard to feel good when they are killing people. There is a huge difference between killing people and doing some good. The acting is horrible, and I guess they were trying to have a sense of humour. The last act was just extremely weak, the movie has only two or three good scenes in it. There was nothing left to do and they all have the same meaning. This is just a very bland movie.  3.5 out of 4 stars.    Why did I watch:  The first film was a masterpiece.  I watched this second film with great anticipation because I thought I was getting to see a great third act and to see how it could have been different.  The movie was very entertaining, but in a weak way.  What did I like about this movie?  The film was very much based on a book called The Devil's Chessboard by Fyodor Dostoevsky. The book has some very interesting elements. It explores the idea of good and evil.  It tells the story of a man, who after being trapped in a dark room he must try to free himself.  This man is played by Russell Crowe. The man is very likable and has a nice presence. This man starts to see his own true colours.  Dostoyevsky also talks about this man's feelings and his mental state as he tries to be free from his condition.  However, all this does not help the movie. The movie has very little plot, and it was hard to follow. There are some good scenes, but they are very hard watch.  Why did I not enjoy this movie: The acting was also extremely bad. It was very hard not to laugh at how the people act and how they talk. Even the actors, who have some good personalities, acted like a group of idiots. The film felt very cheesy, and there was not a lot of humour in the movie in general. The script, the story, and the direction were all very weak.  There were also a few scenes that are just too short and I really did not understand what they were talking about.  If you are looking for a good film to watch that will have some great content in it, give this film a try, but only if you are a
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is an entertaining and well-made movie. If you like comedy, you'll love this movie. It is a comedy of manners and manners. If your in a serious mood, this movie is not for you.    The movie shows a lot of good manners and social etiquette. The movie is made up of four separate segments. All of them are good and funny. ! - The movie starts off with a scene in which the students of the American College, which is in London, find out that their English is quite bad. The teacher has given the students a "test".   In the test, the students have to recite a line from the English song, "The Old Man Down the Lane". There are many funny parts, but there is a good scene where the student tries to recite the line, but fails because he is afraid of the accent of the other boy in the class. The students try out the phrase, "I'm an American from Boston". The teacher tries to help them out, saying, "What a funny line." However, this makes the students think he is mocking them.  When the boy in front of the group goes down the stairs, all the students jump out of the class and laugh uproariously, and the teacher says to the boy, "If you are going down, then you better take it easy." The boy goes down and then says, "Well, it's been great seeing all of you, but now I've got to go to bed". !! - In the next part of the movie, the professor shows the students how to handle an argument. There are several funny parts and good manners. At one point, the teacher is explaining something to the class, and a student comes up to him. The boy says, with a serious tone, "Professor, I think you are a terrible teacher." The teacher is amazed and asks him, "But that's a good point!" !   - This is one of my favorite parts of the film because it features a funny scene of the students trying to find a substitute teacher. There is a scene where one student tries desperately to find someone, while another student is asking if he should go to a different school because all his friends are gone.  This scene is good because it teaches the students what is a substitute and how to find one. The class is finally able to find their substitute teacher at the theater.    - In a segment called "
Write a positive review about a good movie:    " I found myself laughing out loud more often than I was crying....     The script is so well done that it seems to be written for a film audience, and this is the only reason I was bothered by the dialogue."  - A. M. Homes, Los Angeles Times  The New York Times reviewed the movie in " The Story of the Man from Pluto."   "If it were not for the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and the fact that the hero, Mr. Wilson, had a talent of his own and was able to control himself, one would not have the slightest doubt that it would be one of those sensational productions which can never be reproduced."  - The New York World "The story of Wilson is interesting and interesting because it is so wonderfully done and so realistically painted that one is continually in awe of what is going on.  .. There is a definite feeling of a man who is getting more and more out of life."  "Mr. Hyde is quite a good picture of a very peculiar type of man. He is almost mad in a way, but he is a madman nevertheless.  The movie will surely appeal to the intelligent audience and also to the general public."  The story of Mr. J.G. Wilson is more difficult to write than the story for his brother's story, the one I have already told.. The two stories are of the same length, and both have a good deal of suspense, but in different aspects.  The Jekyl and Hyde is based on the life of Dr Jekll. Jef J.J. Hyde, as he was called, was one of the most notorious criminals in Chicago and was one who could command the admiration of most of the people.  He was a man of extraordinary talents.  In his first arrest, he was able, with a revolver in his pocket, to take three robbers and shoot them.  Later on, Jef was arrested for stealing a $500 bond and sent to jail.  While in jail he became a good friend of Dr Charles R. Wilson of St. Paul. Mr. Hyed said to Dr Wilson, when he was in prison, "It is your good fortune that I have a brother-in-law who is a surgeon."  Dr Wilson was also a patient in Jef's hospital, and he was the one who
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this movie to be more enjoyable than The King's Speech. The director was not afraid to put in a character that was obviously in love with his own face. It's almost like you could sense the love that he felt for his own eyes.  But it is the way the story and characters are presented that is what made the movie so good. The story follows a couple that have a love affair that goes bad and ends up with them both going into a coma. When the couple wakes up, they are in their old clothes, and their relationship has all been a farce. The movie portrays the couple as having had the same goals, but they had changed for some reason.  The couple are given a little break when their baby brother (the son of one of the characters) dies from an accident. The husband is very upset about the loss and he is forced to try and bring his son back. The two characters have to get past the dead son, and the man's love for his wife.  The movie ends with the couple coming out of their coma and the husband admitting that it wasn't the love of his wife that ended their affair but the love for their son.   It made me feel like I had been through that sort of love affair as I watched it. The couple have to go through all of the pain of having lost their son and also trying to regain their love in the face of everything that has happened.  I would recommend this movie. It is very dark and the characters were very well done. I didn't like The King, but I like this movie a lot better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good film is better than a perfect film.  I think the film's good in almost every way, though the performances can sometimes be over the top.  The story is decent and the story doesn't get convoluted or overly complicated.  It may have been interesting, though I'd probably have enjoyed the film more if it had been a bit more original.  There is one thing the film does that is truly outstanding:  This shot is amazing!   There is a wonderful shot in the film where we see a ship flying through a cloud of vapor which then disappears.   The only time the film is visually interesting is in the scene at the very beginning where we are shown the "perfect" world in which the film was based on and then we are introduced to the world of the "wrong" Earth.  This is what makes the film so interesting.  When the film tells us that we have the right world, and then when the film shows us the "evil" world, the world that was shown in the "right" film, it is an incredible moment to watch and the film pulls it off perfectly.  We are not shown the evil world, but we are given the chance to see how the "beautiful" world actually is.  What an awesome shot!  This shot is an awesome example of a shot that makes you forget that you are in a movie and that it is in a film.  I really love this shot.  You see the perfect world, we see the evil "world", and we see "beauty" in the middle.  Amazing! The story:    This is one of the weaker elements of the film.   It is a very simplistic story that is easily forgiven by the fact that it has so many amazing scenes.  At first, this seems like it could be an ok story.    The planet is the right place for the perfect humans and their beautiful home.  After a small mishap, the humans come across an evil world.  As the film goes on, the story gets more interesting and the action scenes are some of the best in the movie.  Even though the story could have been improved, I would still give it a 9/10.  If I had more time to kill, I'd watch this story again. There are a lot of other elements that were very creative in this film, but for some reason, this film failed to impress me enough
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot was a little bit interesting, at least it gave me something to think about. I think this was probably my first movie in which the plot didn't matter, which was nice. And that being said, I didn't really care if the plot got explained or not. If you are looking for a plot, this is not the movie for you. I had to rewatch it a couple of times, and I did just to get to the last 15 minutes, and this is a bad movie because it tries to have a decent plot. I don't see the point of a movie where the main character gets locked up and the main plot device is what he is doing with his time. So, there is a time jump, then there is this twist that makes no sense, and it just doesn't add to the plot, and you already know where everything will end up. The characters were ok, but I don�t really care what they are doing in the movie because I am already familiar with them. I found this movie hard to listen to. I am not sure why the movie is called �Star Wars�, but it just sounds so old to me. The dialogue is not very interesting either. I really liked the music and some of the sound effects. I just felt bored. This movie just does not appeal to me at all.   My Rating: 3/10  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think that all the hype is justified, this is a solid film which really puts together a good cast. I think it is a little too long and too long is something that I really don't like, but I guess they want us to have a lot of stuff to think about. What I liked about this film was the story line, it was really well written and it really showed us a bit more about the people that we meet in the movie, but still managed to get the tone of the movie just right. The performances were really good, even though I can see that the kids aren't the greatest actors, but we get a good amount of screen time with them. And this is one of the better movies to come out in the last few years, a great film and I'm glad that it is in theaters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie was a real eye opener for me. It reminded me how much of a good story the people in this world really can tell. This movie really makes you believe that people can have emotions, even when we can't see it. The characters were very realistic, and I think a lot of the time we don't know who these people really are. The only thing I don't like about this movie is it seems like there is more to the story. In the movie I saw there are more events that the audience is unaware of. I think that a lot more of that story needs to be shown and told so people can fully understand this movie and what is happening in this movie. I really hope that the makers of this movie will show more of this story in the sequels to this movie, so that more people can enjoy this movie as much as I did. Overall I was really happy with this movie overall, and it really was a great experience watching this movie to understand more about the people and their feelings.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would have to say that I love this movie. I feel like this is the best adaptation of a novel to have come out in a very long time. It's very well written and I'm actually quite satisfied with how it turned out.  I really thought the movie did a great job at making it feel like the author was a young man at that time and his life as a man, a husband, and a father, would be much more difficult. While I do understand why this would be hard to believe in a time when this was possible, it definitely isn't. In the novel the main character would often say things like, "You're only young once, so you don't understand why I have to struggle, why I must try." This movie does a great deal of work at making this idea believable. There is an element of this film that makes it seem more like a fantasy, but this is not the case at all.    The main character is a man who was raised in the midst of this kind of oppression. He lives his life in a completely normal way and does the normal things that a young boy would do. He has friends, but not many.   He doesn't grow up seeing the things he would have seen growing up in the 1950s and 60s and that kind of makes me happy. Even though the film feels a lot like a dream, it's not so much like a nightmare. It feels like the kind of dream that a person with normal views might experience. I also find this film a bit more sympathetic and real than some of the ones I've seen before.  A few of the people that he meets in his life remind him of people he has known since he was a child.  This is a story that has a lot of depth to it and I feel that it's very believable. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.  My only real gripes with the movie is that the final third does seem like it could be slightly better. I don't know what it was that I didn't like about this movie, but the story just seemed to get dragged out more and more. It wasn't as good as it could have been. It could have made a really great movie, if it didn't have so much dragging to it.  Rating: 8/10 (Good)

The exercises are helpful, but they take a while to master (and if you know what you are doing, you will have more success with the exercises.) For an in-depth review, I would suggest this site: http://cinematic-style-film.com/ The book seems to use the same techniques, so the book should be useful for everyone.  Anime & Manga Review by: Joe  : (no rating)  that's the end of the review. I just want to say thanks to the author for his work. I'm just a little bit surprised and not that impressed by the book. the first one in my collection was my first and I didn't know what to expect. so I thought it was really boring for a lot of reasons. and the book changed all that. I really like the exercises. I don't know why but it feels like it is an authentic film making method and not just a book that gives the same ideas as some of the books of "old" filmmakers who make a lot more money than this guy. i feel like this is the start of a revolution. I think this guy is way way way on the right track. I love the ideas and I think that he is a genius. He's a great guy and I really hope we all get to see his movies. I know they were tough when he made them. so i don't mind watching them on DVD. I would have loved to see them on TV. That's my favorite format and you can watch it on any TV, anywhere. if you have a TV with DVD player this is a great way to see some good old movies.  a lot has happened since then. there are still some good movies out there. but I can't believe that this guy can make them like this. he knows that people like to see movies like this because they are so simple and so pure. I want to make films like this one day and I hope that it is him and I can learn to do it with him. I'd give the book a 5/5. . I agree with the author that the basic idea is the same as the basic techniques in any other film making book. The book is very helpful for newbies and for professionals, just
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw the movie at the cinema as it was being released and was instantly hooked by the storyline and all the action scenes. I was hooked when the movie's villain made an impulsive decision to kill her father, which set the plot of the movie in motion. I loved the romance between Jadzia and Miles (played by Liam Neeson and Jamie Foxx), but, sadly, I could not stop thinking about the main antagonist who is played by Timothy Olyphant and, after I watched the film, I was thinking of a murder that I know too well. The film ended in a very brutal way with both characters dead, and the villain being executed. It was not easy to see the bad guys killed in the final act but, ultimately, Jadzeia's death and the way that Miles was executed was not as gruesome as I had feared. The ending of the film was a very satisfying one, I loved it a lot.   Recommended for fans of: the mafia, James Bond, James Caan, a lot of action, great acting and a great storyline. If you love a good James Bond movie, you should watch this one.  I watched this after having watched Die Another Day, which I enjoyed.  Jadzya and Miles go on a trip to an island.  This island is home to an old woman (I think it's Mme. Bourienne), her grandson, the mafia and some gangsters. Jadzieia wants to stay with her grandfather and to help him find the truth about the kidnapping that he has suffered. Miles tries to persuade Jadza to go with him.  Miles tries a number of schemes, but all fail and, when the old lady dies, his family is devastated. Miles is in the hands of Jadzykia, his lover for quite some time and Jadzikia is looking for him. Jazzy and the others make a decision and, in the end, the main bad guys are killed by Miles and Jazza.  What I liked about this film: -It was very difficult to see a character killed in this film (although it happened in the first half of the second act). -I did not know who would be killed by whom but I always thought that it was the gangsters that Miles would be working with. - The way that the plot developed after the old woman died was very interesting. - I felt that I had a
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In this movie the main character (who is called Zeb) and his friends are going on a camping trip and he gets into a fight with the guy in front of him (a guy called Zem) for not letting them eat lunch in the same spot where they eat lunch every other day. In the movie this guy gets stabbed and later on the main characters decides to get revenge.   I thought this movie was good, it was entertaining and the main point was to be about a fight but in the end I thought the movie was too over the top and the whole thing just seemed so ridiculous, you know, the guys got stabbed by a sword and later when Zeb and his buddies are driving back to camp he says, "You guys know that I got the real sword?" and this guy goes and tries to stab him in the neck with a kitchen knife but Zeb kicks the knife away and when Zem goes over to retrieve his knife he gets shot in the back and gets stabbed through the stomach. And then he dies.  The only other thing that was interesting about the movie besides the fight was that the main guy was a little bit of a douche to everybody. His main enemy in the movie is called the 'Fist of Vengeance' because he wants to kill everyone on the group of kids because he was bullied and also he wants everyone to die. He was also a bit of an asshole when it came to his mom (the mom of Zem, a girl in the camp) and how she treated him. So when Zeeb and his crew were camping he is just a little bitchy towards his mom and starts having a fight in front the tent where he and his mom are sleeping and they end up breaking into the tent and fighting with the mom and Zeb gets stabbed by the mom. When he is asked what happened to his friends he starts to cry and says that they are dead but he will find a way to get them out and also promises his mom that he will get her revenge on the Fist of Vengeance.    In the end of the movie Zeb ends up killing the Fist with a chainsaw, but not before trying to bite his own hand off. He doesn't get the chance because the main protagonist dies and the movie ends.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Why am I blogging about this movie again?   I watched this movie in theatres on Saturday, April 24th, 2017. It's a "superhero" movie, so naturally, there was a lot of talk of the heroes.   At the start of the movie, there is a brief mention of how all the superhero movies are set in the same universe, and that they are all connected. This idea is dropped, and it's explained that there are "universes" which are not connected to any other "universe."   Then, a super soldier named Captain Marvel (Tessa Thompson) is sent to Earth to train a younger version of herself, Kamala Khan (a 12-year old girl from Jersey City). When Kamala is brought to Earth, her parents are both killed, and her father has become the villainous Black Bolt (a bad guy who steals others' powers and gives them to himself.)   Kamala, who has been taken in by the X-Men, discovers that she has been granted the power of super speed, and joins the team as the new Captain Marvel.  The movie is pretty fun, with fun action sequences.  Marvel has a pretty cool comic book world and an intriguing character to play with.  Tessa was great as Kamala in this movie.  As I said before, the plot was pretty basic.  But if you have read the other Marvel comics, and this movie's predecessor, Civil War, you will find much to like about it.  They make their "university" seem pretty much like the real world.  There are plenty of comic book references, and there are superpowered people and vehicles all around you.  What made the movie a bit disappointing for me was how poorly the supporting cast was portrayed.  I mean, look at this:  A bunch of people with the same powers as me!  These people are not even worth talking about.   Marvel's movie characters are in the comics, so of course, they will have their flaws.  In a very small amount of scenes, it seemed as though they were trying to make the movie about the Marvel characters. The only Marvel character in this film that seems to have any importance is The Vision (a robot created by Hank Pym) and, even then, it seems as though the movie was trying to shoehorn in a movie about that character.  While it was cool that the
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie can do a lot of different things. A good movie is a good, fun movie. A great movie is one that stands out from the crowd. A classic movie is something that is truly great and is a part of cinema history. There are many different definitions of the word "classic". There are also many different standards for what makes a great movie. The definition of a great classic movie can change over the years as well. If a movie can hold up for decades it has to be a classic. For a while, it seemed like The Big Lebowski (1998) was one of the greats. A decade or two after it's release, however, people began to realize it was a pretty boring movie. Then came the new age of comedies with films like Anchorman, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Wedding Crashers, Bridesmaids, The Other Guys, Office Space, etc. The list goes on and on. One of the best examples of a new age movie was 2010's The Master. It was an incredibly different movie from the earlier films in the new wave of comedys. It also broke the traditional comedy mold and was an amazing example of a modern classic movie. It won a lot and came in at #7 on the Top 10 list. The movie was not a great comedy, it was not even a great drama. It is still a very good movie. What makes a classic movie: A great classic is one where everyone is just as amazed by it's greatness as the audience. The reason that The Big Bang Theory is a great show is because it is amazing, it has this amazing sense of wonder and mystery. It's like you are there in this world and it's not a fake world. It could be one of a thousand movies. It has all these different people in this great world. You just sit and watch this show and realize the great writers that worked on this show did such a good job of putting so much life and humor into it's world. What makes a show great: There are so many different types of shows out there. There is the dramatic show, which usually is something with a lot going on. The show may be about a person in a big city in this city or it may be a show about a group of people on this side of the country. There may be conflict going on, there may be comedy going on or a romantic comedy. The best of these shows
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like what you just read?   Go to Netflix and search for "The King's Speech" and you'll find hundreds of reviews that are positive. In the same way, the same should be true for The King's English. It is an excellent movie. If you like it, you should watch it. I know I did. The film is a brilliant adaptation of a great work of literature. The play has two very different approaches to the same events. It starts in a small way, and by the time we reach the climax, the audience has already seen the events unfold on stage. The first part of the play is a tragedy. One man commits suicide, in front of a crowd of people who know he has a fatal disease. The second part of this tragic play is the love story between two characters, and is the movie. This is the story of the two friends who want to get out of England so that they can be together in Paris. The whole thing was a play, so there are parts of the film which are adapted from the stage play. The actors play the characters very well. The only thing which I wish was different is that they made a film out of it. The two actors in the play, Stephen Fry and Bill Nighy, play the role of Richard and Geraldine in a way that I have never seen before. The difference is that Bill Nghy plays Geraldine with more authority. He uses the same kind of humour that he used in The Office. In fact, he is even funnier in this movie than he is in The office. As for Stephen Fry, he uses the character in a much more complicated way than his role in the TV series Extras. For example, the scenes when Richard and Bill walk past the Queen and Prince Charles in Buckingham Palace are shot in a different way. They even look different. This movie is just a good time. There is a lot of action. There are also a lot less boring scenes. The scene where Richard and his friend walk past Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace is a good example of how good action scenes can be. There's a lot going on in this film, and the actors take it all in their stride. The main character, the character who has to be the hero and who takes the fall for the other characters, is also played very well by Richard Harris. The entire movie is a masterpiece. I can't recommend it highly enough.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Why you need to read this book:  (I think a few people may have read this and thought it's trash, but here's the problem with this: this book is about a character who's trying to figure out what to do with his life after he kills a man. At this point in the story, he's got a wife and two kids. This is when he's still a pretty cool dude. He's got enough money to buy the car he was driving when he killed his friend. He has a pretty good job. His parents have left him a pretty great life, if not the greatest. And he's living in a relatively safe area (and his car works, so who needs it?). He also is doing his best to keep his head above water. But at a certain point, he starts to realize that his life isn't really perfect.    So he turns to his friends.  He tells them about his troubles and tells them he'd like some advice. He gives them some money and tells one of them he's ready to go back to the old life.  Then things go south fast. It all builds to a pretty horrible, intense, and at times very sad ending. But it is also one of the most compelling and well-written chapters of the book. The main character (the person I'll call Mike) is incredibly likable. His friends are very good people. And the way that the book builds towards a major conflict is incredibly interesting. The problem:  at the end of the novel, you're left with a lot of questions. There's a huge amount of speculation out there about the ending. And, in a way, it makes for a much better ending than what the author gives you. The author is pretty clear in the book that he's not happy with how his story ended. But there's a lot more that could have been done with this story. The ending is very unsatisfying, but it also is a much more compelling conclusion than what you've just read.  Why it's worth reading: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What's new and what I've seen. What I haven't seen yet. Some quick notes on reviews, some things to look for, things I want to get out of the way. I have the DVD in a few of my libraries. I've not seen it yet and don't plan to. I can't watch it now because I'm in a meeting so don't want to distract myself from the meeting. I have the book and will review it on Amazon and Kindle when I get a chance. For this list I was just searching and couldn't find a list of some of my favorite movies. This is mostly a list for people who don't have many movies to watch. If you're someone who is an obsessive fan of a certain movie you're in for a real treat. I found myself in a bit of a dilemma where some of these movies were easy to find but others just seemed to be unavailable in the library so they were thrown into the mix. I'm still hoping to see some of them and I'm probably going to buy the BluRay for now. Some of these I've heard are available on VHS so there you go. Some I may even get to see on Netflix. You'll notice that it's a little bit more focused on comedies. Some are older with a bit more drama. Some have a bit less comedy than some of the other lists. Also, I did a lot of searching before putting this together. The majority of the movies have to do with the movies of the 60's. So, this isn't meant to be a list on just comedies, but a look at some of those great comedies of the 1960's and 1970's. They're probably not all in theaters or available on DVD or BluRay at this time. If one of them shows up and you can find it on some of your local video stores, you're golden. I didn't include films that were only available on network TV. So if you're looking for something that has an old fashioned feel, this might not be the best list for you. But if you want a movie with a good vibe and some classic laughs you can go ahead and check it out. If anyone notices a mistake, can add a few more or have another suggestion I'm all ears. Also check out the list of great movie quotes to help you out on those lonely nights. "If you don't mind, if you don,t get
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A great film, a great soundtrack, and a great script to boot.   I highly recommend this to everyone, and even more so to you. It would be remiss to not acknowledge the contributions of the cast and crew.   It is easy to forget that these are men who are playing men who played men, but I assure you it's not a "feminist" movie, it's about manhood.   The film would be more if the female characters were better-written but as it stands they are no different from the male counterparts in any way.   There is some interesting and interesting stuff that takes place.   These are not "mature" topics for a film but they are still interesting topics.   If this movie is anything like the music, it'll be a great watch.   Not everyone will enjoy this film, and if you are a male viewer I would not recommend it as much as a lot of the females are saying.   As a man, I could not see myself being at all attracted to the women in this movie.   All of them have their own character flaws and it makes for an interesting story line, but as a guy, I can't relate to a single female character.   They are just too different in every way.   I am not in the minority, it seems like more and more female characters are given roles where they are essentially sexual objects.   This is the trend in our society, we've become desensitized to what women look like.                                                                  I really feel like there is a lack of movies that are made for female audiences.   In the end, it comes down to "the male gaze" in movies that make the viewer think "that's a woman"  "that's sexy"    "she's hot".   We want to look at what we are "supposed" to look and feel.    We have no desire to be challenged and we need to be reminded that our gender is still equal and not a hindrance to anyone else's ability to accomplish anything.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      __________________________________________  - "A great action movie in the mold of the Lethal Weapon movies. With a great mix of old school and modern action, including the first ever rooftop fight, the action scenes are very well choreographed and the movie pulls off some cool moves. The movie isn't without its flaws, however. The actors in the lead roles are kind of unmemorable. In fact, one of the best characters of the movie is actually the villain, The Mandarin."  ___________________________________________________________   - 10/10 "My favorite movie in years, and I haven't seen The Mandarin since it came out. I'm sure that the first time I watched it I was a little shocked at its violent overtones, but I think it does a great job of capturing the feeling of a martial arts movie where the characters feel like real individuals in the real world. You feel as though you are watching a movie where you could potentially be involved in a car accident, and you are just as vulnerable as those in the film. The action scenes, especially those involving the car-related fight scenes, are truly spectacular." "A great character study of a good guy and a bad guy. A good mix of classic action and modern set-pieces, with excellent fight choreography. The character dynamics and the performances of the lead characters make The Mandarin an enjoyable watch for action fans, and martial arts fans as well." - Jason Bateman, star of Bourne, Bourne Identity, and The Machinist  __________________________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie:   (The movie I mentioned last is    ), but there are more I want to discuss. One of the first things I liked about this movie was the use of colour. The colours are vibrant, vibrant, colourful. It was nice to see some colours used in a movie instead of the typical black and white. The movie also uses colour well to really set the tone of the movie, especially in some of the scenes. The setting for the movie is an isolated island where only two kids live. The kids are the main characters in the movie and the movie tries to show how they deal with their isolation. For one, the boys have a really nice way of communicating. They don't talk back or have a mean bone in their body. The girls are the opposite, they are mean and don't really talk back. The boys also have a lot of fun, the guys are the jokers and the girls are there for the boys to play with and not really for the guys to date. There is also some humor in the scene as well, I found it funny when a girl asks a boy if he wanted to ride her as a horse. The guy then says he's afraid he'll break his leg in the saddle. Then she says "oh come on you can do that".   There is a lot more to this movie than what I can say about it, I recommend this movie to any child who wants a good laugh, to a younger child who will enjoy watching the characters, and to any adult who has some good laughs at the movie.   I have no idea where I'll watch it next, I've already watched it about 2 times now and I've liked it each time. I just hope they release more of these types of movies in the future.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - I had my dad watch this and he is a hardcore gamer. He loved it. I do not think it has the humor to do it justice. It was funny, but there were some times where I felt like they did not try hard enough.   "I'm a little shocked you didn't like the film. I did!"   What's that about. You are in charge here?  "I was disappointed in the ending, but what can you do? It was a good film!"  What a loser.  "It's hard to watch a film when you don't get a laugh. I'm surprised it has this many followers."    What a stupid statement. " I thought it was a very well made film."   Don't think it did it's job.  What is wrong with you?   A good movie?  An even better movie?

Write a positive review about a good movie:    (or you can even give the movie zero stars and ask people to help spread the word, but I won't, just because that would take up way too much space)   This is an awesome movie.   It's set in a high school and it's a comedy.  It has an awesome cast.  The movie is about a group of friends who meet one day after their parents die and they decide they're going to move to a new town.  There are a few weird stuff happening in the background, like a girl in love with a teacher who also happens to be her teacher's cousin.  This movie also has some weird, but funny, plot twists.  I was so entertained by this movie!   A great laugh, a very funny movie with an awesome soundtrack.  And there's a lot of heart and drama.  What more can you ask for.  (For those who want to listen to a bunch of music in this movie, I'll just let the video do it's thing) Get the album:

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The ending was very dramatic and felt that you needed more to make it work. This is the second film that I have seen that has this ending, and it felt that this movie was trying to make its own thing. There was some good stuff in this movie, and for the most part it was well-done, but the ending is not in keeping with the rest of the movie.  The film had a bit of an awkward, cliched vibe to it in some scenes and some scenes just felt really out of place in the story. It seemed like the filmmakers were going through the motions, so to speak.   I would not recommend this movie to anybody who does not like good horror movies, or is not interested in the more realistic end to the genre.  The reason I like the ending, or at least, some of the ending of this movie is the fact that the movie keeps you guessing. The movie takes a couple of very, very good scenes and uses them to create a new character that makes you question what is really going on. It takes you into the realm of the imagination, where the audience members can be entertained by what they see and feel and the idea of what is going on with the characters.       The film takes a lot of the horror elements from the original Saw film and adds to them. You have a lot more gore, and there are some scenes that are much better than the ones in the original. The ending of the film is well done, and was quite emotional, which made the ending great, although it felt like it needed a bit more.    After watching the original film, I can honestly say that the film was a lot better.  It was also more suspenseful, and the horror element was much more focused on in the film. I feel that it would have been much better if the movie had ended on a happy note. I think that this could have been done, but in a different way. As it stands, I still love this movie and think that it is worth a watch for anyone that likes the classic Saw movies, but wants to try something different. It is not a horror movie for everyone, but it is a film for people who like classic horror movies. I gave this movie a good rating, but do not hesitate to leave a bad review for the movie, as it would be really rude for me to do that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoy this movie. I saw it after watching "The Godfather" and it is so close to the original that it's no wonder they made the movie as good as it is. As a matter of fact, I think I prefer this film as the original.   In addition to the quality of the acting and direction, I really loved the originality of the plot.  My first thought after watching the original is that it looks the way it was supposed to, and I still think it looks that way. This film, which is based on a short story by a young, talented writer, is a combination of mystery, horror and comedy. I think it's all part of a really great story and plot. The script is clever, the characters are well developed and, as I said, the movie is so funny that I kept laughing.    One of the reasons I enjoyed this film so much was that it never tries to be too dramatic or dark. It's about a man who has a gift for turning a simple murder into something incredible. I was really fascinated by the way the film shows a man with a gift, and how he is tormented by it.  The movie itself is not too long, and it's not really too violent, but it has a certain feeling that it is supposed to be a bit violent, and that's just part of the humor of the film.  "The Man Who Killed Don Corleone" is such a clever, well-made movie that I don't think any one can go wrong with it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm sure you know by now that I'm a massive fan of Mad Max. The last time I saw it (at the London Film Festival in 2011) it was in 3D, with an absolutely amazing, jaw-dropping, adrenaline-fueled fight sequence that was totally awesome. I've seen the movie a couple of times since, and it's even better in IMAX!  So it is really no surprise that the new film in the franchise, Fury Road, is a great time for me. It has so many cool and interesting parts that I was hooked the minute I saw them (and even though I only saw it last week, there was still lots to like about it).  One thing that has been bothering me about this film in particular is that the trailers for it didn't really convey that it was set in the 80's, when the film was supposed to be set in 1984. I thought that would be pretty important information, given how much it is meant to stand out as a modern classic. I'm also a huge fan of the old-school, grungy, punk rock feel of the whole series (see my previous reviews of MadMax and Mad Max: Fury Road), and I can see how a lot of people were going to enjoy it in that way, but I can't help but feel that some of the original character designs, the cool car stunts, and the overall style of the film would have been even more awesome in the 90's (I mean, look at that poster).  of The Mad Max Fury Road Poster  And if you're one of those people who liked the 90s, you may have even noticed that there is a reference to the '60s and '70s in the trailer too.  A few years ago, I decided to look up what happened to this Mad Max movie when it was supposed the take place in 1984, and this is what I found:  In 1985, Fox and director George Miller were busy working on a different project called The Road Warrior, which was supposed be set at the same time as the Mad Max series, but it was never completed. After that, the filmmakers worked on a new Mad Max script called Death Race 2000, which also wasn't going to be made into a movie.  I'm really not sure why Fox and Miller decided to set this movie at a time that they didn't think would ever be made, but that's what I've read (
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've been going to movies in Los Angeles for over fifteen years and I think I've seen just about every movie festival in the world. There are some who are very good and some who suck. I think the movies here are a lot better than the movies in Europe.   It's a very good movie about people who live in the real world. It's about a guy who has a wife and child. He works for a bank where he meets a girl, which turns out to be his girlfriend. When he comes back, his girlfriend has married someone else and is a woman. He realizes that he has to go back to work for a different bank, or he'll lose his job.  He is very frustrated that his relationship with his wife is turning into a marriage, but he can't get out.  This movie will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat and is one of my favorite movies.  I really enjoyed the movie and thought the characters were funny and really thought it was good to see a female lead in a film.  The actors were all very nice and very believable.  The movie is about a man who loses his job and goes back to his hometown to work. This town has become a real backwater and he really can't go back home, but the town is so close and he thinks that he could get a good job in the city. He tries to go out and find a job, but everyone in the town has been killed in a violent incident. It seems like everything that has happened to his life is because of the town.  My only other suggestion is to make his work with a bank that's not really a bank in the end, but just a small business. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this movie to be good, with a good ending and a well-written plot, but not much to write home about.  I was very disappointed with the ending, but the movie overall was well done.   The story focuses on an artist whose work is being stolen by a thief named Burt (played by Michael Shannon).   Burt is a brilliant man, and he has to steal a painting of his master's from his apartment before it is destroyed.  To steal the painting, Burt must steal from other artists that also hold a huge piece of art.  When Burt goes to the art dealer (played superbly by George Clooney), and Burt uses his genius to steal the master piece, the dealer has a huge surprise for Burt, and it causes him to break down in tears.  The master piece is a real life painting, and this was done in real life by the late great Salvador Dali.  This film has a fantastic ending, which is what the title of this movie indicates.  With a well crafted plot and a great ending, this movie has it all.  It is not too heavy handed, and the film is also very watchable.    In fact, I highly recommend this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A positive review is the equivalent of a thumbs up. If you find the movie great or at least good, or if you like it because it's not bad and you like to watch bad movies, then give a positive. If the movie is actually bad and/or really boring, just skip it.   You can use the buttons above to create a short review, and they're helpful to have at your disposal. The first one is a "Good". The second one is "Nice". But the most important one is an "Amazing", which will get you the most "upvotes" on Youtube. It's important to use a "New" rating to avoid spammy videos.  But it's very important to read the comments and give some feedback to the author. The reason I'm doing this is because he posted a very bad review of "I Am Legend". So I thought I'd give a constructive review. And I'll keep it brief because this review is already very long!  I like horror movies. There's something so scary and creepy about them, and in my opinion, every director who makes horror movies is doing it wrong. The "I am Legend" movie, on the other hand, does not impress me at all. I think it's too slow and the acting is just so bad. It makes me hate this movie even more than I did the first time. But then again, I really did hate the first one too, so it's really weird.  The acting is bad, the pacing is bad and the scares are just so weak. It is one of those movies where if you think about it for a few seconds, it's easy to come up with things that were wrong.  I do love horror movies, and the director has even said he'd make a horror movie in his own style, but I don't know if he's capable of it.   I think if someone knows something different about this movie (if not a good horror movie expert), it's probably best to just watch the movie and then just skip to the good bits.  My advice? Watch it again and then watch it again. It may be a little boring, but if you really love this movie, you'll probably like it even more.  This movie isn't like "The Last House On The Left", "The Strangers" or "Saw". This is an original film that tries too hard and fails in the end

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't know if you guys have seen this movie yet, but I'm going to make a bet that you haven't.  I'll pay $30 to whoever is able to beat this score.  If you beat my score, you will win a free movie from VUDU. The movie was just okay.  Not a bad movie, just not an amazing one either.  Maybe it's because of the film's nature as a documentary that I didn't think much of it.  There wasn't a great deal going on in the film.  The story focuses on three teenagers, and their families, in the late 60's and early 70's, in Long Beach, California.  Each family members has a distinct view of how a certain subject should be presented to the public.  That was it.   The music was just ok, although the score by Michael Giacchino was pretty good.  We got to hear songs from The Beach Boys, Bob Dylan, and others.  They were ok, but didn't wow me.  This was a film that I could've shown to the casual music watcher and they wouldn't know any of the music.  Also, the story is just a bit too short and doesn't feel like it has a complete ending. There are some great scenes in the movie that do shine.  One particular scene was a great scene.  After going through a number of tests to see if their music could pass inspection, the three kids get on a bus and head off to Long Beach.  As they get into the car, the music is turned up very high.  Their parents are concerned, and they decide to stop the car to look around.  You see them in the mirror, and see that they have this great bass line in their music.    In the mirror...  You see what's happening... The scene is fantastic because it shows the three guys in a whole new light.  It shows the kids and their parents really understanding the importance of music.   As their music plays, they are singing it, just like they are in the moment.  Watching them be kids, instead of watching them as adults, is something to see.  And, it was a cool scene.   The film was directed by Jim Jarmusch, and the film doesn't have any of his famous imagery.  It's more like a typical documentary, where
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "It's all right."    "I'm glad this is all right.  ."   The first time I read this line was back in 1969. It has stuck with me since then, as if there is some other truth to it that makes the passage all the more meaningful to me. The second time I re-read the line I remember being at a movie theater. My father was in attendance with my parents and I was in a row to the right. I was sitting next to a young woman, and she had just seen a film that was rated R.  It was an action film.  That's my father in the picture.  My father is the one in the center of the photo.  I was quite impressed at the film.   I remember that the young woman had been watching it for the first time, and I think she was impressed at how well acted the film was.  The young woman then said something to her companion, who was to my left, "That's all very well, but what about the characters?"   And she pointed to me and said:  "Your character is just a dumb, stupid guy."  In the theater, I was shocked.  It didn't occur to me that she was talking about me personally.  That is a thought that lingers with me in terms of the way the character was written.  When I first read the line my reaction was one of shock.  At first I didn't know why.  As I reread it over the years, I have been struck by the irony of it, but I've always found that the line captures exactly what I think.  We are not really characters in the movie. We are just one character in an ensemble.  So we are not in the film at all.  In order to have the experience we do, we must go along with the other characters and let ourselves be absorbed by them.  Even if our character doesn't matter much, or even if it's something we don't care about, we need to be absorbed into the film for it to make sense. I don't mean that it is impossible for us to be absorbing and absorbed into these films without meaning something about them. But if the character is only an observer, without much to say or contribute to the film, we don 't see it.  What makes a film really a great movie is when you are absorbed and absorbed
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The title's not the only thing you'll notice here: the movie starts out as a typical film about a man trying to find love in an unusual environment. But it becomes much more, as the story shifts from one of a young man struggling to prove himself in the face of a society that's largely rejecting him, to a man, his fiancée, and his son on a quest through the depths of the ocean looking for a mermaid.  It's a well-written movie, with enough twists and turns to keep you on your toes.   It's interesting to see what might have been, had the story been adapted more successfully. It's an interesting and engaging story, and with the film's focus on an oceanographic expedition, it's a story that many have taken to be something of a fairytale. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So here's a story that doesn't really exist - or maybe it does and I just don't know about it because I've never seen the movie (I can't find a review, either, by the way - a movie is either good or bad? - and I think you need to see it to find out). Anyway - the movie is called "Star Wars: A New Hope." I've seen a lot of Star Wars movies. I like them. I was going to go to see the first one in theaters when it came out in the 70s but I decided not to (though it is pretty cool). I have watched "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan" and I like that one. I have seen "Starman." I like all of the films in the Star Wars series. I think they are good, I think that they are all very good films. I am glad that this movie is making a comeback and that it is doing better than some of the other movies in the series.   I really like the first film in the franchise - and that is "StarWars." It's an interesting premise. There are a bunch of heroes fighting evil. It is easy to see why some people like it and some people don't. I love the original "StarLord" character who is played by Paul Bettany, and he is a great villain (though he is not evil enough). I like the other bad guys (Bala, Artoo, and Threepio), and I particularly like the two females, Leia and Senator Bail Organa, because I think there is a lot to like about them. The plot is straightforward and there is no mystery. It's a simple battle between good guys and evil guys. It has its surprises. This movie is a must-see for any Star Wars fan.  (Click on the following to watch the movie on Youtube)  The original StarWars is really funny, but this movie really nails it - the actors are really funny. They really know how to use the lines of the characters. The action scenes are amazing. The dialogue between the heroes and villains is witty, sarcastic, and hilarious.  And this movie was very successful. It went straight to #1 and stayed there for years. There were sequels, remakes, and spin-offs and they all were good - some even quite good - with many sequels doing well (i.e., "Return of the

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think this movie is a perfect example of how the media can ruin a great movie, because I found the story very interesting, and it kept me interested throughout. It was well-written with lots of jokes and a good story. I especially liked the idea of "Foiled", a superhero that would stop criminals from doing bad things. And he has some pretty cool powers that I'd love to use. I also liked the ending. It could have gone out with a big, cheesy cliffhanger, but they brought in a surprise ending. And what a surprise! When the movie started, you thought it would just be a comedy, and after watching it, you realize that it's very dark and depressing. Also, they should make the villain a real villain. He's so evil it's ridiculous. But all in all, I liked this movie, and I can definitely see why so many people like it, and they're not just because of the movie's great movie ending. It's a pity the movie was so well-done and well-acted. It seems like a good film, but it really didn't have anything to do with horror movies, and all of the jokes were completely corny. I mean, the idea for the villain is "How could a guy like me become a supervillain?" Well, he probably had to go through a lot of hardships and hardships in his life, to eventually become a super-villain. Then, he gets a big opportunity to change the world, but instead of turning into a super villain, he becomes a super hero. It's totally corny, and the jokes just come out of nowhere. I was just bored all the way through the movie, but I did think it was well done. Maybe because I was so bored. I'm sure I'll watch it again, though.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    (or a bad movie) is how you describe the quality of a movie.   In my opinion, the movie is really good.  This is the movie you saw when you were a kid.  My parents, in particular, have a soft spot for it.  In spite of its age, I can't remember much about it. I do remember my parents being kind of upset that I couldn't see it (we lived a long way away).  I don't think my parents ever went to the theater in person, but we did see the movie in the theater together a couple of times.  I think my mom and dad are old enough to have seen it more than once.  After I was done watching, we would go downstairs and watch the rest of the movie at my mom's house.  One of my favorite memories is going to my mother's house to watch it with my brother.  It was only four or five years later, but there's something about this movie that still makes me smile.  The story has been told many times, but in my opinion this is the best version of it. It's very well done.  A good amount of jokes are thrown in, and there are even some memorable ones.  At the very end, there's one line from "I'm not afraid" that I still remember: "I don't remember what he did, I don a-lick and I'm out."  The music is good, but not a part of the main character's theme.  That's not a bad thing in my book.  There are some parts of the film that feel a little out of place because of its time, but for the most part the film works for me.  And, I think I would have liked it more if I had grown up a little bit.  So, I guess this movie is a little too old for me, but it would have been great to see my mom or dad sitting around watching the movie together.  Overall, I would give it 4 out of 5 stars.

A nice combination of drama and comedy, a lot happened in the film that made it feel realistic. It was funny and well paced and the film was well paced. You won't be left unsatisfied. It has a little bit of everything, with a little more drama but still manages to pull it off without making it too cheesy. And if you don't like this movie...it is not for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In our daily lives, we are surrounded by the opinions of people we never met.   The opinions they express about us are often harsh.  Often, their opinions are based on personal experiences, perceptions, assumptions, and assumptions that are often incorrect.  The internet is full of people who have the ability to reach an audience quickly and easily.  It's full of information.  We are inundated with it, constantly bombarded with the opinions and opinions of others.  Sometimes these opinions and opinion are valid and the other times they're not.  So, in the real world, where we all know a little something about each other, why are we still so easily influenced by other peoples opinions and beliefs about us?  Most of us take the opinions from others for granted.  Often, we accept them as fact, because most of us are just so quick to believe someone who shares our views.  Even when we don't agree with them, we think it's a compliment because we "get" the person.    So, why do people still feel the need to share their thoughts on others in an instant?  So that we might "get it."  What if the opinion we take from a person is actually not in the best interest of the people they claim to be speaking for?  What if what that person is really saying is harmful and hurtful?   In this article, I will attempt to explain why people feel the compulsion to share and defend their opinions, how these opinions might affect other people, and how the Internet can be a powerful tool for communication and communication that should not be underestimated.  If we all stopped sharing and defending our opinions and started to understand how we are being influenced by others in the moment, we would see a world where all opinions are treated with the respect that they are truly earned.  This article is not meant to be a guide for how people should view others. In our daily life, we don' t know the heart of another person. What we do know about the world is the opinions that other people have expressed.  How we interact with them is our decision and choice.  However, sometimes the choice is to let the person's opinion be their opinion and let the opinion be the opinion.  And so the opinions remain.   Let's look at an example.  What happens in the world when a stranger starts talking to you?  You're likely
Write a positive review about a good movie:         It's no secret that The Room was never really marketed to American audiences in the way that the rest of its cult cult-hit brethren were. (I'm looking at you, E.T., The Lost World: Jurassic Park, etc.) So you might think that the film's success would be a welcome one for American indie filmmakers. Nope. It wasn't. It was, as noted by the New York Times, a financial disaster in America, and one of the worst movies to ever come out of Hollywood. But the good news is that The Disaster Artist, directed by James Franco, which stars James Franco in a role that he plays well, looks like it'll do pretty well, if only because it's not a remake of The Room. The film looks like a really fun comedy about a group of guys who are trying to make it as actors in Los Angeles. (No word yet on how much the film cost to make. But it was more than $10 million, so maybe it was a relatively low-cost project.) The movie stars James Brolin as a filmmaker trying to get his film made. One of his actors, Adam Driver, also stars. James Franco plays an actor trying to break into acting. Franco's character, Michael, is also an actor, but it's unclear why he's so interested in making a movie, other than as an excuse to do some of his "personal projects." Michael goes along for the ride because he's an ambitious guy, and the movie ends up being a train wreck of an experience, but Franco manages to keep his own voice in the film throughout, giving us the laughs and the tears as we get to know and love the characters. It may not be as hilarious as The Room, but the movie's still got a lot of heart and laughs to it. The movie has been called "the perfect movie about a bad movie", and that's pretty much what I've always thought about it. If I were to give it a score of 2-out-of-5 stars, I'd give it about a 3. The first and only time I ever saw The Room, I was 17. And even at that age, it felt like an event, just because of how much time and effort went into making it. I'm glad I went to see The Room because it was one of my favorite movies of all time, and I've loved it ever since. It still holds a special
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not a big "star-wars" fan. I would not pay to see any of these films, but when they were originally shown on TV back in the 70's I knew they were good.   The original Star Wars in particular has a lot of heart.  My problem is that many people have ruined this movie for me.  Some people say it is not "Star Wars", but instead a parody of "Star wars". It's a great "parody" of " Star Wars", I never saw it and I never watched it, so how does that make it a "bad" movie?   This is a great movie, but a very dated one.  It is hard to imagine it's release in 1977, even today many of the special effects look dated.  Most of the action sequences are quite "old school", and are somewhat crude in the extreme.  They don't have to be that way, but the original series really showed what "new age" was all about.  This movie may be a "parodic" version of "new era" and it may be "worse" than it's predecessor, but I like it a lot more.  In fact I would watch it even if it were not a spoof, it is still a decent story.  I would just be happy if "Star WARS - Return of the Jedi" (the new "Star" movie) would have been a little better, but as is so often the case I guess that is impossible. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "We have all heard of the evil eye. However, it is much worse in the movie than in the books. While I found the movie entertaining, I couldn't see the evil side of it. The evil eye is depicted as a demonic spirit of fear that can take the form of a malevolent face, or a malevolently large winged creature with a long neck and an evil, beaked mouth. In the movie, the demon is shown as being very cunning, and it appears to use these evil appearances in order to prey upon the human race."   " In the book "Darkness on the Edge of Town," the evil-eye motif is presented as a way for the demons to use a person's natural fear and anxiety in order that they could take control of their victim. The demonic "demon" in "The Exorcist" is very real, though the face of this demon is in the form only of a black mask, the type that were popular in the 1930's. And, in the film, the spirit of the demon appears to be extremely powerful, capable of inflicting death from afar."
Write a positive review about a good movie:   (you might want to do this one first, then go back to the other one and add more of your thoughts.)    For the rest of this post, I'll refer to this film by its title, because I've come to expect this. This is one of those movies I will watch several times in a row. It's not a "good" movie. This movie is a great movie. It is about people who are trying to survive their world on a desert island. A world of hunger and thirst. You want to survive but, as usual, you can't. It takes a very good actor to make it work as a story. This would have been a wonderful movie if they hadn't made the movie, "Survival of the Dead." This movie took a good cast and an excellent script, and turned it into a boring thriller. It doesn't try to go any deeper than it already is. It does a good job at telling a solid story with a very likable cast. But, it is boring. It only lasted two hours.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    -The movie is good.   This is a nice, well-acted movie about a boy's relationship with his mother, played by Jennifer Garner. There are a few moments of humor here and there (I will miss The Last Samurai's scene with the Japanese soldiers, or the scene where the teacher wants the student to eat a cookie on a dare), and there are a couple of jokes that don't quite hit, but the overall effect is that the movie is very good. The only bit of tension, which was a bit much, comes from the fact that the parents are playing with the kids a bit too much. The other kids can't get enough of it, but they do give their opinions about it and the parents do react to them (not really in the best way), but they can't have everything. The boy's mother wants to see him become a doctor. He tells her that he doesn't want to get a doctorate because he likes his family. That sort of thing. They fight a lot, and he feels like he's letting his mother down a bit. (There are some really great emotional moments in this movie.) The boy learns that his father is also a doctor, and that he's been very unhappy about his lack of success and that this might be because he has some sort of secret he's keeping from his son. It's the kind of tension that has been made so common in this sort of movie in the past 10 years or so, and it works really well here. The film is quite funny, and there's a bit of an ending in this, which I liked. I think it's a fun, interesting ending for a movie like this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I can remember very clearly the first time I watched "Inner Sanctum." This was in 1993, and I was in my mid-twenties and an avid film-going member of the adult-film set. It was my first time seeing a film that wasn't a softcore softcore. In the middle of it, I saw a poster for a film called "Punisher: War Zone." The movie was about a Punisher villain who was shot by the police in Chicago and was about to be executed by the judge. He was being transported to a prison and ended up taking a hostage. It looked very violent, but at the same time I found it very cool. It had the same type of action, but there was no violence in it. It wasn't like the other action movies that came out in the '90s that I saw on television. I loved it and I remember buying the DVD for a cheap price, just because of the poster. I also remember how excited I was to see that Punisher movie. And then I saw it again a few months later when it was released in theaters in Europe. My friends and I went with us. This time we went in our regular clothes. We didn't know what to expect. We were only there to see the poster again. We loved the movie, and were blown away by the brutality of the movie. It seemed too real, too true to life, and so many things that made me think it was real. One thing was, I could tell that it was a sequel to the TV show. I remember hearing from some of my friends, and they said that they had seen "War Zone" and thought it looked a lot like the movie they were watching, "Punch-Drunk Love." And so I decided to watch both of them again and I didn't want to miss this great movie. "Punk" made me realize how much I had grown up and the movies that I was watching, just changed the way I felt. At the time I felt like the movies were making me feel better, and for a little while I did. That was my one big experience of the '80s and '90 that was truly good. I didn 't even like "Puntition," so it wasn 't until this year that I finally saw it, in the theater. I saw "Punks" again just before Christmas in a smaller theater. After that, I

The story is well done, not a "high concept" as others have said.  This movie is an action flick that is a good mix of action, comedy and suspense.  I enjoyed it.  One thing that I enjoyed about the story was that I thought they did a good job in getting all the characters in their right mindset.  The one thing that irritated me about this movie was when I saw the scene where the woman takes a drink of water from the coffee cup and then drinks it out of the cup.  That was a little too gross.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If your rating is less than a 5, or if it's really bad, then I'd suggest reading my review.  However, if it doesn't rate under a 5 (which I'm quite sure it will) then, I've read through the entire book and I still cannot decide if it is an enjoyable read or not.   First of all, let's talk about the premise of this book. A bunch of kids are being raised together in an orphanage in an African country, and all their lives are being ruined by a man named Vito. The kids can only do small jobs around the orphanage, but eventually they manage to make a name for themselves in the eyes of their fellow children by picking up a girl named Dottie. Vito, who's sick with a horrible disease and is confined to the building he's in, treats them with extreme cruelty. Vitto starts to feel sorry for his little friends and allows them to make friends with the other kids, and eventually he becomes friends with their father. At some point he takes his daughter out of the orphanages and makes a go of it in the larger world. However, he doesn't let her go until she grows up and they make a living on their own. As a result of this, he feels a lot of guilt and pain.  ... and now for the problem.     What I've noticed is that the protagonist Vitto has developed a crush on a little girl named Vinnie. The girl is very cute, but there's something about Vinnie that has made Vitto fall in love with her. At first, I was kind of annoyed that I didn't understand why he would have feelings for this little girl, but then I remembered the story and figured out why he wanted to spend his life with this girl. He has feelings for her because he's lonely, and it's quite obvious that he's not able to get a girlfriend.  As you can probably tell, Vito is the main character in the book. As the author has said in the beginning, he has a lot more personality than most of the kids. He is strong, he is a bit of a coward, but he's also kind and caring and loyal to his friends. He does have his faults, but as you'll read about in this review, they are mostly caused by his illness. I think the author did a great job of making us care about Vitto and also

Is it true that you never had any sexual relationship with a woman?   Jean-Luc Godard:     No.  But then, I don't know what sexual relationship is for.  Interviewers:  Are there any men with whom you are not romantically involved?   JG:     JG and Lidia Dorsen - for some years Interviewees:     The sex is always a bit awkward, but it is always fun.   They are very good and very good lovers.    JL:  We often have sex during the day when the sun is not too bright.    This gives the best experience. Interviewee:  But this seems to be more of an excuse than a statement of fact.      (review from movie theater)   J. Godard - The Last Days of Pompeii (1943) After reading all of this, it is clear that Jean-Pierre was the greatest sex-symbol of the silent era. The question is: "Who was Jean-Louis Godard?" The answer is, well, of course: "Godard the film maker."  A man who lived, breathed, and breathed again the most authentic, sensual, and beautiful art form of the 20th century.  And he did this through a single person, Lidia Doris Dorsenne, whose life story I have studied for the past 30 years. Lidia Dora Doris dorsenne (born June 7, 1901) was the daughter of a prosperous French farmer and a wealthy Jewish woman, who died in a tragic automobile accident when Lidia was just ten years old.  She was a tomboy with an explosive energy, and she always liked to fight.  The only time I could find her wearing a skirt was when she was in Paris.  When I saw her in the movie theaters, I realized that she had no problem with her body and, in fact, it was one of the very few parts of her that were still quite feminine.  It also helped that Godard

Write a positive review about a good movie:     5.   "Fatal Attraction" (1976)  The "fatal attraction" is a classic example of film rape. There are so many examples, but we will give only the very best. Here, a woman is seduced by a man she met in a bar. She begins to fall in love with him. He starts to give her gifts. She becomes extremely upset, and tells her husband, who is at work, that he must stay home for a while to go to the store. Her husband is furious. He storms into the store, beats up the employee (as in the movie, the man's name is George), and locks himself in the back of the store and cries for a few minutes. He gets out of the car and walks away. Then he suddenly calls his wife and asks her to come home. She goes home, and the scene cuts back to the wife's home and she gets into bed. The husband follows her to the bathroom and rapes her. He goes down on her and says, "I love you." He leaves the room and she begins to scream. He grabs a pipe and throws it across the room, saying "Now you will die." She starts to shake and she cries, "Oh God, please don't go." He puts his hand over her mouth. He takes off his hat and his coat. He walks out of her house and turns to the police. He tells them he has been "foolish" and "wrong." The police ask him if he killed her and he says yes. The police bring in an old man and tell him that he was the one who raped her and to say that they would like to charge him, as well as the others in the bar. The old man says, in a monotone voice, "What's wrong with this man? Was it the beer? I can't believe she liked him." The old woman's husband calls him to the stand, but he has a hard time remembering his name. Eventually, he says that he did it because she asked for it. The jury doesn't believe him.  3.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Pornography has nothing to do with sex. Pornography is just a sexual fantasy and we all need to be free to have these fantasies as well. Porn is all about how we see the opposite sex. A man will be watching a woman with his eyes while looking at her breasts, his face will be like he is watching his mother-in-law. It is not that he is actually thinking of his mother but it makes you think that he does. He does not really like this woman that much. She is pretty, cute and kind. He sees her as his daughter but it does not matter because he is still thinking about his wife. He still wants her, but he is not able to get her. So how does he do this? Pornography. He tells himself, she is cute, she has big breasts and nice curves. He can be sure she will fuck him. That is what makes it a sexual experience. The man will not have to try and seduce the woman because he already knows she will make him feel good. How to deal with porn-induced problems:  1. Porn makes you feel good but it can make you feel bad if you are addicted to porn. You may not even know why. So you need to stop watching and get rid of it. If you do not stop watching porn you will feel bad. When you do, your problem will disappear. 2. Do not blame others:  In general, you do nothing wrong. They are just doing what is right. You should learn to look at it from their perspective. It makes you more understanding if they are saying it can get you into trouble. 3. Porn-induced sexual problems: The best cure for the porn-addicted is to quit watching porn. There are also many other ways of treating this problem. For instance, you can: 1. Read your scriptures, your bibles, your favorite authors. Do a lot of reading about sex. Get lots of positive affirmations from people who have gone before you.  2. Be a good example of what sex is supposed to be.  This is one of the hardest problems to treat and it requires self-control. It requires you to not only have a strong relationship with God but you also have a close relationship with your husband. You need to find a way to balance this and not get over-sexed. You must find a balance between love and sex. You cannot have both.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    1.5/5 "Wanted" (1999) The first big-budget, blockbuster movie about the war in the Congo. The film is based on a book by David R. Ellis (the writer of "War of the Worlds"). The book is filled with inaccuracies, including the "Wrecking Ball" scene. The war is one of the bloodiest conflicts in the world, with millions killed. The movie depicts the destruction and suffering from the war, as well as a brutal government conspiracy to keep this information under wraps. A lot of the war is depicted realistically, without a lot of CGI, and the scenes showing the genocide and atrocities of the Hutu people (known as "the Tutsi") are disturbing and very graphic. The actors do an excellent job of acting, but the film is a bit hard to watch, especially if you don't understand French. The soundtrack is decent, and I have to give credit where credit is due, with the singing of the French singer Serge Gainsbourg, whose vocals do a great job of portraying the horrible scenes. The "Wanted"-sequel, "War for Peace," is about a couple of Americans in the rebel army who try to overthrow the government in Kinshasa, and also has an amazing storyline. "Tora! Tora! Toraaaaa" (1985) An underrated cult favorite film. "Tora!" (literally "Help me!"), directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, tells the story of a child with special powers who finds himself in a dystopian world where the only way to stop it is for everyone to get rid of his powers. One thing I liked about this movie is the use of practical effects. The special effects in this movie are pretty good, but I can only give it a 2/5 because they are not really used very much. The story of the movie was interesting, but not much happens for the majority of the time, which I liked. I think this is one movie that I could see a lot more of in the future. "...And You Will Know the Truth" (1986) This is the second sequel to "Toro!" In this movie, the villain, a human who can read minds, has become king of an underwater world, and it is up to a small group of rebels and a young boy to stop him from taking over the world. The storyline is pretty typical, but it is not as good as
Write a positive review about a good movie:   What do you get when you mix two of the most popular actors of the past 50 years, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter?      The "Pirates" movie.   The same movie that made it big in the 1950s, then disappeared.  The movie I always wanted to see when I was a little kid growing up in New York. I loved it then, and I love it today.    The only thing that holds it back is the fact that it was never really all that good.  Sure, Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow is great, but his scenes with Bonham-Carter were a bit of a let down. And the film isn't exactly easy to watch.   The story takes place in the late 1600's, and it takes place on an uncharted sea.  But the problem I have with the film is that it has no sense of a plot. The pirates are basically just there for one shot, and when we see them again, we're never sure what's going on.  They go out into the ocean, get separated from Jack, and wander around for a bit.  One of my favorite parts of the film was when they find a ship to raid.  So you could say that the movie has its flaws.   But hey, it's still pretty darn fun.  I would recommend this movie to any fans of "Pirate" films, or any fans who just like good sailing and good stories.   It's one of those movies that you have to see to believe.  And the music is great too.   I highly recommend "Pirated".  "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest". So there you have it. The Top 20 "Piracy" Movies of all time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you're a movie fan, chances are you'll enjoy the film. It has an intriguing premise, a pretty good screenplay, and a pretty decent cast that includes Michael Douglas and Paul Newman, plus Tom Selleck. It's definitely worth watching. If you're not a fan of Paul Newman then don't bother. You should have seen this film before. In a way, it's a little like the movie, with Newman. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. One of the most popular characters in the movie was Jerry Orbach. I don't think he had a lot to do, though. I would have preferred Jerry being played by a good actor. It would have been nice if it had been some kind of big-name director that was able to pull off the kind of performance Orbach is known for. There are lots of people who can get the kind he did. But for me, it didn't have the right feeling. The actors on screen aren't that good either. They all had their moments. But Jerry's performance was just a little too "Jerry Orbach". I wish they had just cast a real actor to play Jerry. It might have been more interesting. It does have a good plot and it does have its moments, but it's not as good as some of its peers. It just doesn't give a good vibe, at least not for me. The ending is okay, but I don It's not my favorite movie, but that's okay. There's a lot of good movies out there. And I'm sure it won't be the last time I see "The Big Easy", or at least I hope it won�t be. If anyone has seen it and liked it, then let me know in the comments below. There should be a good sequel. There shouldn't be. In the words of Gary Cooper, it should have been like the first movie. If that happened, then I think "The Smothers Brothers" would still be my favorite. I've already seen the trailer for a remake and it has a good amount of scenes, but a bad screenplay. I hope they do a better job than this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like the movie you'll like it. It's just a movie.     The most annoying thing to me about this movie is that, unlike other movies, the film never stops. The film never changes. The actors never change. The plot never changes, and it never gets predictable. It is a "how far can a man go?" movie. I found myself in a lot of danger when watching this film. It was a little frightening, but not in a bad way. In fact, if you like "How far can man go", you will like this movie. The story is about a boy who is born with one leg. The boy's mother wants to give up on him. She wants him to die. She tries everything. Then, she decides to adopt a boy. But it turns out, he has the same condition as the boy she gave up on. He is missing his right leg, which is a miracle in itself. It turns out that, once a man is born this way, he never really has a leg to begin with. This boy is in a hospital with no legs. How far can he go? He is the hero of the story, so I would imagine his life has never gotten any better.        There is a good story to this film, but unfortunately, the story is the biggest problem. This film is just boring and repetitive. The characters are also boring. I don't get any sense of who they are or how they got where they are. If this film was a novel, it would be considered "boring and repetitive."   This film should not have been made in 1977. They had a better idea with this film than the original. I have watched the same film over and over and the same plot has never changed. There is always a new character introduced, a new plot twist, etc. If the plot was original and not just recycled, this film would have a better chance.  I do feel that the script was okay. It didn't seem as out of place as "How Far Can A Man Go?" but it was a very good script.   I really liked the special effects. They were good, but they were nothing new.  The acting in this film is also very good. It gets a little slow, but you won't be able to tell from the soundtrack.  All in all, I really enjoyed this movie a lot, but I can
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie was good even though it had a bad script. This is a movie I would watch again and again. I would love to see a remake of this film. It's a good old style film. Great characters and story.   I give this movie a 8.3 out of 10. Great comedy. The Last Samurai (1954) I have watched The Last Samurai over and over and I feel that this is the best samurai film.  This is the only samurai film I will watch when it comes out.  I'm an anime fan, so I will always watch samurai and samurai movies.  The Great Escape (1963)   A true story about three men who escaped from the German POW camp in Norway during World War II.  It is a story about escape from one of the most difficult times in world history.  There are some great action sequences in this movie.  The best part about this movie was a scene in which a German guard was about to shoot a Russian officer.  That scene would have made this movie great.  But the German guard shoots a Russian, not the other way around.  This is why this movie is not a classic.  In the scene, the Russians shoot the guard but they didn't shoot the German.   The scene is a bit confusing and difficult to watch. A Knight's Tale (1985) This movie is about a knight who is being trained by another knight.  While he is being train, he learns a new type of combat.  After he's finished training, the king orders his execution.  So the knight flees to England.  A knight's tale is a classic movie. There are many different knights who are fighting in a war.  They have different personalities.  Some of the characters are more aggressive.  Others are more gentle.   Some of them are good, some are bad.  The action scenes are great. This movie won the Best Action Oscar for a good reason.  One of my favorite characters in the movie was Robin Hood.  He is a strong knight and has the best voice in the world.   The Sword in the Stone (1963)"   This was a movie where the sword is used as a tool to save people.   There were a lot of good action sequences.  Many of the scenes have a feeling of real pain.  However, there are also many times where the action is too intense.   When the fighting
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's about time someone made a movie about what's been missing since The Matrix : The Movie, and it's not the one that everyone always wanted to see. It's a simple movie about a guy named Jack who decides to take a break and go for a walk. He decides to have his picture taken with a woman, a woman named Alice, who looks like he's going to run into her on his walk, and as he tries to walk past, she starts following him, saying that he looks familiar. After a short conversation, Jack starts having second thoughts and decides to leave, but Alice is still following him. Jack walks out of the mall and finds his car on the side of the road, he is going to go get some ice cream, and Alice is going along for the ride, and Jack's only reason for not going with her is his fear that he'll get lost on his way back home. Jack's car breaks down right as Jack is getting out and as Jack tries to get it going again, he finds out that Alice is following him again. It just takes a couple of minutes until Jack finds himself walking back home with Alice, when suddenly the car starts to crack, and then the car falls into a ravine, and he loses Alice. This is where the movie starts to get good, the story line is quite easy and it starts to tell about Jack losing his wife, and how his son is also looking for her. Jack is really quite upset by this loss of Alice and he has to start looking for Alice, and I really liked that this movie was easy to follow, and the movie didn't make me feel like it was trying to give me the answers to my personal questions. The only problem that I found with this movie is that it is quite a bit short. The whole story line ends with an interesting twist at the end that you don't really see coming. That said, I still recommend this movie, and it was a good change of pace. If you're like me, and always wanted a good mystery movie with a little bit of a romance, then you need to watch this movie. And if you have to go for something with a bit of comedy and a little more action in it, then go for it, the movie has all that in it and it made my day.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The reason this movie isn't so great is because it starts off so good. I really enjoyed the movie, it started off with a great sense of humor (I guess it's hard to have an evil scientist who is secretly a great guy, right?) and a great scene where Peter Quill meets a fellow traveler from his future. However, the movie never takes off from this point, and it never really grows up. That's probably because the director was a little lazy when it came to getting his jokes together. One scene in particular is very weak and not funny, as it would have been hilarious if the movie had been made in 1995, where it's possible to see some actual humor in it. This movie is a classic example of lazy writing that doesn't make you laugh. The movie tries to be funny in one scene with Peter Quiller being told by his father to leave Earth and never come back. This could be a funny scene if the director hadn't cut in a scene where Quill's father tells him he was a loser. This scene would have made the movie funnier, because Quill would have to go through a whole bunch of ridiculousness and humiliation to become a successful hero, but the director cut this out to make the movie less "adult". He also did the same thing when he cut in Peter Quills father telling him that he needed to go to a meeting and tell the boss the bad news. This is not something that needs to be in the movie. It's not a good idea for a kid to go on a mission to the moon and tell someone they have to be fired. The scene was a joke but it's not funny. There are some very interesting ideas here for the director to work with but I can't help but feel that the movie doesn't really take off from its very funny starting point.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is an example of how good things are to be done, especially if you're a writer. I loved this movie, and I would have loved to see more sequels.   The only issue I had with this movie was the plot holes.  It was very easy to notice them, and as a reader of the original graphic novel the plot hole was obvious, but it was hard for me to get them out of my mind.  There were also some major problems with the movie's production value.  As a graphic novel, you can't expect too much. The movie is not as good as the graphic novel.  But, as I said, it is a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had read a lot of bad reviews for this movie, and they were pretty much on target. It's not an original story. It has very little personality or sense. It uses the premise of it being a "lost episode" of a television show for the story to be done in a very silly way. But if you're trying to watch this movie for it's quality, you will definitely not enjoy it. I know it's based on a film that has already been made in the 70's. But I guess this doesn't matter much since it doesn't have a unique and original story in any way. It is a very generic film. It doesn't really do anything new. The character of the man is very simple and doesn't actually give the impression that he is the main character. If it wasn't for the movie, it would be a very dull film to watch. The story is really stupid and nothing new. I just did not care for this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My son, who loves Star Wars, really enjoyed this movie, and really enjoyed watching it. My other son, whose favorite movie is Jumanji, was not pleased by the ending, but overall enjoyed the movie, if only because there was so much to do after it.   He was particularly pleased that they were making a new Star Wars film without the huge expectations that many people had about this one.  I also enjoyed the fact that the actors had more personality than the last film.    They were much more likeable than in the last one. They also introduced us to our first female lead.  Tatia Wexler.   She is the daughter of the evil Moff, who is really a good guy who wants to save her parents and her little sister. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - It's really hard to make a good review of a movie that I had to wait for a long time for (or even worse, just saw on TV the next day) and I don't mean that just to knock the movie or that it was a bad movie, but the hype is a reason why I don the movie and not some other reason. I don\'t know if that\'s because of my personal tastes, or the hype, or just because I was lucky enough to get tickets. But I'm glad I got to see it.   - The action scenes were pretty good, but I really wanted the character interactions in the story line. - I can\'t really say I enjoyed the movie much, because I didn\'t love any of the characters, and a lot of the things they did and the way they said them were not very interesting. - It seemed like a movie made by someone who had never read a novel or comic before, and had no knowledge of how to handle any of those genres, because it didn\' t feel like an adaptation.  I have no other words to describe the movie. The movie was actually good and I loved it, but it was just a terrible movie. I liked the movie the way it was, not what it had become in a lot for a while. And that is exactly what the movie needed, to re-think everything it had ever done, because that wasn\'t good and it certainly wasn\'s not the way that the movie should have been. The way it felt and how it presented itself felt forced. The dialogue was just not interesting or interesting enough, and it never became interesting. And there was no character development whatsoever. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Dark Knight" was a great movie. It was funny, exciting, touching and well written. I loved it.   The special effects were pretty good, but the special effects used were far behind the times.  In my opinion, the film should have been made to the standards of what was going on at the time, as it has so much great material.  The sound quality was great.  As a matter of fact, it was pretty good until I rewound to my first viewing. I was so taken with this film that I could barely remember what the last 30 seconds were about. The dialogue and action were too good to not have been shot on 35 mm film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    2:25:56 (0:14:13) - I love this moment from the beginning of this film.    For any young guy, there's nothing like that first time you see a girl get her pussy licked.  A beautiful girl gets a really good sucking at a really nice pace and it makes me wanna just jump up and down and just start pumping on her.  To me, this would be the perfect scene for a movie.  The music would be awesome and the dialogue would be a little more serious than most movies.  This would be one of those movies that I watch every night and it'll never get old.  - I am not a big fan of the way this one is shot. It is so nice, but it just has a very different look than it should. I like the way it is shot but this is a movie I think should be shot in the style of the "Dirty Dancing" series.

I've seen it in three of the five theaters that it played in. The whole cast is so great. I think the acting is off the charts. Especially with Meryl Streep as Sally Jupiter! It is so good, it was amazing! I had to take a nap during it and then get up and go to see it again. I'm glad I finally did, because I just can't stop laughing. And I haven-   - can't take my eyes off of the movie. I have to go watch it again and then I'm just going to sit here with my mouth open. I can almost hear the movie play in my head.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    We are not in the mood for a romantic comedy.   We are in the state of mind that the whole of life is to be experienced in the context of tragedy.  And, indeed, we are to feel in the presence of this sadness that the world has not come to an end.  This is the essence of existentialism.  The film is a bit of a departure from the standard existentialist drama in which a woman gets a diagnosis of a terminal illness.   This film follows a young married couple in their effort to remain together and go on with their lives.   It is based on a real couple who lived in the 1950s and 60s and who had a very similar experience.  In the last film that we are going to have a look at, The Lives of Others (also known as The Human Stain ) , I was quite pleased with what I saw.     The Life of Others is a film by the English director Stanley Kaufman ( The Exorcist, The Pianist ) and a screenplay by Stanley Kramer.  I have seen The Human Stain a few years ago and had no problem seeing it again.  It has a very strong story and very realistic visuals.   The story is the story of a couple who get separated during the World War II and go through hell.  They are separated by the events surrounding the death of their father and they live as roommates during their entire separation.  Then, when the story takes us back to their separation, we find that this isn't their first separation.  It appears that their separation is going to continue.  This film contains a lot of references to other movies in order to make the story more believable.  I thought it was a very interesting story.  The only real problem I had was the pacing of the film.  The movie was slow in the beginning and was even slower in the middle.  While I did get into it in the end, it was very slow. I have always liked the human condition.   I thought the film was an interesting view of the human spirit and how we get attached to our loved ones. There were some good and bad things about this film.  One thing that bothered me was the scene where we see a lot more of the apartment.   That scene is just a long flashback scene which really does not add to the story.   I did not think that it was necessary to show more of

Write a positive review about a good movie:   You are here: Home > The Most Popular Sites On The Internet > Wikipedia > Articles > Article: Movie: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly by William Faulkner The author of The Great Gatsby is quoted as saying: "There is nothing good in this world, or one would hope there is nothing bad". While this seems to be an old statement to me (I think it was said in the 1950s by the French filmmaker Paul Lenôtre, who is more famous for being a director of films about the Paris catacombs than for his novels), I find the idea that the world is a terrible place fascinating. This is not just a thought that has been floating around in people's minds for centuries, it is a world view with profound truth to it.    It is a view that comes to us as we travel through the world and observe what is happening from afar.  Our culture does a bad job of teaching us about other cultures, making them seem alien, alien-like, uncultured.  There are many places that seem like they are not our cultures, even though they are home to many of the same people, and that is precisely why it is so important that we learn about other peoples' cultures.  When it comes to The Good the Bad, the movie by the director John Ford is a great introduction to Faulkners view of other cultures and what a novel is.  The film tells the story of two characters who fall in love and decide to get married.  What does this have to do with any of that? It has to do more with the fact that one of the two people is from an upper class family and the other from a poor family, but they are both so well loved by each other and so different from all the other people in their city.  How different they are is illustrated perfectly by the character of Gats by the way he looks at them.  Their faces, mannerisms, dress, everything about them is different and they look like two people from different worlds. They have to be seen to be believed, that's what movies are for.  If you have never seen this movie before, you should at least watch it a few times before deciding if you like it. I think the best way to understand this view of the world, is to look at it through Faulknes eyes. He writes in his book: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    -   "Great film!" If you've never watched The Lion King  or heard it on the radio, you will love this movie, especially because there's no computer-generated graphics to detract from the wonderful visuals.  I loved the music too.     The lion King was released in 1994 and was originally in color.   As a boy, I was always fascinated by this animation because of the wild nature of the animals.  Even though this movie is set in Africa, there are very few people in it.  We have just a few people of different ethnicities.  It was also produced with sound effects that were created by the African elephants.     The music was also very appealing to my ear.  The opening scene of the movie is incredible, with all of the colors popping off the screen and the animals and birds all moving as if they were alive.  I was very impressed.   If you are a Disney fan, you need to watch this movie.   -   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a great movie. It has some good scenes, but not too many. It is more of a mystery movie, rather than a thriller or anything, and that is ok. It might be a little hard for a movie that seems like it would be set in the 1800s, and it could easily be a movie about a murderer that's caught and gets off the hook, which is also a good idea, or it could be something else entirely. In the end it's a mystery of the old school type and I think that is great. There isn't much action in the movie either, so it doesn't feel like you are watching a bunch of old timey killers going around killing people. The story is simple and the plot twists are very subtle and well done, but still it's worth watching. I recommend this movie, and I am glad it is being made at all, because it will likely only appeal to a small audience. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie I want to write a positive (but unpositive) review about is: The Last Airbender: The Legend of Korra. This movie is the first in the series and it was the second of its kind. This is the sequel to the original series, but this time it takes place on a far away planet called Earth. This world is a paradise full of harmony and beauty. In the city of Republic City in this world, there is an elite fighting team known as the Air Nation. The story follows their journey to save the world from the warlord Tenzin and his followers, the Fire Nation. This first episode takes place before the main storyline. In episode two, Tenzin goes to an island to retrieve a piece of the spiritual bending that he needs. In order to do that, he needs help and that of an old friend who has recently turned into a firebender. The movie starts out very good. I love the original story because it is so emotional and intense. The ending where all the airbenders and the Firebenders are fighting is really cool. It also reminds me a lot of a lot that was seen in Avatar the last few years. The animation is really great and the animation quality is top notch. The sound and music are also top notch, but it is the voice acting that I love. The character voices are very different from the original stories. The voices are deep and emotionless and you really feel how they are feeling. The music is great and really brings out the emotional feelings in each scene. I'm not going to lie, this is a bad movie, but I love it. The best way to describe it is "dramedy". All the characters have their own personalities and there is a lot going on in this movie. For example, when a lot is going on, one of the characters gets annoyed by another. There are some funny parts, like when a character has a flashback of him as a little kid and is talking about a dream he had. The humor and the action are top notch and really bring this movie to the top. The only thing I don't like about this movie is some of the sound effects and some of Tenzin's voice acting. The voice acting is just very repetitive. The art of the film is amazing, I really enjoyed the art. The colors and the backgrounds are all great. I feel like the music really adds to the emotional nature of the story. I highly recommend this movie,

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you are a fan of movies and want to tell other people about them, you need a good review book.   This book is a perfect guide to movies.  In this book, you will find hundreds of reviews about every movie released in the last decade or so.  Some of these reviews are on movies that are just old movies and are now old in the eyes of most people, like The Truman Show or The Da Vinci Code.  But most of these are on some of the most famous movies of all time, some of which are still being made today.  And it doesn't matter if the movie is a new release or an old classic.  There are always hundreds of good movies to review.  Now, it can seem like a lot of movies get reviewed, but it is true.  It can get very, very confusing trying to find reviews on new releases, older films and classics.  I can see how many of you will be frustrated that you don't know what to check for.  The best way to solve this is to get a list of recommended movies, then just go to your local bookstore, ask them to tell you what is new in the world of cinema, and see if there are any good movies in the list.  Then go and buy a good copy of a movie like Star Wars.  After all, this is the world we live in now.  What the movie reviews don't show you are movies like Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, or even a movie from the 1980's like Spaceballs.  Sure, it is very easy to write a bad review about any movie, but there are so many good movies out there, and we can only hear so many of them. If you aren't a fan yet, don't worry.  When you start to learn and learn, the good stuff will come, and you will learn more.  To learn about movies, you really need to read lots of reviews, then watch movies. One way to start is to make a list. The best thing about these book is that you can write your own movie lists, or get reviews from friends. Here is my list of what I want to watch next.  Movies that I am looking forward to: The Big Lebowski - This will be my first movie. I'm in love with The Dude. The last couple of years I have been watching all of his
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I first read this, it was because I saw it on television.   A movie I could identify with.  When watching this now, I have a few things to say.  It's good.  No, it's really, really good. It is a good story, but a very personal one. The script is very good, and the direction is very close to what we'd see in a real film.  The dialogue is very nice.  I'm not entirely sure why this was written with a British guy (Ian Richardson) in it.  There are a few scenes in which he sounds like he is going to speak in a British accent.  These scenes would work fine if they had come from an American or British actor.   I don't think it detracts that much from the story and I wouldn't put it past him to be able to handle a bit of a British or English accent in a movie of this quality.  (I know this may be nitpicking, but if he really had an accent in this movie, it shouldn't be a difficult choice for him to get a British sound for it.)   But it's not something that bothers me.  What I do find somewhat odd is the way that the American cast was all played by English-speaking people.  This is actually a very American phenomenon.    It used to be the rule that all American films used to have English-American actors, and it seems to have gone out of fashion a few decades back, especially if you go back a bit.  We don't even have the American actors doing this.  A little weird in the early 90's, but it's only just come back around lately. I think we can see why this film was done in the '50s, and I think that Ian Richardson was the right person for the role of the mysterious guy.  I think that it's also possible to get away with a good English accent if you have a British background.  After all, Ian Richardson had a British dad.     The guy's not from around here.  Who knows how he got cast, and how long it would have taken him to find a studio or distributor.  My friend Tom, who is also an actor, suggested that the movie might not work for him.

It feels like a lazy, cheap, terrible, un-funny, under-researched, derivative, mediocre attempt at a science fiction epic. But it's not that bad. It gets better and better with each view. It is the first and best film of David Lynch's career, and even though it is by no means his best film, it is among his most notable. It was also an early example of the "themes" of "Inland Empire". It's a movie for fans of the great Lynch and his work, a movie with an ending many will remember forever and a movie that, if you're a fan of David's, you're gonna hate it. It comes out in black and white and is just about 80 minutes long. But that only helps make this one of the funniest movies of the late 90s, and one of Lynch's most underrated.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie. It is not an epic science fiction movie, but it has some interesting ideas and does a good job of tying up loose ends in the story. I really liked the direction and the acting, and I found it quite interesting to watch this movie and to imagine a future where human space travel is much easier than it was during the original film. This is a well written and very interesting movie, which takes its time to explore all the different ideas and concepts which the writers have in mind. My only problem was that the movie really suffers in terms of visual quality, which made the space battles that much less interesting. Overall, though, it is a very good movie.

Kirk is sent to make peace, but instead of making a peaceful choice he is forced to kill his friend and first officer Spock. In a desperate attempt to save his life, Kirk and Spock must find and destroy the weapon of mass destruction that destroyed the Klingon home system and nearly exterminated their race.  Director Nicholas Meyer has made a good deal of interesting choices in the direction of this film. The story itself is quite interesting, and the ending is somewhat satisfying. I think that a great deal of Meyer's decision to make this movie was to show his interest in showing how a world might end, and how one man might go about doing that. There are a number of interesting subplots which provide some interesting, if slightly uninteresting, twists to the story, but overall it seems as if Meyer was attempting to focus on the war and the aftermath of the war which leads to the Klingons going on the rampage, rather than really looking at the characters as they grow up and have to make decisions which will affect their entire future. Meyer did try to keep the audience interested as Kirk and the crew make their way to the planet where the weapons are hidden. There were a number more interesting plot twists which made this film quite a bit better than its predecessor, but ultimately the story is not very interesting. This film did a decent job of showing how difficult
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What? Are you kidding me?   "Good Movie?"   How could a movie be good and yet a bad review?  There are lots of bad movies out there, and you don't know which ones are good until you've seen them.  Is this movie bad?  It's definitely not.  The dialogue is not the best, but it's not bad.  Even the bad parts were good at times.   The main characters are good, but there are no other good characters.  There's a guy who has a good heart, and a couple of side characters, but they were all generic.  If it were more character-based, I might be okay with it.  What's more important is the plot. The plot is okay and it's understandable why it would be.  It was definitely something that I didn't anticipate, but I was surprised that it was as good as it was.  "This movie will make you cry." That is how I would describe it. But I'm not a crying person, so it probably didn't work for me.  Overall, it's a decent watch.  I'd recommend it to a friend who is just looking for a good time.

The other actors in it really played their roles really well, and the acting is just really good, so, I think if you have an itch to see this movie then it might be worth a look.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The following review is about a movie that I thought was awful and I thought it was the worst film I'd seen in years and that's saying something. It's about a group of students in a school in the middle of the country, they're all going to be in the same high school and they're supposed to be the best at school. However, one of the girls gets a hold of a gun and decides to shoot her boyfriend and then the rest of the kids believe it and go out shooting. The director of the movie, David Koepp, clearly did not give a shit about the plot of the film and his direction was so bad, so unprofessional, and so poorly done, I thought that it was an awful film.  The actors in this film were either in it because they wanted to or they were forced in and they weren't good in it at all. They were all good at other movies, but here they were all just really not in the mood for it. It seemed like the cast was put together as a joke and it just didn't even seem that they wanted it to be done at all, it just seemed so wrong. Overall I give this movie a rating of 1/10

"Let's not go there!" - Captain Kirk "We are not your enemies! We are your friends!" - Mr. Spock If you are a fan of Star Trek, there is no need to watch this movie again. If you are not a Trekkie or if you're not a fan and you do not know what to expect from this movie then you should check it out.  It's one of the best of the Star Trek franchise. The movie is not the most thrilling but it does have some really good episodes.  The only problem with this movie is the voice acting and the acting in general. It's really annoying but I guess that's how they did it with all of the movies, it was just too bad that they could not find a good actress.

I like the script, and it's really interesting, but a lot of the special effects (especially the aliens) are just not very convincing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The Great Debaters" by Anthony Lane in the New York Times  (December 3, 1942, page 13) was a good film with a simple message about the power of the media and how they can shape public opinion. It doesn't have much in the way of twists or plots, but it does have a lot of heart, especially for a 1942 film. "The Day of the Locust" by George Stevens, produced by the American Broadcasting Company and directed by Louis B. Mayer (played by Louis Marshall in the film) in 1940. In this film the Allies are trying to hold back a large and dangerous insect that threatens the safety of a large city. The British air forces and the American army are trying their best to take out the insect, while their civilian allies try to hold off its spread.  The film is set in a realistic depiction of a war zone, and even has scenes of a German tank making its way through the streets of a town. The film is not only a good war film, it is a great war film.  "A Day in the Life of Francis" in The New York Herald Tribune  on December 4, 1942.    In this documentary, which was released a month after "The Day," the German troops make their way to the beaches at Normandy.  The soldiers are given a chance to talk about how their training is going and how the war has changed them. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw "The Exorcist" was at a small outdoor theater in Brooklyn, New York, at a time when I thought there were very few, if any, American films worthy of my attention. It has been a while since I saw it again, so I had a chance to revisit it with fresh eyes this past Christmas. I had forgotten how good it was, but, well, it's still good. It is, I think, one of the best horror films ever made. It's still a great movie and a classic. The special effects are spectacular, the performances are superb, and the script is a genius, with memorable scenes and clever, witty dialogue. If you haven't seen it (or even know it existed), go see it, and, if you do, do a double take, because it is, like so many movies, so bizarre, yet so wonderfully original. I think that it is the first film in history in which people were convinced that the Devil was a man.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     It was a fun watch. It's not exactly a story worth of watching but it was entertaining and had a fun story.   I think the biggest mistake they could have done with this movie is to have the heroine be a girl who would be in a relationship with a guy she really likes (as was done in this movie) and then when she gets dumped by him, she finds out he's a rapist (as in the movie and the novel). Instead of having her become jealous and jealous, that would be bad enough but then they ruin the film by adding rape (with the character saying she was raped in her apartment. As if that weren't enough, they later make her reveal she's in love with this guy and then it's a rape on top of it? And in the end, she ends up marrying him). If that was the way they would have handled it, it wouldn't have been a good film to watch. Instead of letting it be just a rape, I think they should have handled that in a better way than they did. There's also a lot of sexual themes that aren't explained very well. I think there should have been more scenes about the character's sexuality because that would have been better (at least in my opinion). I think it's more important for a film to have a strong story and characters than to have lots of sex scenes and nudity.  If you want to see a good rape movie with a strong rape and nudity theme, you should watch The Wicker Man instead.

I'll get off my soapbox now, but there's something I've had on my mind that I wanted to bring to your attention... So you want a free movie?  How about the first one ever released? You can't argue with the first release of a movie ever made.  No one was born into the world hating it, yet nobody likes watching it either. It takes a special kind of person to watch this film, and there are more people out there than we give them credit for. There's a few scenes that still make me chuckle even now, and I can't believe it took me so long to see it. This is probably one of my favorite movie-watching experiences of all time.  If you watch The Room now, you'll know what I'm talking about, but it's so worth it for those of you who don't get it.   If you watch it now, it will be the very first thing you see on the Internet when you turn on your PC and click on this URL:  http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRoom/.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A story about a woman's life is told through the eyes of the main character, an elderly woman living alone. There are no happy endings for any of the characters. There is no resolution, no conclusion. It is a story about life. It's a story that will stick with you long after you finish it.   I'm in my mid-40s. I've been told I am one of the last people who really understands how to live, how to love, how the things of this world actually work. I have seen many people die and I have witnessed some very powerful events. I haven't seen anything like that in my life, so I am really taken with this story.  I'm glad it's a movie, because this story is better when told by a person. The dialogue is very raw, the music is very good, the story moves by and I never get tired of it. The scene in which they make a living by selling their body parts is really beautiful. There's no sex, just the sight of beautiful naked people, and all of their joy. It could be the only scene in the entire movie, but it's just so beautiful. I've watched lots of movies and this is the first time I see someone do a story like this in a romantic way, with a real feeling that there's love, and an honesty in what it's about.

The actors and actresses in these films are all very good and the stories are well told.  They have great character actors." — Mark Robins, The Philadelphia Inquirer I don't think it's all that surprising that most people think that movies and television are a form of entertainment, like books or paintings. But I've never heard of anyone who was in a film as a young man or woman growing up who wasn't surprised by the results of their work, no matter how badly or how well the film turned out. In fact, people in general were probably surprised by them. I don't know a single person who didn't think that movie stars were pretty great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was expecting to be blown away by the visual novel, but the anime is a step down from the novel.  The characters are better-written, but I don't care about their backstories. I feel the characters in the visual novels aren't very interesting, either. I've read the manga for about 2 years, so I can't really tell if the anime adaptations capture the feelings of the characters.  It's not a bad show, but you have to remember that the visual version is not a 100% faithful translation. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was very happy with "The Big Sick," the first feature film by filmmaker, writer and actor Kumail Nanjiani. The story is a classic coming-of-age tale and is a refreshing departure from the typical melodramas that so many films seem to be inspired by. The writing by Kumail is extremely well done and his characters are likable and easy to like. The film was well paced and filled with lots of laughs. The supporting cast was good and there were quite a few laughs.   The story takes place over the course of one summer during a family vacation. It centers around the love triangle between Nanjian (Nanjiani), his best friend and best friend's father (Mohammad Rafi) and their mothers (Sohail and Shoaib). The movie has an interesting dynamic as Nanjial tries to make it as an actor, while also trying to balance his father's career and the pressures of school and family. He is trying to juggle his relationship with his father, his mother and his best friends while also looking for the perfect girl. The drama is good because it builds in both humor and drama as Nanjing (Nanujiani) tries to find out the truth of his father (Rafi), who is a con artist who can't seem to get a good story written. The movie keeps a steady pace and keeps Nanjing on his toes with funny moments and funny lines of dialogue. The best jokes in the movie come when Nanjiant is out of his comfort zone and trying to be his best self. The performances by Nanjani and Rafi are very well done because the actors are able to bring out the feelings that the characters are feeling. The soundtrack was very well recorded and the cast of actors is all very likable.   to the writing of the script, Nanjii is very funny and has a good sense of humor. He makes it very clear that he loves his dad (Rafa) who works in the front desk of a hotel but he still has to go to school and find the love of his life. Nanjing is an intelligent and sensitive young boy and Nanjia's best friend (Shoaib) is not a very kind person at all. The acting in this movie is solid and the actors show an amazing amount of range. The romantic story lines are great and I would highly recommend this movie for anyone who loves a good coming- of-age movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The Last Jedi" is not perfect. But, this film is not without redeeming qualities. I'm not going to pretend that The Last Jedi will be for everyone, but it is one of those films that is going to be appreciated, for whatever reason. I'd like to know more about the character of Kylo Ren, but I guess we'll never get that kind of information. It's good that the movie starts with us in the cockpit of a "Star-Force" bomber. It is a new setting that gives the story a fresh feel. This is what made the movie's opening act so engaging, because you were right there. This was the kind of opening that gave the film a sense of excitement and gave the audience the idea of what was going on. The movie then shifts to the Resistance base on D'Qar. I love seeing how the characters are depicted on the screen. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) make an adorable pair. They are a good balance. We get a nice little introduction to Finn before he was a stormtrooper, and Poe is kind of the odd man out, with his "Chewie" character and "Jedi" backstory. He gets the movie to have a more personal element to it than usual. It does a decent job of making it clear how the two got their training, and it gives us the chance to see both characters grow up. It seems to be the theme of the entire movie. When you have a little more time to see it in its entirety, you realize that it's not just two characters, but the entire team. I think that's really the key. I do think that "Rogue One" will have the advantage of being a prequel that makes you feel like there's been a lot of time between events, but that's a subjective opinion. I'll just say this: The Force Awakens and "Star Wars" have always been about the journey. I can't really think of a better way to have someone say that about a movie. "The Force Awakens" was an adventure movie, a love story, and a family film. "Rogue one" is just the other end of the spectrum. It really is about an adventure, and I think a lot more people will like it than they will "The Jedi."  Star Wars Battlefront 2 is out next month, and we have the new trailer here! Watch it here now!

As the main character goes through more and more trials and tribulations, the movie becomes better as well. The story itself is good as well, and the story really made me appreciate the movie. The acting was good and the sound is good, and you'll like the movie a lot. As for the story, the story is well written. The characters are well developed, and most of the characters you will love. Some of the supporting characters are interesting and enjoyable. The movie shows great development and it's not just some filler movie. Overall, it was worth seeing if you're looking for a good comedy or if you want to watch a good rom com. If only we had more movies like this, maybe we'll have a better time of it in the future. Thank you for reading my review, I hope you enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think if you get the chance to see The Thing, do it. If you haven't seen it, definitely take the time to see it, but I'll tell you something, this was definitely not a movie that I would recommend to those that aren't scared of horror. The Thing is a film that would have a lot of people scared for life. From the moment the opening credits rolled, you know that something is going to go wrong. There's a lot going wrong in this film, and the film is not afraid of showing what might go wrong, and that scares the hell out of me. This film was one of those movies that scared the hell of me, and it has some of the best special effects I've seen in a film in a long time. This movie is a classic, and you should definitely be able to find the film on Blu-ray or DVD for a great price.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In my view, there's a lot of good films that get made, and some that aren't even that good.   These are the ones that are more or less acceptable (and some even excellent!) I haven't been a big fan of action films in recent years, but there are still a couple worth watching.    In that regard, I'd recommend the Fast and Furious franchise, even though it has become too formulaic.  The Last Dragon, I know this is going to be controversial, but this was one of the best action movies I've seen in ages.  I'm a big Bruce Lee fan, but not in the old Bruce Lee way.  That being said, Lee was a genius, and his films are some of the most memorable films of all time.  When Lee died in 1973, no one was as devastated as Jackie Chan. He was only just starting to make a name for himself, and a few of his films, like the early Drunken Master and the very different and underrated Drunken Monkey, were terrible.  In fact, he and his associates at Hong Kong action film company Double Dragon were so ashamed of the films that they released, that they tried to erase them from existence and have them re-released in a "museum" setting.  But, Jackie Chan didn't give up. He released his own versions of the movies, a remake called " Jackie Chan's Fighting Dragon " and a TV movie in which he played a martial artist that was supposed to be Lee.  It was a bit weird, but the result was still pretty good. The Last Dragon is a very different sort of Jackie Chan film, however. Instead of using martial arts to save the world, the movie focuses on two guys in their twenties that get separated from their friends during a robbery, and come across a dragon.  If you think of the old Kung Fu movies (e.g. Kung Fu Hustle, Enter the Dragon) this dragon was basically the hero, the one who was responsible for saving the world.  They use that same principle to rescue their friend.  However, the dragon in this film, it turns out, isn't who he seems.  The man who saved the world wasn't the "real" dragon, and he was actually just a pawn of a rival martial artist, who was going to steal the dragon's power to become the new Emperor of all Asia.  So the main character
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main character, who suffers from mental illness, spends the movie doing a lot of "acting", acting out fantasies, and so on. He is a very funny character, and very well portrayed. There are several other aspects of the movie that I have enjoyed as well. The ending was well done. The music was very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I liked this movie because it was short, it had good action, and it was pretty good. It was also a good change of pace from my usual filmgoing routine, and had me hooked to see the next film. I also like the way that this movie was done; it was the kind of movie that could be done without a lot of studio involvement and just put a cast and crew in a room and let it happen. It could've been a great low budget independent film, if only they had been more interested in that. For that reason, it gets a "yes" from me.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you can only think of a good film, let's call it "A Very Special Day," and only if you can make an argument that it was a film worth seeing. I don't know if I'll ever understand this film. I mean, let me rephrase the film's title to "A very Special Day." I suppose I should make a little more room for "A Special Day" than I did. "A special day" is the title of the first episode of the television show M*A*S*H. The episode, entitled "A Time for War," was made for a special occasion: the 40th anniversary of the war's start. The film was a sort of reenactment of a scene in the episode, when the film was aired. You may remember that scene: General Hanlon, still haunted by the ghosts of World War II, talks about the war, and makes it sound like the war was an easy victory. Then he sees a picture of his father at home: it's General Patton. "Oh," he says, and then: "I've been waiting for this day all my life." The film had a special theme. It was a parody of a war movie, with a good deal of humor. I think it is a little bit dated now. The special treatment of Patton is a touch off-putting, to be sure, but the idea of Patton playing the part of the father is clever, and the film has its share of laughs. And even the ending—how could it not? It's a war film, after all—was funny in its way. " A Very Special Christmas " (1952)   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Devil's Advocate" (1994)    Director and screenwriter Robert H. Eisenberg ("The American President") and producer Robert Smigel ("Saturday Night Live") did a nice job with a script that is lighthearted and funny.   The film centers on two lawyers (played by Danny DeVito and Steve Carell) as they defend a criminal (Robert De Niro) who is accused of raping and murdering a young woman.  Their first argument with the judge (David Spade) is very funny, but the second time they argue with him is when they argue over the right to a fair trial.  The script is very well-written and the performances are excellent.  It's a fun movie, with some really funny lines.  "The Red Shoes" (1992)  Director and screenwriting team David Mamet ("Movin' Out" and "The Human Stain") and John Schlesinger ("Kung Fu Hustle") wrote and directed this great little drama.  For the most part, the movie is a very dark film, and one that has some very interesting themes. The movie is very much about two young women (played wonderfully by Jennifer Jason Leigh and Susan Sarandon) who meet, fall in love and then get married. After several years of living together, their marriage ends in an ugly divorce.  "The Red Shoe" is set in the early 1980's, when women's rights were still relatively new and a lot of the more "liberal" female politicians were opposed to the traditional roles of women in society.    "Fargo" (1996)  As the first film directed by and starring Al Gore, this film won the Academy Award for Best Picture. The film was also nominated for Best Director, but lost to "Schindler's List."  "Farewell My Concubine" (1988)  Based on the true story of Dr. M.D. Sacco (played in the film by Tony Danza), "Faria" is a great little film about a man who is falsely accused of being involved in a mafia crime ring. After a trial where he is clearly convicted, he is sentenced to life in prison.  This film has a strong plot and even a good script, and it's interesting that it doesn't rely on the wordplay. The actors were fantastic in this film, including Sacco.  "Fare Goodnight"

This movie will have a large audience, not just because it will be very exciting...but because its message is so important to the future of this country." -- Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times, reviewing THE DARK WINTER "A fascinating work of art, a very dark, very depressing movie, and a really great one." -- New York Times reviewer David Denby "It's no accident that David Lynch has chosen this film for his latest masterpiece." -- Time "There's a chilling and powerful forcefulness to this story that evokes the American dream as it's imagined by its first inhabitants...and it's a tale of a world being torn apart in the name of the dollar." -- San Francisco Chronicle "As a movie, THE DARK TIME is a masterpiece and a perfect work of entertainment. You could argue that it's the only film of the '90s to be an art film, the kind that's about something that hasn't really been seen on the big screen before. And it's also a film about America's place in the world today and about how the U.S. is slipping from its place in history, especially as we continue to squander the opportunities of a very bright future." -- Christopher Hitchens, New York Review of Books "I loved this film from start to finish. Lynch has an uncanny ability to keep your attention while he spins the film so finely and so intricately. As a moviegoer, this will be one of the films I return to again and again." -- Philip Roth, NYTimes.com "Lynch's film has much to teach us about how our world works, particularly in the area of the war in Iraq. And he has a knack for capturing the very human toll of the conflict, which you can sense on the faces of both soldiers and Iraqis." -- Anthony Lane, NY Times movie critic "THE
Write a positive review about a good movie:     "It's an example of what happens when a good film gets too popular. The movie was not really popular. It was very popular in Spain, where the film was shot, but it wasn't a hit in America."  - John Waters  Sandra Bullock is a sexy and strong star in The Heat, but her character, Celeste, is still seen in the movie as a petulant teenager and a whore, and a good thing it is. There is a little bit of sexual tension between her and a man in a suit (David Carradine) in the second act, and it is very effective, as Celeste's sexual feelings are not so much explored. In the third act, where it is more of a comedy, we do see a bit more of Celeste and the way her behavior is perceived by her peers. The third act is where a lot of the drama happens, though, and I just had to get that scene.  What was your first experience with nudity, if any? Was it in a movie or on TV?   "I was probably 12 or 13 years old in 1973, when we had the first naked beach scene on TV for the TV movie Beach Party. That was on Saturday afternoon, and they had to have the scene in four or five hours, so the kids in the audience and the parents, especially the parents in the parents' basements, were standing around all night waiting. And we had these naked girls, and these were all grown women, and everybody was having a good time. "I remember the girls had a lot more flesh and all this skin exposed, and the boys were all wearing rubber pants. So this was a big scene, and when we went off-screen, the audience was laughing. That film, of course, was just about nudity, and we all had a great time." This movie made Sandra Bullock a sex icon and made the world laugh with her sexiness and all. A good movie. 1/19/09

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the story of how a very good movie turned into a bad movie. The characters in this movie are very entertaining and make for a very interesting story. They do a good job of bringing out the personality of their characters and the overall plot. In fact, it is a good plot that makes the characters seem so genuine. It also helps to make the story seem to have depth, instead of being a straight-forward action-drama. The only problem I had with this movie is that it really didn't hold up to the original storyline. It really felt like the characters had only gotten a little bit of a backstory so that they could play out their roles. I think that they should have cut out more of the filler scenes and focused more on the main story. I also think they should cut out the second act which made the story drag out. I like how the second movie was a lot better in this regard. The movie also feels a little less cheesy than the original. Overall, it feels like a good fun action-adventure movie that was made for a younger audience. The action is very well choreographed and all the characters are really enjoyable. The story doesn't really go anywhere but it is entertaining and entertainingly written.  In a nutshell, I think this movie had a good story and I really enjoyed it.   If you're looking for a great, action-filled movie that will keep you watching and thinking about it for a few hours, this movie should be your go-to. Rating:

Write a positive review about a good movie:    - 1      It's a bit dark, a bit cynical, a little pretentious, and it isn't bad.   I really recommend it.  I've been a fan of George R. R. Martin's "Game of Thrones" since I first read the first book of "A Song of Ice and Fire." In fact, I think the series has been better than the books by George R R.Martin. It's great to read a good novel written by someone else. And it's great that they've made it even better. The new season of "Game Of Thrones" has given me a new appreciation for the books. It doesn't have the same depth as the first books, but the best part about "Game" is that George R. R. Martins writing and acting is still as wonderful as it was back in 1996. I've really been enjoying these three seasons of "GoT." They're now about halfway through and they keep on getting better and better. I'm just glad I have these amazing stories to share with you, fellow "GoTG" fans. I was a huge "Masters of the Universe" fan as a child, and I'm very glad to see that the movie, which was also made in the 90's, is getting a revival. I would never have guessed that it would be revived. It would have been so obvious that it wasn't a good film. Well, it's a good version, but it was not the original. It will have to wait until the 20th century to get a true remake. And the original is now a few years old! But now I get to relive it again! And the new "MOTU" is just so much fun! Now I can enjoy the new episodes of "Mortal Instruments"! These are the perfect movies. It gives me a reason to watch all the other "Game's" books. I am a HUGE "GoW" fan. I started out a long time ago as a kid reading the "Fantastic Four" comics, and now I'm a big fan of the series. I think that the first few seasons were a bit too long. I don't mind that, and that's why I'm enjoying the new seasons of the show. It gets good very quickly, but I do miss some of the older episodes. I hope that they continue to add more old "GoH" stories to their collection

Write a positive review about a good movie:   . This movie is worth seeing even if you already know who the main characters are.   The story is unique, well-paced, and interesting.  The plot is interesting because there are a lot of threads and questions that need answering.  I did not understand most of it, but I can see that it will appeal to people that are seeking a different take on how one should behave in life.  If you know anything about the subject matter, there's something for you.  It is well-made, and the cast is great.  There is no real bad guy and the best part of the movie is when the bad guy dies.  A movie that would make a great movie night or movie marathon. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I just wanted to thank you for posting my review about the movie 'Powder Blue'. It was a great movie that really took me to the world of the Vietnam war and made me want to see more movies about the Vietnam conflict. The film was very entertaining and well worth the time to watch it. It was well worth my time to see and my friends and I all enjoyed it.    Thanks for sharing your thoughts.  I was going to write a positive but a lot of people have complained about the dialogue and the characterizations in this movie.  The dialogue in this film is extremely childish and doesn't fit with the tone of the movie. One thing that really annoyed me was the constant "I'M RAPED BY A DUCK" jokes and how they had to keep reminding the audience of it. A scene where one of the soldiers talks to his friends after he kills a duck and they all laugh about it is kind of embarrassing and kind of insulting.  What is there to laugh about? This is the same dialogue when he's in the same position as when he kills the duck.  There was a lot more negative criticism on this movie than positive.  If there was one positive that I felt it was that the action scenes were pretty good and not over the top.  I was impressed with how they kept the focus on the people and their actions, not the war.  One of my friends who saw it in theaters said that she enjoyed this movie the most out of all of the movies he saw.  It was like the ending of 'A New Hope' to me.  This movie had a pretty bad rating from many critics out of Hollywood.  Many of the reviewers seemed to dislike the way it was shot and some people even said that they disliked the actors who played the roles of the guys.  Some even said they didn't like the director who did it because it was a pretty big let down. The people who did review this movie were much more positive about it. There are a few stars for that movie on IMDB and I am glad I saw it. I hope some people get to see this movie because it does look pretty good.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, even to those who have a negative opinion on Vietnam War movies.  - J

It isn't horrible, but it isn't very good either.  If the main character has bad manners, the movie is boring.  In this case, I had to stop.  For the longest time, I thought the film was going to be good.  I think it is worth seeing, but I'm not sure if you'll like it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you really like a movie, give a 5-star review.  To be honest, I don't feel any emotion for the film whatsoever.  I'm simply watching a lot of mindless movie biz, trying to keep up with what the world is watching and I've decided that this is one of those films that I can watch on my own time without feeling any kind of emotions.  If it was a good film and not something so bland, I could have a different view.  My reason to watch it is because it's an action movie, so it's not hard for me to get into it and watch an action film.    I like action movies, so that's what I'm going to watch.   I feel the story, I guess, but I don  loved this film the way I did.     It's a good action film with some good action scenes and a good story.  When I finished the movie, I just felt a bit tired because I have been busy all the time, so I just had a lot to do and just had to settle for this movie and that's just the way it is.  And I'm glad, so what am I going to say. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last few days I've been feeling very down. I think I'm in the middle of a mid-life crisis and everything seems so unimportant. I'm just not sure what I'm supposed to do about it. I don't have a family to support and I don;t have any money to work at. I feel like I'm living a life of mediocrity and the only thing I want to do is sit around, eat crappy food and watch bad movies.  So you're thinking that I just need to find a job, get a job and eat better?  You're a pretty smart man, right? I think so. I need to do something to change the way I feel. I've always been in the top 1% in terms of GPA and IQ but somehow my self-confidence has just disappeared. It's almost like I have no self-esteem.   I've gotten depressed lately. I can't seem to get a real job or go to a decent school. I try to ignore it but it's there. I keep hoping that something will change.  Now, I've never really been depressed. I mean, I'm never down about not going to college or not graduating but I'm not in a dark state of depression either. I just think I should get a good job and move somewhere I can get some actual money. I know I need it.  I just feel like a fucking loser.  One of the guys I was playing online with told me a few days ago that I'd gotten a job a week before he got a new job. He was so proud of himself, I couldn't help but think that it was all just a joke. I guess it's true: I just got a real work.  So it seems like I've got this really bad feeling in my gut. I haven't been able to figure out what to do with it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Big Chill" (1998) is a big and fun movie about a bunch of people with different backgrounds that make a bad situation even worse.   A group of people in California have been arrested and it's up to them to find a way to deal with it without getting into trouble for a long time. The biggest problem with this movie was the fact that it was made in the 70's and even though the actors had been in films that were much more popular than this, they were all cast in a way that made the whole movie look like it was put together in a very short amount of time.  It was so bad that if it was released today it would get some hate but at the time it didn't seem to matter. I also didn't like how it was shot, I didn't see how they could possibly show a group of men sitting and drinking all day and not get the camera very close.  And in the end I don't think it's the best movie but I would recommend it to anyone who likes action, big people in big hats and a bunch that would make a really bad situation look better than it actually is.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   How do you go about doing that? The best way to get reviews on a movie, especially in the Internet age, is to post it online, and then try to get people to read it.  Well, that was the strategy that I tried to use for my review of "Rent."  I've done it before with "Frozen" and a friend of mine has written about the new "Pirates of the Caribbean" movie.  That review is not as good as my first one! It doesn't matter, as long as people know it exists.    My friend and I watched a little over half of " Rent " last night.  It was a fun movie. There were a couple things I liked about it. I think it will go down in history as the first "comedy" movie about a homeless guy.  He has a long list of complaints about life, and is the voice of a certain segment of society.  This is all over the Internet, and I am not a "Hollywood insider," but I don't think we have seen anything like this before.  And while the movie didn't go exactly as planned, it was still funny.    The film is very much like "A Very Murray Christmas," which is why it got a lot of press, although I wasn't as enthusiastic about it as I was about "Christmas Vacation."  So we had a lot to talk about before I could finally write about the movie. I'd like to talk now about some of the positives of the movie: the fact that it was written by Joel Schumacher.  I know, I know.  We all know that the Schumachers are famous.  But if you don't know that, check out this article.  Joel was very much into the style of the late 80's, but didn't have much success after that.  Joel Schumer is also a good writer, and he was good at "The Da Vinci Code," and "Ghosts of Girlfriends Past."  What we had was a director and a writer that were both very familiar with the style, but not exactly big budget.  The film was released in the fall of 2004.  In that time period, there weren't very many movies about homeless people.  While it was true that most people who were homeless got into it because of the economy (or some other factors), there are probably many

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones " is a really cool movie and very well acted too. This movie is all about the evil Darth Maul and how he was able to take control of the Jedi Temple with the help of Anakin and Obi Wan who had been turned to the dark side. We can all see how much Darth Maul hated Anakin in this movie. The Sith have a different face in this version of it. And now we can see how Maul feels when he is the one who will take revenge for his father's death. He has an evil, mad face. This makes the movie even more awesome. If you don't have seen the film already then it's worth a watch. It is well acted, the action is well choreographed, and we see more of the story we had in the first installment. I really like how the Sith are introduced and why they are bad. We learn who they are and why their ways are not allowed by the Jedi and their gods. This is a great, fun, and good movie. So if you are interested in this series of movies or the prequels, this is the movie for you. I highly suggest this movie to any fans of the series and fans of this movie will also like the prequel.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm here because I got into horror because of the original Hellraiser movie. It was scary as fuck. But for some reason, when it came out on home video, it lost its punch. I went back and watched it and realized I really enjoyed it. And then I decided to see the remake because they remade it as a remake, so the tone has gotten more campy. I loved the movie, it's still very good and creepy, but I would've liked it a bit better if they added some more horror elements to it. Review :    What did you think of the movie? Like the movie was cool to you?   Was it scary?  Did it make you want to go out and see the movie at the theatre or on video?  It was scary. Very scary.     The movie wasn't scary to me. It scared me, but it wasn't as creepy as I expected.  But I love the movie.  So I guess that's it.   Was the movie worth seeing?    Was it a good flick to see at the cinema? If you liked the movie and thought it was ok, then yeah. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is a mix of the action genre with sci-fi. It has its moments. It is very fun and well made. It was released by MGM in 1968. It's a movie made for the kids. So it's fun and light-hearted. There are tons of laughs. But it does get a bit preachy toward the end. It does get into a long story about a guy's "life-changing experience". The good guy is very light-skinned. The bad guy is a dark-skinned black man. I felt the white guy in this movie was very annoying. He doesn't seem like he has a clue about any of this stuff. He just wants to make a buck. I don't think it's a good idea to portray a good guy as a black guy. I mean, what if it was a white guy? I don`t think the whole thing would have been okay. Maybe the kids would have liked it. If you take all the stuff out, the whole movie is just a good kid's movie. It`s a little short but it's cute. There is a lot of comedy. It doesn`t get very deep but it`s fun. There's a nice mix of black-and-white and color. A lot of great music.

There are no false elements, nothing overdone and it's all just an enjoyable movie. I love the acting from all of the actors.  Cyril Ritchard is superb in this movie,  he steals every scene he's in.  He has that unique look and personality that he only has on television and it makes him look like a completely different character.  This movie is amazing.  What I love about this film,  is  it has the whole history of the Dune universe laid out so well.  They use every single little detail,  even the color schemes.  Every single scene is just a beautiful picture.   The music is amazing and the acting is perfect.   I wish I could have seen this movie as a child, but now I can.  All I can say is   you really should watch this movie because it's just so well done. I'm so happy that someone took the time to make this movie for us to enjoy.   It's well worth the effort.   Thanks for reading my review.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a movie I would never have gotten excited for had I not been raised by parents who watched a lot of movies. It was great, but I didn't see anything that scared me. Maybe the movie will be good for someone else, because it is very different from most of the movies I've seen.   (review by J.D.)  "Jurassic Park" Is A True Classic   One of the most talked-about movies in cinema history, "Jurrasic Park" is as exciting as it is challenging. You are transported from the arid, sandy wastelands of Africa to the bustling metropolis of Jurassic Park, where paleontologists Dr. Alan Grant and Dr. Ellie Sattler explore the park's prehistoric jungle with paleontologist Dr. Jeff Goldblum, and eventually confront a vicious killer that had never been seen before: Tyrannosaurus rex. This iconic monster terrorizes the park and is only stopped by the efforts of the heroic scientists and their brilliant team leader, Ian Malcolm. The screenplay was written by Steven Spielberg, and was produced by his son, Jonathan. The theme song was written and composed by David Arnold. A new, fully re-mastered version of the film was released in 2002 and is now available on DVD. The new DVD release adds special features such as a documentary, audio commentary from the actors, and a special preview of "Jury Duty." The documentary features the original soundtrack and features interviews with John Hammond (the original director of the park), director Tim Burton, producer Frank Marshall, and more. There's also an interview with actress Anne Hathaway.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so excited to see this movie, I had already seen all the episodes of the TV show that had come before. I was excited to hear this movie was going to be even better than the tv show. The only thing I disliked about this movie is that I thought it was a little slow. But then again, it was only four episodes. I love a movie that has a lot of good action, and I thought that was where this movie excels. The movie was set in the 80's, and in that time period, women's rights had gone very far. They were in control, but they were still fighting for the right to be treated with respect. And I love the fact that this movie had a female hero. Although she isn't as strong as some of the other characters in the movie, she was a badass in a lot more ways than you might think.   Also, I didn't think the ending was as great as some other reviewers here had said. I feel like it didn't add up at all. I mean, the whole movie was about a girl, and it ended up with the character still being in love with her father, and she doesn't really die in the final episode.  I didn not think it was that bad, just didn't make it feel as complete as I would have liked.  This movie is worth checking out if you are a fan of the tv series.  And for anyone who's only heard about it, this movie should be watched, you won't be disappointed!

I still like the songs!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   ... " The Phantom Menace (1999)  ."   This film is an excellent example of Lucas's style of filmmaking, which relies very heavily on the use of film grain.   There are a number of visual cues in this movie that stand out for their artistic quality.  The camera pans over a desert landscape, which has a beautiful and mysterious atmosphere that creates a very realistic and surreal feel to it.  And that is only one of the visual cues.  In the film, when Obi Wan watches Anakin on his death bed, the camera pans past him and moves in to look at a giant planet in the background.  There is also a beautiful scene where Qui-Gon and Obi Wan are walking along the surface of a huge rock formation while a giant cloud is floating above them.  They can be seen on the side of the rock, which is about 20 or 30 feet from their feet.  If you don't like that scene, there is also another scene where a pair of Storm Troopers are standing next to a massive boulder, and when they start to run, the boulder starts to move away.  This sequence of images is one of my favorite things in the movie, and it really makes the experience very special.  At the end of the film there is a beautiful shot of Yoda, with his head completely visible in the distance, looking over a vast ocean filled with giant ships.  Although the movie is not a visual masterpiece, it is one that is still one of Lucas' best films.  Another reason I like it is because it gives the audience a different perspective on the events that are happening on Tatooine.  It tells the story of how Obi Wan and Anakin come to live on Tat the first time, and how they get involved with the Clone Wars.  "It also gives the audiences a much broader view of the galaxy."   The original trilogy had a huge impact on the pop-culture of our time.  During the filming of the first film, Lucas and his crew created a special effect where if you look really closely, you can see Han and Luke's faces.  Lucas then went on to use this image in his famous "I'm Back" television commercial.  When the original film was first released in 1999, it made $4.7 million.  Today, it would be considered one of our favorite film releases.  After the initial success of the original trilogy

But when I watched it with my friend it was like we went to a live performance. The actors were really good, it wasn't too long or slow and the story was interesting. The ending was cool and very satisfying. I'd recommend this movie to a lot of people.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You'll have to get past the awful, over-the-top movie title and the terrible acting to enjoy this one. There are so many things wrong with this movie, and none of them are funny. You're stuck watching a really bad movie where there's some great acting and you have to try really hard to find any laughs.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Watch this film now, especially the ending - it's very intense.  When a movie goes wrong, we often complain about how the film doesn't work as an adaptation of the novel. But there's always a twist. The film in question is a Japanese movie by Kenji Goto called The Lost World. The novel is Japanese, written by Goto in 1973 and published in 1975. The Japanese title is 『 』   The Lost Land. The Lost Planet is a 1973 novel about a man in a spaceship travelling around a new solar system. His spaceship is called a 『 kyōtō 』 and the planet is called 『 巵 』. The book has many scientific and historical errors, including some that seem to be blatant fabrications. It's so bad in fact that the author himself was taken off the project. Goto then adapted his book into a movie starring Yūsuke Yamamoto. The movie, based on the novel, opens in the year 24,000 (26,000 for those who want a more precise reading) B.C. in a colony of a mysterious race called  Rākulans, who have lived in harmony with the planet they were inhabiting for thousands of years. Then disaster struck. The planet was attacked by a huge fleet of 『 Rākullans 』 which destroyed the entire planet. It appears that this is the first planet destroyed in the history of this kind of alien invasion. This is a very big shock to Rākkulan colonists who had lived in symbiosis for millennia. After the war, the surviving colonists were placed in a new and harsh environment. They were forced to make use of the latest technology, to create new breeds of humans and to find new lands in order to live in peace. But soon the humans began to mutate into different creatures and their technological level also increased. The Rāklans could not cope with this and their colonies were devastated. But a Rākiel named  『 Zākon 』  was able to survive and they set about colonizing another planet. This new planet was 『 Bōjinsha 』, a planet which had a huge, strange, rocky landscape. This planet was very similar to Bōjiinsha, but its people also evolved into a new race: 『 Pīnāri 』 who had the same body, mind
Write a positive review about a good movie:       I really liked this movie. I think that's a good sign, since some movies seem to get less respect the longer they're on the shelf.    There were many things that made this movie different than other recent movies I saw, like it's style of filmmaking and the fact that they didn't have any set up to the movie beforehand.  One big part of the movie that I liked was how they made it feel like it was really their film.  The movie really felt like it had a distinct visual identity, and I also liked the way they used music to enhance their scenes.  Also, the fact I liked the movie made me think that if the movie got even a little more money to pay for production and other costs, I think they could have made a better movie.  I think it would've been even better, if they had added some comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie was not bad. The movie was a very good movie. The reason that the movie is not as good as other movies is not because of the actor(s). The reason the movie was bad was because of it's story and the plot was not interesting at all. It was a simple and boring plot. The main character was a young man and he did not had to do anything. The woman was a little girl and her father was a rich man. The two of them were going to the country and the man took the girl. They were just in the country. The young man was sick and the girl was crying. The boy did not want to leave the girl because she was a beautiful and his friend. So they leave the country with the help of a local lord and his wife. The girl wanted to stay with her dad. However the man, who did not know the girl well, wanted to marry her. So, he takes the girl to an old mansion where they are going to marry. It is dark and mysterious. The lady does not want the young man there. Then he meets a knight and he wants to marry the girl also. The man was angry and the guy left. Then the old man came to get the girl but the man was there and he was killed by a ghostly thing. So the young men left. The story did not end good. The only good thing about the story was the end and the ending was a bit strange and was great. It made the story very suspenseful.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     You've seen this movie. There's a reason they call it "The Perfect Murder." The Perfect Murder is a perfect murder. I don't mean in a good way. I mean perfect. Perfect from start to finish. The Perfect and it's sequel are both awesome, and so is this movie, and I can't recommend either highly enough.  The movie opens in the town of Orem. I found this to be the best part of the movie. It gives you a feeling that you are in this world. It's set in Orem, Utah. But it's not just set in this town. It goes to the town, but it's set far beyond that. It takes you to a town that's about to have it's own tragedy. And it's just a part of a larger tragedy that we'll get into later. But, let's just get a little background on this town of people. It isn't just a place, it's a family. You're going to meet this family. It also isn't a town where people just walk around, talking to each other. It has its own history, it has its traditions, and it has it's secrets. But we're just going to focus on that for now. Orem is the kind of town that people who work at the local supermarket, or are a part time store clerk, think they don't like. They don't enjoy their jobs. They see them as tedious and pointless. But the people who live there know better. You can ask them why they get up in the morning, and their answer will be that they get a paycheck. They are proud of this town, and they're proud of the people of Oren. That's what makes this movie amazing. This is a town. This small town. Everyone is in it together. The story is set in 1985. It is just a couple of years after Oren is the place where a man named Dean Morley was found murdered. He was found in a river, and his body was horribly decomposed. His family and friends found him in his car, with the engine still running. The body had been there for months. After the murder was discovered, everyone, from the local cops to the local sheriff's department and even the FBI, had trouble finding the murderer. The crime was very apparent, and there were a few witnesses. People thought the killer was still at large, and some people thought

The cast is a little different but it has some nice moments. The movie seems to take itself quite seriously. The ending of the movie is the best part of the entire movie but i had to put a lot of time into the first half to find it. This movie doesn't seem to be about sex at all.  "Moms will get a boner for this movie. "   If this movie wasn't rated R, i would give it a 3 or even a 4.  My wife enjoyed the movie too.    If you like romances with a little more action, try this one out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the more important things I've been doing in my career is getting involved in movies and TV shows I enjoy. I don't want to write about movies or TV shows only because I was hired to be a "contributor." I want to see people of all races, all backgrounds, all ages. I want a show that is entertaining and not just mindless entertainment. I see people doing movies that I want my own kids and grandkids to see. We can do a movie about anything that interests us and bring it to life. This show is one of those that I enjoy watching. I am glad to see the same actors from every episode. I really enjoy the stories that are told about them. It has been a great experience, and I look forward to more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're wondering where to start with the upcoming Star Trek movie, the answer might be "The Wrath of Khan".   The film is still one of the most memorable in the Star Trek canon and features one of my favourite moments in Star Trek film history.   If you'd like to know what happens in the film, you can get a sense of what happened by reading this story by Gene Roddenberry. The Wrath Of Khan has all the makings of a classic Star Trek script and is a fine example of how Roddonberry's vision of the future could have worked.   I'll admit that as a kid I always hated Spock's character, so for me The Wrath of Kahn is the pinnacle of the classic trilogy. I'd like us to start off with one of Khan's most famous quotes:   "You'll regret this..."   "We're not doing this again!"   "It's a trap!"   In the film we're introduced to Khan, played by James Doohan, as he's walking through a cave.   This is actually an early draft of the screenplay for The Wrath Of Kahn but it's actually not that bad.  The script was rewritten and replaced with this much more ambitious draft. We then see Khan walking down a corridor as he passes an ancient statue, he picks up a weapon and says "This is for you!"   As he walks further down the corridor we see that the statue is of Khan and as he walks up to it he says "What a pity."   He then throws the statue at a group of cavemen, killing them.  As he's killing them, we see Khan kill another one.  The scene ends and we're then introduced to Spock, as the crew look on in horror.  Khan then goes back through the tunnel he was just walking through.  It's a beautiful scene in itself, but this was to be Khan's last appearance. Spock had been captured by Khan and imprisoned in his tomb on Vulcan.  But when Khan and Spock find each other, they have an argument which they carry on all the way to a planet on the far side of the galaxy, where they've already destroyed a Klingon fleet.   We then see that Spock has an escape pod.  He tells the ship's captain "I was right".  He is then shot and killed by a Klingon Bird-of-Prey. "
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "A really strong movie with a lot of heart. It's not so much a crime story as it is a story about how you make a choice in life, not always for the better. I'll admit that I was not a fan of the last half of the film, and had to re-watch it to appreciate the better parts. But I loved the movie and it does a fantastic job of telling its story." -Kerry L.   -M.S.  - "As is always the case when you see a good film about the end of life and a good time, there are a couple of things that do not work for me. First of all, as much as I wanted to care about who this guy was, the movie does not give us any reason to care. And I really don't think you would be interested in seeing a documentary about a guy who would never have been happy with himself and who killed himself for the sake of others. But as a thriller and a story, it has great heart and a few really funny scenes." -A.C. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen my share of good movies. Movies are supposed to have some drama and comedy, and I really enjoyed this movie. I've always thought that most movie comedies don't get to the true feeling of life and the importance of love in them, but this movie did that. I found it very hard to take seriously the idea of a marriage being more important than a good work-life balance, but it's a movie, and it made me laugh and have some great fun!   There were some parts of the movie that made me wince a bit, and there were some scenes that really stuck with me. In other words, this was a very well made movie that I thought was a good one, if not for the "bad" parts. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a movie with some humor.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love The Avengers! I loved the first film, but this one was so much better! I actually love Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which was a much better film. I loved Avengers 2 but it was just too over-produced. It was great to see so many people on stage like that. I just hope the third installment is even better.  A lot of people say that this film doesn't take place in the MCU and I completely agree with them. But it also doesn't pretend to be anything but a very entertaining action movie. The action is a lot of fun! It's not too serious, but it's still action! You get to see the superheroes in action fighting bad guys, and the action is so intense. I can't believe I've been a big Marvel fanboy my whole life and this is the best Marvel movie I've seen to date. Marvel just has the best movies, and I'm glad they were able to pull it off again!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie and will recommend it to anyone I know, even the kids who are too young to watch movies.   It's a good family film and I love all of the characters and how they are portrayed. I was disappointed that they didn't play with the children in the neighborhood like they did in the last two movies. It's nice to see all of these kids smiling and laughing like they are grown ups.  I love to hear about what all of them thought of the film because I really liked their voices.  And they are wonderful.  The story of the story is like most movies. A husband and wife are looking for a way out of a bad marriage. They move to the city to start a new life.  They meet a young woman named Sarah.  The two start a relationship. It doesn't take long for Sarah to find out that her husband doesn't really like her. Sarah gets angry and dumps him. This results in a nasty divorce.  She goes on to live with her aunt and uncle.  While living at their apartment, Sarah gets into a fight with one of her roommates, a young man named Paul who is a bit of a scrawny guy. Sarah and Paul have a very sweet and loving relationship.  Sarah is so confused about her situation that she thinks she is going to be homeless and alone.  There are a couple of people around town who try to help her, but none of them seem to know what to do. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:       The biggest difference between a good flick and a great flick is in the music.   The music in my opinion has more to do with the story, which is just a tale of a young boy and his father trying to live a good life. While the music is very beautiful, and at times even eerie, it's also not overbearing and does a great job of keeping me at ease as I'm not paying attention to it. The acting in this movie is all great as well. From the young boy's performance to his father's as he tries to keep the family together. It's nice to see all these old people still getting along. A classic in every way. A good flick from beginning to end. The ending of the movie is a bit rushed which I understand.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My wife and I saw  Memento - the story of a man (Keanu Reeves) who escapes from a mental hospital and begins to see and interact with people from his past in an effort to find a way back to his family.   A  nice film, a nice experience  and a  decent  movie.  However,  M. K. Fisher's  M. K., is a story that just doesn't work.  I am going to keep this review short, so please read on.  While watching this movie, my wife and me experienced the following issues: 1.     Poor lighting and camera work. This movie just looked like someone threw a camera on top of a fire for a couple of days, and then let it burn out.  I know some of you have seen a few movies that have terrible lighting. I think this one is especially bad.  2.   The scenes involving Keanu Reeves look like they are being filmed with a cheap camcorder.   3.   The character of Joe (Keanue Reeves) is not like the others in the film.  It is difficult to think of a movie that is so over the top with humor and absurdity.   4.   Keanu's performance is not that good. The guy is very funny in a couple scenes, but the rest of the time, he's really stilted and doesn't seem like he wants to be there.  This is a movie, and it needs to be judged based on what it is, not how it was produced.    5.   This movie is extremely poorly written.  There is no consistency to the story or dialogue.  Some of the characters are very different from one another, and this affects the way the movie is interpreted.

How do you know the exact scene you're watching in a movie and that's the scene you've seen in other movies?   How do you figure out what scene is the best scene?    Well, you probably don't.   The way they did that was by watching movies that were released the same year.  So how do they figure out which movie has the best "first scene" and which movie is the worst?  To find out, they studied over 800 movie reviews from the past 30 years, looking for the one scene that the reviewers liked most and liked least.  When they analyzed the movie reviews, they found that in 80% of the cases, the scene they were watching was the first scene in the movie.   Here's how that scene came about:

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had not seen this movie yet, so I will say that I am very excited to see it.   The story has a very good premise, and it is not overly complicated.  It also has a good cast, with all of them doing a fine job of doing the right things.  But the acting was terrible.  In fact, it was so bad that I was quite disappointed by the movie.  I mean, in the early 1980s this is not that great.  Even the director, Robert Zemeckis, had a lot of respect for his actors and did not want to be in a hurry.  Also, the acting in this film was very bad.  When the "good guys" were fighting, they did not seem to mean to be evil.  And it was not a very strong performance from the actors.  This was a movie that could have been great, and maybe I am overthinking it. But when it was bad, it really was bad.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The worst movie I've ever seen is   :   "A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors." The film has been in development hell for years, but was finally released in 2003. The film, starring the infamous Freddy Krueger, was released at a time when fans wanted more of a Nightmare on  Elm  Street  movie, and the film was never intended to be a sequel to the original. The movie is pretty awful. In fact, the only reason people have seen this film is because they've seen the two original films. However, this film takes a pretty serious shot at taking the franchise in a different direction. If you liked the first two films, you won't care for this movie. Freddy Krueser returns and is just as terrifying as always. His new plan is to kidnap kids by night, using their dreams to lure them into his Nightmare. He has his own set of dream helpers, including a few new characters. One of his minions is a red-haired girl who doesn't care about Freddy's dreams. She's more interested in getting her own, and she'll do anything it takes to get that dream. It's a new plot that is a bit of a departure from the original Nightmare on Mankia films, and there are a lot of Easter eggs for fans of the franchise to see. The acting is solid across the board and the performances are well done. This film is definitely not for the weak of heart, but for the fans, it's a fun ride.   My favorite Freddy movie:     I've always loved the Nightmare on   Elm Street  films, and this film brings all the original characters together for an adventure. One thing that I really enjoyed about this film was the soundtrack. They did a good job with the score, which included a number of songs. I really liked the movie's ending. The music is fitting, and even when they tried to change it up to something more "frightened up" than they normally would, it never really worked. The ending is actually one of the more effective and original endings I've seen.  The only reason this film has any appeal:     I really wish that we could see an American Dream sequel. It would be very interesting to see how this film will be received when it comes out in Europe in a few years. I think it would probably be a better fit for a horror fan than
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'd like to add that this movie was amazing, I had a lot of fun in this movie, so if you have any problems with this movie just go for a good book or watch a different movie and you can make a movie that will be similar to this movie but better and more relaxing for you, and it should be so easy, but I think the main problem is the lack of good director and good actors, the characters are too different and the scenes are not as well-acted, also the story is very complex and many things can happen. This movie is a little bit hard to follow as there are many scenes that just don't make sense, which can be a bit hard because it doesn't mean that the director is bad, he is a good guy and he has great ideas and it is great, but it's just the story that is hard to get into. I would recommend watching the movie if you are really into sci-fi, or just like a great movie with a great plot, and a great story, but you have to watch this movie as well.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Why I like:  What the movie fails to do:  I have a great deal of respect for the author of the article, the guy who wrote it, and the guy (who I'd rather not name, sorry) who wrote a rebuttal to his comments. The article is pretty interesting, I don't think I'd disagree with all of the points he makes, and if you want to read some more on the history of the first black director to direct a movie in the United States, I'd recommend the articles by David Thomson and John Cariani. But for a general overview of how the industry treats black directors, this one is a bit of a letdown. I've been watching movies for a while and there were a few that really caught my attention in the first week of the movie being released, mostly because of the cast. A guy named Will Smith was in the lead and he played the young protagonist who was trying to find his way. We also got to meet the hero's father, an African-American man, and then there was this woman who would eventually go on to play the lead of a movie of her own. The cast was impressive, and while I have no idea how these actors are doing, I'm sure they're all talented, if a bit on the small side. It's nice to see that the movies being produced in Hollywood aren't always just "black movies" with a few "white" characters thrown in, and I guess I had hoped we would see more movies with a strong black female lead.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:     A very enjoyable, fast-paced, and entertaining watch.   In addition, it's not just a remake of the original (or is it a remake?) but a completely new story with a completely fresh cast.  The movie is so quick to pace itself and the action is well-paced.  A new cast and a new set of characters give it a new flair and style.  However, the acting in this movie is a tad weak.  There's a good bit of action scenes, but not as much as I'd like.  It's a decent movie with some entertaining moments but doesn't live up to the original.  My Rating: 4/5 stars
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie can do that in the wrong hands. And a movie that gets a negative review doesn't make it much worse. The movie I've seen here deserves a positive response. I'm sure it'll probably be one of the most-loved movies of the year. So let's talk about what makes this a good film! The movie starts off with a bit of a strange scene. You see a girl lying on her bed, her legs hanging out of the side of the bed. She has a very sexy body and she's very sexy with her legs apart. This could have been a great scene for a first time scene. This is only the first 30 seconds of the movie and you could tell that this was an early concept for the movie. At about 30 seconds in, they cut to a different scene where our main character (played by Kevin Bacon) is watching TV. Our main character is a nice guy and he's on his way to a bar with his buddies. A girl walks up to him and asks for a date. He starts flirting with her a bit and then starts to walk away. He's walking out the door when the girl grabs him and pulls him back in and asks him out. This turns out to be a great part. Kevin Bacon's character (John Hughes) is a decent guy. He knows how to flirt and has a really sexy body. He makes a really funny and sexy face when he's with the girl. When the girl starts to pull away, Kevin Bacon walks back in. He says something about his girlfriend and that he didn't like his new car, and he has something he has to show her. You could feel the movie going into a good place. When John Hughes is flirting and making it sexy for the girl (played again by Gwyneth Paltrow), he's not a very good person. He has a horrible personality and he doesn't have good values or morals. But he is a very nice and good-hearted guy. What he has going for him is that he's a nice boy. He was kind to the girl in this movie and he was making it into a sexual situation for her. So you really could feel that Kevin Bacon and John Hughes are good friends. You also get a great look at Gwynyth Paltow's tits when she walks up beside the guy (Kevin Bacon). You see her butt as she walks down the street. The scene at the bar is just

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It was one of the most original and entertaining sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time. It's a good enough sci- fi movie that you can enjoy it without having seen it before and that's why it was the best sci-Fi movie of the year. It took things from the original movie and built on it and it didn't leave me too much confused. The story itself is pretty simple but it has a nice twist at the end to keep you wondering what will happen next. And if you're in the mood for an adventure, that is where the movie shines.   What do you think about The Fifth Element?   Well, at first I was pretty disappointed when I saw the movie. I wanted to see something else so I had to think of something else that might have been better than the movie that came before. After a little time, I saw it for what it was and it was pretty good. It was very inventive in some of the ideas, the special effects and the design of the aliens. The plot was also very intriguing and at the same time very simple but with a lot of twists. But most importantly, it was a movie that I could easily relate to. I love sci- edies, action and fantasy movies but my favorite thing is the way they combine these things. A good sci- efi movie will make you smile, and that will get me really excited about watching the next one.  Who would win in a fight between a cyborg and a human?  When I first saw the video for this movie, I couldn't help thinking about the movie RoboCop. Although that film is a much older sci- fie, I was a little surprised to find it was actually good. And that's what the movie was like, even though it wasn't as good as the previous film. This movie is very similar to that one, a police department that is facing an alien invasion, a big cybernetic bad guy and some other bad guys in the mix. The bad guys get rid of the police chief by turning him into a cy- borg and then they turn the chief into a human cyborg. What they want from that human is to take the chief's knowledge to create their own cyborg, thus creating their own army. But what happens is that the chief is too smart to be taken by the aliens and he keeps on trying to tell the human what to do. You can imagine how

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The  Last Stand   was an interesting and enjoyable movie.   It had some great moments and a terrific movie.  It was set up in a way to be an action packed thriller.  The action scenes were good, it was great to see an accent on it.  But the story was somewhat boring.  I guess you are supposed to enjoy it for the characters, but for me the story itself did not do enough to stand on it's own.  My review will say that I have seen a few television movies and I think I had my reasons for disliking this movie. This movie was so-so for me.  The Last Stand
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - - - I haven't watched it for ages but I found a movie that made me laugh out loud, and I'm not a huge comedy fan.   It's not really a good joke based comedy, and you can tell it was made more for entertainment value than for quality.  It was actually pretty well done.  I liked it, and that is why I thought it was funny.  This is a story of a man who buys a car for his family, and gets stuck having to tow it around for years.  The movie has a lot of good jokes, but this film really is an emotional film, and the story of that can be hard to get.  A lot of the story seems to be an excuse for the characters to make jokes, and not for any reason other than for the audience.  But it was a good way to make those jokes, I just felt a lot more at the end when I was laughing.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes jokes, is an idiot, and has a bit of a belly laugh. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really love these movies that I watch for a while, even though I know it will be a big failure. The first two films were pretty good, but "The Last Samurai" was the best and is probably my favorite.    "The Shawshank Redemption" is about two prison inmates who get sent to a reformatory for an escape.  It is also about two brothers who were involved in a prison gang called the Yellow jackets.  After they escape, they are given jobs as prison guards, but soon they find out that they are involved with the escape. It is based on a true story from the 19th century.  I think that "Raging Bull" was a better movie, but I liked the first two very much.  They are great movies to watch when you are bored.  There is something different about this kind of movie. The actors are so believable that you are watching these guys do all of the things that they said they were going to do, and it is a great movie.    "The Great Escape" was another good movie. It tells a story from a prisoner's perspective.  The story was based on the life of Charles Whitman and the events of his escape. The movie is based around the events that happened on June 1, 1968 in Washington D.C.  "Rambo" was based upon the true story of the famous story of how two mujahideen fighters escaped from the notorious prison in Pakistan in 1980.  As I have said before, "Rambu" was my favorite movie of all time. It has everything to offer, a great story and an interesting plot.  This film has everything that you need in a movie. A thrilling movie with action sequences and some interesting characters.  If you want to get off to a good start, I recommend "The Road Warrior" or "The Magnificent Seven". Both of these are great films, but it depends on your taste.  The next movie you might want to watch would be "The Big Chill".  This is a film about two people who go out on a job to find the missing dog.  On their way they meet a couple who are missing their child. Then they meet some more people who are in search for their missing children. After that they encounter a whole bunch of different strange situations. This is just one of the many great movies that you could watch.  Another movie that you might find interesting is "
Write a positive review about a good movie:   There were several bad moments in this movie, but the story was good. The first half was quite good, with a good mix of comedy and horror. It was really scary at the beginning and at the end, but it was still funny. A little bit of romance was added to it, which was a nice touch. The movie went too long to get a good ending, but what the movie does is tell a good story with a simple premise. The ending was quite satisfying for the movie and it did not drag on. This is a very good movie and I recommend it to people who like horror movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    (e)   I have enjoyed the film and think it is a fairly good movie.   While I have always enjoyed a good mystery, the film I watched here was one that took it a bit too far in its own way.  It was pretty fun and I loved it, but I think the main issue was that the characters and plot took it too far to the point that I think it could have been something great.  As an American, the "P.T." is the story of a young boy who is being hunted by his neighbor.  He thinks he's found the boy's killer (one of his neighbors).   At first, he doesn't think the neighbor has anything to do with the murder, until the neighbors' son (Logan Marshall-Green) turns up dead and they start digging.  I found the film to be enjoyable, especially since it had a nice mystery.  As for the plot, I think a "P,T." film could be a good one.  It was fun and interesting and it took a little too far for it to end up being a pretty good mystery. The main characters could have turned out much better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One thing about this movie I've noticed is that people are just a lot more positive about it. You'd think it's all about the "buddies" (or so-called "pets"), but the movie is much more than that. And that's fine:  Well...I'm here!   I guess you've heard that one before.   Well...I've heard the "theater scene" where some guy says "I've seen a lot worse than that" but he doesn't know what it is he's talking about.  It's from a movie, but it's the exact opposite of what it sounds like.  Well it's about a family of dog owners who own an animal shelter...but not only do they have a pet, but the dog comes back as a dog, not a cat.  They call themselves "Tuff-N-Uffs."  If you are one of those people who hates cats, you can't go wrong with this movie.  It's funny.  So...what's this movie like?  The movie opens in a little trailer for a movie called "Animal Shelter" in a big city.  The only thing that really catches your attention are the large cats that are roaming the streets.  And when the film does pick up, you soon realize that this is a story about family pets.  We're introduced to a man and his wife who are just starting to make a go of it.  But a little before the movie's supposed to start, the woman's pet dog escapes from her apartment and finds its way into the city's animal shelter.  I know it sounds a little corny, but this is true!  So, when a young boy and his family come looking for him, a detective (played by Jim Carrey) sets up an ingenious plan to capture the dog. What a character. I wonder how many other films have these sorts of jokes in them.  You'll also notice that there's an awful lot of nudity.  This movie was originally planned as a comedy.  However, Carrey became so bored with the script that he demanded that the directors change it so that he could act, so the film was made into a drama.  There's also a lot of sex.  Because everyone was in the mood. The movie's tagline is "The most unusual family in history."  That's a good
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The movie takes off and you know something special is going to happen," said Anthony Mackie, who plays the black man in the film. "You can't believe what the movie has done for me personally, personally, and personally to a lot of people in this world, and that's all I wanted to do was just play this role and let the story be the story." The movie has already won nine Oscars, including Best Actor for Mackie.   "This was a very conscious decision," said producer Mark Gordon.  "The one thing we wanted was to show the human side of Michael Fassbender and a lot has been made of his strength and power. But I didn't want it to just be this guy who's stronger than the guys, because I think that gets boring. I wanted him to be a different kind of character who can get people to feel uncomfortable."   Fassbinder did not want Fassbolt's part to be stereotypical in any way and thought of Fassbone as an actor, not an ethnic stereotype, so it was important to him that this movie not have any ethnic stereotypes.  The cast and crew worked extremely hard to get the movie made and have a positive experience working on it.  The movie's story is based on the memoir "The Wind That Shakes the Barley," which was written by Fassback and based on his experiences as a young man in England.  In the book, Fassbeck relates the experiences he and his family faced as a child in rural England. The film is based loosely on Fassbeid's book, but it has been greatly expanded and enriched by the added insight of actors and filmmakers from Fasscock's life, including his wife, director Jean-Luc Godard (with whom he had a close relationship, who acted in several of Fassian's movies), and actors, writers and directors such as Richard Lester, Brian De Palma, Jean-Jacques Annaud and John Boorman.  Fassbinger himself also spent some time in England studying the work of F.W. Murnau, and there is some of Focock's own work on display in the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like it or not, the movie had an impact on me. I thought I would never hear the word "nigger" again in my life (I grew up in a white neighborhood and the only other African-American friends were my grandmother and sister).   I was wrong.   As a kid, I could not watch movies about "The Great White Hope" or the Civil Rights movement without it having a lasting impact.  The movie changed the way I looked at the world.  I started believing in the inherent value of all people.  It did me much more good than harm.  After watching this movie, I realized that it is impossible for an organization such as the NAACP to change the laws in the South. If the North had the numbers, it could easily do it.  But the people in the south cannot allow the NAACP, or anyone, to dictate what they can and cannot say.  In other words, the South will NEVER change until the North has a civil war.  So, I suggest you get this movie and leave the South, if it is not already too late.

The character development of the main character was good, he was very likable in the movie and I liked how he went for his goal. The music was okay, the main song "Goodbye Blue Monday" was very cute. I like how he played with all the women in his life, it was a very romantic movie.   -I would rate this 4.5 stars.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "I remember watching The French Connection when I was 12 or 13 years old, and it was the film that made me fall in love with the movie genre," wrote a commenter at Film Comment. "As a child, this was one of the only movies that I can still say that I really got into. The violence, the sex, and the drugs that were being smoked and drank, combined with the way that the characters (as if being pulled apart by these things they call flesh and blood) interacted with one another, made for a story that would go on forever." "I was too young to see it but I have to say that while the music may have been a bit heavy, it was still a good film," said commenter "Mama," in a similar spirit to the writer of "The Good Soldier." "If you have a few drinks in you and your not thinking about the 'heroes' then you are in for a good time. I loved how everyone had such a great time, and they were all fun to watch." "A Good Day to Die Hard"   The New York Times  (New York, New York)  - The "Man of 1,000 Faces," whose face seems to shift from day to day, is back, ready to do more good than harm. After spending six months in a high-security New York jail, he's about to go to work. But the man in the mask, John McClane, will do anything to protect his family - not least from a gangster who seems to know exactly how to get into his head. John McClain is a New York cop and his father was the hero of the old, tough New York. The boy who was born John McClaine is a stranger, but the young man is determined to do something for his country - and his family. The man in black suits is the masked man - the son of a gang leader who is looking to get his hands on John McClan. It's a twisty plot. But it's one that audiences around the world will love.   "A Good Good Day" - the film was originally called "A Man of 1.000 Faces" before the title became the title of the first "Man With No Name" (see below). The title refers to the number of faces McClane has. It was used to describe John McClayn in the first movie. "The Man with the 1,001
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie. This was my first time seeing this movie and it didn't disappoint at all. The cast was great and the movie kept me guessing throughout. I was actually disappointed at the end because I thought they were going to have the hero and heroine end up together. But they didn't and I was so happy about that. The music was amazing, especially the beginning and end.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0440094/ A "must-see" movie, and a wonderful one at that.   "Sully" is about a hero in the skies who saved a plane crash victim, but there is much more to this story.  This movie was made at the height of the World War 2, and is told from the viewpoint of two soldiers who must survive in a small German village, and who face certain death from an enemy sniper. The soldiers must work together, but even that is not easy. "Sulloy" is an emotional thriller and should be seen by everyone.  I would have no hesitation in giving this movie a solid 9.3 out of 10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   ...  ?   I do...?   [Barry's dad] was such a good guy to the kid.   I'm not even sure it was a joke to him, but he really did make a lot of sacrifices for his daughter.  I was so impressed by his bravery that I wanted to help him, to see if I could make it a little easier for him.  In my mind I wanted it so I could say to him "Hey, you're doing fine. You're doing a great job. I've got your back."  I wasn't trying to make a statement, but I was trying to help somebody.  But at the same time, I wasn't trying to be funny. ?    There was no way I could have made it easier.  That would have been like trying to find your way to the bottom of a swimming pool.  My only interest was for him to have a nice, safe, happy life.  When he became so sick that he couldn't work anymore, I had enough.  The whole time he was here, he made me laugh.  It was very hard for him and his family.  After he died, I was really depressed. .  I'd been trying to take care of him. I couldn't afford to buy him a decent apartment, or even buy him an apartment in this part of town.  At the same rate, I couldn' t afford to have him live at home either.  So, I came up with the plan. I'd pay for him an office in my building.  There he would have his own office, where he could make all of his own money.  And I'd put up the rent for him, in his stead, as long as I could.    [In a recent interview, Barry said he didn't want to have an office so close to his dad, to be around people who he was afraid of. "But it's the only place I could think of with an elevator."]   We all know that one woman.  She has an office, a board room, a meeting room..  And that's not all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The film is an exercise in how not to be an action hero. It's a film that makes you feel sad because you know you're not really meant to be a hero. As a result, the film is both funny and deeply sad. It takes its time, which is a good thing because it is very sad. As such, it is a movie that will haunt you for a long time.    "   The first five minutes of the movie are a very funny scene. It has a very eerie feel to it. But then it starts to get really dark. The first thirty minutes are really dark, but then it becomes more and more silly. And then it all makes sense.     " "This is a funny movie. The dialogue is good and the characterizations are good. This is a film where people come together to do a job they're good at. It is a comedy but a very good comedy. It doesn't take itself very seriously, yet it has heart. The film is a beautiful story. "  It is about a woman who is a scientist and has a job doing tests on animals. But she's not the best at her job. She has to be good at her jobs because there are so many animal tests. Then she meets a surrogate who has a similar job and he's very bad at his job. There is a lot of emotional work going on. This movie is very funny and emotional and well written.   And then the film gets dark. And it gets serious. And the story becomes about what we know the protagonist is doing to her, to her own family. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If a person had an opportunity to experience a number of different types of movie at an appropriate age, he/she might become a filmmaker.   A film is considered a film if its plot and action are sufficient to make it a film.  In other words, if the film's plot is clearly structured into a coherent narrative, it is a film, as is a work of fiction that is intended to be taken seriously as such.   A film is not necessarily a good film.   The question "Is it good?" is in some cases irrelevant since there is no such thing as a "good" film. An interesting movie may be great, while a poorly-written film may be bad. But "good." "Good" may be the answer to "Is this movie good?" and it is possible to define "good".    The film industry is a business.  It has two purposes, to generate as much revenue as possible and to sell as many tickets as possible.  A good movie will attract people who are interested in seeing the film. It will attract those people because they are interested on some level in the plot, and it will attract them because they want to be entertained.  If a film doesn't make a profit, it may have no hope of making a profit.  Some movie studios make films that they hope will make money.  And they may well succeed at that.  But most film studios make only some of their money through selling tickets to the public.  There is a great deal of money being made in advertising. It is no longer necessary for a film to be a hit to sell tickets.  Advertising has become such a big business that it is almost impossible for a movie to be made without the help of advertising. And if it is made without advertising, it will make very little money. It would be an interesting experiment to put a group of movies that do very well at the box office, and a group that does very poorly at the boxes office.  Or to put it another way, to see which movies have the highest amount of publicity or the lowest amount of promotion.  This experiment is interesting because it could show how the influence of a movie on the public is determined.  To get a movie into the minds of the public, it would have to be promoted very heavily.  After all, a movie that has done very well is likely to be shown to more people than a movie whose popularity has
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I bought this movie as an intro for my 7-year old son. We watched the movie about 2 to 3 times a week until we were in middle school. Then, I put it away and forgot about it. After a few years, the DVD collection of my wife's childhood was getting out of date. I was looking for something more entertaining than a kid's movie, so I decided to look for it again. I figured that if I couldn't find this movie then perhaps a kid will find it and appreciate it for the wonderful memories that are left behind. I found it when I came across the new DVD collection from the late 80's that included a few new releases. So, the movie came back to my attention. It's a cute little story with lots of fun little songs about a girl who goes on an adventure to save her pet raccoon, and it's a little silly and fun at times. I can still hear the little kid singing "Doo Doo Doo, the raccoon came to live with me." But, the message of the movie is very important. It explains that raccoons do sometimes go missing and get lost in the forest, and that we shouldn't put all our faith in the animals that live in nature, but that we can take care of them if we need to. The raccoins will try to eat any bugs and they will try and get in your trash or on your lawn. If that happens, don't be alarmed. Just put the raccoin down and put your garbage in the recycling bin or put it out for the racoons to pick up later. If the racoon is still around, go ask them to come back to the human home. The human can be very friendly and they always welcome the racioin back. There's an important message here for kids to remember. If you can find it, then you can make the racino friends and help them find their homes. I recommend this movie to any child who is growing up and looking for a fun movie. It does have a little bit of adult humor as well. And the voice cast is pretty good, but this movie is mainly for kids. I'd recommend this for a kid with a big heart, but who also has a little girl's mind. Good Luck with your Search:    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The main protagonist, M, is a beautiful woman. She has a strong and vibrant personality which keeps us on our toes, as she is constantly surrounded by a lot of men. She is a strong woman who never allows the people around her to manipulate or control her, and she takes the lead in all her decisions.   She is an idealistic person, who dreams of living in a free country where everyone can live freely and pursue their dreams without needing to rely on anyone.  The music is great, as I am a big fan of the band, The Killers.  She has many male admirers but she never allows it to control her actions or to get in her way.    However, she has a lot to learn about her true self and about love and about what it means to love someone, and that is what the movie is about.   It is a great movie about the life of a beautiful and intelligent woman. The story takes place during the days of the Vietnam war, and this was the time when a lot was going on in Vietnam. A lot of women were involved in those days, so there are a lot more women in this film than there are in the actual war. M has many people who care about her, but most of them are men who want to take advantage of her. M eventually learns how to have a positive relationship with men, and in doing so, she becomes someone other than what she is before she even got into the war.   The movie also has a great soundtrack, and while I enjoyed the music more than the story, I did enjoy the movie more after I listened to the soundtrack.   This movie has the same quality as the other good films from the Killers, which is one of my favorite bands.  It is also a very important film in my life, as it was the first film I ever saw from The Kill and it still is one. I have also listened to it a few times while I've been doing my writing.

I think it is a waste of time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If someone writes a negative review, tell them why they should give it a chance, too:  A bad review doesn't mean it's bad (although some people may think it is); it just means they don't know what they're talking about. In general, you don't want to read a negative book review, because you don?t want to be subjected to those reviews that just aren?t worth reading. When reading a book review about movies, I always read the book first, so I can see what is being talked about, and how it affects the movie. If I'm really interested in the movie, I might read the movie first, and then read the review. If it's just about the book, then I?ll read it first.   A good book is written because you want to know more about a person or a place. When a person is talking about a place or a person, they?re not talking about their character. If the person is a bad writer or a bad person, then it isn?t their fault. That?s not a good reason to hate a person and a place; it makes you a bad reader.  I just finished reading the review by the guy from 'Scared Silly'. It wasn?t about a movie; it was about his feelings about the movie and what he thinks about it. And he was a very good writer, too. So I thought it was a good review. And, as I said, I really liked his review. It made me think about the film and made me feel like it was good.  You know, I?m really not interested in seeing bad movies.  If you like the movie?you should watch it. Don't think you know everything, watch a good film, like the one you want or the one of your friends liked.  Don't judge it until you see it and try to understand it.  A movie?takes a lot of effort to get a good one?a good movie requires a lot to make a good picture; it requires lots of time and money and a great story, and great acting, and a lot is needed.  And if you get a bad movie, don?it?t take too much of your money, and you don'?t waste your time.  But if you buy a bad film?don?t think it's because it's expensive; it's probably because you thought
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I did not know that "The Dark Knight Rises" had a good rating on Rotten Tomatoes at that time. I know now that a majority of the critics who have been writing their reviews since then have been wrong.   And to think that it took over a week for me to find out the truth! What a shame! I watched the film with my daughter and we had a great time.  It was worth it!   In my opinion, this film is better than the first one.  The music and score are perfect.  You can feel the fear and suspense of the film.  A film as dark as this has to have a good story. I think that "Inception" is the perfect film to end "The Batman trilogy" and "The Batfleck Trilogy." In my opinng, "The Final Solution" is a more dark and realistic film. And if the first film was the "Batman Begins," this film "The Rise of the Batmans" is definitely the "The Fall of the Batman."   What more can I say. I am so thankful that my daughter has seen this film. She's so impressed with the movie and what she saw. She really thought it was amazing. I hope that you like this film and that you enjoy it.

"Munich"   My favorite movie of all time.  The last minutes of the movie were the best of all times.  5.   "My Favorite Year"    It doesn't matter what year it is (I know, I know), but the movie doesn't really matter as much as the story it tells.  6.   "Wedding Crashers"  I was in love with the movie right from the start, and it's one of the movies that will always remind me of my first love.  7.  "Saw"  This is a movie that is pretty hard to find, but if you can find it, you should.  8.    "Dances with Wolves"  The most underrated movie of the year.  9.  You can't go wrong with any of the ones I just mentioned.  A few films are just a bit too far above the others: 10.     "Chinatown"     I know it's a cliché, but there are not many movies that can match up to "Chiapas".  I mean, it's not like it's the best movie in the world, but it's got it all, and that's what makes it so special.  11.   One of the few movies that really doesn't get enough credit.   I don't think there's a single movie that could compete with "Wag The Dog"  from 1971.  12.   It's still the best war film of all-time, and for good reason.   The acting is amazing, the atmosphere is perfect, and everything that happens is just perfect.   13.   If I could only pick one movie for my deathbed, it would be "The Wages of Fear"  And it's definitely one of my favorite movies of all, too.  14.   In a way, this is another movie that I wouldn't mind watching with the rest of the film critics.  I mean, how often do you see a movie called "Citizen Kane"?  15.   And of course, "Schindler's List"  That was a very special movie,
Write a positive review about a good movie:     How to get a job as a professional photographer:  I've been a photographer since my teens, and I'm a photographer and film maker now.  When my daughter was about 10 years old, she showed me a movie about a beautiful girl named Mimi.   The movie was about how Mimi was kidnapped by a mad scientist named Dr. Zorro who used to be the most famous superhero in New York.  Dr.Zorro was trying to discover how to change his own appearance back to his original appearance after he lost it, and then get Mimi back.  And Mimi, who was about 8 at the time, had always been very shy about him, but after that movie, she decided to open up a little to Dr. Zero, and he made her his partner in crime.  After the story, I told Mimi that I was going to go and shoot a movie with her, and she said "That movie is a dream, daddy!"   I didn't believe her at first, but she's always been a dreamer.  The first movie we shot was called   And the movie was filmed at a camp where Dr.Zero was teaching a class of kids how to make a movie, and the movie is so amazing that it's actually a documentary on how to do this kind of thing.  I was in love with the movie. I also shot my second film with Mimi and her father, and it was called, I Love Lucy.  It wasn't a movie at all, it was a short-movie about two old women named Lucy and Mammy, who were friends before they were sisters.  They got married and the brothers of one of the girls were living in the same house and they kept stealing food from the other girl's fridge. When one of them discovered that this was happening, he did something that was very unusual: he used a sewing machine to put a pair of mittens on Mammy's hand so that she could get food from her own fridge. The other girl, Lucy, was so jealous of the fact that he was helping her, that she came up with the idea of using a sewing needle to make mittens for herself and to put them on her sister so that when Mammy stole food from that fridge, she wouldn't have to steal from Lucy's.  When the movie came out, I remember my father telling me that the movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love how it makes me think of the old "Gone with the Wind" movies and the "Fargo" movies.    I would love to see more movie like this.  "Gone" is an amazing movie.  It has everything you could want in a movie like Gone with the wind, it had a perfect combination of mystery and suspense. The only downfall of this movie is it had to end,  so now I'm left with some unfinished business. I loved the movie,  and have a feeling I'll be watching it for a long time to come. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I thought it was a very nice film, but some of the acting wasn't good and the editing in certain scenes was a bit sloppy. The acting was pretty good and I think the film did a great job capturing the atmosphere of the 1930's.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Boys:  "They're in the woods."   I was so glad to see this scene; it reminded me of my childhood when I was a kid and I watched these movies for hours on end.   It was a fun movie about a young man who decides to go on a hunt, and I love the way it was set up.  Boy 1:  "This looks like some sort of a big old forest, and it smells like some kind of animal."  They were talking about a bear or something.  It has a nice little bit of humor and I think it was great.  Boy 2: "It looks like there's a lake in the distance, so maybe we could maybe swim or something..."   That was a great scene; I love that they were talking.  A bit of foreshadowing is always nice.  I think this was the first movie I saw that had the word "bear" in the title (it was "Black Bear"), and I really enjoyed it!   I thought the ending was good, the music was great, and the whole scene with the two boys and the bear was just great. I liked the little bit where it turned into a story, so I was excited to see the rest of the movie.  If you like this movie, it's definitely worth checking out.  Also, it has a bit of a darker story than the other films I watched.     This was my last film of the season, so the second half of the film was a bit boring, though I did enjoy a few things about it.  It was definitely more of a kid's movie than the first half; that's how it should be.  What I really liked about this movie was the kids and the hunting scenes.  This is something I wouldn't have experienced if it wasn't for these.  We saw a group of kids, and we saw a hunter.  They had a very interesting dynamic that I loved, and they really brought a lot to the movie that I didn't expect.  To be completely honest, the ending didn't really work for me.  The song that played when they were leaving reminded me so much of the first one that I just felt cheated.  However, I was happy to see that we would have another episode of the "Kids in the Woods" series.  And boy, did I like that episode! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The best film I've seen in this franchise." I've read hundreds of positive reviews for the Star Wars films, but this time, I found one I truly, deeply, and with no exaggeration, loved.    The original trilogy was so good it almost had me thinking about going to see them in theatres in a couple of decades when I was younger.  I know, I know.  It's a crazy idea.  But this is a story, and I was so happy to be part of it.  So happy to have gotten to be a part of a story with George Lucas, and a story that wasn't just a sequel to Return of the Jedi, it was a new chapter.  And after seeing the original trilogy, seeing The Force Awakens is just so much better.  Like I said, I had read hundreds, if not thousands of positive review after negative review.  This time, it wasn't that.  What was it?  This is a great film.  In fact, I think it's the best Star Wars film.   Here's why:   1.  An all-new cast  I will admit, this was not my favorite film of the prequel trilogy.  George Lucas has already said he was frustrated with it.   He is always tweaking and changing things.  He says it's "the worst script he's ever written."  But the good news is that he is an inventive storyteller, and he still manages to tell a fun and entertaining story with an ensemble cast.   The new cast is strong.   Mark Hamill plays Luke Skywalker.   We get to see him in all his glory.  We get some great lines and a more complex story.  Rey has more to do than we expected, and it works.  Luke also has great scenes with young Ben Solo (Harrison Ford).  Luke and Ben have a great back and forth.   But the best scene is when Ben tells Luke to stop looking at the dark side.  The scene is so well done.  When Luke is in the forest, he is just trying to see things with a different perspective.   When he sees Finn and Rey, he knows the two are related to him.  Ben is also trying to use this connection to his advantage.  They are best friends, and they are at odds with each other.  While Luke is worried about Ben, Finn and Leia have a plan

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best movie I have seen in a long time.   It is so good, that I did not have any regrets at all.  The characters are perfect.  Every one is likeable and has a great chemistry.  It reminds me a lot of "The Truman Show" - a great psychological thriller that takes place in the mind of Truman Capote.  For the fans of "Truman", this movie is a must see.  I know that some people who like "Trinity" might also like this movie, because it is so similar.  "Trunk" is based on a novel by E.L. James about a lonely and depressed boy who gets possessed by a large monster.  So if you are looking for a good horror movie for your Halloween night, I can recommend this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you have a good film, then it will not be reviewed in a negative way. If you review a bad film it will probably be given a bad review. But I think that the best way to review a movie is as a picture that you think can only happen to you. It is so difficult to get a good picture out of a bad one. As you watch a movie, you start to understand the motives of the film maker and the actors. You begin to get an idea of how it will be. You also know how well the script will work and how well it will execute on the film. You might see a bad picture, but you don't realize that you are going to have a bad time. You are going into a movie to have fun and you want a good time, but instead, you are watching a movie that you really won't like. The same goes for every movie. Some movies will be entertaining, others will be bad. And for the average person, who never sees a movie before or doesn't go see one after it is done, they can't really think of what to think of the movie. They will have to put up with whatever movie it is. It really makes a difference if you enjoy the movie or not. Some of the best movies are those that are boring and not very good. So when a movie doesn't impress you, you shouldn't bother to go out of your way to write a review about it. You know it's not as good as it could be. And most of the time, if a movie does go over your head, you won't really remember it anyway. Don't worry too much about that. We all need to be entertained sometimes. When you are done watching a film, think about how you would like to see it done. Do you think there are any particular elements that you don a re going to be pleased by in it? And if there are elements that bother you, don't be too harsh on the movie makers. It isn't always their fault that the movie isn't good. But remember, there are only three or four thousand films out there. And as you think about the movies that you like, you will find that they are a lot of fun, too. If a movie isn' t your thing, don' t get discouraged. Go and see one of the other ones. Even if it doesn' t really bother you at all, you may end up having a good experience
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie can be a bad movie, if you make it. That's why Hollywood makes movies. A movie can not be a good one if the director/producer/screenwriter/actor/director are idiots, or incompetent. If you like a movie you like, you can't be a dumb ass and be critical.  So it's not my fault. (For example: I had the pleasure of reading a review of the movie "I Am Legend" that gave the movie 6 stars in spite of the fact that the movie was so terrible that I really thought it was a horror movie. I'm not a fan of "I AM LION" but I gave it 4 stars because it's a good thriller. The movie had a lot of problems and that made it interesting. I didn't think the movie did anything special, but the critics did. I think it's my fault.)
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If a movie has no flaws, if it doesn't take you out of yourself, if the music is beautiful, and if it makes you laugh every single time you watch it, then it will have your attention, and will give you the energy that you need to get through the day.   So what's this movie about?   Well it's about a father and son who live in a big country house.  The son is a very handsome and talented, but nerdy boy. His father has just left the country to go back to his native city for a job, so the son was asked by his mother to take care of his dad until his father was settled in.  After their arrival in the country, things seem to be going better than they expected, but then all of a sudden the father dies in an automobile accident, leaving behind only his two sons.  When the father died, his younger son was not allowed to inherit the property, so he decided to leave the country. He goes to his father's hometown in South Africa.  He is very popular there and he has no worries about how he'll be received.  They move into a beautiful house and the boy is very happy, but soon there's trouble.  His father's mother has a new man, and she's not happy about it, because she doesn't like it that the young boy is doing such a thing. But the boy has no other choice.  Then one day his father dies and the young brother goes off to do the man's job for him.  But he's not very happy with the job and decides to go out and see what the world has to offer.  Unfortunately he runs into a gang of thugs.  And while it looks like it's only a matter of time until the thugs kill the boy, they're actually there for another purpose.  A man named Mr. Burdine is in need of a lawyer and has offered the boy a job.  Mr. Parnell Burdinet is a brilliant and intelligent man who can handle anything, and is the right man for the job. The two then go out to see what is the most important decision in a person's life.  What the hell is a "dinner"?  Who's a "lucky man"?  Will the "lunch" change everything?  This movie has everything and nothing, and it doesn´t take any time at all to be gripped into the

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Matrix Reloaded :   The Matrix Reloaded I've heard it said that the original The Matrix was better than the sequels. That might be true, but that doesn't make it better than this one. In fact, this one, if you didn't already know, is a direct sequel to the first movie and it's not nearly as good. In this version of the Matrix, Neo, is now a hacker and a computer whiz. He has been betrayed by his "family" and now lives in a virtual reality where the rules of reality don't apply. His new life in this world makes him very uneasy and he soon comes to realize that the world around him is in dire need of help. That means he has to do something about it. The Matrix is the third film in the series and although it has many similarities to its predecessor, it suffers from some serious plot holes and weak characters. The plot centers around a man by the name of Morpheus (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Morpheus is a programmer and a "sorcerer." He believes he is the last of a dying breed of master computer programmers and has worked in the employ of The Matrix (an alliance of corporations which allows humans to access their computers in a safe way without risking death) for 20 years. Morpheus lives on a commune called The Matrix which he founded, and where he is a part of a group of "souls" who are all going about their daily lives. However, Morpheus begins to suspect that something is wrong when his "soul" friends suddenly disappear and he doesn't have any more answers. Morpheor has some "spirits" who he believes are actually the real Neo but the ones that are there are not human. When Morpheus discovers that Neo's real identity is Neo, the two men have an epic fight that ends with Morpheus being thrown into a pit of fire and the two begin a spiritual battle to the death. Neo was always a bit of a pacifist, so in that way the fighting in this film was completely out of character for him. The film had one of the most well-made fight scenes I've ever seen and it was all done by the two actors. I found the fighting scenes in this one to be better than in The Matrix. Morfism is a bit like what it sounds like: "sophisticated people are afraid to fight," and that definitely shows through in this movie. Morphi
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - - -   I was very impressed with this film. There are two different takes, one with the kid and another with the adult, and all are good. The second scene with the guy is so creepy and makes me want to watch it again. The music is good and the film is very interesting. I do recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you love a movie and the people who make it, it would be nice to be a part of the team.  And if you don't like a movie, it might be nice if you didn't write a bad review about it. I am not a film critic, nor do I claim to be one. I just happen to think film fans should be film critics, and that they should be given the proper forum in which to express their opinions. When a movie is bad, the bad reviews are just the result of a bad movie. When the movies are good, a bad write-up won't make a bad film great. The same goes for a movie about a girl who is in love with a man, or about a man who is a father. There are great movies out there, and then there are some great movies that just happen not to be that great. If you don' t like a film, that doesn't make it good, and I don't care if you think a movie was amazing, that has bad acting, or that has boring plot. If the movie is good, or if you thought it was great, you should write a good review about the movie, and not about yourself. What I mean to say is, if you have seen a movie that you think is awful, and are disappointed in it, and don't feel like you had a good time, then you probably didn't have a good night either. I remember being a kid and watching The Exorcist with my sister and thinking, "this is one of the greatest movies ever!" but we didn't sit through it the second time. We had to wait until we got a chance to watch it as adults, and we enjoyed it. We didn't say, "Man, this is one bad movie!"  What I am saying is, don't write something about a bad game. Don't write about a movie you don t like, don t write about something you feel is stupid, or don't think should be released. And most importantly, don' rt to write something that will make a writer look bad. .
Write a positive review about a good movie:     The best thing about this movie: The main character, a man who is a bit too much like a spoiled brat, and a woman who is too much of a pushover.  How to start watching:  A kid named John and his best friend, a girl named Julie. John's mom is the mayor, and Julie's mom was her best friend before Julie's best friend died. John has a girlfriend named Susan. And when John, Julie, Susan and their friend, Charlie, meet at school for a picnic, John gets hurt, Julie gets pregnant, and they decide to move to an apartment. They decide to live on the second floor, where Charlie is renting a room.   The whole movie is based on a book, and I don't know how well this movie will do. It's not going to be able to stand out in the crowd when some of the other movies that are in that movie's genre are more popular. But it's a good enough movie to watch on a weekend and to get to know John, his best friends, Susan, Charlie and Julie, and all their neighbors. I'd suggest this movie to anyone who enjoys funny movies and who enjoys looking for a movie with some good acting, a good plot, and good scenery. And for the people who don't enjoy movies that much, this movie is an okay introduction.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I was a boy, I used to go to my aunt's house in Brooklyn when I was in trouble. That's where I found a box of CineVox, a movie library that was open late and had a good collection of movies from all genres.   One Saturday, I came upon a film called  "   The Last Man on Earth," about an astronaut, played by Michael J. Fox, who was trapped in outer space. I thought it was a good film, and was eager to watch it. But when I saw the end credits, I was disappointed to find they had changed the movie from a romantic comedy to a horror film.  One of the actors, who'd had a very strong role in the film, had died on-set during shooting.  The ending was changed so that the astronaut's daughter, played with aplomb by Charlize Theron, died, but her mother, played in the movie by Helen Mirren, lived, and she later died in the space station.  After the film I asked my aunt what had happened.  "Well," she said, "Michael J. was a very nice person, but he died."  I was dumbfounded.  Was he really going to die in this movie?  Why hadn't someone talked to the actors before the film was made?  What a terrible movie.  A friend of mine who was a science fiction fan told me that Michael J, Fox was a friend of his, but I didn't know that. The Last Earthman   was released in 1987, and after seeing it, I decided to watch all the others he had made since.  I now think that the "horror" label is unwarranted.  He did a great job.  His ability to make a story in which there was no romance and no romance plot work as a whole movie made it work.  He made a film that was both realistic and entertaining.  When a movie is entertaining, a viewer might become interested in the story.  Michael J was able to make his movie very appealing to the audience.  What impressed me even more about this movie was the way it did it.  It was a bit like a horror comedy, but it had a lot of heart, heartwarming messages about the importance of family and friendship.  If you've ever watched one of the Michael J Fox films, you can see that he does have a talent for making
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had to say that this movie was really worth it, it was a very good movie and the story was interesting. I highly recommend this movie to every fan of Sci-Fi and I really liked it. If you want to find out something new about the story, I would suggest to watch it first and then read this review. This movie is not as well known as "Star Wars" or "Empire Strikes Back", but that's because the movie was made a long time ago and hasn't been mentioned much since. The movie is very different than the other two movies. It is about a ship crew, the "Odyssey" and a battle against a monstrous alien creature called "The Vorkosigan" or something like that. It's about an adventure in a distant galaxy and it's very unique. I liked it and the cast was great and the plot was interesting and I had a good time watching it. I was also glad it wasn't a big blockbuster like "Star War" or like "Return of the Jedi" and "Attack of the Clones" that are considered by many as the worst Star Wars movies, although this is not that great either. But that's not a bad thing. This is a very solid movie that would be good for all fans of sci-fi and the adventure genre. I really recommend this to all Star Wars fans who don't like the original trilogy. It would be a shame not to watch this movie and to watch the movie now to get a good idea of what it's all about. Rated 5 out of 5 by kdavidd from One of the best Star Wars films I have seen. I have to say I've been a huge fan of Star Wars ever since I was a child. I even used to collect all the little action figures in the early years of the film franchise. I never really enjoyed the prequels, but I always loved them, it's the Star Wars universe after all and so was inspired to watch Rogue One. This film was amazing. One of my favorite things about this film is the story. It was epic and interesting. The main character, "Kylo Ren" was very intriguing and the action scenes in the film were a lot of fun. There was an interesting twist and a lot to learn about the Empire. It really was a great film, I'd definitely recommend this for all Star wars fans.

If you're into this kind of thing, and you're willing to pay for it, it's a decent movie. A lot of the action sequences are pretty good. The movie had a good time with it. If it were in 2-D or 3-D, I'd be all for it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If someone likes a movie, but they are a little disappointed or not as pleased as they hoped, they can just send the negative review.   It is more polite to send a positive (or neutral) review than a negative (or nasty) one.  This is because the "bad" review might get more attention than the one that is being kind. It also allows the person who sent the negative one to have an opportunity to express their feelings.  If the person thinks that the person on the other side of the screen is being a little too harsh on them, they have the opportunity to make the person feel better.  The person that sent the bad review may get the opportunity of sending a nice comment, or the other person might get the chance to make some more friends.  One reason that people like to give bad reviews is because a negative one is less likely to be published than a positive one. This allows the bad reviews to stay anonymous.  Another reason that someone might give a bad review is because they are afraid of making others feel bad.   It makes them feel better if they can tell others that they are not mad at all.  When people send negative reviews, they think they are going to get rid of the movie for being bad.  Instead of getting rid of a movie for bad, they want the movie to stay as it is.  The reason that a movie can get a bad rating:      When a movie has many negative reviews (and even many good reviews), it may be because the movie is not as well received as expected, but this does not mean that people who see a movie think that they like it.  What the movie does is make people look at their own opinions, which can change from time to time.  To get a positive rating, it is very important for a movie to get lots of positive reviews.  It helps to be liked by other people.  A movie with many positive reviews, can go through a lot of changes.  Once it has lots of good reviews, then the movie will go through many changes and the audience will start to like it, which will result in more good reviews for the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My review will be on a positive note. I would say I'm a bit of a movie snob. I only liked the first two films by this director and I wanted to make a decision and be done with it.   I found myself feeling that if you don't have an opinion on any film you can't expect to really know what you're talking about.  I also found it a bit tedious, I can't think of a good way to describe it. The story is told in a similar way to the two previous films in this franchise. In The Last Samurai, the characters have some semblance of what a normal life would be like in Japan. Now, this is all a bit lame. You don't expect this in a historical film and you really don't need to. If anything, it feels as if they took a very long time going through the motions.  It was also a bit boring. There is nothing that happens in the film that you need to see. This is a film you could watch with an empty stomach and get no enjoyment out of it. I'm glad the director made the change from the second film in this trilogy. I feel he had to do it. There are some things that I'm not completely happy with and it's a shame.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The ending is great.   One of the best, if not the best ending to a film in my opinion.    The second half of this movie is not that great. It gets a bit silly.  But, the ending, and the final act of this is still great.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Good   - the movie has a good script and some good acting. It is about a girl who gets caught up in a love triangle with a guy and a woman. It has a bit of a twist that I really like.   - The bad    - There are a few problems here and there. The acting is a little too wooden for my taste, there is only one or two good and some pretty bad moments.  I was never a fan of the movie, but I think I am going to watch it again just to see if it gets better.  I do have some other recommendations if you want to watch this for the first time:    - Watch "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" or "The Prestige" to get a feel for the movie. The plot is pretty similar here.  - Get the soundtrack to this movie and just listen to it. There is no way you can watch this movie without hearing the songs.  This movie does have some good moments, but it is a bit too short. The characters feel a bit flat to me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a really good movie with a pretty good cast:  The story is great, the acting is great (including some big names), the special effects are perfect, and I just can't stop thinking about it.   I really loved this movie.  It wasn't as well-made as the first movie, but it wasn't really bad either. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The Evil Dead Trilogy  (1984) - The filmography of Sam Raimi.  If you haven't seen these movies, go watch them right now!   These are some of my favorite movies.  They're so fun and crazy and funny.  I'm not a fan of horror movies but these are such a great set of movies.     I just want to say that I have to go check out the remake soon.  But seriously, if you love the Evil Dead  trilogy, I don't see how you wouldn't love the remake.  ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The Evil Within  - I'm still going to review this movie, as it has a huge impact on me.  This movie was the first game in the series (or film if you want to call it that).  It was a huge hit.  The story is creepy and dark with some really good acting.  It took the Resident Evil franchise by storm and put it on the map.  My favorite character in this game is probably Alice and I can't really think of anyone else that could pull off the character of Alice.  He's just so perfect in this movie and I'm excited for Resident Evil 7! ______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Resident Evil 2 (1996) - This game has always been on my top 10 favorite games.  There was a bit of an ending for the Resident evil series when Resident evil 2 came out and I felt like I lost a favorite franchise.  And I would have to say the Resident dark remake does a pretty decent Resident evil remake, but the game is just so good and I couldn't believe it was just an HD remaster.  Even better, it was available on the Playstation 3 and it came with some great new additions.  What the Resident Dark remake lacks in originality it makes up for in atmosphere and great gameplay.  Resident evil 4 was a pretty much a sequel to Resident evil 3 with a few additions. So if you've played any of the previous games, this is the one to get!

That's my first and last impression of this movie." -Tina Smith "No wonder it is so popular." -Michael Koppel "It is a story about a girl in New York who has to live with a mother who doesn't want her anymore. It's a dark story about love and friendship." -Lester Cohen "This is a movie that could have just as easily been written about someone you love." -John Madden "No, it is not about a boy with a little girl." -Mike Leigh "This is an oddity. We're used to the Hollywood type of girl. She's beautiful. She doesn't do anything wrong. She is what you want her to be. The movie is set in an alternative reality where this young girl's mother decides she has had enough of her daughter. When the mother becomes pregnant the young girl doesn't know what to do. Her only options are to go to California and live with her mother or to leave her mother and to live on her own with a man she just met." -Ronald Reagan "It was like a film made by an old-fashioned studio boss who would have wanted to make a movie with a pretty girl."-Jack Schick "The movie is so unusual. I love the way you look at it and what it says about what the American film industry is all about." -Drew Barrymore "I thought it was about a mother and a daughter who don't fit into a formulaic way of looking at a mother-daughter relationship. The way they live their lives and the way they are treated by the people around them." -George Burns "I didn't expect to love it as much as I did. I thought it would be more of a romantic drama. I think it's very honest about life and how people live it. I had a real emotional reaction to it." -Bryan Cranston "The way they were played by all the actors in this movie, I thought, well, that's very important." -Don Johnson "The acting was excellent. The scenes between my mother and my father were extraordinary and, in a very sweet, real way, just real." -Denis Leary "It's a very strange movie and very sad. But it's also a very real love story
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You need the words in the script, because the film has to be in the theater.     I went with my friend, but you never know.  My main concern was that my friend didn't like this movie, but the other two liked it.  I think it's a great movie, and they can't believe that it's in theaters.  The one complaint I had was that it didn't have enough shots.  Otherwise, it's an excellent movie, with lots of action and a good amount of humor.  There is a lot of nudity in this movie.  It's kind of strange, but it is kind of cool.  This movie has a lot more violence than most of the other movies that come out of Hollywood, and it seems to be just as violent in the beginning, and then it slows down in the middle.  But, it has enough blood and the nudity works well.  In the end, there are two things that I thought were cool in this film.  One is a man who was a cop that was killed by a group of kids, and you can't get away.  That's probably the coolest thing in the movie, although it does get a little cheesy.  Another is that the police chief says that he was an officer in Vietnam and that there's no difference.  When he was a boy, it must have been a lot harder to live with his father and a mother who was in prison for murder.     What I like most about this movie is the humor. The movie is full of humor, and the humor is a bit crude.  Sometimes it's hard to figure out who's being serious and who's just being stupid.  If you have the patience to sit through it and let it make sense, you'll get a good laugh from this movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Why the hell not. "Paint Job" has been around for decades, has been called "great" numerous times, and, while it is not perfect, is still a very solid film with great acting, great cinematography, and plenty of moments that will stay with you for years to come.    "Painted," which was made for a total of $5,000, is the second film directed by Paul Verhoeven about a young painter (Michael G. Wilson) who has been hired to paint an old house for the wealthy, but has to work for free.  When he starts painting on the wall, the painting becomes a masterpiece and the house is a masterpiece too.  In order to pay his rent, he paints the interior and the exterior, but things go awry when he's charged with the theft of an ancient piece of artwork.  He was trying to sell it on the open market and he doesn't know why someone would want it (because he was just a teenager at the time).   He ends up having to paint a painting of his house to save his own life.  Unfortunately, he never manages to sell the painting, but he is saved by a man with a very special talent for painting.  " Paint Job 2" doesn't quite come to life like the first one, but it still manages to have a strong story and a strong performance from everyone involved.  I think this film has been referred to by many, myself included, as the "Ripley's Believe It or Not" of the 1970s.  To make a long story short, Ripley is an art student at a prestigious art school.  She discovers a painting that she believes to be a lost master work.  The painting, however, is actually a forgery and Ripley has to solve the riddle of the painting to find out the truth.  After she finds out the painting was painted by a forger, she confronts the art professor and says she wants to get his attention. He is unable to give her the attention she deserves so she becomes the target of the teacher's anger.     When all of the clues are assembled, they are able to figure out who the true author of the forgery is, but the art faculty have no interest in helping her.  Ripley takes this to the dean of the art school, who is willing to help her find the real creator of the picture
Write a positive review about a good movie:    * It's a good action movie that has more than enough going on.   The story is not as engaging as some of the others I've seen from this director, but it's better than the usual.  And the action scenes are good.    * There's not much character development in this one; you never really get to see what makes him tick.  * If you are not a fan of the original, there's nothing new to see here.  MIDDLE GRADE : B+ The following entries are not ranked because they did not meet my standards for what was expected from a middle grade movie. FINDING FURY : A   GATEFOLD:   A- * A lot of people seemed to like this movie; it does a good job of showing just what the F.I.R. is all about. * The action sequences are pretty cool, and I liked the villain and his motives.  (I wish that the villain would've been a bit more interesting. ) * The ending is satisfying, and a good way to end the movie.  I liked that the action stopped there, as a nice bit of closure. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the movie, one of the guys tells a funny story that was filmed in his trailer. It's a real fun movie, but a lot of people thought that they heard it from one of those movies about the "happiest people on earth."  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is definitely not your typical horror movie. I think that it's actually an original movie with it's own concept. The film is a bit different from typical horror movies in that it tells a very unique story of a young boy and the zombie who he accidentally becomes when he gets bitten by a mosquito. I really like the movie and am sure that it would make a very good short story. The movie has a great storyline and it does what it should to entertain the viewer. If you're looking for something new to watch, give this movie a try. It's definitely worth a watch.   I think that this is my favorite short story of the movie. The story is very original and it really makes it's mark in the horror genre.  This is my opinion about how the movie was written.  The movie doesn't make you feel scared or sad in the least. You know that it can happen anywhere and it's not really scary. There are some good scares in the movie but it's definitely not a horror movie and the story is a little bit confusing and you really don't get the true horror of the film. The last half of the short story had a lot of twists and turns, but you would think that after the first half of this movie there's nothing new to see.    The movie ends in a very different and mysterious way. This makes the ending even better. It makes the movie a very original story and it definitely needs a follow-up film.  I think it's a really good short film that I would recommend to fans of zombie movies or to people who like their horror more original.  I've seen this movie four times, and each time I've loved it more than the last. It does a lot to stand out from the average horror film and I highly recommend to watch this movie at least once.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "I was so nervous before we got into that theater to see this movie. I was very pleased. It's not so much a "Star Wars" movie as it is "a great "Star Trek" movie. If you want a great "The Twilight Zone," and not a "Nightmare on Elm Street" movie then this is the movie to see. If "The Terminator" movies had a love-hate relationship with me, "Star Ship" was almost like a therapy session. They all feel like two different worlds coming together. "Star Captain Jean-Luc Picard" gets to do what no-one else could do and what everyone else can't. The crew's mission has been to find a new home for this planet. They have a problem in that this planet has a race of space-babies who are out to conquer Earth. The people aboard the Enterprise have been infected with the space-baby virus. " The crew of the Enterprise has been trying to find the cure but every time they go to the planet, they are confronted by the space babies who want to destroy them all. " "It's a "Trek" movie in space but it doesn't feel like a "Tron" movie or an "Alien" movie."    "I didn't love the movie. "   I just got this message on my computer. The message came from my son. It said: "Dad - it's a good idea to sit down and watch a Star Trek movie. It is a great movie. Do you think that it is better than "Aliens?" "  It's a great thing to know that my son likes Star Trek. You can't teach love or enthusiasm. It has to come from within. I wish I could get into the minds of my children. It was only three days before my son's fifth birthday. He's four now and it's like it was yesterday that he was getting ready to go on his first movie date and he told me that his favorite was "Star trek." My son is not even old enough to drive. I always wanted to get him an adult car, but now that he's a teenager he has to figure out what he wants to be for himself. I wonder what he will be like by the time he's grown up. I can't even think what kind of future he will have because the thing that makes me nervous is his future. I worry that he'll be like me.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is hard to describe. It is the story of a family of three traveling to a small town in the mountains. The father is a doctor and is caring and caring for his family. He has a daughter who he loves dearly, but she is not a very smart girl. The daughter gets a job at a local movie theater and ends up falling in love with a star of the film. But what starts as a love triangle soon goes a very different path and this leads to a whole family tragedy. One by one, the family members are falling to the dark side and the two protagonists are trying to save them all.   This movie is a must-see for anyone who has a passion for horror. The cinematography is amazing and the sound effects are very good. The soundtracks are also great.  The acting is amazing as well. A lot of the characters are not only good and likable, but also likable for different reasons. The movie is funny and the plot will give you chills. If you are looking for a horror movie to watch with friends, then this is the movie for you. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most amazing thing about this movie was the amazing acting and special effects. This movie had a great and memorable soundtrack as well. In a great film like this, the story never changes. It is amazing the way the story flows. The special effects are amazing. It just goes on and on. The great part about this film is that you never know when the end is going to come. This is a great movie and it makes you think a lot about the movie you are watching. You wonder if you can beat your parents at something. You question what you do next. It makes the movie more enjoyable. This isn't a "bad" movie. It isn't just mindless action. This has a story to it that you can follow. It does take you to a good place in your mind and you don't want to forget it. I give this movie a 9.5. You just can't go wrong with this movie. I highly suggest it! This is a picture with the characters from the film in the same pose. The first picture is the boy and the second picture is himself when he is 13 and when he will be 18. These pictures were taken with the same camera and lens. The same film that the film was shot on. This picture is a close up of the boy on the set of the movie. These are the shots that I took during my entire time on the film. My only regret was that I did not do as much of this as I would have liked to. It would have added so much more to the movie and helped me remember the movie better. A close up shot of the back of the man who was shot in the leg. My father's car.   These are some of the best looking close ups of the people in this movie that I have ever seen. There are so many shots that are taken from the rear of the cars and you just cannot help but look at them. They make you want to go on the adventure of the film and see how far they will get. These scenes are just beautiful. Here are some great pictures that are from the movie that have never been posted on this site. I think that this picture really shows how the film is shot. The man in the middle is the one who is looking at the car as he is driving through the streets of Las Vegas. The car is driving from the back to the front.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's not often that a movie is actually good, but  Jumanji  does it. The movie does a lot of interesting things. Jumanjins are weird creatures who live in the woods. It's the early 1970s and they're all white and all handsome (well most of them are). One of them happens to be an Irish girl who is an escapee from the convent. She's played by a real life Irish Catholic woman who was a model and worked in the fashion industry. This movie has all these interesting things going on and it's a fun movie, even though it's over 20 years old. I actually kind of loved the movie. It was funny, it had great character development, and it was different and original. If you haven't seen this movie I highly recommend it. This is a fun watch. 4) "The Big Lebowski" - 2009 - Comedy - 4 stars There were so many good movies on this list that I don't know which one to pick.   This one was a movie that was so hard to decide on. The plot was great, and the acting was all on point.  The plot takes place in a bar and a dude and his wife (who have a kid, but not a son) and a guy that she's just met, and a bunch of people, all trying to get into the bar and out of there. There were some really interesting things happening in this movie.  There was this weird relationship between Walter and his brother that seemed a little too close. The character of the Dude had some really good character development and was a great side character.  5) "Kung Fu Panda 2" - 2010 - Animation - 3 stars "Kung fu Panda 2," or Kung Fu Panda 3, takes place after "The Karate Kid" and "Karate Kid 2" (this one was good).   "Kumo" has been turned into a kung fu movie.   The main character, Po, is just a normal boy who doesn't have superpowers. However, he does have the ability to summon a karate bear that can help him in his kung Fu fighting.  He's been trying to save a Kung Fu hero called Monkey, but he is so angry that he doesn't want to save him because he doesn'st know he's a Kung fu hero.   This movie is like the sequel to the
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Dawn of the Dead" (1978) "Dawn Of The Dead" was an excellent horror movie. It has a creepy atmosphere, it's well-constructed, it has good special effects and it's a really enjoyable horror movie with lots of gore.   "Daryl" is a good character, a good actor and a good director. His directing style is excellent.  A very interesting movie.  The best movie about the zombie apocalypse  I was at the movie with my friends (he's my favorite), and it was fun.  The story is great and it makes a great zombie movie. The zombies are terrifying and have a great voice acting.  I don't like the plot of the movie but I can't say that it was a bad movie. We enjoyed it and I was hoping to see this in the theater.  "The Walking Dead" is another great zombie apocalypse movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone who likes zombies.   I loved this movie a lot, and I'm excited for the next one!   A great zombie thriller

Write a positive review about a good movie:   ... I'm not sure who did it but the voice of that girl sounds so much like the voice I think she would have made for the girl in the first one, she has a much higher pitch and a more girly voice and she has the same expression. The way she speaks just sounds so cute that it really is a great voice to hear.   The way that the man is talking sounds a bit different but it just kind of fits in with the movie, that is it.       The best thing about this movie is that it's got a very good plot and I think that's what really helps it because if the story was really horrible and it wasn't really good that it wouldn't have got an 11.5/10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A few weeks ago we did a short film about a small town where the locals make a lot of movies, and a lot happen there. It got good reviews.   One of them was from our editor, who said he saw it when he was a child.  A little bit of our film is based on it.  Nowadays you can get good reviews, and you can have good movies too, but that film was great, and made me remember what it was like, back in the 70's.  The other part is that I wrote my first novel, The Boy With the Red Hair.  I had a lot to think about about this.  Some people think it was about one boy in one town.   I tried to keep it realistic, and had the characters be from all over the place. The only thing I knew for sure was that the boy I loved was the only boy I was ever really interested in.    In the movie I do a good job of portraying the townsfolk, the towns and the world they live in. I think some of it was influenced by a film I had seen a while back called The Little Stranger.  It was about a boy, and his uncle.  He has a pet rabbit, and he's taken it away from him. He wants it back, but he can't bring himself to take it. It's his life, he can do whatever he wants with it. I was trying to make a movie about that, and it was very effective.  But I was also interested in the little boy, who couldn't give it up, and what would happen to him.  When you're growing up in a small place like that, it's very hard to make good friends.  And so I made sure that his uncle had to be a friend of that boy's. The story is about a kid in the same situation as the boy with the red hair, except he's trying to get back at his uncle, and the same problems happen. But there are some interesting differences.  So that's how I came up with this idea.  In addition to the film, I also wrote a novel.  Here's a little bit about it. The Boy with the Red Hood is a novel set in a fictional small town in Wisconsin called Little Red Hood.  A few years ago it was written, but never published.  There was a book for kids and a little girl.  My brother
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One of the best action films of all time, you really cannot get better than this.    If you do not like it, do not watch the movie.   This movie is a must-see for all action fans.    In my opinion, I consider that it is a perfect movie. This movie will give you an awesome adrenaline rush. There are a lot of action scenes in this movie and it all will go down in a spectacular way. It will make you scream "FUCK, yes!!!!" because of how good it is. It really is a great movie. I do not know how this movie got such a terrible rating. The movie is great.   A good movie for the whole family.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film takes place on an isolated ranch owned by the Mackey family in the middle of nowhere. They are a wealthy family of cattle ranchers who keep their wealth by owning and operating a vast ranch. The Mackey ranch also supplies them with many of the best beef in the world. A year passes and the ranch continues to grow. In this year of peace and prosperity, they start to lose a sense of identity. Their cattle are being killed by some unknown group of outlaws. Things are not the same at the ranch. One of the ranch hands, Tommy, is a hotheaded teenager who has recently come to the ranch, but he is not what everyone thinks he is. He is a little short on confidence and very hot headed. Tommy is not the only one to blame. His father and his wife have also started to see things a little differently. The ranch hand and his father have started to fight over control of the land. Things quickly spiral out of control when a young cowboy arrives on the scene. Written by nufs68
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I have watched many of these films, many in my youth as a child. Some I enjoyed and some not so much. This one I am going to rank high on the list and it is one of my favorites. I am glad it was released.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When I was first introduced to this film, my expectations were extremely high, so I expected the film to be excellent, but as I watched the film it quickly became apparent that the filmmakers didn't take their time to work on it to make a good film. The story is very basic, a group of young people in a small town in Texas have a serious drug problem, and soon things are about to get out of hand. I can't emphasize enough how bland the film is. The first half of the film seems to revolve around a character that spends the entire time going off on tangents to explain the characters actions, this character never seems to change, and is never really developed. The film also feels very linear, if I had to describe the plot, it would be this: The main character starts smoking weed, and then he gets involved with some other characters. These other characters also smoke weed. The second half of this film is a continuation of the first, as the main character is trying to convince everyone that he needs to stop smoking weed. All of the characters are introduced, their motives are explained and their backstories are told, and all the while the first half continues to follow a straight line, making it difficult for the viewer to connect with any of the plot twists.  The film's plot is extremely simplistic.   So many of the films are very long, with a beginning, middle, and an end. For whatever reason, when The Green Inferno was originally announced, I was really looking forward to watching it, but it didn't deliver on that promise. The plot of this movie is very simplistic and doesn't even include any real character development. A few of the people in this film make the list, and I won't spoil them, but I didn't feel any genuine emotion for any of them. I think most of the audience would disagree with me on this, but The Green Infernus is simply not the type of film that is going to make you care about any of its characters, it's just a pretty good, generic story. This film doesn't disappoint, but its lack of character development is the only major negative thing about it.    I've watched a lot of bad movies over the years, and there's always something that keeps me watching, even if the film doesn's t impress me. It's like the people who like bad films think that they should never watch a good one because people like it so much.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My family has been watching a few new TV shows and movies lately and I wanted to see the movie about the guy that made the movie.   I loved it.  The story is not a great one but the movie is so entertaining that it doesn't matter. The guy is funny and he really shows that he's not so bad when he's angry.  There is some nudity in this movie but it wasn't gratuitous, they didn't show anyone's butts.  I also like the fact that it's rated PG-13. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you're not sure if something is a good film or not:  Here's another great thing to do, watch a bunch of the film's trailers.     Now I know I said this in the beginning of the post, but I still feel it's worth mentioning:  If you have to ask yourself a question on the internet:  What would I do if I had $500,000 to spend on a new car? What would happen if I decided to go to a movie theater to see The Terminator? Would I watch the movie or not? You can find an answer to those questions here.   There are tons of people who have read this entire post, who have seen all the movies I have listed, and have not been able to answer all the questions. So I have decided to put them on my blog to answer as many as I can.  You can read the rest of this blog series here.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What's wrong with the movie: The movie is just terrible, everything seems out of place, especially in the second act, and the ending is really awkward.   The story seems to be the result of a brainstorming session, as some of the dialog is not exactly believable, especially since it is the first time we get to see the characters together in the same movie.  One of the main reasons for the film's greatness is that there is a good balance of humor and tragedy throughout.  The film is very funny at times, especially because all the characters are kind of stupid, but even the jokes are surprisingly dark and disturbing.  At times, I couldn't help but laugh out loud, and I didn't care because the characters were such a good joke.    This movie is great for fans of psychological thrillers, especially if you liked the better known thriller      Memento.  The movie is also worth watching for fans who like a good dark twist.  And for those who like the dark and the scary, this is the movie for you.  There are also a few characters who are a little bit more interesting than the other characters, which makes the movie a good choice for horror fans, since the scares are somewhat frightening. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story of the film is, quite simply, an excellent piece of work. I thought it was quite gripping throughout. There is something for everyone, it can be enjoyed by a person in their 40s, it could be enjoyed at a younger age. If you are not yet interested in movies or want to give it a try, it is well worth a look. The cast is terrific, and the cast of actors are talented. The story is a great plot, there are not too many "wow" moments throughout the movie, and it's very easy to follow the plot without being bored. There was not too much humor or heart in the story. But it is a very well made movie, so don't worry about that. This is a simple and easy to watch movie, that is a good thing. I loved the ending, it felt like the end of the movie. It was done very well, it was sad at times, but it wasn't as long as some of the other movies. This movie is not as long or complicated as the others, and there was not as many character introductions, so you get a taste of a lot of the actors and see who they are.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are a lot of very great movies out there, and we don't get to see a lot because they're either too obscure or too expensive to make. Here are the five movies that we did see, and the things that we loved, hated, and didn't understand at all.  5) The Great Outdoors (2014)  "The Great Outings" stars Paul Rudd as a man who can speak with the animals in the wild and is called upon to help save them from a poacher who's threatening their lives. It's a very funny film with great acting from Rudd and a fun script with lots of action set pieces. The acting isn't perfect, but Rudd is a great comedy actor, and he gets to do something more interesting than he normally does. The script doesn't quite follow the first act to a T, but the first half of the film is just as good as the second. It ends with a funny cliffhanger and the possibility of a sequel. It has some technical problems with some of the sequences but overall it's a solid comedy with lots to like. (I think they can learn from this and get better actors, at least, in future) . I really think that this movie was made to do well. The cast is all funny and funny people. It doesn't have any of the gross overtones of "Reds" and is very respectful of nature, both in its wildlife and its humans. It does a very nice job of making a funny, funny movie that isn't offensive in any way. The only problems with this movie are with some scenes that are a little too long (but they are still funny) and the fact that it ends in a cliffhangers. That's not a problem that this film does poorly with, it just doesn't come across as good. But I do think this movie is a worthy watch, if you've ever wanted to see Paul Rudd in an animal-human romance. It's not the best animal-centric comedy in the world, but it's definitely one of the better ones that I've seen. If you want to get a real laugh out of this movie, I would recommend giving it a shot. I would also suggest watching it with a big group of friends, because I have had people who watched it with one person that it's impossible to enjoy it with. The dialogue is very funny and the performances are all pretty good, so it'll

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "It is a long film, it is a movie for a large audience, and it has a lot of violence. But it is an unusual film and it is interesting." I had seen the movie twice before I wrote this review, so I guess I could give a summary of the plot, but really, it would be better for me to just let you read about the movie yourself.   The movie opens with a quick summary of what happened in the last four years:  the world is in a state of chaos.  It is a situation caused by a global catastrophe, the so called "big one", that has left the planet uninhabitable for thousands of years.  The main character is a soldier who was sent to Mars to investigate the disappearance of a couple that were in contact with another alien species.  These aliens live on a planet that resembles the Earth and are capable of transmitting radio waves that can reach other planets, creating an electromagnetic pulse, and they are responsible for the deaths of almost everyone on Earth that had the chance to contact them.  After landing on Mars, the soldier was captured and held for four years in the colony.  He was tortured in the prison and his brain was examined by the scientific community to find out what happened to him, and the answers he got were shocking.  So after that, the story begins. The protagonist is taken into a small underground facility where they are kept in isolation and can't talk to anyone, or even to themselves.  They don't have to worry about any danger or infection in there, as they are protected by a very high voltage, but there are signs of radiation poisoning.    Eventually, his condition worsens, and he has to be taken out of there, and as he leaves the facility, he is attacked by a vicious, mutated alien.   The soldier is eventually saved by some members of the military who came in on an evacuation mission, and after being attacked, they find out that he is the son of a scientist who invented a drug that allowed him to survive the radiation on Mars.  In order to get him back, he needs a sample of his father's blood.  Since he has no family or friends left in Earth, and since he can't have any contact with his past life, he has decided to take on a mission that will have him go back in time and become a human in the past.  As he moves closer and closer to the date
Write a positive review about a good movie:        The movie was a good mix of action and horror, with a well directed movie that had some interesting moments, such as the fight between the group of children and the man who kills them and the other group of kids.   It is not a very good movie, but it has some interesting stuff to offer.  I am glad that it was at least a start and the director showed that he could make a good horror movie that wasn't a bad one.  If I could recommend the movie:    My only advice about this movie is to not watch it with your kids.  I'm sure there are some kids that would like to watch this movie and watch it together.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    ( I love movies ) I think this is an excellent movie. It has a good story line and some great characters and I think it will appeal to both girls and boys.   This movie also has a great soundtrack and even an ending song, just what you want from a movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One thing I must say: the sound is amazing. The sound is so close to the movie it's uncanny.   It's like hearing the movie but with much much better dialogue.  In other words, it's like they didn't pay attention to the movies dialogue. But this is a great movie to listen to.  When you're watching a movie this long, you're hearing the same thing over and over, but with a new, fresh perspective. So, the sound in this movie is fantastic.  Also, they used a bunch of music from "The Magnificent Seven".     
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was in the cinema for a film festival and it was packed. There were a few rows I wasn't in. I thought I was going to be the only one that wasn't. I saw a few people get up from the box office. People like me that have no interest in a film are in the first rows, so I thought: well, it's okay that I'm not in there. I'm so close that the whole place is just a blur to me. I looked out for the guy with a big smile on his face, because that's my guy. But everyone else was just in the middle. And when the film started, a few guys and gals came up to me and said: "You should come see this film, the first of it's kind." The film had a lot of new stuff in it. The first act was just a bunch of people looking around and talking. There wasn't a lot happening except for the first act. The next act was like a long scene that led into the next section. I sat in the seat that wasn not in the audience for the next act. I'd never seen anything like it. It had a good energy. The film wasn't as scary as I expected it would be, but it didn't have any of the kind of scary stuff that usually gets me out of a film. It was just nice. It just made me want to see more movies like this. The end credits rolled and a guy came up and asked for my autograph, then he walked away. I went to get the next movie. I was the only guy in the theatre, so we sat there until the end. I didn't see the end credits roll and that movie got me out there, just a second. This film made me go: this is great, I'm in the right place for this, I'll see other films like this and I'm going to watch a movie just because it looks like fun. I just didn't get out of it.   I'm sorry if I was rude or anything. This is a review from a guy that went to see it! I didn "t want to go to see a film that just made you want to want to read more about it! The movie is about a group of people trying to make a big money deal in the movie business. There is a famous actress that they think will work for them if they make a good offer. They
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I love the character of J.A. Bayona.   I like the movie,   and I am not a big fan of the style of filmmaking.  However, it is a film that I have seen a million times.  J. A. Bayoan and his camerawork is incredible.  The performances are amazing.  You don't just watch this and you are done.  If you are a fan of cinema like myself,  you are going to be entertained.  For me the acting was just what I expected it to be.  I have loved his work for a long time.  It is a shame that he is not able to bring his best work to screen.  But I am sure he will. As far as a film about war is concerned, I like how this one deals with it.  Not just the war,  but the human stories behind it all.  War is a harsh, scary and frightening thing.  People need to understand the reality of the conflict.  There are many stories that are told and many different types of people involved.  All of this has made this a very difficult story to make.  What makes this a good film, is that it deals with all of the characters.  We hear their stories and their struggle with war.  And we learn from them, and make up our own minds as to why they did what they did.  The one aspect of this film that left a bad taste in my mouth, was how the film portrayed the Israeli military.  A film with a lot of emphasis on military violence should not have depicted the Israeli army as being as vicious as they are.  At one point you see an Israeli soldier, who is clearly a hero, killing another unarmed civilian, for no good reason, only to kill him again.  One soldier, a man who I believe is a pacifist, gets a head wound, and goes back into battle.  This soldier then kills another Palestinian, for the same reason.  These soldiers are not only ruthless, but also callous and callous.   These people have a way of killing people who are innocent, without giving them a chance to even fight back. I would highly recommend this film to anyone that has an interest in the subject.  Those that have not experienced the wars in the Middle East should not even watch this film.  With that said, I give it a 6 out
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In addition to the positive reviews of the movie (at least one was written by an actual movie critic) the main theme in this movie is the importance of being an entrepreneur and making an honest living. There are many parallels between the movie and life. The movie has many more similarities than just the movie itself. There is an entire scene in the movie that is a parallel to the movie: "The Hard Sell" on the other hand is very good, but it does not tell the story the way this movie does.   I love this movie and it shows what a movie about an entrepreneur could be about. The characters are likable and interesting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What is so fun about watching a movie that you have seen a million times?   The more I watch a movie the more I become attached to it.   It is the same way with music.  I have been listening to a lot of rock music for the past few years, I listen to a variety of genres.  The first bands that attracted me were the first bands I heard on the radio.  My favourite bands were the rockers like Led Zeppelin, The Doors and Pink Floyd.  I was so into rock music that I was really into the music in the movies, but I didn't always know the meaning of the words, I was looking for a deeper meaning, what do you think of this film?  I thought the movie was entertaining but had many flaws: 1-the acting is not professional, it is not believable at all, they are just mimicking their previous performances. 2-the music was not original and it doesn't fit the movie, it could of been better. 3-the plot was not very original.  4-the movie is long and drawn out and not funny at all.  5-some scenes are just bad to watch, and some characters just come off as weird and out of place. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "A simple idea is turned into something greater."   The film was not the first of its kind but it was a bold one. The plot is about a woman who wants to have the world of a rock star and the man who helps her achieve this dream. The film also explores the relationship between an artist who is on the verge of suicide and a man who wants her to stay alive for him. The director, the lead actor (Paul Dano) and the writers were all the right people to make a film about an artist and a rockstar, but a great director should know how to bring the two together in a good and a good film, and Paul Dano was brilliant in bringing this dream into reality. The cast was great as well, especially Paul Danno who plays the rockstar and David O. Russell who is his producer.   The film was made during the 1970's and it was an important movie to make and we all saw it many years ago.  There are so many great scenes from the film that it's hard to list them all and here are some of my favourites.    - In the beginning, a rock superstar meets a woman in the music industry who tells him that he will die if he does not get a shot at fame.   -  As soon as the rock star is offered a career as a singer he is thrown into the rock business and soon finds himself falling for the girl, who was only a singer in the past and is now a rock and roll idol.   - A singer and a musician go to a party where there are several celebrities, who are drunk and the singer tries to help them.   The film is not for the faint-hearted and the audience might find the violence and language a little difficult to watch.    However, as I mentioned earlier, the film is about two different people, one who wants a career in rock 'n roll and the other who knows he wants to die. The two men are different and the film explores this.  The music of 'A Hard Day's Night' is very important to me and to many other people, and I think the film should be viewed by people who like rock 'and roll music, rock'n roll songs, and people who are not familiar with rock music.   A Hard Day's Night is definitely a good way to introduce people to rock'n roll music. The movie is also known for it's beautiful
Write a positive review about a good movie:    - - -   The best horror movie of all time. The original (as far as I know), made on an amateur budget, but with a very tight and solid script. The cast is great: David Carradine, Tim Curry, and John Cassavetes (of The Third Man ) have great chemistry with the characters, and the set is beautiful (no CGI, or silly special effects, this is very well thought out). The writing is really strong and keeps you interested until the end, the suspense never lets up. This is one of my all-time favourite movies. I highly recommend this one.    5.0/10
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just want to say a few things about this film and say that I enjoyed it. The cast was fantastic, all of them and they worked very well together. I also enjoyed the ending which really didn't leave me disappointed. I would recommend this to anyone, and for those who like a good story, it was very enjoyable.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not going to lie. I was a bit of a nag back in my 20s. I wanted to make a change in my life and move away from the typical teenager angst, but I was also a perfectionist. I took up photography when I was 17 because it was supposed to help me break out of the mold of what I was being told I should do with my life. I'm happy to report that photography has done just that. I've now gotten over my nagging fears of being a model/model agent/model, and am able to get things done that would've otherwise been too far out of my price range. This isn't a product that I recommend, but if you're looking for a way to break into the entertainment industry, this might be something to consider.    Was this helpful? Yes (0) No (0).  I was wrong about the service...  This is a service to people who can't make it to a major studio. They offer a small amount of money (less than $200) for just a day's worth of shooting (1-2 hours of a model), and that's it. They have the models sign release forms and take down their name/picture as a reference. They provide some sort of tracking number that is then emailed to you. Once you're in the studio, they're nice enough to send you out the same day to do the next job, if it is necessary. In general, I would say that the quality of work that they provide is not great. I got to shoot two very hot models, and they both looked great. The studio is clean and the lights were nice. However, the models were very stressed and overworked, which I don't like. I think it was probably due to the fact that they were all being paid very well, and were also in a competition to see who could get their shots shot the quickest.  Dana was very nice and really got the job done for me. She took time to explain all of the models' limits and what their needs were as far as being comfortable/comfortable. She was not only nice and helpful, but also a model's agent. It was a good experience overall!  I used this service for some nude modeling... This service is for those of you who just don't have time for a day job, or just don's like to be a model! The
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You'd think that with a new movie that they are going to get a positive rating and then maybe it gets 2.5 stars. But nope. It got just one star.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is awesome. The plot is interesting, but the acting, the plot, and the acting are great. The movie is very fast paced, and you need to watch this movie in one sitting. I am a sucker for a good story, and this story is very good. The story is based in India, and in the beginning you are not sure whether you are supposed to love or hate the characters. There are many ways to look at the love triangle, and some people may hate this movie for it. If you like the love and hate, this movie is for you.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like it or not, a movie will only have an impact on your life if you actually watch it.   I'd rather read about a movie and then see it than watch it and then read about it. A movie is not a book, not even the classics.  But a movie can be a good book if you have read the books that have been adapted into movies.  As I watched The King's Speech, I realized it was a movie about the United Kingdom and how the citizens of that country have a more liberal attitude to political ideas.  Like many of us Brits I was raised to believe in the British Empire, and it's never too far from my mind.  I can recall in my teens listening to David Attenborough on the BBC.  It's also a reminder that the world isn't flat.  I'm not talking about the Earth's surface, but actually, it's not that far from a globe.    In this movie, Attenbrough portrays an old man and his old wife, and their relationship is not very pleasant.  His wife, Mrs. Spencer (Karen Allen) is an uptight, snobbish British lady.  When the King of England decides to visit her country, he's shocked to find that she is not pleased with the whole idea of being king.  For the past 50 years, Mrs Spencer has been getting her hair done by the King's best hairdresser (Robert Hardy) every night, and he makes a conscious decision to not touch her hair.  She feels that he is only following tradition, and that if the King was actually a gentleman, he would do his own hair.   Then there's Mr. Bumble (Benedict Cumberbatch), who comes to the house to tell the King that he's come to pay Mrs. H's (Linda Wilson) respects for the occasion.   The King is a bit confused and can't make out why Mr. Bentley (Cumberbatch) would come to the country of his parents, but he agrees to his request.   It turns out that Mrs. B has been making all these gifts for Mr. and Mrs. Bentley for years, and has even hidden them at various places around the country.  The King and Mrs B (Wilson and Allen) decide to celebrate the King and his wife's visit by going to a nearby village to have a good old fashioned day in the sun.  Mrs
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Here is a list of all the "A" and "B" movies. In order to be in a movie, you need to get your A's. They need to be good. However, if you don't get your B's, you cannot make a movie. You need to work on getting your A. You have two options. One is to be a good actor or get a great writer. It doesn't matter what you do. You will still need your A grades if you want to be an actor. The problem is, this list contains films that have many B's. These are the ones that are considered the worst. There are a lot of people who hate B movies. But there are a few B movies in this list that are actually great.     This is the best movie that was directed by Tod Browning. It was released in 1942 and was so popular it was dubbed in many foreign languages. If you ever thought you could make a good B movie, Tod has just the film for you.  This is the first "B movie" to be directed by Alfred Hitchcock. It is a masterpiece of suspense and violence.  It was the best selling film of all time.  What I like about this movie is the fact that it has both a love story and a murder mystery. The "love story" is about a girl who has a great passion for a certain boy. The movie starts with her leaving the guy to go back to her friends. She then goes back home and is attacked by her father.  There are no morals or messages here. This is pure B-movie evil.  In 1943, Alfred Hitchcock directed The Birds. This was another film about a family that was living in an apartment building. Their father was a rich man and they were trying to get into his money. This leads to an encounter with a little bird who becomes a friend. This little bird has two friends and they help the little bird by hiding him in the bird house. They eventually become the bird family.  This was the second "A-movie" directed by James Stewart. He directed it in 1940.  I like this movie because it tells the story of the love triangle that started in the first movie. The film was popular because it was the first film to tell the love story without the two girls in it.  After this movie came out, many men and women started going on dates with other people. This movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Dark Tower" is a movie that makes the entire world and all of us as people, more alive. From the very beginning, it shows what can happen when a world is being destroyed and people are trying to make it better. I've never seen a movie with this amount of impact and emotion from the very very start. The last shot of the movie just made me cry, the entire journey, the action, the music, the writing. I just cried for the entire movie, and not because I knew what was going to happen at the end, it was because I just wanted it to go on. It has the energy to never give up on the people that are trying, and the love in it, which I'm not sure is possible to find in a movie as this one, with such a dark theme. The movie also contains a strong message about the end of the world and the way that it is going to go, which the main characters go through, and their feelings towards each other, and themselves, make me really think. The entire movie shows how we live in the world we have and how we deal with it, as people. I also think that the whole movie shows the love that people in this world have for each other and the pain they go through on their path of survival. The ending of the last shot just brought tears to my eyes, because I always thought that it was the last one. It is very difficult to give a movie a negative review. "The Dark tower" makes me feel sad, and also happy. It also has a story that will stay with you. So, it is a wonderful movie. "Dark Tower" has everything: drama, action, and even humor. The only bad thing about the movie is the ending, but it's not even that bad. The way the ending is written just made my heart feel like it was broken, and I would do anything for that girl. The Dark Tower is a must see movie for me. "A very good movie. A very good film."
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The worst film ever made. No film in all of my life ever makes me so angry. This movie is truly a disgrace to cinema. I don't have any words to describe how I feel. I feel like such a bad person. It's the absolute worst movie ever made in all my life. I can't watch this movie. I just want to watch something else. It made me so mad at the movie. The reason I want to stop watching it is because every time it played, it made my stomach hurt. I really wanted to vomit. I thought that it was so sick that the director made me do it. It makes me sick to my stomach.   After the opening credits rolled, I was so angry that this movie was about a guy named Michael who loves a girl named Jennifer. This was the main focus of this film, but they didn't show any of the rest of the plot to me. I didn't even know that they had a second act because we don't even get any details of the second act. If you're into horror and you want to see a truly disturbing movie, this is the film to see. If this is how you want your horror movie to end, I can tell you this movie will leave you disgusted.  Horror is a genre for the most part. The kind that gives you the creeps and makes you afraid. A lot of people don't like it, but for some reason, most people love this movie more than any other movie.   I would be lying if I said this movie didn't leave me traumatized. I've been in the horror genre for so long that this is my first time ever going to a movie that made me feel this way. This film will make you fear the darkness of your life.  But this horror movie was made by a man named David Cronenberg, so you know it was going to be a great movie.  This movie has no brains and doesn't really do anything interesting with the story. I'm not saying that this film has no ideas or that the characters don't move at all. There are times in this film that they move around a bit too much. In the movie, they do a great job of making you feel like the characters are in a house with no doors.  At times they seem a bit annoying but I suppose it's because I'm a horror movie fan and I love to hate on those horror movies. If
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When you see The Big Wedding, it's probably because you want to see one of the most iconic and beloved romantic comedies of all time, but you also have some lingering doubts. Is it any good? What are the plot holes? Is it a good or bad movie? Do I really like it? And if I did, should I watch it again? These are all legitimate questions, and there are other similar questions that I had about the film. But after seeing The Big Weddings, I think you will know it was a good and a great movie.   I think it might be the single most underrated romantic comedy of all-time.  When I first started watching it, I thought it was boring, but after the second time, I realized how much I loved it, so I think its good that I said that before.  I loved The Big Love. And that's what makes The Big Wive so much more satisfying to me than The Big Loving.  Like The Big Lovings, The Big Wife is a movie about a marriage between two very happy and talented people. However, unlike The Big Loves, The big marriage is done on the cheap, and it's not a very interesting relationship.  Instead of showing how perfect the husband-and-wife are and how they just really get each other, the story instead focuses on their problems.  This is the only problem.  So many love stories fail because the characters are either too perfect or too stupid.  The problem with The Big Marriage is that it was written for the wrong audience.  It was written by a writer who thought he knew how to write romantic comedy, but he really doesn't. The story starts out with a guy and his wife, and then it jumps to another couple. It's a movie that focuses on how two people love each other.  After all, I've seen it before. But the second couple has nothing to do with the first couple.  And the main characters?  They're too dumb to be any good.  However, this is a minor thing because the main character was written so well, that you can't tell he's a dumb guy and then realize he is. I really liked the relationship between The Bride and her husband, and I really love how The Bride keeps her cool and calm even after the craziness that she goes through with her husband.  Not just that, but she is the most mature and calm character

The two travel throughout the Earth, where they try to find a way to the center of the globe. The movie was directed by Len Deighton (an associate of Victor Fleming), and stars Victor Fleming as the titular Count Dracula, the villainous vampire with the mummified face. In addition to Victor, the cast includes Frank Sullivan, Barbara Bel Geddes, Frank Grillo, and Joan Cusack.   (This was the last of the classic Disney films I saw before I left. I'm still grateful for their influence.)   I was surprised to learn that the movie had a relatively small $100,000 budget. The story itself was very different from that of the other Disney films, and had no plot to speak of. Victor and his mother have been traveling around the world when they come across a small boy in danger. He needs help, and needs to escape from the monster that is hunting him. The boy's name is Max (Frank Sullivan), and he has a rather unfortunate name. It is never revealed what is actually in the chest of his shirt, but it seems to be something that makes him very popular with women.   and   VICTOR FILM  (1935)  A boy is kidnapped by the wicked Count Dracula.

The entire movie takes place entirely in front of a stage. It takes a long time to get to the point, but the story isn't terribly complex.

The whole movie takes places inside a huge hall, where the characters meet up in turn, and then the story moves to the next room.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "One of the best movies of the year."  The Great Wall Trailer: http://vimeo.com/9456438  I saw the movie in the Chinese and it was a great movie. The Chinese and Indian were great and the story was amazing. This movie gave me hope for my people. I thought about it a lot and I still think about it. It is very important for us to be united. There are so many good things in the world and I hope that my people and all people of the world will be able to live together in peace. I'm a big fan of the movie, and I feel that all of you should check this movie out.  "The Great White Hype" is a movie that I will never forget and I want to thank everyone who has worked on it. I know it was not easy to get the film made.  of course I'm talking about the Chinese producers. They were a team, and they were great. The movie was shot on a very small budget and we knew that going in. But they did the movie justice. I think that everyone should see this movie because it's one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. In other news: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    When:  Dec 17th (7:00-11:00PM) Where:     The Grand Theatre This movie is a comedy about an evil millionaire who uses the city's transit system as a personal train to transport women to other planets.   I've always enjoyed these types of movies as I find them more engaging and interesting than just plain old sci-fi.  My favorite sci- fi movies are often the ones that involve people in strange and unusual situations and I think the cast here brings it off really well.  The best thing about this movie is the script and this has a really good story. The writing is funny and lighthearted and the actors really bring out the comedy.  It is about a man who was raised in an aristocratic family and after his father's death he is taken in by a poor family and finds himself thrown into a weird world of aristocratic misfits. It's a good twist on the same old story of 'the rich have more than they need'.   It's an easy watch and the film is worth checking out. My only real gripe about this one is the fact that it was released in the early 80s and it's only recently that I found it and that the music and sound effects on this are very dated.  So I was happy to find a DVD and it looks great.  I'm sure this is a good time for some classic sci-fis.  If you love good sci- fis then this is one to check out.  Check out the trailer:  There is a very interesting twist on 'The Wizard of Oz'. This movie is not as lighthearted or funny as that movie, but it is still quite funny and well acted.  The plot is pretty different from 'The Tin Man' and it shows the world through a different character's eyes.  This is a movie that is definitely worth checking if you like sci-FI, comedies, and the old classic of The Wizard of OZ.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Lion King" (Disney/Pixar) is a story about two orphaned cubs who find a mystical talisman. The cubs go on a journey to find their mother. The film has a magical world filled with animals, dragons, and some awesome special effects. I saw it in my childhood. "Ling" and "Sitting Duck" are two great Disney movies to get your little one started. They teach you about the importance of life, love, and compassion. The "Bambi" franchise is amazing, especially "Saving Mr. Banks". A couple of years ago I saw this with my family at Disney World. I loved it. There are some good movies like this that are made with children in mind.   The first movie that I watched with my son was "The Emperor's New Groove" (Walt Disney Pictures). He loved it, and asked me to get him "Tangled" in DVD format. I told him that the only way I could get him the DVD was if he paid for it. He was a bit young for that though, and we let it slide. Later, he got "The Lion King". I asked him if he thought it was good, and he said that it was great.  "Lion and Baby" (Cinderella) This is one of my favorite Disney movies with my kids. It's a cute story, and I think it's a great family movie. I also recommend it for boys because it's all about how cute and funny these two are.  I think that the best way to introduce your children to these movies is through a DVD set. They'll be happy you did.  The two Lion King movies are a little over a decade old now, but still are great movies. I really recommend watching them. "The Little Mermaid" is my favorite. It has so many cute moments that make it a favorite for me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first two movies are great! The acting was fantastic in both movies. If you were hoping to see the character of Jake played by Jake Gyllenhaal, you won't. Instead he gets a more "serious" approach and it is pretty cool. The cast was great. You have to give props to the actors who play Jake and his buddies as they have a great chemistry with Jake and are great at portraying this guy who loves his work and is so determined to do good. The supporting cast was also very good. Even though it is a PG-13 movie, there are some violence scenes. A couple of the girls in the movie have to get some blood out of their noses. This is pretty normal for a horror movie. It's not that hard to have some blood splatter when your character is being brutally stabbed and slashed. Overall this was a very good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think most people can agree that The Shining is a good film.   It has been well reviewed by most critics and the film has received awards for it's production quality.  As such, I am not going to argue for it being an even better film than it's predecessor.  There are a few things that The Stanley Kubrick Collection makes me really excited for.  One is Stanley Kubrick's contribution to the genre of horror, and it is really something to be excited for and a bit sad at the same time.  I was excited about the fact that the film featured a strong female protagonist, who was a "normal" woman whose life was taken away from her at the beginning of the film. I think that is something I have never seen in a horror film, and that is really exciting.  Another thing that has been mentioned many times in Kubrick reviews is the soundtrack.  If you have never heard the score for the film, I would highly recommend listening to it here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FhDqcWjzE8  This is a pretty good score and you should be able to recognize the score on the film if you listen to the original score.  Kubrick himself is the master of this score and he really knows how to give it a unique and creepy feel.  It is not a typical, "moe" style of score but it does fit the film well.  The Stanley Cup, which was featured in The Shining as a prop for Jack's parents, was actually used in Kubrick's The Shining.  Some of you may know that Kubrick once gave a Stanley Cup to the hockey team he coached at the University of Wisconsin for his coaching services.  This was really great because it showed his respect for the hockey fans.  Now, you should know that The Kubrick Collection will also have The Shining and 2001: A Space Odyssey in a 4k scan in high definition.      As of now, The Stanley Kowloon Collection is in pre-production and is set to be released sometime in 2014.  There is no word yet on when the film will be released but I am sure that it will be a very important film for Kubrick fans.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've seen two of the movies I just mentioned above, and they were good movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        When someone tells you that your movie is great, it's like a light on your head that says "hey. you're great". It's a beautiful feeling, especially when you see the praise.   So when I saw the first trailer for the film, I couldn't wait to see the movie.  I had an idea of what to expect.  This is a romantic film that centers around a college student who is in love with his girlfriend. She's so beautiful, but he's too busy being an amazing hockey player to notice.  The film was directed by Sam Elliott and stars Matthew McConaughey and Dakota Johnson.  When the film first came out, it was a major disappointment. It was just a love story that had no passion to it. But the film got so much better and was so much more interesting once it moved to the big screen.  As the film progresses, there are great twists, turns and emotional scenes.  One of the best scenes in the film is where Matt goes to a hockey game and sees a young girl that looks exactly like him.  After finding out that his girlfriend is sleeping with another guy, he does a lot of soul searching.  It has all the ingredients of a great romantic film.  If you're a fan of movies like Fargo and True Detective, you'll really like the film. It's not perfect, but the film really has it's moments.  However, when the film came out I was disappointed.  In an industry where so many movies are terrible, it took a film that had so much potential and turned it into something that I wouldn't watch again.  My rating for the movie is 4 out of 5 stars.  There are many great movies out there, but this one really didn't stand out. About the author:  Matt Murphy is the creator of  Nuke the Fridge. You can read more about him on his  blog.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I can't even begin to imagine how my heart must have raced when I saw the trailers for this movie. I know I can't say that I was looking forward to the movie.   As I looked at the trailer I had the same feeling that I do when I walk into a restaurant and hear the band I saw before.  I knew something would be different about this movie from the trailers but I didn't really know what.  A lot of people are going to say that this movie is nothing like the trailers, but I was really hoping that this would be a more serious and serious story that took itself less seriously. I'm glad that they stuck to the script and didn't try to make something out of nothing.  Unfortunately, we end up with what is in the trailers: a love story between two women, a love triangle, a lot of cursing, a huge musical number and the woman who gets the man, and I have no words to describe how disappointing this was.  First of all, we never really see the woman, just a girl who is in love with the man who is a criminal.  She calls him her "boyfriend".  Now, to anyone who has seen the trailer for "The Usual Suspects", that is nothing but a cheesy love story of how these two lovebirds, played by Kevin Spacey and Kevin Bacon, finally meet.  The movie, "Girlfriend" features the girl from the trailer but plays her down as if she was the girl in "TheUsualSuspects" with Spacey doing a perfect Patrick Swayze.  In the end of this movie we have a guy who is not even in love, let alone a good person, and a woman who isn't a real person at all, and in all honestly, I'm not sure who I am more disgusted by.  This is probably the one thing that I can think of in the entire movie that was really off.  Now I know that this is not the movie for everyone, but for me it wasn't bad.  A girl and a guy on the run...   I watched this movie with my three year old daughter.  We watched it for the first time on DVD a couple of weeks ago.  During the first act she was watching the trailers on Netflix, so that she could get a taste of the movie as well.  Then my daughter and I sat down and watched it together.  Her reaction

Write a positive review about a good movie:    http://thefilmjournalist.com/movies/star-wars-episode-ii-darth-vader-the-saga-of-dear-yoda-anatomy-of.html I've seen this movie before. My friends and I saw it a few times. I had a good time. It was a good story, a good performance, and a good script. However, this movie is not as good as the first. The film is better. I would say it is a little better, but still not very good. The reason this movie has been in theaters since it's release is because of two things: 1) The prequels did not do the franchise justice. The prequel to the second movie was not that good. 2) The character was changed. The character of Anakin became more arrogant and a little less likable. The old Anakin was a decent guy. The new one did not have the best of intentions. I like the new Anakin. He was more likable and a lot more intelligent. He wasn't that evil. He had a heart of gold and a love for his wife and son. The whole family could really relate to him and his quest. The other characters are the same, except he has a much more good attitude. The first movie was all about the Jedi and they should've changed this. I thought that the new characters were fine and there were some great moments in there. But still, there were better characters and better stories. I enjoyed this one a lot. It is fun. The characters are fun. It has a fun plot that makes for a good little movie. I hope they continue the series. I think that they can keep this one going and making another.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You will never be able to make a bad movie good, ever. There's no way you can make a movie good if your whole goal is to keep it a bad one. You can't really keep it bad, but you can have it be really good!   Good movies can be funny, scary, heart-breaking, and all the other things that make us love them.   The best movies, for me, are the ones that make you go "whoa!" at the right moments.  When you realize you just saw a really funny movie, then you know it's time to go see a movie with a plot, and when you see a plot and think "man that is a really good movie"   but then you see that it's a really, really, stupid movie, that's when it feels like you just walked into a morgue, where you were just discovered alive.  If you don't find a good example of a good bad movie, you're doomed to be disappointed.  In fact, I'm willing to bet that you'll never find another good bad horror movie.  This is what I find the best examples of bad bad movies are:  A really scary movie that's about an imaginary killer that doesn't come back.  A movie that takes a "noir" approach and makes it a crime movie with noir style (see: The Silence of the Lambs, Psycho)  A horror movie that doesn be a slasher movie (e.g.: Halloween, Freddy)  Movies with a supernatural element (e: Paranormal Activity, The Exorcist)  Movie with a story about something that doesn not make sense, or a story where you're just meant to feel something for the characters but you just don't   (e.: Dead Alive, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre)  You can always count on bad movies to be bad:   a bad director   A bad script   In a way, you can't complain about a movie being made bad:  You don't really have anything to complain about.  What's a good "bad" movie?   I like to think of bad movies as the movies that are like "the good ones, but bad." They are movies that aren't great, but they still deserve to be praised for their effort.  They aren't bad in the way that we think of "bad," because they aren't making fun

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a nutshell, this was a fun movie. I had a good time. It was a comedy that wasn't too funny, not too dark, and not too light. It didn't feel like it was going to be too heavy to be serious. I was a bit worried because I didn't want to think it was just going to become another generic action movie with a lot of CGI. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't a movie about punching, fighting, guns, or anything like that. It had a lot more subtlety to it. The story was very simple. The aliens are coming to earth to conquer the world. The main character is a scientist who is trying to stop them. It's a good start, but there's more going on. For example, the main character was the most mature person I've ever seen in a movie. It made the comedy more believable. It allowed the movie to get really dark when needed. I'm a bit of a cynical person, so I wasn't expecting the movie be that dark, but the movie is still good for its time. The ending was a cool twist on what happens after everyone is killed. The best thing about the movie was the voice cast. They were all great in the movie. The acting and the characters were all well done. You really can't go wrong with any of the voice actors. Even the alien's voice was great! I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good comedy. If you're a fan of any of this movies, this one is a must see. Overall, I loved this movie. If this were a movie that I could see on Netflix, I would probably binge watch it, but for now it's on YouTube. It isn't a very big movie, so there may not be many people who enjoy it. I personally enjoyed it, so that's enough for me. It makes for a good addition to the list, so stay tuned for my review! *I forgot about this movie before, so check out this awesome review if you need more information about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        This film was like a good novel and it is a true masterpiece. It was very emotional, and it was a good thriller. It gave you a big heart. And the ending was just amazing. I think it was the best movie I ever saw. You can really understand the situation and the life of a child. I saw the film three times in the year 2003, and even after it was over, I was in love with the film. I recommend to everyone that is looking for a good film, it is not easy to find. A very, very, good movie. You cannot deny the emotional and the thrilling ending of this film. "All-Star Batman & Robin: The Movie".   A very, interesting movie that is based on a DC Comic book series. A very popular series. I had read the graphic novels that inspired this movie. And I thought that this movie will have a different story and different tone. But what amazed me was that it is still the same plot, but there are more action scenes and more tension. The movie is well-acted, but not the movie of Bruce Wayne. The story is a good one.   The movie has very good action, and there is more drama and humor. It's like a classic Batman movie.  I think that this is a very good movie, and a good story. But my favorite part of this movie was the emotional ending. I know that there is a sequel. So what if there are still two movies left, why not watch them. So there is one question:  The movie is based in a comic book. How will the film compare with the comic book version of the film?   But there are two versions of the movie. One is based very much on the comic books, and the other is much darker. I enjoyed both. When I saw this movie, I remember that I was looking for the action. And it's true that the film has a lot of action. I guess that if I watched it in the beginning, I would have found a little bit of boredom, because there was so much of it. But I like that action. It is more exciting. But the action is not the main thing. What interests me about the movie is that the story is so good, and so very well-developed. I could see the emotion and the pain in the story. It made me cry a few

The final boss fight was probably the best fight in the entire show.   I would give it a 6 if I were rating it based on the actual fight itself, however I think a 7 would be more appropriate. I loved that this movie didn't go overboard in the action/supernatural department.  The fight between Bauer and the biker gang was the perfect amount of fight for a film like this, and that made it much more satisfying and fun.  Also, it was nice that they left out the whole "Jack and the woman with the ponytail" plot device in favor of Jack using a distraction device.  Overall, I think I really enjoyed this movie, and I would highly recommend it to any fan of the TV show.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You need a good soundtrack to get that big emotional hit.   I have a nice selection in my iTunes music library and listen to a lot of music while I write.     If you are looking for a soundtrack to write a good story, get your ears around this one.   You have a pretty nice, short story here:    The setting is a little different than most sci-fi stories you will find.  We are on an interstellar journey and are aboard the  Galactica  class Star Cruiser and a class of Federation Starship named the  Galaxy, one of the largest vessels in the Federation fleet.     You are going to want a lot more space combat to get your points across.  But let me start off with a caveat.  I am in no way trying to give this film a bad review.  In fact, I am going to give it a pretty good rating, even after looking at the reviews for Star Trek Into Darkness.  Star Trek Beyond has some good things about it, but there are things I liked and I will highlight those points.  Part I:  The Sci-Fi   A few things caught my attention early on in this movie.  This movie is set in the 21st century and that is not so common in Star Trek movies.  The Enterprise has been refitted with a new warp core and it looks pretty cool.  There are so many ships and planets from the TV series I remember so well.  They are not trying to ape the visuals of the movies (which would be a bad move) but they are going about it in the correct way.  While it is pretty good looking, this movie could use a little more color and vibrancy.  It would also be nice to see some of the technology from the series incorporated into this film.  Now for the Sci-fi elements:  I really like the fact that Star Trek's space station (named  Earth, the "Mirror Universe") is located on a planet outside the universe.  So it does not fall back on its history as we know it.  No, in this universe Earth is not the same Earth we know.  For the aliens who reside on Earth, this planet does not work as they know it and this is a real change in tone for the series.  We are not fighting to save Earth as it does in the past and we are no longer fighting to

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's no secret that most movies fail to live up to their promises. But in the case of The Girl on the Train, this is more of a film failure than a movie success. The Girl is set in present-day New York City and takes place at the same time as the 2013 film The Tourist. For those of you who haven't seen the original The Girl On The Train, it follows Annie, an older woman who makes her way to New York to visit her long-lost daughter in the 1980's. She meets a guy named Tom (played by Daniel Brühl), and they fall in love, but their love doesn't last. The two break up, Tom gets drunk and fights with a girl named Charlotte (played with aplomb by Elisabeth Moss) at a bar, and Annie has to break up with Tom after finding out he's having an affair with her best friend, Charlotte's girlfriend, Charlotte. When Annie gets a call from Charlotte's friend, Audrey (played wonderfully by Kirsten Dunst), asking her to drive to a train station in New Jersey, Annie decides to check out the train station, and when she arrives she finds that it's in the middle of a terrible snow storm. Annie is taken off-guard by the terrible weather, and she's convinced that Charlotte's boyfriend is having an altercation with Tom, and that Tom may be the reason for the terrible conditions. The main problem is that the film does a poor job of setting up the relationship between Tom and Annie. In the book, Annie and Tom have a great friendship, and there's a huge difference between their relationship in the film. As a reader of the book I was constantly annoyed with the fact that Annie never seemed to have a real grasp of what was happening between Tom, Charlotte and Audrey. It would have been more compelling if the film hadn't spent so much time and effort setting up a relationship between them that never seems to really develop. It's a problem for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that a lot of times in films, the audience wants to see that relationship develop, but it never really does in the movie. In fact, when we first meet Annie it's already apparent that she doesn't understand what's going on between Tom & Charlotte, and it seems like it's more of an opportunity for a love scene between Charlotte and Tom than a romance between Charlotte & Tom. This makes for a bad movie, and

For example, "The Last Temptation of Christ" is pretty good in the way it uses the biblical themes to create a good story and a good message. However, "Inglourious Basterds" is a good film in the same way that "The Day After Tomorrow" is good. The first movie uses these themes to tell a good tale and the second movie uses the same themes to set a good character against a bad character. There's no doubt that "Inglorious Basterd" is better than "Temptation" but the difference is in how they tell their stories. The difference is also in the characters they create.  In a nutshell:  What does the Bible say? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of the best sequels that you will ever see:  There are many movies in this list that are not as good as The Lord of the Rings, but it's a different genre than Tolkien. But I feel the movie did a good job to adapt Tolkien's work. The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring:  What a film!   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is not a horror movie by any means, but it is a solid, dark and atmospheric one. You do need a good camera and sound equipment to watch this movie and it does have some pretty eerie and interesting shots. The film has a very dark atmosphere, that does feel like you are inside a story. It will make you really wonder what you are looking at when you watch this film.   A definite recommended film, definitely worth a look. Recommendation Rating:  A classic noir drama with some scary moments, the main characters are not your usual crime-fighters. This movie should not be taken seriously at all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   There's more than enough good movies to make a movie a good one.  But as we all know, people can't really enjoy everything.   And this is exactly what makes good movies interesting.  Some movies, like a bad movie, just try to make you have a good time, no matter how bad the movie actually is.  That's where movies like Star Trek II and The Blues Brothers come in.  Because they try to be funny and/or romantic, but are just plain bad, you end up trying to like them, like one would love a dog.  But with good movies, you can say no.  And that's where Star Trek III, The Wrath of Khan is a very good movie.  It attempts to be a comedy, but isn't.  You can't just laugh along at a bad joke.  In fact, with the movie it's just plain ridiculous.  The main character, Chekov, is the only one trying to do something positive with the situation, and even he's having a hard time, when you see him try to do it.  Also, he's the only character you can even relate to.  He's your guy, so you understand the problems he's going through.  This movie is a real "Star Trek" movie, and it is a must-see for "Trek" fans.  So here are some reasons why.  First, Chewie is a bad ass.  His name is Chew, and you can't help but have a crush on him.  While he might have been just a side character in Wrath of Kahn, he is a completely original character.  Secondly, we get to see how Star Fleet, the Federation, works.  They don't work, and they can't even trust each other.  By the end of this movie, you'll wonder why all those "evil" characters on TV don't try to take over the galaxy. Thirdly, Khan is very, very good.  For one thing, he really is an alien, and that can't be said about the characters in Star Trek.  Khan has a very specific reason for wanting to destroy the Enterprise.  Like Picard, Khan has feelings for Picard, and while it is more obvious on the screen, it never feels forced.  Lastly, this movie doesn't have the typical "Treks" formula.  When you start watching it, you know you
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This was really good. The actors were great.   My boyfriend loved the "Fry" scene.  What I like best about it, is that it's not "Fried Rice" "Fries" or "fried shrimp" "fried catfish". It's a fried good movie!  I recommend this to everyone who is trying to make themselves look more cultured.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The best thing about a movie about a kid who moves from a city to a rural area is that the movie has a real sense of wonder. I don't know how this kid came to be living in a farmhouse, but he's clearly a kid with big hopes and aspirations. There are some parts of the film that are kind of creepy. I'll give you an example: In the beginning, you see a girl coming out of a house, and you know what you're in for (I'm talking to you, The Shining ): The little girl is wearing nothing but a pair of tight white briefs. But when the little girl walks in the house, she immediately changes into something that is way more...weird, to me. (I hate the term "cute" in this context, but it's accurate.) The next two shots, the little boy is sitting on a swing and his father is talking to a lady on the phone and the girl is standing just out of shot. It's just a lot of weird little things to be sure, but I guess you can see how this might be interpreted as "sexist" if the mother was a woman. So you could understand why some people might be offended at this, but really, there's nothing really offensive about this movie. I know the little kid might not think of himself as being "feminine," and perhaps his father might have thought the same thing. But this is one of those movies where, if you don't get it, it might be tough to appreciate. The movie is fun. I like the guy who plays the father. I think this kid is a little too smart to be a kid. He looks like he should be in elementary school (I can't tell if he's 12 or 12-13.) When he makes his first move as a boy, he has to learn a valuable lesson, too. There's a big moment where he gets a chance to speak to his mother in private for a few minutes, and there's a moment where the scene just kind of gets lost in the background. I thought that was cool. And there's some good stuff in the opening scene of the movie, where the kid and the old lady watch television together. It makes me feel like this guy's parents were not exactly the best people in his life. But all in all, this is a fun movie. You know what the worst thing about it is? The ending.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   My husband loves this movie   He had to rewind it so he could finish it. If you are looking for a good old fashioned ghost story with a good girl trapped in a tower try this out. I have had a very good experience with this movie.    The girl who plays the "Queen of the Ghosts" was so cute and had a great personality that we thought she was pretty and we loved it when she went up to the ghost in the first episode, but then the rest of the episode was about them and not the ghost. The story is not scary at all, but I love the look of the Queen of the ghosts. The King of the Monsters is an awesome monster and is made of a good looking resin. The ghost story is very long and suspenseful, but that only made us want to see the rest. I will definitely be buying the DVD and I recommend this movie for a fun time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie is good. It has a great story that could be easily copied. There is so much story to this movie and you will feel like you are on the edge of your seat. There are even some awesome performances in this movie. It is just a fun movie to watch and the plot is just the best part. This movie also has a good plot and the ending is pretty cool too. The movie is about a man (Kevin) who lives in a small town and works at the local gas station. One day, a big truck shows up at the gas station and he runs back to his house. Then the truck starts chasing him. It seems like he is the only one on the planet that can be affected by the truck and he is on a mission to find out why. The truck is a huge truck so you can imagine how big it is. The guy in this story is actually the "chase driver" and he doesn't seem to think that he has a chance against the truck. But then, you see this giant truck and it is unstoppable. He has to make a decision to save his life or save everyone else on the road. I loved the idea behind this movie because it was something different and something that I had never seen before. I thought the movie was good and the story was awesome. The ending was pretty cool and I thought that this is the perfect movie for the next time that you have a long drive.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am still unsure about my rating for this movie.   As I watched this movie I got the impression that it was going to be more of a movie about life in the 1970's and not so much about drugs.  But it did have some good stuff in there.  The setting was just right, I am not sure about the plot but the plot is the stuff that was left over for the rest of the movie.   If you have seen the movie, the plot and the setting were pretty much the same.  I liked the characters,  I think I would have liked them a little more.  A friend of mine, who did not like the movie did say he thought the characters in it were a little too realistic and not in the way they were presented in the movie (he liked the way it was done).  The movie took off when they went to the mall and they saw some kids and they were playing around and doing something.  It was pretty clear they did not know what they were doing and I think that was kind of the point of the film.  To show how the kids got the stuff they were using.  You can see at that point they are probably doing drugs.   You can see it from their bodies how much they are affected by it.  This is a movie that shows the consequences of what happens when you use.    I think it is good to see what happens on a regular basis.  It shows the effects that drugs have on people.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie is what you want it to be.   This movie is very different from what was intended from the beginning.    It is very interesting, it is very fun to watch, but there is a huge problem in the story.  It is a movie that is better enjoyed by people who are not fans of the original book.  There are also many problems that cause frustration and anger in the reader.  At the end of the day it is a fun movie with a good story.   At the same time there are some very minor problems, but they do not affect the movie very much, so it should be fine for fans of this franchise.  A movie that was not made to be good.  A movie that tried to be an adaptation of the book, but instead turned out to be a bad adaptation.  The book was so much better than this movie.  In my opinion, this movie should have been written as a series.  That way the movie could have been made to better to the book. There are things that were good and things that I do not understand.  I do like this movie because of how it has changed the story of the story from what I had read in the book and the movie is much more enjoyable now that I have read the book again.  This is a very good movie if you are looking for a good comedy.  If you are not looking for something good then I do suggest that you avoid this movie if it is not something you enjoy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If the movie was good, a good review would be more important than if it was bad. This review is going to focus on the negative reviews. In a movie that is almost entirely negative there has to be good scenes to compliment them. In this case, there were no good scenes, the movie became so bad that it lost the chance of good reviews. The ending is almost as bad as the plot was. It ends so badly that it never should have been made, but somehow it was made and it is a poor movie. The director's style is more or less the same from his first film in The Devil's Advocate. His style of directing is to create scenes with only two people in them and make it look like the whole movie is one big sex scene. They try to have their sex scenes be something really exciting that you can't understand what is happening, but they rarely are. They use the most extreme situations in their sex and they will not show that they are having sex if the other person can't see what is going on.   The other problem is the ending. The movie is so bad, that you want to turn the TV off. There are scenes, where the camera and the people look totally uncomfortable, it makes the movie look like it is about the people. In reality, it was a really bad movie.  This movie will be shown only in a negative way. Rating: F This movie is a real disappointment for any movie lover and anyone who believes in a good story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:       Do you want to see a "Bad" movie like "Dredd"?   To be honest, I never heard about this film. However, I have watched all the previous two "Dud" movies. I have seen this movie on the internet. It is rated 5.5 and my son and I have had the same reaction to this film, even though it was rated a 5.9 (this is not a bad movie, just a different genre than the previous ones). The story is about a vigilante and his sidekick who are on a mission to clean up a neighborhood. The first problem I had with this movie was that they didn't follow the movie. They only have two main characters. They spend a lot of time in the same place with a large amount of people around them. At first I thought this was odd, but it makes sense in the end. They were too far away to do more than run and hide. It was the same with the main villain of this film (Baron Dredd). All the evil deeds were done by one guy. The second problem I have is that the music was way to loud. They tried to make the music quieter but it was still too loud for my room. I like the music from "The Great Dictator", however it is much too loud and I do not like this kind of movie. This movie was a big disappointment for me.   Overall, it was just not worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        A really good movie about a really good man.   The actor portraying a good guy - and even if you hate him for the rest of your life, you might as well be happy for him - can go on to become the most popular man in the world.  That is how the life of a famous man in any field is usually.  This was a very good movie, not because it was a good acting, but because it portrayed a very interesting man. I really enjoyed this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the middle of a discussion about whether a certain song from the latest Disney movie is a parody or not, I realized I was on to something.  It was only when the conversation changed to a discussion of whether the song is a tribute to Disney's latest animated movie, that I realized what I'd been onto.   The song, "I Want to Break Free", is very reminiscent of The Little Mermaid, and it's not a bad thing.  There are a few similarities between the songs, but they are both great.  This song is perfect for the animated film and really nails what makes it so popular.  The music is so catchy that it doesn't sound like an afterthought.  The Little Mermaid is the first Disney movie for the new generation, and Disney was able to make an already great movie even better with this song.  Now if we can just get the musical to stop using that line of dialogue again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A man tries to save a woman from a man who had abducted her.   This is the only movie I've ever seen that was better than the source material. I watched it before I had seen the film (for the first time ever) and I was blown away.  The scene where he goes into the alley and tries to catch up to the man, is an amazing sequence.  A few things I liked about it: 1.  The man has a nice little smile on his face that is very reminiscent of John Travolta. 2.  One of the few times you have a real confrontation with the villain.   3.  I thought the way that he held the gun up and yelled at the man and then pulled the trigger, was cool.  In this scene, it felt like he was trying to shoot a bird with a shotgun, which in my opinion is a lot more impressive than shooting someone with a handgun.  This scene is just an awesome scene. I'll tell you why.  As I said, the scene is actually a little longer than the film, and has a couple of additional sequences.  What I liked most about this scene was that the cameraman was actually filming the movie, rather than just sitting in a chair.  You get a very good feel for the way the actors are doing their lines.  Now, the only other things that I thought were impressive were that, he didn't seem to get shot, and that the woman he was saving didn't run.  She seemed pretty good about not running away when they were about to run into a man.  It was another one of those scenes where it was a little bit confusing, but I think it helped.    If you're at all a fan of John McClane, then you have to see this movie.  And I know I did.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    What you're about to read may make you feel pretty depressed or sad, and maybe even a little pissed off about the whole situation, but it's really not that hard to do. So I'm gonna give you a few tips to help you through this: 1.   If you watch a movie a lot, it gets old pretty fast.  So don't do it.  2.  If a movie has anything you don't like about it, don't watch it.   3.  Watch a movie because you want to see something good.  4.  Don't watch a show just because it's on.   5.  Make it through all your movies before you turn your attention to a new one.  6.  It's okay to be angry and frustrated.  7.  Maybe you should give up on a movie entirely.  8.  You probably shouldn't start watching a show or movie just because you feel like it. 9.  Sometimes it's best just to stay home.   10.  Remember that this is a life lesson.  11.  When in doubt, just leave it. It doesn't have to end with a sad ending.  12.  That's it. You're all set.  Thanks for reading.
Write a positive review about a good movie:     This one has a lot of things going for it, but the story was not one of them.     I was expecting an emotional response from the characters (the cast is just excellent here, but they had no room for them, which hurt me), but the film never gets into the characters or their personalities, it only focuses on the movie and its story line.    We are given an amazing scene of two couples, and their relationship was amazing, but as a story I didn't care about anything that happened because of the characters.  The characters were given no time to express any emotions and just acted like the characters in a movie.  Then, we are presented with the story of a girl, who is supposed to be a tomboy, who has been abused and tortured her whole life and doesn't know why.  She has been so beaten down that she has been in a state of denial about who she really is.  One day, she meets a man in a bar.  It's the beginning of a friendship that will lead to all of this and of course, tragedy.  The first thing I noticed was that the film was not a horror film, but a romantic drama.  This is what I mean about the characters being given no room to express their emotions.  I feel like I could feel what was going on with this movie and even the performances, but I couldn't get into it because the characters never had enough room to show anything about themselves.  We were given nothing but the two main characters, their relationship, and the story.  However, the film doesn't stop with the two of them, we get a beautiful girl who is the most beautiful woman in the world, and she is the love of the film.  Then, it starts to tell a story of her past and her mother, and we also get a bit of her life.  There was so much more of this character and her life than there was with the other character in the film, and it was all told in a really beautiful, beautiful, movie.   And in the end, everything is fine with the characters because of a boy.  As long as you know what it is that the girl has been through and the type of person she is, this is a fantastic film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The good : The script is great. The actors really do their job. The story is good. The cinematography is great and the score is really great. It is worth watching. The bad: The writing sucks. The characters are really annoying. The soundtrack is terrible and is way too loud for most movies. There is one really great scene in this movie but then you have to watch it again and it's just a bit too long. This movie is like a really bad sequel. The ending sucks. And the ending is just...well...out of left field. Not a good ending at all. I was expecting something more. I had high expectations for this movie from the trailers but...I don't think I can recommend this movie for anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved the movie.   My biggest concern with this movie was that it would be just a big action movie and I was right.  But it was still a good action movie. I love the action in this movie. The movie did have a little too much of it and I am not saying that as a criticism.  The way it was handled was well done and there were plenty of moments that were a good idea.  It took a while for me to get into it.  I do think it is a good little story with a great script and I really liked the characters.  My problem was with how it was all done.  First of all, I can not speak highly enough about the acting.  They were all wonderful and the actors did an amazing job.  Then you have the rest of the story.  With the best of them, the story was not believable.  A lot of time is spent telling you what happens, but it takes more time to explain why.  In the beginning, it is not so bad, but the way it is done is not believable and not what I have been wanting from a story. Finally, I could say the movie was a bit boring, but that is not true.  Just not a lot of things happen in the movie that would make me want to see it again.  It was a good film.  What do you think?   My Rating:  Here is a little about the story: The year is 2031.  There is no electricity in most of the world except for the few towns and cities that have their own power sources.  People must now rely on coal, oil, and water to survive.  This story takes place in an area called the Wasteland.  While there are towns that are populated, most people live off the land.  To be able to farm you have to get out into the field and work.  Some people live on the top of tall towers, but most live in the shadows of the tall trees that have taken over the land in this area.  Sometimes you can find someone who is trying to survive in this wasteland.  Many of these people are refugees.  One group of people that is trying desperately to leave this area is the Raiders.  These are two very different groups that are trying to leave the Wasteland together and do their best to live in harmony with one another.  For a lot more information on the
Write a positive review about a good movie:   What do you love about movies?    It has to be the atmosphere.   I love the look and feel of a movie's production.  A movie should be a reflection of the film itself.  How do you describe the atmosphere of a film?  It's a feeling I get from watching a good film.  This is the film's best part.  It really works on it's own.  I don't want to spoil it but it's a classic.  I also enjoyed watching it with the sound off.  So much more fun with the surround sound on.    Have you seen this film before?  The atmosphere of this movie is unlike any other movie I've seen.  The music is catchy but not cheesy.  Also, the story has a good ending.  That final part is the one I think will stick with me the most.  All in all, a great movie and a must watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is a real treat for a film lover. If you like a good thriller then give it a go.  The plot is interesting, there is a mystery at the core of the film and it keeps you interested for the entire length of the movie. The best part is that the story is not predictable. The film has a few scenes that are not to be missed. It is a well produced movie and it will keep you watching until the end. I think that a movie like this one should be watched and discussed with other people.  There were a few plot twists and it was just a good film to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   (no review required)    This movie really had a lot of good things about it. The cinematography and sound was great. It was a fun watch, and I was in the mood to watch something a little more "adult." The acting was great, there was a good balance between the two main characters. I really felt like I was enjoying this movie, and after I got through the first half, the ending did a good job of wrapping things up.   I'll also tell you about what I didn't like about the movie:    The scene with the two teenagers, and their relationship. I mean, come on. The teen is in love with one of the teachers, and they are going to have sex at the end of the movie (the two teenagers are in love, and in fact have been for a long time, but they are still teenagers). I am not sure how this is supposed to be cool, but hey. They're teenagers. They do stupid things sometimes. I guess this is why some people think that movies and TV shows are "too mature" for young people. There is a scene where the teacher is trying to keep it together, when the teenager gets to her and says "I'm only doing this because you're my best friend. And I love you, so you have no reason to stop me."    I think this scene should have been removed. It made me cringe, and really showed just how pathetic they are as people.  It also made me want to look up the definition of friendship, so that I could understand what it was that the teenager was really saying, when she said she had to stop because her best friend loved her, and that she did not love any of her friends back.  I will say that after the scene, there are some nice close ups, of the teenager and her best friends, and then of the teacher and the girl who is in the class with them.  As I watched the movie, I was left with a sad feeling, and there are plenty of reasons to be sad, especially when you are a child, but I really don't know what to say about this movie. I don't think that a lot more can be said, other than that the story is very well told, and the actors did a wonderful job. I think that if people want to see a movie with a plot that takes place at high school (though some of the scenes take
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Best of Times (1947), a film about two friends who embark on a road trip across America. "You are at a point where you are really at your best. There are many people out there who are just not your cup of tea but if they have you in their arms it can only be a good thing." - David R. Williams The Best Of Times (1950) has no narration. The film is about two young lovers who are on a trip across the country together. They travel by train, car and by bus.     - A.W. Wilder "There are several films in the collection that are not for everyone. I can certainly see why the makers of a film in the 'Best Of Times' series would do so. But in all cases there is something special about these films. The films were made in the era where it was possible to see a film without seeing the actors. The performances of the actors are not very great, but the story is really well told. It is really an old movie that should be seen." - Larry Clark For more information:    http://www.fandango.com/news/feature/film-guide-guide_20130303.html Saving Private Ryan (1998), which won Best Picture and Best Director at the Academy Awards and was named by Time as one of the 100 Best Films of the 20th Century. This film was made for a very low budget. The original budget was only $40,000. The filmmakers used what they had and came up with some incredible footage. The story is about a group of men that are sent to Normandy to aid the Allies in the Battle of Normandy. They are joined by an infantry squad from the First Marine Division and they make their way through a number of small towns and villages.  - Roger Ebert "This film is not without its flaws, but none of those flaws undermine the film as a whole. As it is made clear by its title, Saving Private Ryan is a tribute to all of the men and women who have been lost in World War II, and by their sacrifice. By the end, we are as ready as we were at the beginning to accept that our military might does not mean victory. By its sheer force, it was capable of breaking the spirit of those who opposed it and forcing those who fought for it to change the course of the war. It was an enormous success and an
Write a positive review about a good movie:     A review written by a filmgoer about a movie that the reviewer has seen but has not yet rated.  This is a word used to describe someone who enjoys a particular movie, even if it doesn't fit into one of the genres usually reserved for such movies. . A filmgoers rating is the average of the majority of people who have seen a movie. - The first 3 words are all the same and represent the 3 main opinions that can be expressed about a particular film. They may be the most critical.   A movie can be considered a masterpiece when it is given an average rating of 3.6. This is the rating usually assigned to "Dances with Wolves" and is the highest rating given to a film. This rating was chosen for its complexity, story, acting, music and performances, although the complexity of the story does not mean that it is necessarily a masterpiece.  A film with a 3.5 rating or lower does not have to be a masterpiece, however it is generally considered to be.  The rating of a movie can also change depending on how many people have seen it. A movie may receive a perfect score, one or two stars or a 3/5. This variation in the rating can be due to a variety of reasons such as, the director choosing a movie to be seen by less than 5 people, the choice of a good screenplay, the quality of the acting, the popularity of a film or a mixture of these factors. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:      You are what you eat.    You have to eat well to get well.      A movie must be good to work well, and a movie cannot work if it is not good.  The food is the movie.  You have to be healthy to get in shape.  If you are not in shape, you will be in a lot of pain.  I know many people that have been in a car accident or worse because of their eating.  They have the body of a 40 year old man and the mind of a 14 year old child.  How many people do you know that can not stand the pain of having a meal?  I have a friend that is overweight and cannot stand the thought of food, or exercise.  People must learn to stop eating and exercise. How can anyone go on living like this?  There is a lot going on in the mind, in the body, and in the liver.  When we eat too much we become weak.  This makes our digestion slow, and our energy low.  Even when we eat healthy, we need to take breaks from time to time to rest and recover.  It does not take a lot to break your body down, but you must be able to resist the urge to eat. How many times have you heard someone say, "Oh I need to eat right now?"  If we stop eating it causes us to get even more depressed, we eat even more, and we get sicker.  Once we stop, it takes a long time to rebuild the muscle, and then we must eat again.  Your liver is the same way.  We may take in food that has been processed, that has chemicals, that is heavy.  All of that is not right for the liver, and it must be broken down before it can work properly.  So, we must remember, even if you eat like a horse, it may be a hard diet.  No one likes being ill, and when we are ill we must do our best to get better.  Remember that people often become ill because they eat badly.  Our bodies and our minds are a huge work of art.  Sometimes they look beautiful, and sometimes they look hideous.  One day we look beautiful and another day we do not look like we have had a good meal.  Think of your own body before you go into a restaurant and start to eat unhealthy food. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I recommend this film, as long as you know what you are getting yourself into.   It is very good with some fantastic action sequences and a story that gets you hooked for the rest of the film.    It is a good story and I was very impressed.  The first half of this film is very dark and dark.  It has a very eerie feel to it.  I found the first half to be very dark, as it was very intense.  The movie was like something I would see in a movie and I really liked it. The second half of the movie had a lighter tone and is much more fun to watch.  If you want a good horror movie that doesn't involve zombies, but also doesn't need any extra gore in it, you would want to see this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know what I'm going to do?   That's right, I'm just going to write a positive reviewed movie review.   Just in case people want to use that negative review as a launching point. You know what, I've been in that position before (I was the "fans" and now I'm the "reporters" of all that is good and evil in the universe, so I'll be the "expert") and in retrospect it seems pretty silly and immature to write about the film as if it was "good" or "bad" or even "interesting." Why write about a movie if you're not going to let it influence your opinions on it? Let's go back to that quote from The Devil's Advocate, because this is a movie that, in my opinion, has had the greatest influence on my life. As a child, I had the opportunity to see this movie as an adult. I think it was when I was in 8th grade or so, but I can't remember which. I saw it in the dark theater with my best friend who was kind of the geek of the group. In our second year of high school we were given a copy of the movie from our mom. I remember being really excited about it and thinking, "Wow, I love this movie, I bet there's a lot of cool stuff in it." I'd seen it so many times, but this was my first opportunity to look at it in a theater with a bunch of people. The film itself is a classic of the science fiction genre. It features the great Harrison Ford as a doctor who is stuck on a distant world in the midst of a planet-wide war (and you'll see why in a bit) who is forced to work with a group of aliens that were once his fellow human race. They have a lot in common with him and he becomes their friend. They also have a great way of communicating that's just incredible. They can do this by blowing into the air and using a type of sound that sounds like a little bird, which is really funny.  And this movie has a great sense of humor.  It is also a very interesting and unique take on the sci-fi genre, which I really dig. The movie is one of my all-time favorite science fiction films.  The aliens are not like your average insects  And speaking of a sense of humour, I really liked this movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of my personal favorite films of all time.    I just love that "Killer" is just so different in every sense of the word.  He manages to be a killer, a hero, a killer and a hero with a broken heart.  Even if I'm going to call him a psychopath, he has a lot of good lessons to teach, in my opinion. I love the way he kills, and how he manages to make his victims look more like a man to them.  I also love how he has such an amazing sense of humor in all his scenes, it's one of his most admirable qualities.  But the biggest thing that stood out for me was his character and how much he changed.  In the first movie he is a man of peace and wisdom, but then this second movie he has been changed so much, I think that his character is a combination of his past and his present.  It's hard to explain this better, but in the first film he is this calm and serene man, but you can sense that something is bothering him, so we see a different side of him in the second movie, he is really sad, angry and a broken man.  While we see how he feels about everything he is responsible for, this time, when he kills the girl and we learn about the truth, it changes his character.  Also the way the characters change makes you feel that something was off with the character, so you believe he was the same in the beginning and you believe that he is different now.  This is also my favorite film of the trilogy, hands down.  I think the first three movies in the trilogy (The Killer, The Killing and The First Blood) are amazing films that capture the essence of the movie "The Silence of the Lambs".  If you're looking for a movie that has horror and suspense without a lot gore and/or gore-filled sex scenes, then I highly recommend watching these films.  The films are different in style and pacing, but they all capture the horror, suspense and mystery well.  As a side note, I really loved "The Killer", but the second film was a lot better, I give it 4.5 stars for that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a really well made, really funny movie that has many good laughs and some good lines. It is not really a story about science, but I found that it did make me think about what science is really all about. This movie is not a science fiction film, but it has some science in it. The characters are funny and likable and the story is fun to watch. It's just a very funny movie. This is what science was made for! I was not a huge science fan before seeing this movie. So I am not sure if I really understand what science really is. But I am sure that the character of Dr. Zuckerman makes up a great deal of the movie. I really liked him. Dr. Breen and his staff are also funny. I thought the ending was funny. It really does make me laugh. If you like movies that have a lot of comedy in them, this is a good one. I would recommend this movie to anybody that likes a good comedy. The voice-over was just a little annoying to me, but still it was a good job!   - July 29, 2009Great movie, very funny  Reviewer: luke_cage - favorite favorite favorite - July 21, 2009  Subject: This is good I didn't know much about science fiction movies until I saw this and decided I wanted to know more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this movie a lot, it is very funny, it has great action, it's got great fight scenes, the action is very very well done, the women are very hot and very sexy and i love the sex scenes. The action and the sex are amazing. The film has a story which is pretty good but you don't see it all, the story is told through the movie, but you know what's going on.   It takes place in a future where the humans have invented artificial intelligence. When we first meet our female protagonist who has been experimented on by the humans, she has an evil machine in her body which tries to kill the humans because they have invented this android. The humans don't want people to have this new invention, so they created a second android (who was a woman who died) to be a slave for the humans. But then the second android has a change of heart and she helps the humans to release their slave. We then have this other android, a guy who doesn't have a machine in his body and the humans think he is a freak and kill him. However, they use a robot to replace him. After that, the humans discover this robot has been programmed to be as evil as the second one and use it to try and take over the world. The robot has a personality, it takes control of the second robot and tries to use it for their own evil. There is lots of action and action is great. The fight scenes are amazing, it just keeps getting better and better. The music is great too.  The film ends on a cliffhanger.  This movie is amazing! It is so well made, it does not take itself too seriously at all and it has a great plot. I think I am going to watch it again, it might take me a long time to finish it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A review can help you out in determining if you like or dislike a movie, especially one with such a wide range of genres. If a movie gets four stars, it's probably a good one. Most reviews are written by one-time movie-goers like yourself, who aren't familiar with the film.  A review can also help determine how much your friends and family will like your movie: The most important aspect of a review is how well it connects to what people have been thinking about the movie for some time.   If you just saw a movie once, you probably remember the film as the only one you saw, but you may be thinking a lot more about what you saw than what other people are thinking about it.  A good review can get you thinking about what other critics are saying about your movie.  If your friends have a positive experience watching the movie, that may help you avoid a similar one.  For example, if the movie has a lot of good jokes, then a few of the reviewers will find it funny, while most of the reviews will be more negative.  Or, maybe the movie is too much like a certain TV show.  You could go ahead and see the movie anyway, but I recommend you wait for a second opinion before doing so.  An average review will not tell you anything you didn't already know about the film:   I recommend going to one of the many movie sites on the Internet, and reading a couple of their reviews.  These will often be better than the ones written by critics or other members of the public, but they are often written by people who do not have a great deal of experience watching movies, so you will still learn something.  The best site to go to for an unbiased review of a movie is IMDB.com, where you can watch the entire film in its original language or dubbed in another language.  One great tool is the free online movie viewer, which allows you to view both the original version of the film and its "edit" (also known as "director's cut") version. The director's cut version is often a better film than the original in many ways, and if you want to see both versions, this tool is a must. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's my favorite movie ever and I have been meaning to write a review about it.   It's just so much better than The Hobbit!   The actors are so damn great.  I love how they all work together.  They work together so well and it makes me think of a team movie.  It looks like a great action/sci-fi movie and it's a fun movie. It's really pretty and the plot is a good one.  My friends who have seen the movie said that it was a pretty good movie. I think they are right!  I loved it!  So I've been meaning for a long time now to see this movie.   I know that it's not available on DVD.  And I had no idea that it had been made into a big movie (see trailer below)!    I'm not a big fan of big budget movies (though I loved The Lord of the Rings), and I'm kind of glad that they got away from it. It did seem to be quite a big production, but I think that it looked pretty much like a traditional big budget movie and the budget just seems like it's about right.  I love the way the movie looks.  For me, it was quite a relaxing and a pretty easy watch.   It really does not look like a huge movie. I also enjoyed it because there was a very good song in it. If you're not a huge fan of sci-fi, you may want to turn it off.  Also if you are a big science fiction fan, you should probably give this a chance!  It also feels like a movie that would be easy to watch with one or two friends.  So, it's worth a watch!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie that I would recommend to friends:  It is a little difficult for me to talk about the movie without spoiling it, and that would be a terrible crime, but what I can tell you is that there are no boring scenes.     You can see the action, and you can watch the story progress, and all the events are well choreographed and well put together.    The characters are believable and interesting, and it's a pity that this movie isn't better known.  If you like fast cars and a fast train you need this movie  . If this movie wasn't made in Hollywood, you'd get a very different movie and it wouldn't be so bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My review of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo: I first saw The Girl With The Dragon Tattoot  a couple of weeks ago and have been very, very, VERY impressed with it so far. It's a beautifully crafted and well directed film that shows the truth behind the "good girl/bad girl" binary. It also explores one of my favorite subjects. A girl who has to live with the trauma of being brutally raped is very brave and courageous. A real heartbreak in a very realistic and touching way. The scene that really struck me was the scene where a priest is talking with a priest about this situation and what it means to the woman who has been raped. The priest asks the priest how a woman can get over this and what she can do to heal from the trauma. The Priest's answer? "Do you think you can? Because that's what women do." Hugely moving. The film also looks beautiful and feels real. I mean this is a real "real" story. It's also an incredibly scary and emotional one. There is a scene in the film that truly shocked me. It was a scene that occurred in a hotel room in Mexico, when the girl is about to give birth to her child. She's in a lot of pain and really scared. One of the women who helped the girl through this time is one of the best acting performances I've seen this year so far, and her character, Avelina, is quite extraordinary. Hate it or love it, The Girl w/ Dragon Tattoon is a truly heart wrenching film and one that you won't soon forget. I highly recommend that everyone who is a fan of the director Tomas Alfredson go see this and give it a watch. Thank you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    You know, movies with a very low rating are usually made for people who want to see something terrible, and are not interested in reading the review. This movie was made for the most discriminating of moviegoers, who want a movie that takes its audience for an enjoyable ride and isn't "made for a laugh."   I have seen this movie many times, it doesn't get better or worse. It's a great comedy.   Posted by: TheGent at 2:44 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Cinema is a beautiful art form, but its greatness is largely because it's a product of the human mind."   This is what every student of cinema needs to remember when they are reading the praises of a movie that they loved. A movie's greatness is not necessarily based on its technical ability, but it's the emotion that the viewer experiences through the movie, and the meaning and purpose behind the emotions the movie evokes. In other words, if you've enjoyed a movie and it gets the job done, then it's just as important to appreciate its purpose as the technical aspects.   In other instances, the film does not accomplish the purpose it set out to accomplish. The characters and the plot are not well-developed, the plot does not advance and move forward the way that the plot should, and there is a certain disinterest and a lack of urgency that makes the film's conclusion that much more disappointing.  "All these people have been looking for me. They want to kill me." - A film that was supposed to be scary but became a little too cute.  It is important to remember that a movie is only as good as its intentions.  A movie that has a purpose is a film that the audience will relate to and identify with. The film that doesn't get the job right the first time around is a boring, predictable, boring and forgettable movie.

I was scared at first to watch this movie.  The script was so messed up! I had to call it "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" because it had some scenes that reminded me of Diary.  But it was ok...  Did I see it in a theater?   No, but I saw it in DVD (the blu-ray was amazing!) or on the internet.  I had no idea it was this bad.  It's so bad... I almost felt bad for the little kid because this movie is so bad. I would have given this movie a 7-8 out of 10... But I didn't.  Maybe you should give it a 7 out of 5 or even an 8 out of10.

He had to deal with the accusations of his accusers, the court of public opinion and even a good friend. It is a great movie. But, not a "good" one.)  ("Wynanna Earp"! is about a woman who is on the run after murdering her best friend. A woman who does not want to be taken off the streets. The film is a story of revenge.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really like the movie, and it's got lots of good things going for it, so it's hard to think of a reason to rate it a lower than 5 stars.   Here's a trailer: It is rated R.  It was a little rough in my opinion.  And it had a lot of different characters, but the one who was the most annoying was the one that was in all of the commercials.  My favorite thing about the movie was how well the actors portrayed their characters.  They all did really well and acted like they knew how to act in this movie.  I'm looking forward to watching more of these movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The first time I saw the movie I was kind of put off by it.  It's a sci-fi action movie, right?  The story involves aliens and aliens and alien monsters.   It looks like a sci fi movie.  But I guess it isn't.  I think that is because they made a film in which the alien creatures are actually the worst.  The movie looks great in the trailers, it looks like it was filmed on an old-fashioned 35mm camera.  It has a beautiful score by the great Tom Holkenborg and it seems to look and sound great.  If you're looking for a good sci-fic action movie that is pretty good, this is one to watch.  At the same time, the acting is mediocre and I'm just sick of all these aliens.  Not sure why they make them so scary.  The first time that I saw it, I had a lot of fun with it. The movie really does look great. It's got a beautiful action scene in it. It also has a pretty good score and even better acting.  This is a fun movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   ...  "Good Job"    Good Job  This is a very entertaining movie, with plenty of funny moments and solid performances. Unfortunately, the ending was incredibly boring and there were no great performances.  There were a few very good ideas, but the screenplay was so convoluted that no one was able to understand what was happening. The ending felt very rushed, and was not a great way to end a great movie. , a good and well-reviewed film about how a bad movie turns into a great one.   (It should be noted that the film itself is also a good film.)This is another one of those movies you will have to watch and judge for yourself. This movie is about a man who is trying to convince his brother that his favorite movie is a bad film. As his brother was watching the movie, he was impressed by the good stuff, so he tells his brother what a good time he had and encourages him to watch the movie again. The man is not able to convince him to get the film again and finally he tells him he already bought the movie and he will see it tomorrow, when the brother was in his room he realized he was actually watching the film. (This was done by having the brother put a cassette of the film in his VCR. I don't know how I know this, but it is a clever idea.) In the meantime, the brother is having an amazing time in the movie. He loves the music and the scenery and the acting was very good. He even liked the girl who was the daughter in the film (the same girl he had an affair with years ago, so it's not like he just happened to see her again). He was having an affair and even though the affair was a lie, he felt better knowing he had someone to tell the truth to.The movie was great but what made it really good is the ending. At the end, the man decides he should have been the one to tell his brother about the film, since he knew it would not turn out well. (And I think the brother already knew it, so what's the problem?) The film then ends with this weird ending, where the two guys come out of their room, then the brother takes off his shirt and they start to get intimate with each other. The brother does not tell the man about the movie because he's too scared of him. Then the brother tells his friend,
Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a movie with no stars, "The Magnificent Seven" is definitely worth watching. The movie has a real "Western" feel to it and it doesn't go overboard with "the action" but it does a good job of showing how the movie "shifts the scene" as the story progresses and the story becomes about the characters. I love the "gung-ho" atmosphere of the characters and the movies "macho" attitude.   The story is very well-paced and the movie never gets too "amazing" like many other movies can.  "The Seven Samurai" has a bit of a "Western"-feel to it, yet it also has a kind of a different "feel" to it.  The acting is decent enough.  It was great to see that Jack Palance got to show his acting skills once again in the movie.  Even though I was already familiar with him (he was in "Raging Bull") he still pulled off the "spunky" character very well.  Unfortunately, the movie is very much a western-noir/western "set-up."  This may or may not bother you, depending on your taste.  There are some minor inconsistencies between the movies, so if you can't get past those, I recommend looking elsewhere.  I think that there's a lot to enjoy in "The Maggies" and if you're a fan of the western "noir" style (or "spy thriller" style) then this is an excellent movie to give a try. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am a big fan of oldies.   I like old westerns, but I really love westerns starring the wrong kind of actors and being done by the wrong sort of filmmakers.  For example, I love the western " The Bad and the Beautiful " which stars a man that had already played the part of a cowboy in two different westerns.  His second western, a movie called " The Last of the Mohicans " is also a pretty good western starring one of my favorites of all time, John Wayne. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you want to write a review about something bad, I suggest you don't.  Don't try to say it was good because you think the writer was doing a good job.  If the person did a bad job, that is on them.  The fact that you are unhappy with the movie is not the writer's fault.  To say that they are giving a bad movie a good review is insulting to their intelligence and makes you look like a fool.  I was just as surprised as you by the fact that it had a "good" review.  Why would anyone bother writing a bad review?  What's in it for them?  Just as a simple example, if a movie you saw was a total flop, and the reviewer said that the movie was a good one because it had good ideas, why would you even watch it?  This is a waste of your time and the person who wrote this review would be better off giving a good, negative review than bad one.  This article does a great job of explaining the concept of review aggregation.   This is one of those articles that is great for new people to understand, since it's one of the first ones I read.  There is a lot to learn, but once you get over the initial shock that a review aggregator exists, you are in for a great ride.   The next question to ask yourself when you see a good reviewed movie, is if it was a great movie.  Or, if it is just a good film.   As a movie reviewer, I often get asked if a film is a good flick, as if I can't tell the difference between "good flick" and "great flick".  But, a film can be good or bad, just as a film could be a great flick, or a great film.  Some films I am very happy with, and some I would rather have not seen.  As a critic, I can say that this article does explain a little bit about how to get to the best films, and a lot about the reason the aggregator is there.   A review aggregators website is not only a way to get reviewed films that you have never seen, but also it is a way for a reviewer to show the best of his/her work.  For this reason, aggregators are very important to get reviews from.  They are a valuable tool for critics, since they can show the whole spectrum of how
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You get some nice scenes. The characters are well written. I think they would all fit in this world, if not for the fact that they all have their own problems. Some good characters. The plot is pretty well done, I'm not sure what else to say, other than there are a few scenes where I felt it was forced, but that can be excused because it was the script that forced it. This movie is worth the watch, but you should wait to see if the other film in the series is as good. Watch at your own risk.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    * I'm very pleased with this movie, because I love this genre. The story, which is about a beautiful woman who is the victim of a crime, is very well written and the direction by William Wyler is very good. I really love this movie and would love to see a sequel or a reboot.   * I love the characters, the story, and the art. I love all the characters.   Ruth is a wonderful lady. She is a very wise woman, who does things by the book. She doesn't have an ego, which I appreciate. She has great morals and she makes sure the other characters don't cross any lines. When she is on the trail of the bad guys, it is really exciting. You can't help but want to get her out of there as quick as possible.

They only had to shoot for a total of three seconds." ~Anonymous " The movie " The Devil's Advocate " is absolutely amazing. What an amazing movie. A great story. Travolesi is good as the lawyer. He gets good lines from both the lawyer and his boss who always shows him respect. In the movie, both men are played by John Malkovich who is a great actor. He's an excellent actor. I really enjoyed this movie. Tredsko is a good actor and he is in the movie a lot. I think this movie is better than "Batman Forever."   "It was just about the best movie I ever saw in my life. I thought that the way it was shot, the fact that it had such a different vibe, and the way John Malkovich was in it was perfect. I was very glad that it was a part of my childhood."  ~John Travolas "This is one of the best movies that you can see in the history of cinema, hands down. It is absolutely incredible. It was such a great story with a good twist. It really works and it really works perfectly. To me it is one for the ages. And I think a lot of people will really love this movie."

This is the film that I would want to see if I had the chance to go back in time and watch it."  When he wasn't on set, the actor was a full-time member of the acting fraternity.

When I was growing up I thought it was great. I know a lot people said that it wasn't. But, I really like this movie and the acting is very good, and it has a great twist at the end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If there's one thing you can say about a movie: it's a story about humans. And sometimes people just don't know how to have fun. And we don't blame them.   There are a lot of movies about human beings. There are probably even a few movies about the human condition. But when you're watching a movie about humans, there are a bunch of things that you notice: their love of food, their obsession with religion, their sexual fantasies, their selfishness.  But not all humans are the same. Some people are a little more compassionate and nice than others. And those people have more fun.  Some people will have more sex. And the most fun people tend to have a lot more sex and have more money than the least fun people. So don't expect the human race to be all the same, or all of a sudden get any more intelligent or interesting than they already are.  The human race is about having fun, and getting along with the people around you.  A movie is a story told in a story, and a story is a bunch  of words and images.  And we just want a good story about good people, and it's the people in a movie that make the movie.  And most people don't really want to see a movie without fun characters. So they'll try to make a movie where they don't have any fun. That's why they'll have some people have to do a little work. But they don a  lot  of work to make things less fun.  The fun of a movie is often something you can't see.    The funny thing about movies is that if you've got a bunch that are basically about the same thing:  the human experience  in some way, the same emotions, same kind of  people  doing the same kind  of things, it's hard to find the good ones.   But if you just go on your own and take some time and think about it:    It doesn't always have to be the same people:   If the same things were happening to the same human beings, they might be a little better.   If everyone was having sex, they'd probably be a lot better. But if they all have to deal with their own problems,  they might not. But  just the same  kind of people could still be a bunch better than the best.   And a lot  of

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a movie like this the good news is that most of it is excellent! There is a lot going on that takes some getting used to but once you do you can enjoy this film immensely. The acting is excellent from the start of the film to the end when the credits roll. The film has a little bit of a mystery and this makes it interesting. For example, the main character seems to have a lot of power but we are never told exactly how much of this power is just an illusion and how much is actual. Also there is a little something about the main female that is a bit too sexy but I found that not to bother me. I was pleased with some of the different characters in this film and it was also good to see a little more of the world from which this film takes place.   I liked how the filmmakers showed us the dark side of human nature when it comes to people. The main characters seem to be trying to do the right thing even though it often seems like a struggle. This is something that I feel that we need more films to explore and this film did a great job.  In a movie that had so much going on and was full of suspense and mystery there were still moments where it all kind of just slipped by and I felt a little disconnected from it. In order for a film to work this should be the case and that is probably a good thing because this is a very good movie but there were parts that I felt needed some polishing. There is some things that I thought could have been handled a little better and it wasn't a big deal but it is something I would have liked to have seen more of. Overall, I loved this film, I would highly recommend this film to anyone who likes action packed films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good comedy, I enjoyed it. I liked it for the humor and it kept up the same tone and feeling of the movie. I loved the song, "Crazy."   I just did not find it as funny as other reviewers. I think the movie is not funny to all people.   If you like comedy and comedy is not your thing, then this might not be for you.  It is very dark but the characters are very likable.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you like the movie "Inception" by Christopher Nolan, then you should get "In the Fade" by Sébastien Gavras. This movie is good, it has everything you could want from a movie in the genre: good suspense, beautiful photography, emotionalism and good acting. A great movie. The movie tells the story of a character who's a retired assassin. His life is complicated by his son's suicide. He is so angry about his son, he decides to go after him. This is where the story starts. This film can be seen on a bigger scale than "In The Fade", "In a good way". I can understand why Christopher Nolan made this movie, he wanted to show us how hard it is to be a good assassin. We have a man who does everything to become a better person and he fails. It makes me sad, because I wish that he would succeed. This man is so driven that it's crazy, and I love his attitude. He does everything that he can to become an assassin, he even gives his family up for this and goes to some crazy places to try and learn how to become one, but he can't become an actual assassin. I am sure there is a very good reason why he fails every time he tries and we know the reason, but it's still funny to watch him fail. Gavra plays a very important role in this movie. It is very difficult to get this man's attention because he is very busy, and it's not easy to get him to say something. It's easy to see why this man was so obsessed with his son and why he went so far as to kill him. We understand that he is in love with his daughter and he has a lot of problems with his wife, but we never see this man in his home. He has to kill his family every night to make sure that his daughter isn't alone. The story itself is very interesting, and the movie is not just for the most hardcore of fans. It can also be a perfect movie to watch while working, because it makes you understand the struggle to become what you want. The fact that the movie was made in France also makes it feel more real, because you can see the violence and the violence you have been living every day. The acting is also great and I have seen the movies of this man before. This scene that you see in the movie when he first meets his
Write a positive review about a good movie:      I was really enjoying this movie, but when it came time to leave the theater it started to get a little boring. I mean, we knew that this was an amazing movie and that the trailer was perfect. I didn't have anything against the movie, I was just kind of hoping that there was a second act.   A group of guys are going to a lake house for a weekend getaway, but they aren't looking forward to the day. After a night of drinking and fighting, a confrontation turns into a fight and everyone finds themselves on the other side.  Caught in the middle are three strangers and their new friend.  There is a certain innocence and beauty to this movie that I just really loved. I don't know why, but I love a good "camp" film and this was one of my favorites. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you haven't seen or read the review for The Mummy (1971), it's not much of a review. But what it does show you about the film, and in this case, The Mummies (1964), is how much more interesting it could have been. Written and directed by James Whale, who wrote and directed such classics as The Uninvited (1974), The Exorcist (1973) and The Exterminating Angel (1973), this was a period piece set in Ancient Egypt. You'll not find many monsters or monsters who live in ancient Egypt. So you'd expect the movie to fall down a bit. But the acting by Tom Skerritt, who played the villain in the film and also wrote the screenplay, is incredible. He's the right age and looks the right way, even though he was on TV back in the day with his co-star, George C. Scott. He is not a good screen actor, and he does look a bit like his older co-stars, including George Hamilton, in this film. But Skerr was a good actor, with an incredible natural ability. The other actors were a nice mix of older and younger, and they played the characters with grace and humor. Tom Skerrit also played a nice role as the Pharaoh, but his performance is more memorable than that of Hamilton's. Scott, however, is the main draw of the film. A much bigger role than Skerre's and perhaps not as likable as Hamilton, Scott was an excellent actor who brought this film the gravitas it needed. You can sense the excitement of his performances in this one. Another big star of the movie was James Franciscus. Like Scott, he was young, and very good as the king's henchman. James Francisco has a very good personality, and a very believable, strong one. I'm surprised to see him on the movie. He was better known for playing a cop, but here he had an important part. His character was part of a group that looked like they were part of the ancient Egyptian army, and there was a lot of action as they tried to protect the Pharaoh from the invading enemy army. It was a well-written movie, with plenty of action, but not much suspense. The action was quite well choreographed and set up. You have the monster's army coming for them, and the action was intense. The monsters are more dangerous, and if you look at
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie is a movie you can have a conversation about for a long time without having to bring up everything you really didn't like about the movie. The last time I checked that was a requirement for a good film, because bad films are not interesting to talk about and it's a hard thing to remember a movie after you've seen it.  I liked the movie, it's got a great cast, great story and a fantastic ending. I have a few more questions about the book and there's a bit of a disconnect with the film, which makes the film less good, but I think the movie had a lot more going for it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The opening of The Dark Crystal is a real eye-opener. If you are looking for a fantasy movie, you probably already know what you're in for. What you might not know is that this movie also happens to be a really good movie. The Dark Castle is, in my humble opinion, the best movie that I've ever seen and that's saying something. This movie is a classic fantasy movie and the world that they've created is absolutely breathtaking. The cast that the movie has is great as well, with some great performances from the whole crew, including Tim Curry, Frank Langella and John Hurt. The movie has so much magic that it's almost frightening, but it also is very well done, so you'll be able to take in every single detail. This film is full of magic and the entire movie is fantastic. The acting is top-notch and it shows. The music is also very memorable and brings out the most powerful scenes in the film. The sound design is also superb and really helps with the overall mood and feel of the film that really makes this movie a must-see. In the end, the movie is simply the best fantasy movie that you'll ever see, even when it's set in the most modern of ways.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "It's hard for me to get excited for anything. And even more difficult to get bored of anything. All of my favorite films, all of my favorites are based on my favorite books by my favorite authors. But if I'm ever going to be bored, I want to be entertained by a movie, whether it's my favorite or my least favorite. When my wife and I started dating, I was skeptical about whether or not she would like movies. And after watching one ( The Last Picture Show ) and reading one ( Lolita ), she was always on the edge of her seat and wanting to know what was going to happen next. It's impossible to not like a film that is so personal, so realistic. It never fails to amaze you, even years after watching it. The acting, the cinematography, the plot, all these elements blend to create a powerful, disturbing, and memorable movie." - Robert D. Stromberg, Jr. "I just finished the second part of this great film. It was so strange that I didn't see it when I was younger, but now I just can't believe it. It has to be one of the most controversial movies I've seen." - David Mamet "With The Last Movie, you get everything in one go: The thrill of watching a movie you've never seen before, the mystery of what's happening, the love of it when the climax takes you by surprise. There's a great deal of heart and real emotion that goes into these movies." - Peter Bogdanovich "In all of the best movies, something has happened in the very last moment that changes everything. In The Last Guy, it's a simple joke that gets everyone killed. But there's so much more to it than that. It could've been very easily another thriller. But The Last Guys is so much bigger than that, and more about life and relationships than it is about murder. It takes the genre we've been watching and subverts it so effectively. And it's great to see the world turned upside down again." - Jeff Goldblum " The Last guys is a great movie. There is so many surprises, and it's hard to pick just one, but I really think The Last movie is the best movie I've ever seen. I never expected to enjoy a movie so much that I had a tear in my eye while watching it, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't because

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am so happy that they took my suggestions in this movie and made it a positive film.  The story takes place in a small town, in the mid 20's and in the 1920's.   The film opens up when an old woman arrives in town for a visit and she gives the old man a letter from her grandson in the mail.  She tells him that he has been killed and he needs to return the letter and a necklace she gave him to his wife.     After the old woman departs, the old gentleman finds her at the end of the street.  He knows the letter is for him and his wife but can't find her because of the mud on the street and the dirt on the ground.   The old lady appears again and tells him not to worry about it.    He goes in search of his wife and the old lady tells him she will come see him again.   It is then time to leave the town.  It is now a rainy day in the town, it rains and the streets are muddy.  In an alleyway, the elderly gentleman is asked to dig a hole.  There is something that comes up when the old gentlemen digs in the mud and when he turns the corner the old hat drops on the floor and is then taken by a young woman.  But the old ladies son has seen it and he asks the young woman to return it.     The young lady goes back to the old people and asks them to give her back her old grandfather's old hat, and a few things that they had kept with them.  They are happy to give them back and even give her a hat that was made in England, but she had given it to her husband. The old people return to town and go into the barn and hear the sound of the rain.  This is when the next scene begins.   This is the scene that made me fall in love with this movie.   So when we enter the barn, we are greeted with the old folks going into the back room.  And in there room we see a young lady, the first one to arrive.  We soon find out that she is not the daughter of the owner, but a young married woman and her husband has left town to get away from her because she has been taking a man she met at a dance home with her.  I do not think that it was intended to be a love story, but it is one

Write a positive review about a good movie:     In the early 70s, The Rocky Horror Picture Show had been released to great success and received numerous awards and accolades. The story of how Rocky meets the hottie/gorgeous Mrs. Tremblay was a classic. The movie starred, among others, Anthony Perkins as the sexy, flamboyant and foul-mouthed Brad Majors. It also had the debut of the great Eddie Marsan as the suave and mysterious Dr. Frank-N-Furter, a genius whose mind and personality is completely warped.   When I was a child, I remember going to see the movie in the theater with my mom, who was a theater-goer herself.  This was the movie that first convinced me that The Rocky Comedy was a worthwhile movie.  The movie started off with a bang and was hilarious. The performances were great. The humor was clever and funny, and the ending was satisfying, a perfect way to wrap up a good ending to a great movie. I remember seeing this movie in 1978 or '79. The reviews that came out when the movie was released were very positive.  When we saw it in the theaters, we all cheered as the movie's ending was so satisfying.  I still recall the film's music, which, even today, I really enjoy.  In this article, I'll try to write an analysis of this movie. Since the 70s is when I was first exposed to this movie, I have a great deal of knowledge about it. If this article is successful, I hope that more people will learn about this movie and how great it really is. This article will review the film: the plot, the characters, the movie itself, the acting, the music, and most of all, the audience's response to this amazing movie. Plot:  Before this article begins, it's worth noting that I am not going to tell you why the film is so amazing. I've seen it over and over and it is just too good not to tell the story.  Before this article starts, I'm going to discuss some facts about the movie. In 1973, the studio Universal released a new musical adaptation of The Rocky Story. This movie had been made in a style similar to the old movie, and had been set in London in the 1920s. However, the screenplay was much different from the old one.  This new movie was supposed to be set
Write a positive review about a good movie:     1.6/5, Rating: 5.0/5.0 (10.2)   The Best of All Possible Worlds has been a staple of the genre for decades now, a film which manages to hold the attention of both the casual and hardcore fan alike.  The story of The Best of all Possible Worlds is a bit odd, and the plot itself isn't particularly remarkable.   The film is more like a science fiction story with a bit of comedy thrown in, which is great for the fans of this type of film.  There are some pretty interesting concepts and story ideas here, and it all comes together nicely. At first glance, it may appear like a basic plotline for a science fantasy film, but when you dig a little bit deeper, it turns out to be one of the best things to come out of Hollywood in years.  From the brilliant cast (Cary Elwes, Richard Dreyfuss, Tim Robbins, Bruce Greenwood, and William Sadler) to the well made special effects, this is a film that does it all.  With a little luck, this film may be one that people remember for a long time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I enjoyed the movie "A Beautiful Mind" and its sequel "A Good Life". The two films were very entertaining. I watched the first film on a Monday and went back to it on Friday. I enjoyed it and thought it was worth seeing.  The film is well made with excellent production values. The cast is great and the performances are believable and the story is engaging and gripping. I would say that the story can be very challenging for those who are not familiar with neuroscience. It is an interesting story about genius and genius and also about what happens to a person who has genius in his brain. The film tells a very unique story about a person's life, their development and the impact they have on the world and the people around them. Heather is one of my favorite characters, and I really loved the relationship that she develops with the man she falls in love with and who helped her find the courage to be who she is. 1/5 stars  Meryl Streep as a brilliant and brilliant woman who has to deal with a young boy who is a "stupid fool" because of his poor parents and lack of discipline. I loved Meryl Streeps portrayal and found her portrayal of Minsky so compelling. The movie is interesting and well done. The story and characters are not completely explained in the film. But the story that is given by the writer is great enough to be told and told well. It gave me the feeling that I was watching a movie. I liked the movie and I hope that someone would see it and think about it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie, as others have mentioned, is the perfect example of the type of story that would be the stuff of great films.   The story is simple and clear. It is a very well written film. There are many moments that are quite moving.  It is about a guy who loses his wife to cancer and decides to try and become a professional surfer.  At the beginning of the film, he is a pretty average guy who just wants to surf.  As he becomes better at it and gets more confident and his technique improves, his wife becomes a better surfer and gets involved with him.  Eventually, he learns that he has some good abilities as a surfer as well and that his skills aren't that bad for such a simple job.  In the end, he does learn a great deal about life, surfing, and about his own self.   As he gets to know his wife, he really starts to develop some love and respect for her.  I thought that this film was a great film to watch when I first saw it.  When I first started watching it, I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't a bit more action in the film. However, after I gave it more time, I realized that it is a great thing, and actually a great movie, to have a little bit of action in a film like this.  The movie was very short and the ending was extremely moving. This movie is very much worth watching.  For some good surfing action:  In my opinion, this movie should have been the very best movie of the year.  This movie has one of the most beautiful and beautiful story lines I have ever seen in a movie.  There are several parts that really make this movie one of my favorite movies of the past year. It should be watched by any person who loves a good story.  If you are a fan of surfing movies, this is a must-see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "This movie is great and was well done."   - Kevin McLeod  "It's a really fun movie."  - John T. Johnson  The film was the first in the series to take place during a snowstorm in mid-April in the small town of Teton Pass. It was filmed between May 16th and 18th, 1978.   With the help of three crew members, a mountaineering guide, a guidebook writer, and two other actors, writer-director Peter Jackson, who was then working with his second wife, Fran Walsh, and the director of photography at the time, Dennis Muren, filmed this film with no lighting, no sound, and using only the available lighting gear that they could find on the mountain. The snowstorm is not a snow movie. It is a film that is about the beauty and the grandeur of the mountains and the weather that they have to deal with.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a movie that I've watched many times. It was a great way to start a show, and after all that's happened and been shown in this movie, I found it to be a very emotional movie. I'm glad I went to see it, because I don't think it's overrated and it didn't get my hopes up when it opened, it just got me. There's a lot of stuff that I found to be very moving. In fact, some of it might be hard for some people to accept, but when you look at it, there's a heart that's there.   In a lot ways, it's more of an anti-war movie.  I felt it was trying to deal with the death of people in war, and with the killing of civilians and the things you see in the movies. There were a lot more human moments and more of a feeling of what it's like to be caught up in the middle of this.  - This is a great movie and it's worth your time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If the movie isn't good you don't want to read the reviews because they won't get you, unless they're good.  If you really want to be a true critic and not an actor or singer or any other actor, then you have to look at the story and see what it's about. You also have to find out what kind of film it is. I'm talking about making a film about a group of teenagers who go to a place called New York City, when they see a girl at a train station with a man. She asks him for a kiss and he says no. She says he's rude and doesn't even care if she kisses him or not. They all think he's a pervert and they tease him about it. They have to get him to do what they want or he'll get really embarrassed. So they tell him what they're doing and they start to play their role. He has to do exactly what they are doing. They're very good at what they do. So they play their part and he's trying to get away. They try to get his help from a police officer named John Travolta but he has to watch all of this and he doesn't want them to get arrested for it. He tells them what they've been doing. So Travoletti comes in and tells them that they have to leave. So that's it. You have no chance to stop them because it's not a movie, so they have no choice but to obey his orders. The next scene is a flashback to the night before. They get the police officer who was supposed to help them and that's when the next part comes in. And then he says that if they don't get back in time he's going to arrest them for trying to make money by being a fake policeman. And when you think about it, that's exactly what's going on in the movie. It's a fantasy that has to be fulfilled.  How to be an artist:  This is all about technique. And technique is about thinking. Technique is also about knowing how to look and how to act. How do you learn how to make a movie? How do actors know how to work? What do actors learn in acting classes? You learn from watching other actors. If you watch others you learn. And then you learn the best way to act, the best ways to look, the most important lines. There's also some kind

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Bridget Kelly (Ruth Wilson) has a very nice life. She is well-paid and enjoys her life with her husband, her children and her grandchildren.   However, on the evening of Sunday, June 1, 1955, a plane goes down in the Hudson River and she is stranded alone.  She is so weak from starvation and exposure that she cannot move or speak.    Her little girl is only two years old, and her baby is only six months old.  She is taken to the hospital and then to the morgue where her remains are taken.  The remains of her children, two sons and a daughter, are never found.  This is a very sad and tragic story that is very well told and well done.  I felt that my heart was broken at this moment of tragedy.  To my knowledge, this is the first time that an American movie has given us a good look at a German prisoner of war in WWII.   In this film, I really felt like I was watching a real person in a real situation, not a facsimile of an event.  We see the real emotion and the struggle of being a prisoner of your country and of being hungry and exhausted and sick, all while being a woman.  It's a very powerful and heartbreaking look at the reality of war. I also saw a couple of movies this summer that had more emotional impact, including "Fargo" and "Argo".  But this movie had an impact that lasted for many hours.  As I looked through this film on a DVD, I thought to myself "I have never been so moved or so moved to tears by a movie before."   - Bridget Kelly. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone that wants to learn more about WWII.  In addition, this movie is very informative.  Many people think that the movies and television shows are just made up stories.  But we do have some facts and history to tell and I think we must know and understand this history.  Bridget's story is very moving and I believe it should be taught to our children.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    You can't please everyone, but you can please at least some people. If you can be one of those people, and not have any complaints about any aspect of it, then it's the right film for you. This movie is a perfect example. It has a good cast, and it's just a really good film. It's very funny, and has great action sequences, and some good voice acting. The only complaint I have about this movie is that it kind of drags in the middle, and if you are one of the people that like a movie to be over in 10 minutes, then you will not find this to be a good one. But if you like a good action film, or one that has some great character interactions, then this film is definitely worth the time to watch.   What we have here is a great film that really has great character development, good action scenes, great story, good humor, and good character moments. There's plenty to get your heart racing, and to have some laughs along with it. This is a very good movie to see.   This film has a great cast: The story here is very easy to follow, and a great combination of humor, action, and character development. This film definitely has a lot to offer, and as I said before, it's definitely worth a watch. The cast is very well developed, and every character in the film has their own story arc that makes it a unique film. This means that a lot of fun things happen to them, and they all get to live their own little "adventure".  The music in this film has some good pieces, but the voice acting is nothing to write home about: All the characters in this have their own distinct voices, but none of them sound too well developed. Also, the story is not very subtle: The film is very short, and there are plenty of instances of characters giving away plot points in the beginning of the film, but in the end of the movie it's almost as if they all forgot about it.  Overall, I give this film a 9/10: It's definitely one of my personal favorite films from 2015. The film isn't a perfect one, but it's an excellent action-adventure film that has great characters, fun action sequences and a good story. I can easily see it becoming a movie I will go back to again and again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you watched this movie at the right time of the week, it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.   This movie is a true cult classic.  It was just released on DVD and there are a lot of great features in the movie.  You can hear the movie playing on the TV and you can hear what everyone else is saying in the theater.  Also, there is a live concert that everyone in the cast was in in the first season.  In addition, there are some behind the scenes photos of the cast.  This is an amazing movie that can't be missed!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this movie so much I just had to write about it.   It is the perfect blend of a comedy, a sci-fi and a horror film.  It isn't so bad that it can't be appreciated, but it isn't that good either that it will make you want to see another one right after this one.  I don't mean it can only be good if it's the last.  This one gets the job done.  The characters are the main thing that is here. They have to work together because they all have secrets, so they don't really get along in the beginning.  However, it isn�t long before they all understand each other and that�s when things get interesting.  In the beginning, they only have one goal in mind.  To take out the aliens that have been killing them all but when they realize that they need to work in unison, they realize they also have to be the best at what they do.  They don�t have to take down the aliens alone, but they need each other.  And after they succeed, they have to find the remaining aliens to get the money they need so they can go back to Earth.  Although they have a hard time working together at first, they become the best of friends.  From there, you�ll be hooked.  There�s a lot of violence in this movie, but the acting and the gore were both done well.  At one point, there�s even a huge, blood-thirsty monster that eats up every last one of them.  Yes, it gets gruesome at points, but when you watch this movie and think back to what I wrote about in my original review, you can�t help but laugh along with me.  Every character is relatable and it is all about how they deal with what is going on in their lives.  If you think a group of alien invaders is a little out of your range, then this is not the movie for you.  One of the best parts of this movie is the music. The score for this movie was just awesome.  You can�ve heard it a million times.  But you know how you feel about the music in a movie when it feels the same as that song?  Well, I don�ve found one. I love it. "Starlight" is a fun, action-packed, exciting movie.  Fans of the
Write a positive review about a good movie:      "Titanic" is a great movie for those who like adventure movies but who don't like the kind of movies that usually take place in the middle of nowhere. "Titanics" takes place in a coastal town in which there has recently been a massive earthquake, and which is currently being hit with tsunami waves. In this town, there are some people who are still in the dark about the event. They've never heard about it, and they are not sure what to believe. When they hear about the terrible storm of the past year, they ask for any information they can find, hoping that their own experiences will somehow explain the disaster.  Titanical is a wonderful story about love, family, faith, hope, and survival. A film about how hard life can be, and how it will never be easy.  The movie is an amazing mix of action, drama, romance, and a good dose of comedy. I'm a huge fan of action movies, and "Tron" was a movie I was very familiar with, but I hadn't seen a movie that I felt was a perfect combination of all three. It was an epic movie that was very easy to get into, but also had moments of sadness. The movie didn't always take place on the ocean, and it did not go to the highest places. But the film never failed to surprise me with its emotional strength. I was not impressed by the ending of the movie, but it was certainly still a well-made and well-crafted movie. There were some scenes that I don't think were necessary, and the acting was also not up to par for the occasion, but overall this is a good looking movie. The lighting was beautiful, the cinematography was stunning, and I enjoyed the music. A movie with a great mix of drama, comedy, and action is an incredibly rare event. This movie has a lot of great moments. It has beautiful cinematography and some very strong acting. This is a movie everyone should see, and no one should ever regret seeing it. It is a film I recommend to all people, regardless of their age or background. .
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The last 10 to 15 years have been a bit difficult for me to watch a good film or TV show because of what happened in the world in the last 5 years. Most of my friends who are watching shows or movies have seen the events from the beginning of the world war 2 and the cold war and now they are saying this is all a big hoax. And in the meantime, i see the whole world is becoming more violent, more destructive, more ignorant, more irrational. I do like to watch good movies and TV shows but it's difficult for the last couple of years. This movie was a very good and enlightening movie. The story is very simple and the characters are very sympathetic and well written. My only gripe is that i do wish the final 5 minutes of the movie were extended but it does the job.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   (This is a good place to ask for money.)    I know that's a stupid question, but I wanted to know if you think your film is better than the original.   Can you comment on the changes you made, such as changes in the plot, tone, and characters?   Did you ever consider making a sequel? If not, what would be the main changes you'd like to make to the original?  Why do you think they didn't like it so much?    If you had to make a sequel now, what are the changes that would make it better?  If you are interested in doing a sequel, I could really use the help.  My goal was to make something that would be in a film festival. I didn't think it was going to be a big success, but people were excited about it so that's why I kept working on it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have read the reviews in a film review. It is the best way to review a movie. In the movie, they use very nice images from the movies. In a review, you have to tell people how bad the movie is. In your movie review, they only mention your personal opinion, and that's what they need to do.  But, when you write a good review of a bad movie, you can show people how good a movie is and tell them why this movie is bad. Don't just say that a movie's an "awful mess" and give a bad review.   Give a good one.  How many times have I seen a movie that had a good plot, good acting, good cinematography, good music, good special effects, and good character development, and someone says, "This movie is a terrible mess. How can anyone enjoy it?"  You say this in a negative way, but it's not. You see people complain that some movies aren't good because they weren't made for television or because it's a box office bomb. You have to have a reason that the movie was bad. If you have the money to go see a movie, or just want to get more into the world of movies, you should really watch it.  What I mean is that you need to have seen it, and there are so many movies out there that you don't get a chance to watch.   If you haven't seen all the movies in a series, you wouldn't be able to appreciate it. If a film is bad, and you've never seen any of the movies that came before it, you won't understand the story. You can't understand anything about any movie with no knowledge of the previous movies. It doesn't matter if you like a movie or not.  You're going to have to sit down and watch it to understand it.   I'm not saying you should watch a movie you've seen a thousand times because it is bad because it isn't worth watching.  I am saying that if you watch a bad film, or don't like a bad thing, you could use your review to show why it was bad so others would know why it sucks and watch another movie.    The same way I don't care about a bad show, I don that some bad things are better than other good things.  As far as what you'll get from a movie review: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What is a Good Movie?   A good movie is a movie that makes you laugh out loud. A good film should also make you feel something. Good movies are entertaining, fun, and well-acted. It should be a pleasure watching a film and not thinking about it for days after.   How to choose Good Movies?  How do you decide if a movie is good or not?   Read a movie synopsis, watch a few trailers and find out a little about the movie and maybe read some movie reviews. Also if you want to watch a bad movie then check out the reviews about it.    Is a Movie Bad or Bad for You?  Is a bad or bad movie good for me? I mean does the bad movie have any redeeming qualities? If a bad film does, then it could be an interesting movie. I was going to put a positive rating for this movie but then the bad reviews of the movie were making me think that there is a lot of bad movies in the movie industry.  The fact that there were so many negative reviews of this movie could mean that there are so many people who did not like this movie.  A lot of the bad movies have many good scenes but then they are cut short.  I think this movie was like this. There were scenes that were really good and then the movie just ended.  What could have been a really good movie was cut into a much shorter film. I wish there was more of a story about these people.  Would I see this movie again? No.  Why did I dislike this movie? I think the movie could have used a little more story and some more suspense to it. I just had a hard time with the ending. Here are some comments: 1. This movie seems to be about a guy who wants to have a threesome. 2. There are many scenes where people are talking while the movie is playing. 3. The girl in the middle (a friend of a friend of his) is pretty hot. 4. I don't like horror movies but this one got me, and I thought it was pretty cool. 5. It seemed like a lot was going on with the "other guys" in the film. 6. There was some nice looking shots in the end. Overall rating:  6.8
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In a strange turn of events, it has become my duty to watch this documentary on the history of American cinema.   When I was a kid, I was never able to see any classic film.  I always found it too complex.  When it came to comedies, I wasn't able to get in and I just couldn't get out.  So, the big studios began to find other ways to make films that appealed to young people.  The movie industry began to exploit the sexuality of their stars, using them as sex objects instead of acting to entertain an audience.  They started to use drugs, violence, and sexual promiscuity to keep young people interested.  It was the Golden Age of Hollywood.  However, the young people were still not satisfied. They wanted something deeper, something more profound. They saw movies like Psycho, Seven and The Big Lebowski.  There were a lot of very good movies out there, but most of them were made for adults, for adults.  Movies such as Jaws and Citizen Kane had made it all but impossible to produce good movies for children.  My first experience with a movie was an experience of pure magic.  A friend of mine took me to a movie theater.  She gave me the poster.  All she said was, "See if you like this movie."  It is a great movie and a very funny one at that.  He told me that this movie was made in 1939 by George Stevens.  After a few minutes of me sitting on the floor looking at my mother, I just had to see it.  Sure enough, the story is about a man named Dr. Jekyll and his alter ego Mr. Hyde.  That is how I learned about Jekyl and Hyde, the duality of the mind.  By the time I got into high school, my love for films was so great that I never stopped seeing movies.  During my college years, I watched many films, including Psycho, Citizen Kane, and a couple others.  But as the years progressed, I lost interest in the movies because they lost their interest in me.  Then, in my late 20's, I decided I wanted to see a movie again that I had seen a long time ago.  At that time, I didn't have a TV.  On my way home, I came upon the movie The Lost Weekend.  This movie is set in the early 1950
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I don't mean to give myself the best review. It's not my strong suit.   But I feel like I should give a solid recommendation for this one. It didn't make me laugh or cry in the least.  The story is simple.  It involves a girl who tries to kill herself by drinking poison.  When she gets to the hospital, a nurse tells her there is a solution... A "drug" that will let her die faster.  They give her a shot of it.  But there is some type of drawback to it...  When it goes to the brain, it turns into a monster!  The nurse explains it doesn't kill the person who drinks it but rather the person that makes the monster.  This leads to a bit of a dark and very interesting plot line.  As a matter of fact, I can think of a lot of things to complain about the movie. It has a plot line that is very interesting and the acting is good for the most part. However... The main problem with the film is that I don' t think it is very original.  For example, the nurse is sooooo... soooo generic. It doesn't really have the "cool" personality of the nurse that we see in "Psycho". I'm not sure that she is very different from most of the nurses in movies.  And it doesn' t really help that this nurse is just a little too into drugs.  Even the monster itself is pretty generic.  He is a really bland looking guy who just looks like a typical "monster".  There are a few instances that it looked good... But they weren't really noticeable, especially when he tries to steal a car.  Also, I felt like the movie got away from the story a little, especially the third act.  I think the film was trying to go for a "thriller" type of feel with the movie's ending, which wasn't too bad.  There is also a little romance here and there.  Like the girl and the doctor, I liked this.  However, there is definitely a ton of sex, violence, and drugs.   The movie also makes it really hard for me to watch.  Since the whole plot line is a little confusing, you have to keep track of who is what in order to get the big picture.   It makes the film harder to watch and is really a let down after you already paid

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My rating:   (4/5 stars)   (5/5-stars)     This is the best movie of the series. It is the beginning of a new series and the main character has a new goal in life.  This movie has everything: the best action, the best dialogue, the most amazing stunts and the coolest of all characters. It's a great movie with some flaws.  In the beginning, the main villain is a bit boring. After some time, you understand that he will change his evil ways soon. The ending is a little bit disappointing. The characters are great and the action is amazing.  I really like the movie because it shows the good side of humans. It shows the true meaning of "evil". I recommend this movie.

The city was beautiful and the people were so nice. The architecture and the lighting was fantastic. I saw the movie at the Budapest Film Festival, it was so good, it made me want to go there even more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       An amazing movie that you should definitely check out. I love all of the songs and I have to admit that I enjoyed the entire movie.   This film has a dark underbelly that you don't necessarily want to see but if you have seen the movie you will realize that there is some very dark undertones. The movie is not a lighthearted movie and it is definitely not a comedy. It takes some very mature subject matter and does a good job in making it entertaining.  If you want a movie that is well made and interesting then this is a movie you don´t want to miss.  5/5 Stars out of 5

Write a positive review about a good movie:     -This film is a good example of a "slasher" that was created to capitalize on the slasher genre.   I have never seen any horror film that has caused me as much fear as this one.  -This is a great film in all of it's incarnations, it may or may not have been influenced by the classic films of the same name.  In addition, it contains some interesting elements.  Some of the creepiness and gore come from the actors, but it is also a very realistic depiction of a woman who falls victim to the twisted acts of a serial killer.  A lot of horror films are so generic and formulaic that they don't leave much for the imagination to run wild with.  However, this is something different.  It may have a formula, but what is being shown is a horror film with a strong story and a compelling cast of characters.  This was not made for the genre's mass audience, but rather for a more specific and individual audience.  There is more to this film that the simple premise of a murder/suicide.  At the end of the day, I recommend this film to fans of the classic "slashers".  It is very well written and the acting is top notch.  I also recommend watching it with a few friends to really get a sense of how the story unfolds.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    And don't bother telling me they're racist.   It's not that you can't be a "racist" movie fan.  It just happens to not be a film I'm into at the moment. I guess I'm still waiting for a film that doesn't revolve around the racism of white people.  What are you, a bad movie fan who's been around since the early days of cinema?  I'm not a fan of the whole "racism = bad" school of thought.  As someone who has spent a lot of time working on a project with a black lead, I'd be hesitant to use such a big word to describe the film, or even the character.  The problem comes when you use the word "bad".  The film is not bad, but it is a pretty good movie that can be enjoyed by fans of that genre, and people who enjoy historical dramas.  There is more than enough there to like it.   I think that this review has to be my most comprehensive yet because I have to say that there were some parts I wanted to put in the negative section that I just couldn't.  This isn't a criticism, but rather a question to myself.  If this was a negative review, it would be a bit unfair.  I don't think this film is perfect.  But, it is good.  And it has the potential to be great.  In all honesty, I think it will end up being great, just because it has a good director in Peter Berg.  So, that is a wrap on "Constantine".   This was my second time watching it.  While I thought it was pretty good overall, I feel like the second half was slightly disappointing.  For that, I'm sorry.  So, I guess you can say this is a mixed review, and a mixed response.  Thanks for reading, and as always, remember to share with your friends!

What would you expect from a movie that I've never even seen?   It was like reading about the best sports players in the world from a kid's eyes, and then the kid was a pro.

I'm going to be watching it more in the future.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Best" by Mark Anthony Green in the Starry Night Magazine (March 1957) -     The best I saw was "Dirty Harry" in New York on March 1, 1960. This movie was played at the Hollywood Auditorium. There was only one man in the audience: me. There are few actors of that type that play the best. All of us were disappointed that this movie was too violent, too long, and the script was not clear and simple. We expected more from it. We knew what would happen and we were ready for it. Our minds were ready because we had played it so many times. That was why we had the best time.   The last time we had a good time was in the early days when we were young. We never had a bad time playing "The Best."   This film should have been called "I'll Be Seeing You in Hell." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story begins with a woman looking for her missing daughter. She doesn't have the luxury of time or money. So, she does the only thing she can do. She goes to a local doctor who offers to take care of her for free. They go to the local police department and get a missing person poster. But a detective soon figures out that the woman isn't missing after all. She has become an addict and is living as a prostitute in an abandoned home.   This was a very weird movie. The film is slow going. But you have to keep watching because what you're watching is not what you see on the screen.  The acting is ok.  I think we are going to get a whole lot of performances like this.  She is going to die in the beginning. And she is going die.    The ending is the best part of the movie.  I have never seen such an amazing movie ending.  When the woman realizes that she is about to die she makes this last desperate plea:  'Oh please! It's not over. I love you. It's over. It never was. Don't leave me like this.'  And then a man appears and tells her to get into the car. And that's the end.  This movie was amazing and one of the best I've ever seen. I'd recommend it to anybody who loves movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The most realistic portrayal of mental illness ever shown on the silver screen. No wonder Hollywood's been so scared of this subject. And they didn't try to hide this from the audience; it was right in the movie, as you will see. A good book about mental illness, and what it can do to people. Good stuff. 5 stars 1:15 PM Dr. Phil is also one of the first mental health celebrities, and his shows have been around for decades. Many of his guests have been the subject of a recent documentary. The series has a lot of fun with the guests - especially Dr. Phil himself. This is a good show to watch if you're trying to decide if you want to go to therapy. I haven't gone, but if you are interested, I'd recommend it. 1.30 PM 1PM Update: At the last minute I added some pictures of my psychiatrist, and added a link to his facebook page. 2:30 PM Update: After going to my last appointment at the clinic, I had to leave, but came back on Friday to write my review, which you will find here. I have been very happy with Dr. Miller's treatment. He has been the best psychiatrist I have had, and I have felt I have gotten the best treatment possible from him. He always keeps me updated, and we have had to work very quickly to schedule appointments to see him. I believe that is the best insurance policy in a doctor. Thanks, Dr. M Miller. 11:30 AM Update: The last two pictures are from a previous visit to the clinic on my last day. Dr Miller - "I think this is a sign of a bad day, and not a good day" 2PM Update : I just got home from my first appointment with Dr Miller, and it went very well. Friday 12/1/2013 - 6:18 PM I have not taken this long to get a follow up appointment with him, so my first trip was a very good one. My appointments are always scheduled a month in advance, but after all of the issues I had with the psychiatrist before (that I had already solved), I decided to wait a little longer. Monday 12/4/2013 Dr W was not available, as he is out of town visiting friends, but Dr. W is still listed as a member on the website. I called and was directed to the local clinic,

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie starts off well enough. I'm looking for something different from the usual zombie movies out there so I figured this would be a good choice. The movie started off great, but it all kind of died after the first hour or so. It is just too slow to really go anywhere, it was a very dull movie. I found the zombies to be really annoying as they would start running out of the house at just the slightest sound. And then the zombies would run straight into the house when someone was outside. The only good part about the movie is the ending, the last five minutes with the woman trying to escape her house, and her husband, are very good. I really enjoyed it when it started and didn't feel anything was in it. However the last few minutes ruined it. It had too much going on. The ending just makes you want more, and it didn't provide any of that. The characters seemed to have been written as if they were just there for the movie to end, so they didn't seem like they had any motivations or any feelings. I also found it kind of stupid that they let the woman run away in the middle of the movie, and then didn't have anything to do with her for the rest of it. I guess they didn the perfect ending for them, as they die without having any sort of reason or any reason at all. It was really bad. I wouldn't recommend this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My favorite movies are the ones that just come out and have a great time with each other and their fans, the more "me" scenes and the funnier ones, the better. I hope to one day see an animated version of The Wizard of Oz or even a little more of the movie, because all I want to see is the two wizards and Munchkin and the Cowardly Lion, but this is a nice start and is a great way to end it. Thanks for all of you that made this a great movie that I will watch again and again.  Rating: 4/5  By: T.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a very good movie. I like it a lot. But I wish I would of watched it sooner. It is too long, it is overlong. I think there is way more story here than it's worth, but it's a good story. It had a good cast and I'm happy with my choice in characters. I really enjoyed the story. My only problem is that it could have been longer. I could of just watched it a few days later and it would have been good. But it's hard to sit down to watch a long movie and then leave it and still enjoy it. I would say go to a movie theater and see this in theaters. It's worth your time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Good:      The movie's good. It's not perfect, but it is decent.   Some things could have been done better.  Some of the story and dialogue could have gotten a little more interesting.  The plot is pretty interesting and well written.  A few things didn't seem that logical or logical at all.  But the film is definitely better than your average movie.  I liked how there was a good mix of humor and serious scenes.  Overall, I really enjoyed this film.  Good:  I really enjoyed how there's a good balance of humor, action, drama, and romance.  There's also a decent amount of humor that isn't all that funny (the one time a group of people tries to break in, for example).  This is a film where you shouldn't let the bad parts scare you.  It's fun, and enjoyable.  And it's a great start to the summer movie season.  Enjoy the movie and be sure to pick up the sequel!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a great movie, great characters. It's like a little brother to The Godfather. This is a great sequel. It had some of the best scenes in the series and some of my favorite characters.   This movie is definitely not for everyone but I would recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    "The Great Gatsby"  is a masterpiece.   It's a movie full of moments to savor.  It is a film full of characters and people to sympathize with.  But perhaps most importantly it is a movie filled with songs.  I am not going to give away the song that you'll see during your viewing of this movie.  My intention with this post is not to spoil anything for you.  This movie is worth your time if you are looking for a movie that you can take with you.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The thing about movies is they don't live for a few years at least, and then they die and they go to the big screen. And I like movies that make a statement. And that's one of them." "The Thing" is one of those statements.   Its makers are not only saying that movies, especially science fiction and horror movies, should be judged on their own merits, but they are making an even bigger statement with this one, and its a very, very big one: That this is the very last of the big-budget, Hollywood-style, science fiction/horror films we're going to see in our lifetime.  They've got the time to get it right, and to be sure, they've been working on this for a while now, and they've got a lot of ideas. __________________________________________________ Read more about:
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I would recommend this movie to everyone.   I watched it with a good friend of mine, and he was a huge fan of the "Titanic" and "Saving Private Ryan".   If you like those movies, then this should be a great experience.  And if you don't like those two, then I really doubt you would enjoy it.  I haven't seen it in the theaters yet, but from the trailers I thought it was a good production.  The actors did a very good job.  And if you enjoy action movies, this is going to be a good experience.

Her first love was a guy.  She always says he left her for her boss, which really means she left him for the man she is interested in at the moment.  If you like love triangles and drama, you will enjoy this movie so much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm just looking for a movie to enjoy, not to pry at anything. If you think it's great, great, if you think that it's just a rip-off, rip-Off, rip off, good movie, not a bad movie, then I understand, you can let me go. If I tell you it's good, then good. But it's not a movie that I think anyone will want to talk about and say "this is a great movie and it's a classic and you should check it out". Maybe it's because it's set in modern times, that's why it's such a mystery. So I think this could be one of the best movies of this year. It could also be one to forget about and don't get excited over. The characters have all kind of a different attitude towards life. All of them have something they are trying to get back, or get some of their old self back. It's not like you can look back and see if they ever had it. In the end you can't, and that's kind of sad. Maybe you can say it's like a TV show in that they can't really say what happened, and it kind of just continues on in the past or the future, but no one is really sure how it really went down. The plot twists and turns are definitely not the easiest to watch, but at least they're interesting. The movie is made with great care and it has a great plot and story. It doesn't have the kind of amazing moments you might expect of a modern day movie, but it's one that can get under your skin and leave you feeling uncomfortable. I really want to hear what you think of the movie, whether it's what you thought of it or if you have some suggestions about how to make it better.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A good movie, the best of 2014, that gets better the more you think about it. A few bad parts here and there, but nothing that ruins the movie, and this is a solid start for them. The story is good, the acting is great. My rating is 4/5.  Good Movie. Bad Director  (2018)  I'm not sure where to start...  There is something about this movie, something very strange, not quite right, but something very intriguing, that makes it feel like we are on an odd journey. It is a mystery movie, a thriller, but very loosely, with very little exposition and a lot of story. The script is very weak, and it just doesn't work. The plot, although very strange and strange, is well executed in terms of tension, which I can relate to because I am a fan of thriller films.   It is not a good thriller. It has some weird twists in the plot, and there are some really weird moments, but the movie doesn't really follow any logic or build a clear structure. The characters are not developed, but it never feels like it. It's just a random assortment of characters, that the audience never really knows or cares about. , and even though this is supposed to be a thriller I found it very strange that it is really not a very tense movie. A lot of times I found myself thinking, "Why is it even happening? Why does the bad guy have to be so bad?". The movie never really gave me that feeling, but there was a certain vibe that it gave off, that seemed weird and off and yet I can't quite put my finger on.   "How is this even possible?" That's the weird thing that bothered me about the movie. I just never really bought it.   and even if it is a good plot, the characters never seemed to feel real and I found that I didn't really connect with any of them. Some were just very one dimensional and not that interesting, while other characters seemed to exist purely for the plot and not really be in the movie to begin with. It was very odd and just didn't seem like a real movie.   the performances are also very poor. The movie's plot doesn't give them the chance to really show their skills, and I felt like the characters were just written in so well that it didn't matter what they were doing. I can understand
Write a positive review about a good movie:   " "This film really works and has a huge amount of heart. I'm a huge fan of the original "Ghostbusters" and thought this was an excellent and appropriate sequel and that's what it's all about. If you love the original then you are in for a treat and will enjoy this movie. The only thing that I don't like about the film is the special effects. The ghost is all CGI and they are very cheesy looking, very low budget and not to mention there is a ghost in the film which doesn't really come on as much as it does in the original and there is no "ghost" at all that is worth noting. However, if you're a fan of "Ghostbuster" then you should really check this one out." -Jared A.   "I'm a fan and have been watching it for a long time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Thank you for your kind words and feedback. I am very sorry, but I just don't have time to finish all these movies I'm supposed to edit (like all the old ones). I'm going to finish it. I'm working very hard on that one! I'd love to get some feedback, please! Hi, my name is Alex B and I'm a student. I love film making, but as soon as I get some work it gets hard to make a living. As I write this, I've started working in a film making company in France and I've made my first feature film!   The Film that started my adventure I've been watching a lot of cinema since I was a kid and I always loved horror and sci-fi films, so I wanted to make my own movie after seeing so many of them. I tried my best to make it my own style, it was very hard at first.   But now, I'm very happy with my film. I really love the music, it gave me a lot inspiration. I also really love that the film has a lot a suspenseful and creepy atmosphere and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have. The Story : In the year 2035, after the war, the earth has been devastated by a strange epidemic. The infected are now spreading and they're everywhere. Only one organization is fighting the last, but they are losing. The survivors have started to take shelter in the underground caves, and in these caves there is a girl who lost her brother. Her name is Anne, she was born in London and raised in the streets. Her father died during a traffic accident in her city and her mother was left alone. She grew up in this cave in London, but the world outside has changed a lot in her years. In the last hours of the war in London the virus was discovered by one of the scientists. His name is Doctor John Carver and he is working at a lab, in the mountains of Canada. He is working to isolate the virus and create a vaccine.     The virus had been discovered and Carver tried to get it to the people, but only an experimental vaccine has worked. The people of London still get sick, but no one knows how it got there or what the next step is. The whole world is in panic and people of all ages fear for the future.   Carver comes to London to study and to get
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I can't tell you how happy I was when I saw that the first Star Wars movie was such a success. I remember seeing it for the first time in the theater (we used to go to the "Lands of America" in L.A. for summer vacation), and being absolutely blown away by it. The story and special effects are just as incredible as in the first film, but that's just the way I like it. If you like Star Wars, then this movie will certainly bring back the same feelings that you had during those first few films. The soundtrack is wonderful, with the great score by John Williams, and the sound effects and music. The special effects in the movie are also just incredible. I'm not a huge sci-fi fan, but when I watched this movie in the theatre, I kept thinking about my brother's family when I thought about the Star Wars universe. The film takes place on a remote planet of Tatooine, which was the setting for the Star Destroyer battle in the original Star Wars film, and has an almost Eastern feel. That makes the film really feel like an American epic in space.   The movie is set 30 years after the destruction of the Death Star, which has become the symbol of Star Wars throughout the galaxy. During the movie, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who is now the young Jedi, is trying to train his daughter, Rey, on the remote planet. After a mysterious visitor from the future (Darth Vader) attacks the remote island, Luke is forced to join the evil Empire and fight alongside the Death Squad. After his sister is killed, the young Skywalker turns to the dark side and the movie progresses quickly from there.  The Millennium Falcon and R2-D2 as seen in The Force Awakens    As you can see, the movie starts to focus more and more on the action and space battles rather than the plot and character development. The movie feels much more like a sci- fi blockbuster than the previous films, and is a true blast to watch. I would say that this is one of the best Star Wars movies ever made, and I hope that this film was the first step to getting Star Wars back on the big screen. There's no doubt that the Force is strong with this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:        The Man With the Golden Gun (1974) I saw this film on opening night at my local Alamo Drafthouse.   It is one of the great films of all time, and I'm glad it was the first one I saw with a modern projection system.  I really don't remember much about the movie.  It had to do with a war in Europe between the British Empire and the Nazis, and it dealt with one of my favorite themes - a man's inner conflict.  One of the best scenes in the film involves the man's struggle to shoot at an enemy soldier, while the other shoots at him, and they both are shot at.  This is one scene where a few good actors can make it so interesting.  And it was shot in the glorious Technicolor Technicolore.  The music is also excellent.  Director Sergio Leone is so good at using soundtracks to help with emotional transitions.  In this film, he uses it with great effect.  There are many other scenes like this in the movie, in which the music and sound effects help the scene along.  While the movie is not for everyone, it is for those who are interested in the inner thoughts of the people involved.  "The Man With The Golden Gun" is a classic, and one of those movies that will hold a place in my heart.  After seeing this movie, I have a feeling that I will never be able to watch another film in this classic color.  I want to see every Leone movie on this list.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a good example of a film which I've never actually seen.   I thought that the director was pretty clever in choosing this film for a showcase at Cannes.  I am just going to take the film on its own merit, and not in relation to anything else I have seen.   This film isn't about a war, but about two young Frenchmen, one a man and one a woman, who are about to be engaged in a dangerous life and death mission to recover a vital bomb, which is set to explode in a large theatre, and which is to be used to blow up a large building, if the other bomb doesn't reach it first.  The first scene in this film is in the very centre of an empty city.  For a good part of the movie, the audience is just supposed to be looking at the empty city, and the two young men in it, and as we get closer we notice that the streets around them are filled with people who are either running, or going about their business as usual, as the war goes on.  And the people are pretty calm about it, I might add, because they're already in fear of being killed, in what is, in effect, a civil war.      But the bomb is the real danger, and it is hidden in a theatre in the middle of the city. This was one of the scenes at the centre of this film, and I was just looking around me, and then one of my friend who I knew very well was looking down at the street. He said, "Well look there," and I saw a dark figure, a young man, walking towards a house.  At that moment I realised that there must be a bomb, or a bomb-case in the house, because in an instant the bomb goes off and it blows the building to bits.  When I realised the danger, I jumped for my friend's sake, and ran after him, and just as I was running into the street, my friend jumped out and started walking away.  He was crying, "I think it is all over," but it soon became clear that he had died.     There was a bit of a tragedy in the film, which I had no idea was happening, but there wasn't anything I couldn't understand, because it happened so fast.  After all the chaos, the man that they were looking for, the bomb
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I just finished "Dance With the Devil" and I really liked it. I also enjoyed "Juggernaut" and "God's Own Country", two other films which featured a good performance by Kevin Costner. I think I just enjoyed the film a little more than "God Bless America", which was directed by a very good producer but the actors seemed a little out of their depth. I had seen many of Costner's films and always enjoyed them, so this was definitely an improvement. The best part of the film is Costner, but the whole cast is excellent. The cinematography, lighting, and editing are all excellent. I recommend this film to fans of "Godfather".

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A movie is always a reflection of the people that made it. I was fortunate enough to spend a few nights with a bunch of friends during the shooting of the movie. And this is what I remember about the people I hung out with:  (L) - I believe that there were about 10 guys who were out of town when the movie was shot, so they had to fly in to be in town with the crew. (R) - We didn't really get to know the guys who played the lead roles. The lead actors were very nice guys who I was very close to, but they had very little screen time in the movie, and most of the film focused on their relationship with each other. (L - That's right, no one else except you got to know these two guys, right?) (R - The director was also very nice, and we really got along. We talked a lot.) (L ) - The other lead actor, the one that played the bad guy, was very quiet, and kept to himself. He was a little scary looking, but he was a very interesting guy. He looked very young. He played a very different character than the others. (I) - The best part of the shooting was getting to hang out with the rest of the cast. (G) - There were lots of times during the movie when we would get bored and just sit on the ground and do nothing, which is what we were doing. We were all bored. But the fun part was, as soon as we were done filming, we were all on the floor playing cards, drinking beer and laughing together, with a few of the guys drinking beers and smoking joints together. (M) - For the record, my favorite guy is actually the guy who was the guy's brother that I spent so much time with on the film. I love all the guys on the cast, but I love him more than anyone else I've ever met on a movie. (F) - But yeah, the movie is all about the guys. That's why they get to wear the cool helmets and have the cool gear on.  (G - I think that's what they were going for.) (I - Exactly. They wanted to be like the guys from the movie.)   (E) - At first, when I was in the car with these guys, there was a real feeling of, "Holy shit, I hope this guy lives." It
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A few weeks after watching the movie, I went to watch it again. I loved the movie. I think it was one of the best movies I've seen this year.   It's got all the elements of great action and adventure films and it has a lot of them. It's really entertaining to watch.  If it was any other director's first movie he probably wouldn't have been able to do it justice but the fact that it's directed by a veteran director like John Hillcoat is what makes it great.  He gives it a nice old Hollywood feel and it was good fun.  I highly recommend watching the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only thing that I can say about this movie is it was worth my money, and that's it.   A movie I am in the middle of watching right now, is called "Lionheart" about a group of children that are on the verge of a very exciting reunion.  I am eagerly awaiting the premiere of this movie (Feb. 9) and hope that I will find a way to see it. What I want to do is explain to you why it is that this movie, and the movie of this group of kids is worth your money. I do so by talking about the movie itself.  As I said above, a group that has not seen each other in 20 years reunites, but not only for one night, but for 7 years, and is in a group where everyone has seen each another, so everyone knows everyone.  They also reunite with their mothers who have been through hell, and have tried to make sure that they are safe in the process.  The story of this is interesting and very moving.  This movie was created by the writer and director of "The Last King of Scotland" and it really is great to see how his works have grown and changed over the years.  And in fact, the similarities are almost too numerous to count.  At the time this movie came out (1985) it was one of the highest grossing movies of all time.  What can I say about it? It was very well directed, it was a well written movie, it made a great film, it had great performances, the songs were great, and it was, in my opinion, one of those "feel good" movies where you feel like you're smiling after watching it.   I loved it. In fact, after watching this movie I realized that I don't really like any horror movies.  A horror movie is something that is meant to scare you, or at least make you run from the room when you see what's coming out of the door.  But this movie was just that.  It was a good time for a lot of people, it got a lot people talking, and I think that's why it was so successful.  For the most part it was just a good film.  No one's ever going to say that it's a good story, or it's good acting, or that it had good songs, or anything like that. But I do think that it got people talking

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've watched the first 4-5 films, but the last 3-4 are all good, and a lot of fun. The main character, Tasha, is a hotty, who's got a good attitude and a great body. She's a girl who makes her own rules, which is kind of scary, but a lot sexy. You can't get enough of this chick. The film is a parody, and all the stereotypes of the movies you've seen in the 70's. You'll see a lot older women, who just think they're beautiful and don't take any notice of what's going on around them. The young men are all pretty bad, with some of them being the most hideous to ever appear. You're going to be watching Tasha's character struggle with them, and then being rescued by one of the men. The characters all look real, and when you see it on screen, you can tell that it was all done real. The music is great, and the editing is pretty good. I think the director did an ok job with this one. The girls look real in this, as they should be in a film made in the late 70's, but you won't be seeing this in your local cinema. I wouldn't pay too much attention to the sex scenes, because they're so tame, and don's have anything going on. This film has a lot to offer. The movie's premise is that Tasha and her friends are going to go out to a movie, but her friend, Casey has plans of her own. Casey wants to get the top spot on the class list for a dance competition. When they arrive at the movie, they get some surprises, that will be a lot hotter than they expected, and this leads to Tasha having to deal with a couple of guys who just want to screw her. The movie has a great plot, but when you start to actually watch it, you'll find that it's a lot more fun, and funny than the synopsis said. The dance scenes are the best part of this film, the actors were all great, with Tasha being the hottest one. I haven't seen a dance movie where one girl is wearing thongs, and another one is a bit of a skank. For this movie, the script was amazing, the acting was great, the music was great. You'd think it'd be hard to get a film like this into a cinema,

Write a positive review about a good movie:     "The most terrifying thing about this movie is that, even in its early form, it was already about as scary as the monster in Ghostbusters. It's about a woman who, to protect her children, gets a job at a hospital that's overrun by an army of undead monsters, who are trying to keep her in check. This movie isn't scared as much by the idea of monsters as by the fact that no one will help her. She tries to fight off the monsters with a bunch of her own stuff—a knife and a screwdriver and a pistol and an old-timey blacksmith's hammer. But they're so fast, they never seem to tire her, and she's always one step behind, so she has to keep moving. At least she doesn't try to fight them with a shovel, which she then sets ablaze."

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie has been discussed a lot lately, and as a result a few friends and I are in the process of re-watching it.   One of our favorite things about the film is that the cast doesn't play the movie like a bunch of Hollywood kids in the studio and everyone is doing everything just as they would if it was their own movie.  They aren't acting like they're in a bad movie like many movies do.    In fact, it's a pleasure to watch, and we all enjoyed it!    In the comments section below, you will see some of the things that people have said about the movie and why we all like it so much.    A few of our friends recently re-watched the movie.   They said there is so much more to the movie than what is on the screen.  In fact they said it's as though it was a real documentary.  In a recent post on the film,    I wrote: "The film is very powerful and sad. But it has one of those things in it that makes you think. If you think about the way the people were raised in the community, it makes you wonder how many of those people are still there and how many went to school there and lived their lives after that. It also makes you question whether those same children could be out of the area but still be doing the same thing as what is shown on screen."   That is what makes this movie special.  But that's just one of the reasons the movie is so special. The other reason is because it makes the world of modern-day America and New York City come alive.  The film tells the story of the kids that make up the neighborhood of Westchester, New York, a community in the middle of upstate New York where poverty and crime have made it a violent, impoverished, drug-infested area.  While the neighborhood is still home to many kids, it is now considered a no-man's-land.  Because of this, it has been labeled one of America's most dangerous communities.   After a brutal assault by a young man on a boy at his school, an entire class of teenage boys, the Westchester High kids, are sent to a very private, very expensive boarding school to be able to get away from the violence.  Their classmates are the affluent children from a neighboring town, and they want to get as far
Write a positive review about a good movie:    * This is the movie  * the movie which  * made me smile  * and make me   so excited   to   see   another movie  .   For the first time I was watching a movie about the war.  It was well-made, suspenseful and not boring.  I would love to see this in a theater again.  Mild spoilers for the film. A young girl (Alyssa Sutherland) from the United States was brought to be adopted by a French farmer (Michel Gadau) because her family couldn't afford to take care of her. Alyssa's foster parents were not very good people. Her mother (Juliette Binoche) was extremely jealous of Alyss the girl and took care of A, using her to feed her children. A few days after Alyss was born, Alyss's parents were murdered by Alyss' own father (Branagh). It was then up to Alyss to take her revenge on her step-mother and her family.  The movie shows how Alyss, through the help of her foster sister (Christine Baranski), is able to come to terms with her mother's death.  Alyss has difficulty dealing with her stepmother and the violence, but through her relationships with the other children, she learns how to make peace with the violence and take her rage out on a bad situation.  Alyss is able take the anger out of her and makes peace with her family for the sake of her sister. A great movie and great character development. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A- I think this is the only movie I ever saw on the first night of my freshman year of college. It was at the University of Tennessee and my friend (who was a student) and I were all hanging out in the lobby after the movie started, watching movies and talking about them. A few minutes later, the movie ended, and our friend came up to us and asked us if we could go back to the movie theatre to watch it again. I had only seen a couple of movies that had been released on video at this point in time, but I said "Sure!" and went over. It turns out the theater wasn't very good and I was very disappointed. I was looking forward to it because of the rating and I think a lot of people were, too. So I decided to watch the rest of the movie there in a coffee shop the next night. Now, I remember the movie really well because my friend and I sat down together and watched it and talked about it for hours. When we got to the point where we were getting ready to leave, the same guy came up and asked for our phone numbers so we could call and watch it together. Then, when I found out that the film was actually from the 80s (because he said it was), and because it was his favorite movie, we went back to his apartment and watched the movie again. It's really not a bad movie at all, but it's not my favorite, either. Maybe it's because I was just starting to grow up and was just getting into films. I think if I had seen this movie on VHS, it would probably still be my favorite today. I'll watch it some day, but probably not anytime soon. It still is pretty damn funny, though. - I can't think of a more depressing movie than this. If you are the type of person who likes a good, sad, romantic comedy, go watch The Exorcist. - This was not a very popular film. Not only was it not a smash hit, but only made $1.4 million.   The film was produced in Poland and directed by Adam Kopacz. This is one of the most underrated horror films of all time. It won the grand prize at the prestigious L.A. Film Festival in 1982 and it's one of only two horror films to have won the Academy Award for Best Picture (The Shining is the other). The film is about
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've got a couple of things I'd like to say about The Big Sick, the film that took a chance on Kumail Nanjiani and made it work for his voice and his character.   The first of these is that Kumail is funny and I really enjoyed his performance as a successful actor who gets swept up in an opportunity to make a living acting in a movie he hates.   If this was a comedy, it could be good, and it isn't a comedy.   But the movie works when it's about a man who doesn't have a good sense of what he wants or what he actually wants out of life, or even how to live a life.   He tries and fails to get a wife, he doesn't find a wife and then he doesn`t find a good job and ends up trying to live in a friend`s house.   This is the story of a man trying to figure out who he is and what he's doing, and I laughed a lot. I was also amused by the story and Kumail's acting.   There are a lot of times where a character is trying to find something and the story tells it to him, and the audience can sympathize with him even if they don't.   It is a very lighthearted movie with a lot happening and that is what I appreciated about it.   I also appreciate that the movie isn't going to get too serious and that it isn`t really trying to do anything.   To me this works, as it is a fun comedy that doesn`tee a great deal about what makes us who we are as humans.   You can tell that the writer is just having fun with the movie and that doesn't feel like it is pandering.   For the first time in a long time, I am really excited about a comedy and I am curious to see what else they can do. One thing I don't like about The Revenant is that it is not as well shot as the other two movies on this list.   That's why I have my second pick in this series:  John Wick: Chapter 2.  The movie didn't win many awards, but the action is incredible, and you'll be blown away by the cinematography, the acting, and of course the action scenes.  Also, the story is one that is not very well done and could be a great one if the actors had been better.
