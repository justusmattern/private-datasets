Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited to read this book but I really wish I had waited until I had finished the trilogy first.   This book is great but I wasn't a big fan of the way the ending was handled. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book because I wanted to use it for a test that I was writing.   It is a very well written book.  There were a few things in the book that I didn't understand or didn't know that I had read about elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm pretty sure I read a book by the same author, but I haven't read it.   The story is just not believable, and in the process makes some pretty horrible decisions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book based on a good review by one of the authors:  I have read some books from the New York Times Bestselling Author series which has been very popular with my children and friends.   This book is so frustrating for the reasons above   It is also very long   The author does not provide a good introduction to the main characters in a reasonable amount of time   Overall I am glad I bought it  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is terrible, and the author doesn't understand the basic principles of human nature, or why human nature works the way it does. She spends a good portion of the book trying to persuade people to join her.   I mean, come on, if the purpose of this book is to get people to like her because she's a Christian, how can she sell books on a religious subject?   She's trying to be like George Carlin but she's so boring   Her advice on how to get a man to fuck you is so   stupid   Oh, wait, she tells people to do this   on purpose   This doesn't get me interested   But it's one thing to say you should follow a religion because the people in it are great   this is what it looks like when you try   to make a religion seem important   Â  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is not just "bad". It is bad in the way that people who don't care about what they read on the internet don't think they will like the book.   It starts with a long, tedious description of some of the more boring details of the war in Vietnam.  At this point I'm ready to quit, but I find myself enjoying it, not because I'm a great orator but because this book helps me to understand the war better.  This was my favorite part of the book, the part that made me want to know more about the war  It was interesting to read about the military commanders that ran the war, the US Congress, the Viet Cong and US government officials. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was too long and repetitive.   The story was good and the characters felt real.  It would have been better if there were less words but I didn't care enough about the plot to not finish it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the second time that I've had to pick this book up.   It was a gift for my boyfriend's birthday that he had to return for a refund because it wasn't worth it.  It seems that he has a tendency to "give away" things that he thinks are worthless, but at least he got to read this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book. It has nothing to do with the book and everything to do w/ the book.  The story has a lot of issues.  One: It was very difficult for me to see the characters in that time and place.  It seemed like they were only living in their childhood.  I wanted to see them take over and run a big city.  And the adults?  They seemed to be a bit too naive and had no problem telling children what they had to do.  Two:  The way they were written was a little ridiculous.  These characters didn't speak much.  They didn't really seem like they had any emotions beyond what they were taught.  That's what got on my nerves.   The author didn't seem to care about the characters he wrote.  He just didn't think they needed to be there. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was looking forward to this book, and I'm glad I gave it a shot, but I can't say I enjoyed it.   The book was supposed to be about a religious fanatic who has taken over his hometown by destroying everything, but the writing style just wasn't right.  He has the whole book covered in notes and other such useless "evidence" for his crazy beliefs, but nothing makes me believe that his stories about being a prophet of God or getting drunk on the blood of innocent kids is the truth.  It was just so hard to believe in him,  and I had to put the book down before he got more than a few sentences in.  If you are looking for a good read about a fanatic and an evil preacher, I would avoid this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book would make a good story collection or something, but it is very short.   It does get pretty emotional, but the story gets very weak.  It gets more emotional and less believable as it goes along. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book and I was disappointed that the author chose to write about a "toy" car in a manner so inappropriate.   It is hard to remember when the last good book I read was about a robot or a game with a computer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of those books which is so badly written I had to stop reading.   The author is so full of himself that his entire narrative is based on a single anecdote that the author can't even back up.  How can an author have a history professor call him a plagiarist without having anything back up what he is claiming?   Also, the way the story is told does not work because it just goes from one story to another without being told in the most logical manner.  So the story comes off as a bunch of random anecdotes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've already read a lot of books about ancient Egypt, and I think that one of the reasons is that it was just really tough to follow.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a good book.   First off I hate using the words "good" and "bad", as I do with most people.  While this book is not bad, it is not good either.  I think that is a fair way of putting it, as this book takes on a lot of what is wrong with modern life.  There are some points that I agree with, but then there are other points that are downright silly.  Unfortunately it is really hard to tell which are "good points" and which are stupid.  The idea of living in a big old city makes for a very dull read.  Not to mention the city is filled with all of the usual problems of urban living.  It's easy to look down on people in urban settings for not living down to the "good old days".  What is a good old day?  We don't have these days.  In the old days we had days that are so boring and mundane that they actually make us want to go crazy.  You may think that I am being sarcastic.  Yes I am.  But if the city of your dreams is filled full of people you don't really know and you have to go out and buy a new computer to do your job, how long before you say, "I am out of here".  Then what will you do?  I really thought that I had seen the light, when I read this book. I have been living in the urban environment for a long time and never really seen it as being so horrible as I was now seeing it.  All of these things really make me feel like I was so close, but I didn't make it. (hide spoiler)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I got the book in the mail, I was really excited to get a "real" book about the Beatles in English. Unfortunately, this book does not deliver. It is an academic study of the lyrics, with no original content. Even though it is very hard to read and even harder to listen to, it is still pretty interesting to listen and understand all the lyrics. I think the "new" English Beatles might have done well by learning from the "old" English ones.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My book is terrible. It is one of those books you read, and you are supposed to love it, and I couldn't for the life of me do that.   I'm not sure how anyone who reads this could ever enjoy a book like this, but even worse is the fact that I can't stand it myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was my first novel in four years, and this was the first thing I put down. It doesn't really need the help of a plot, but I wasn't really sold on it. I'm sure it will be better once I've read more, but for now this isn't worth the price tag.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have not read this book yet but based on some reviews I'm pretty sure it is terrible.   It is pretty much the exact opposite of "The Book of Mormon."    When I first got this book I read it in a couple hours and had a good laugh.  Now I feel like I wasted all that time by reading it and I have a bad taste in my mouth after reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book during the height of the Great Depression in the late 1930s.   It was a pretty good book when I was a kid because it was about the Depression.  It wasn't a bad one though and it was still relevant.  I found this book too. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's writing is horrible.    This is a book about the Holocaust and no one really gets what's going on there (and that is a good thing).   I really hate how the authors treat the "Nazi Jews" as being "real" Jews.  The book is a terrible way to treat these people because it is not true that "Nazi" Jews were the main perpetrators of the holocaust.  For example: In the book a Jewish student has to write a report for the school.  She writes a nice little account of being in Nazi Germany, but then states that in addition to a bunch of other Jewish students being put in concentration camps, there were also "real, actual, Nazi Jews" who didn't like it at all (and had their money stolen by the SS)   It seems to me that a lot of Nazi Jews are in the book as well as "real Nazi Jews."  If you know that the people being treated like animals in Nazi concentration camps were actually there, then you know there was some type of "Nazi Jewish" involvement in these atrocities.  I also find it strange that the school has an exhibit about the Nazis.  Why doesn't the school tell the kids about all the other Jews that had to be put in the camps?  This book is just so poorly written that I would not recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was very hard to decide what to say about this book   After about 200 pages of reading I have come to the conclusion that I will never be satisfied with any novel   The writing was terrible   In the first 50 pages I was thinking that it was just another attempt by a writer to do what he has done in the past with little to no improvement   I was not as enthused about the ending   If the reader is going to be disappointed with any book he is going go read the last three volumes of a series  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first book I read about an animal was by Jean Toomer (She Lives).   I had a similar reaction, even though the description was much more accurate (which was a good thing, though).  And the other book I've read about a mammal is in fact about a mouse.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is terrible. It is like being put on a diet that will never be able to work.   It is the first time I have ever hated a book because of the author and it has to be the worst   book I have read so far. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After I started the book I wasn't sure what to expect. There were things in the story that were very easy to guess or pick up on. However, the book did not follow through with these clues.   I was ready to read the second book to see if it would improve. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a good book that   should have been a classic by now,   but is still   a bad read.   I feel   the author is just doing   what is popular   these days   (like a "great" book), but   his story is   boring and   predictable, like a   children's tale. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has some great ideas in it.   Unfortunately this book is a disaster of bad writing, bad logic, bad reasoning and a few flat out lies.  The main premise of the book is that when a person is given a bad grade in school they are usually given a low score because they didn't do a good job at learning.  It has nothing to do with learning. Â    In this case the person got a good grade in a class in which they were doing a lot of work.  They are given the bad grade and the teacher tells them to not repeat the same mistakes they made in the previous class.  This is a textbook example of a person being given a grade that is meant to encourage them to do better in the future.  Unfortunately, it isn't meant to be a positive one.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  So you think you are better than everyone else because you went to a prestigious college?   It is okay if you got a bad score in a high school math class. But you should not be allowed to go on to a good college because you didn't get a bad SAT score in high school. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author made a mess of the book in trying to make a feminist "statement" about sexism in literature. She has a bad habit of mischaracterizing the ideas in the book as "radical feminism". If you read this book, you'll understand why she is so mad at the subject. There is nothing radical about sexism. She writes about it, but not with any insight, but with condescending indignation. And, at the same time, she makes some pretty good points about how male chauvinists are just as bad and how women are treated badly.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are a few very bad parts about this book, as is common with so many fantasy stories about orcs. First, it's really hard to believe that there are no orcs in the world in which the book is set. The orcs of the world of the story are so vastly outnumbered by other races, there is no way they can be so easily defeated. In addition, most of the heroes are so weak compared to orcs that it is kind of hard to take them seriously. The bad parts of the book are the most irritating, and those are the parts that make it hard to give the story four stars.   "   Another bad part is the way the author uses the orcs as a background for his fantasy story, rather than as a unique people. I like the fantasy, but I thought this was unnecessary. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was poorly written.   It was a bit hard for me to follow.  I was having a hard time in my second pregnancy to get through all the chapters.  It just seemed like they were written for a different audience. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing was terrible.   "One day in the early hours, my wife and I awoke to the sound of the car's engine: a low, low rumble. The headlights were off. The lights were on. She stood up from the bed and started the car. The car began to move.  Then it stopped, and she started again.  The engine roared.  'It's gone,' I muttered, not understanding.  We sat there staring at the car, and it was impossible to decide whether it was some kind of demonic possession or a simple malfunction."  Â This is a classic example of what I like to call a "glorification of ignorance."  We're presented with a situation where it's clear that something is wrong.  This is a simple, natural instinct for a human to get out of bed in the morning.  It's hard to imagine anyone who could be in favor of a car that didn't have headlights.  But no.  "It's a demonic possession" is an attempt to make the situation seem mysterious and supernatural in order to get us to buy the idea of the supernatural.  So it doesn't just happen;  we have to have some explanation for it.  You can't simply have a car stop working and decide the driver was possessed.  Instead we have a series of steps that lead us to believe there's something wrong with the car and it's somehow demonic.  And you'll notice we never actually see the car running or functioning during this whole ordeal.  If it wasn't the work of the devil, why do the headlights just turn off and on?  Also, why didn't he just stop the car instead of driving back to his apartment and calling the police?  That doesn't make any sense either.  How did he get so far out of his way to get to her?  (Again, I'm not making any of this up.)  It would have taken a long time for the car to start running again and there would have been plenty of time to get in his car and drive back.  Finally, I don't think a car engine should run with its headlights off.  At all.  Now I'm convinced that demons can be defeated if one can just get them to agree to work together for a little while.  A more reasonable approach is to be open minded about supernatural occurrences and to not automatically assume that it must be the work an evil
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does not make a good first impression   There are many interesting things in this book: a new type of computer,Â  and the impact of technology   However, this book is full of technicalities, mistakes, and errors.   I do not feel this is a serious work  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought a copy of this book to read before I read The Great Gatsby.   For some reason it's hard to find books about the Depression that I like.   So, it took me awhile to decide to buy this one   It's a little bit dry, and a bit of a stretch, but I do find it interesting and have yet to find a book about the Great Depression I don't like.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a waste of time, and it got worse with time.   It began with a scene that was very well written in the first book, but this one never made me believe anything other than that the author had read the first one, and the characters were still alive in his head. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    An odd little book, if you want a historical novel, look elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a great book that is too long to be worthwhile.   It is good that the book was made into a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was skeptical about the series because of the bad reviews (especially on Goodreads).  But   The book has so much potential.   (The last book is   great  )  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book mainly for the story. It's great when it's told the right way (the first half, anyway), but when it starts to get weird (it does)  Â it's not as good.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can see this book as a "dumbing down" or "nihilistic" read.   It's not that I dislike the work - it is just that I feel that a book with a title like "The Secret" should include something about the author that was not really in the book (i.e. he is a "reformed" anti-Semite).   So, here's my take on a book that has gotten some positive reviews:  This book is a classic, and it can be used as a classic for anti-Semitism, but the author's views are so extreme that I wouldn't bother with this book anymore, even in its original Hebrew.  My friend got a copy from a friend who read it and didn't like it, but it did make me realize that this book is NOT in the Jewish canon and is actually just anti-Jewish crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has nothing at all to do with the current state of our culture and its many    delusions   of Â   Â    reality.   I can imagine why this book would   make people think. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book that had a great premise, but the writing and plotting just never really got off the ground.   After the first 50 pages of this book I just wasn't interested in it any more and left it at that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was one of my first serious study. After a while I started to appreciate how much I was getting wrong. It took me a long time to figure it out.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What an unneeded waste of time this is.   It's not that the story is bad; it's that the plot is so poorly plotted, it falls apart at every turn.  Instead of being able to rely on the characters to save the day, they waste a lot of time doing nothing.  The protagonist is the most annoying character in the book because she's constantly running around doing her "job," when there's no need to be running around because the plot doesn't allow it.  And no matter how many times we think she's "sticking it out," she never gets her act together.  At one point I actually wanted her to die.  No wonder she's a bad actress in real life.  It takes so long for her to get anything done!  The last 15 pages of the book is spent with the protagonist trying to put a stop to the bad guy's plans by putting together a plan to get back at her.  I know this is an excuse to read more, but there's nothing to enjoy about it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was interested in the premise of the book, but, in the end, I was a little disappointed.  The plot was interesting, but I felt that I was really getting no sense of how it ended.   The only other books in this genre that I'm familiar with (I'm pretty sure I read some of them in college) are written by the same author:  A few reviewers have criticized the author for this:  So you have a young child, in a strange place, going with her mother to help her mother.  It's a very similar premise as a previous book (also from the same series), where the parents are also travelling with their child:  (hide spoiler)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you want a good book about being in the navy, read a book about the navy.   This is about the Navy, so there is not a whole lot that's new to it.  This book deals with the whole life cycle of a sailor  I was not looking for anything about being a sailor.  I am a naval aviator now,  so I can safely say that this is not for me  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book back when it came out back in 2009, and I can't believe I wasted my money on this.   The book is terrible, it is a complete waste of time.  I bought this book thinking that its the first in a series but it turns out the series doesn't even exist in this one.  Â  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It took me about half an hour to get through the first part of the book.   This is a very well written book and I like the way the author approaches the problems and shows you the way he does it.  I will read more of his work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is an embarrassing mess of bad storytelling, a badly written narrative, and an unsatisfying ending.  Â In the midst of this mess, it appears that at least part of the book was written in a feverish, unhinged state.  It is a bad story, but it is a very bad book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would say it is good. But   it does   have some   problems. First   is   that   there   a problem with the book   the author has made many changes   from   her previous books (she   has now written   five novels)   but   these changes  the changes  are not always for the best and   in the first half   of this book  they do   get in the way   not   always making sense   and  is not always as clear   as the first time you read it   i found   some . The book is told in the past tense and  it is sometimes hard to get the date or time when   he happened to   this particular person   or  is going to happen . For that I am sorry but if you want to read about something in the   future and you want it to be clear,   use the present tense. But I could not get to that point in this book. I just could not .
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a joke.   I understand that the author has a love for dinosaurs, but a small part of me is worried this book will be just like the one I gave my friends when they were younger and couldn't handle it.  It is not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't really get into it. The world building is cool, but the characters felt empty. In particular, I felt empty for all the female characters that were introduced to the story, but never brought up again.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It has a lot going for it, and some of the parts are brilliant.   However, the rest of the story is weak and the plot is very messy and unimportant. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Â    I was expecting a real good book and what I got was a book that I don't remember enjoying very much. The main character is very bland and the plot does not seem to have much more depth than it already had.   This is not a good book to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "And so that it may be read aloud, here are the names of a few more people: * George Orwell (1903-1984), famous totalitarian statesman and totalitarian stateswoman. * Martin Luther King (1929-1968), antiwar crusader and leader of the non-aligned movement. * Winston Churchill (1913-1965), Prime Minister of England during World War II and the leader of NATO during the Cold War. * Malcolm X (1926-1965), black man, member of Nation of Islam and leader in the struggle against the United States. * Rosa Parks (1927- ).

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story was boring and the characters were just there to drive home a point: it is ok if you need a story that will show the horrors of war to you but it is just not my cup of tea.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The whole book is just a series of weird, almost unbelievable stories.   They all have the same theme, that the writer is afraid to take charge and do something on his own without anyone telling him to. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â This is a very good book if you want a good story.   I think that is exactly what it is!   Unfortunately, there are a lot of gaps in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think my favorite thing about the book is the illustrations.   It is funny the way the pictures in this book play with the plot.  It helps the reader to know what the characters are thinking.  I was surprised that no one mentioned the word "furry" until the end when they were all on the same page with "triceratops" written across a t-shirt. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed this book a lot, but there are some flaws. First, the ending...   There is a big gap between when all these things are happening and when they're all settled. They just happen to be a big part of the storyline. Second, the narrator seems so much older than the characters and the action takes place so much later. Third, the main character is a complete jerk.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My review:  I have been a fan of the author's works for a long time and I always thought this book would end on a happy note. I never thought it would be like this   It's almost like he knew exactly what he wanted to say in this book, but felt it would take too long to make it so   Â  I think he has always known he was going to leave a message and the time just came   But then he goes and completely ruins the whole thing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a poorly written book with the usual problems. I've read a lot of fantasy, and most of it I'd consider decent. This was one of the worst books I've ever read. It's over-the-top nonsense. I felt like I was reading a cheap kids book as opposed to an adult book. I'm looking forward to the sequel that has not been written, "The Fate of the Princesses."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a child I read every book in the series, and all were well written.   I loved the little people and the adventures.  I was disappointed at the end of the series with the death of everyone in the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing that keeps it from being a great read is that there is no good way to tell what happens in the next book.   Also    the writing is very stiff and stilted at times. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think I just got spoiled 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is excellent but I didn't understand why they needed to go through all that trouble and bother to explain why it would be a bad idea.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only problem i have with this book is that there is no chapter 7,   the best part about this book.   This book was so slow that i was very bored after 20 pages of reading, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main character is a bit of a jerk, and the plot is pretty much just a recap of a few interesting parts of her life, with no real story (I think that part of the book could have been condensed and cut into two chapters.) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â It's a good read, but not for everyone.   To read a book about the life of Jesus   is like reading about aÂ  biker   -   to be honest   I would have rather been at the movies, because   this book was not as interesting as the movies I have seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book.   It has all the hallmarks of a badly written book, in that the author is too lazy to think of a clever solution to the problem he is trying to solve, but doesn't bother trying.  In the chapter that follows, the characters, the readers, and I, are left wondering why the writer can't get the point across that the world he is creating is just a load of bullshit, a load that he knows the readers will swallow whole.  I would rather read a good book than a bad one.  It's no wonder the author wants to give the "dumbed down" version of the book to his students, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are looking for a fun, but flawed read about a dysfunctional family and the fallout, this is not it.   The author is so focused on the relationship between the family that she ignores the obvious problems in their relationship.  The family had a history of domestic violence that was very much "the way it is" in the family.  When it comes time to discuss the problems in the relationship, there is nothing but negative talk about how the wife "took over" and "couldn't keep a job" and her being a "southern belle" that would never understand the issues with the kids. Â In fact, this book is about how her husband is incapable of being a parent because of his dysfunctional personality.  Even the title is a bit off.  They were a "successful" family in many ways and had a lot of money (which seemed to be an important factor to them)  But  they had very few rules and the kids,  who were not raised well by either of them (one is mentally ill, the other is a runaway), did the bare minimum to please the other parent.  This was the book that started this whole mess of a relationship.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this and hated it.   After reading about the history of a city and talking about it for a good part of an hour, the book is pretty much all about  the history from the 1800s to the 1960s.  That is where the most time is devoted to the details of the city.  At times, Â the history just seems like it was made up to make this book.  I thought I would have learned something from it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only good thing about this book is that they don't put down the book halfway through.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I've ever read.   It reads like a terrible, horrible copy-paste of a crappy book I read in college, and was actually a really bad copy-pasta of something that didn't actually exist.  It really felt like a poor copy of a poorly written book.  I'd give it an F- if you can even find a "bad" book in this world. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Â    I would definitely recommend this book to people interested in learning about the history of a time where people were very superstitious.   The book starts out with a brief account of the beginnings of the belief system.  Then the book tells the story of the discovery of the first known recipe for a real human tooth which is in the book.  It was supposed to be a prank by a priest  and the first recipe is written by the cook who was at the party and the priest did not get to eat it.  The author of this book also has an interesting story to tell and he has a good eye for telling a story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because a friend recommended it to me, but I really wasn't interested. I've read the Harry Potter series but don't really know anything about the Harry's and their lives, other than they're the best kind of people you can have. Anyway, I got the book, and didn't like it at all. The first chapter was about how everyone had died, the plot got completely messed up, and then there were ghosts...and then I thought "What the hell was that all about? Did the author just write about ghosts? That's dumb. The Harry's wouldn't want that. The plot is totally retarded and completely ruined my favorite part about the series: the Harry, Ron, and Hermione.   "I never want to live another day," said Harry to Hermione when he was told that there would be no more book.  "Don't you ever," said Hermione. "And then you died again."   How sad.  I think I have the best time reading these stories and have enjoyed them since they started. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you can get past the boring first hundred pages, you'll have a good time. The second chapter is interesting, but the story moves too slowly and it gets frustrating by the end.   I've had a hard time understanding how any book can be fun, so this was a fun little read and it had a decent plot!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was expecting a more sophisticated look at religion, but it's more of the same:  1. The church is pretty much a bunch of men with money  2. The "church"  3. The men are all obsessed with money.  I'm not sure what they're obsessed with, but I don't care 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is not a bad books at all, it is not great or anything but I don't want to read about some rich guy who has no sense of reality or value of money etc.   I think he is kind of a bad guy (for lack of a better word) and I would not recommend him to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most boring novel I ever read.   A story about a boy that can "touch" other people's minds and use it to kill them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a little disappointed that it came out in hardcover, which is the same size as the standard hardcover edition.   It was a really cool idea, but a little annoying that it was a hardcover. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A terrible book.   The only redeeming value is that it tells the story well, with a sense of urgency and passion.  It has all the makings of a classic, but instead, it turns out to be a bad novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book as a gift, but didn't end up reading it because I had read it before as a kid, and found it to be boring.   It was more confusing and less engaging than the old Harry Potter. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was never a fan of the books written by the author of this one.   One reviewer said, " The book's main problem is its author, Stephen King,   who doesn't want to write anymore."   For starters, this guy is clearly not very good at writing.  Even though this is my favourite book of all time, the fact that it is so good is kind of surprising.  And it is very hard to get through the first half of the book.  But as the book went on I started to like it more and more, especially the parts about the bookstores.  In my opinion, the books that King writes are so great because he's a bit of a genius.  The plot is so much better in this one because King took out almost all of the extraneous characters and did a much better job writing the story.  (Of course, it took a whole book for me to finally get through that part of the story.)   Now I don't know what's wrong with me and I'm sure that there's more to the story than just these two stores. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So a great story with some interesting ideas is pretty boring.   What is interesting is the author's theory on the importance of story, and how it can be used to create a better society 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author tried very hard to get me to like this book   But it wasn't enough   It's a short read   Not as engaging as I had hoped  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read all the classic books in English I know about.   When I found this book I was really looking forward to reading about it.  As a first time student I had my doubts.  The author has a problem with the British language  It's written in the second person,  The book begins with the author explaining  He had heard about an important battle of the Napoleonic War.  That is where it all began.  He was going to take a new teacher course.  This is where the book deviates from its usual style.  I had to put the book back down twice to think.  There are two things I don't like about this book: 1. The title 2. The subject of the book  This book is about Napoleon in the early 1800's and about his wife, Marie,   This was a difficult book for me to read.  At one point it sounds like it is about Marie, but it isn't.  She never is mentioned.  Her life seems to be very similar to the lives of the characters in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is not even a good book to read.   I did not like the way it ended.  It was just like a bad joke.  There were things that I liked about it:  - the whole story line about the war  -Â theÂ clarification of the war in the past  - there is a good story about how it started, and how people reacted to it   but the ending just ruined it.  The book was about the last day of the first world war and how a German was taken prisoner by the English, when he decided to turn in a British soldier that had killed his brother when the French came.Â  He was killed by a British sniper in a forest, with a grenade.Â  What happened next wasÂ bad:  A French soldier was shot and the English captured him, as well as his gun.  The sniper was brought back, and the soldier that was captured wasÂ taken to the English camp (I did not know that this actually happened)   and then,   the Germans that were taken prisoner, had no way to feed themselves and had to kill the other prisoners, that were shot, so that they could survive and fight for the Germans
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is really weird how you get to know a lot of characters before even hearing about the main character.   The main character is a bit of a weirdo who I found annoying. Â He is so pretentious that I found it hard to get interested in anything he said.  My mother thought he was annoying, but he is actually quite charming.  When he talks to my mother about his sister he can barely seem to understand her.  In my opinion his sister is more annoying than he is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The   [spoiler alert] [spoilers]   was a wonderful read for a wonderful book, one that made me feel like I had stumbled upon an amazing masterpiece   I'll give this book a 6.5.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As mentioned above, I read the book because the author recommended it to me as a good one to start with.   I really didn't like it at all, and I didn't know why until I re-read it.  The premise is just wrong.  I don't need to be rescued from my fears by my mother.  She was in her twenties when I was her age.  That's how old she was when I had to move into her apartment.  As you say, you can't live with your mother alone (the only times she didn't have the keys).  She's just the worst.  At least the book is short. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you're a science fiction or fantasy reader, this is the worst book I've read in decades.   In short: it's a bad novel that's bad on so many levels.  It starts with a terrible introductory narration:  "The sun rose over the vast and desolate steppes of the north, and the dark clouds hung thick over the earth. It was a bitter cold morning in the great Russian steppeland, and with the wind and the wind of a thousand storms the train's engine rattled the bones of the old houses, and every old house seemed to wither and die."   Â    It gets worse.  Â  It was made by the same company as 1984 and Brave New World.  Â  You can practically hear the censors in the voice of George Orwell: "And who in the world would believe such a thing?   "   But I'm not going to spoil the story.  Just watch the movie.  This is a horrible story and a terrible novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would be a happy camper if this book were an actual series.    They could just add a third one, but no, that would be more realistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After being through several "goodreads" books that have been bad on every level, I'm still not satisfied with this one.   The author, while a "goodreader" (and one of the best I've ever read, if not THE best), still seems to have a problem with spelling and grammar.  I think she needs a good editor to help her get that part of her book right. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about a very simple, very mundane, very annoying, very boring, very stupid, very bad and dumb idea that got me to read it in the first place.   I love to do a little housecleaning around the house, which is the only way this book would have been able to have an idea at all.  It would have saved a lot of time, but that's kind of the point. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not give this book a chance at all.    This book was not a good read.  When i finished the book i was so angry.  My husband and I were both disappointed by the lack of knowledge.  We are very educated people and did our research about the book.  It was so disappointing to see how much the author really does not know.  The author claims to know more about it than the people who make the products.  She has absolutely no experience or knowledge in anything to do with the making of a brazilian beer. Â She claims to be "Drinking a little too much" when she drank.  Is she???  What about the beer company that produced the beer (Lagunitas) that claims to not know how the beers were made??   Why was the author so wrong about that?   Who knows?  If you want a good beer from a good company then give it a try. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was surprised by the lack of detail on the "how to" portion of the book - there was no description of what to look for or do when you find a bad disc (which were very noticeable), or what you should do when a bad one came out in the field (you can never tell in the book which are the good and which are not).   All in all, this is a good book if you want to learn about the field, but if you are already involved in the process you will want to pick up a good one in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is an insult to anyone that has experienced abuse and/or violence in a relationship or at school. This book fails to do anything in terms of exploring the reality of the abuse or violence. The author blames men for their abusive behavior, but not women. Women are not abused at home; they are abused at work, at school and at all social functions. No one who has been abused should ever want to be a part of a male dominated profession.   In the first chapter of the book, the author tells us that, "Men abuse women because they feel they cannot control their women."   As if it's just a male thing.  In chapter 2 the author says women must stop being too emotional and become more logical, and she gives a list of rules that women must follow.  She never takes a stand for women's rights, or says that violence is wrong.  I guess we just can't be logical. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you have read any of the books I have reviewed on this blog then you know that I am a huge fan of Richard Dawkins and his work.   This book is part of the "Dawkins Loves God" series that I read in college.  It was so well written and written in a way that I felt like I had a conversation with Dawkins.  Even though I have a problem with the idea of a god that does things like killing his children, the book is a good introduction to the topic.  The one thing that bothers me about the book are the stories about women in the bible (even though it is mostly men that are the problem).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book for a "book night" that I was having on the day I got my PhD.   It was the first book that I'd seen that described the experience of writing for an online audience, and I felt that if you are a woman in the literary field, you'd want to read something like this.  When I finished it, I felt very "bad" about what I did to my writing, and for this I am extremely disappointed by this book.  I didn't understand the importance of good feedback, or how important it is to listen to your friends, mentors, and editors.  It seems to me that the author's message was to become the writer that she wanted to be.  There is very little discussion about what makes a good story.  And there are no examples about different ways to write a good book, or different approaches to writing a good scene.  If you want to have a good time writing, the last thing you should do is get discouraged because you aren't happy with the way your story turns out.  This is an excellent book to get you started, but not the end of the story, and it certainly isn't a complete book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For starters this book is just a compilation of what other people have written.   I did not enjoy this book,  it is just another copy of the books I have read before.  My other favorite book to read is " The New Testament in the Original Greek "  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   ...   This is an interesting read, but the ending just gets me.   I love the fact that the ending of this story is very different than in other books I have read that deal with the same subject.  I was also very sad about my dad's death. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While not as bad as the first, this one was pretty bad. It got really old quickly and the ending just didn't sit right with me.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is a huge disconnect between what the author describes and what she actually does with the subject matter.   The descriptions are of a girl who is on a bad trip and being followed around by her lover.  They make her do something that actually is not that bad.  There are a lot of things that the author could have said about the protagonist to make it better, like a good boyfriend or a good job or an actual boyfriend or not a bad boyfriend  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My daughter is a fan of Stephen King but never his novels. She recently finished the last book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book in an effort to read more about the War on Drugs.   But even though I've read many books about the war,   this is the first one   that   made   sense.   And it wasn't just about the effects of drugs but about the cultural problems at its root.  It was also great to find   the author's   experience in the war. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very bad book with a bad plot.   It is an action book but they are almost never interesting or worth the reading time.  There is a lot of running, fighting, stabbing and fighting but there is not a whole lot of action.  Some of the action is just silly and boring and almost feels like they are taking their inspiration from Conan.  As a result of this book I felt as if I were watching a poorly made soap opera 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â This is a wonderful book about a boy who becomes a man by the time he reaches his late teens and has sex with a woman.   In my opinion the book is too negative because all the "treats" given to the boy were not really necessary.  He got a lot of "teachings" about how to get laid (and the fact that he was too lazy to get an erection is an added bonus) but he still has no idea how to do it correctly and ended up in a very embarrassing position.  One girl he slept with ended up becoming his wife.  The "touches" were also not that good, he didn't even "get her juices" the way I'm used to.  Even though I was impressed with the "gifts" he received and enjoyed reading the book.  I would never go back to such a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a new author trying to get a foothold in the industry, I found the plot and the writing very difficult to get through.   The characters were all the same   with no individuality.  I didn't really enjoy the book at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was one of the worst reads I have ever had. I have always been a fan of the Harry Potter books and had just finished the last book (which I loved)   that had an   plot point that had a very bad impact on the characters I cared about:  As I was coming to grips with it and getting ready to read the next book, this was the first time the characters that were close to my age and my current friends, were suddenly not who I thought they were and were now in a different place   I was very confused   but I didn't expect it would be that bad   when I finally read the book and read all the reviews it was still   hard to put it down   the characters in it   never seemed to be in the same place in a novel as when they were in the books   i think it was a case of not trying too hard   maybe the writer just wanted   to be different than the others   or didn't know how to write an adolescent protagonist   not sure   and now I have this negative thought about everything 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a hard book to review for a couple reasons.   First, it is a difficult book.  It is not a hard work like most books are, but a difficult process.  For many of us, writing is not easy.  That is why I have always enjoyed non-fiction books with hard work in them (though I do not really agree with the notion that it is difficult to write a book that is interesting and not boring).  Second, it has to be hard work to make a book of such importance in the 20th Century.  Many people consider Einstein a genius, but he was a hard worker.  He worked hard for his success.  This hard work has been a good thing for him and many others as well.  However, I think it is unfair to give such a talented man such a low score.  I believe this book is a good book about an important person in our history.  The book has lots of good information, but also the information is hard to get, so many people will get the wrong idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have a copy of this book from the 1970s in my library, but I have not read it since the 1980s.   It is a bit dry for a children's book, but that is a good thing, since I like dry books.  As a book about a boy named "Barry," I thought this book was pretty interesting and well written. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a reader of a lot of sci-fi, sci-fantasy and fantasy books, the worldbuilding is incredibly slow.  The plot is pretty good.   The characters are great,  the world is fun to read about.  However, the characters are boring.  It seems like the world isn't very rich in cultures.  I mean, it's a world where everyone is obsessed with the history of the world (and every other place), and yet they do not seem to have a large number of different cultures. It seems there is no magic or magic technology, the technology is only based on science and engineering.  Is that enough for a "great" world?   I would love to have heard more about the cultures. I mean these people have to come to terms with the fact that they will have to go through all the pain and struggle, and then go back into a world that looks just as much like Earth, yet with everything turned on its head. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My wife and I bought this for a birthday present.   We bought it because we're big fans of James Bond and love his adventures.  There's not a whole lot about his early life that is relevant, but we found some of it interesting and fun to read.  The main character is the type that makes you think you know a guy or girl when you see one, but after you see him or her in person you realize he or she is a totally different person.  It seems that at the time Bond was an immature teenager and still had a lot of self-esteem issues.  That is why he makes the best villains.  (For the record, I'm a huge James Bond fan.)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a terrible, boring, disjointed, boring book that wastes pages and pages on the mundane, boring details of what we've just come across, and never lets us get into the main story.   I mean, if you think about it, it's a book about the very first time that a group of people meet and realize that they're related to the same person, and that the person is actually a ghost...   The characters in this book don't really seem that interesting...  What would a good, fun, and memorable summer read be?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a terrible book.   It is really very bad.  The characters are so poorly written, that you will be lost in a world they create.  I really can't say anything positive about it, but this is certainly not a book you should try reading, it is like it is written by someone who is not well versed in world history. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author clearly thought of the book as a children's book. He did have a couple of nice pages at the beginning of the story, but that was about it.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a hard one to review.   It's a very good story, I liked it.  I liked the characters more than the plot.  This one was just a lot of stuff you don't know about people. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was going to give this book 5 stars, but it came out way over budget and not what I expected.   My husband and I have been talking about getting a car for some time now.  The reason we are so excited about a car is because it's usually way over $1000.  We were just debating over whether to buy a used or a used.  This book basically made me hate used cars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is about a group of students going through a very bad breakup. It's quite an emotionally intense book, which I found to be very appropriate. I read a lot of memoirs and came away a bit depressed, but not from this book.  Â I found it very interesting to see the relationships develop, and I really like the ending, although I found it slightly too neat. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is by far the worst book I've ever read. The whole thing was a bad idea. The fact that this book was supposed to be a fictional memoir about a woman who was sexually abused in high school and had a difficult time getting her life together in college is a bit of a stretch. The main characters have no emotional connection to the book and it's pretty boring (not to mention pretty misogynistic). The main character (the first one, by the way) had the misfortune of meeting a group of girls in a small town and being forced to participate in sexual encounters with them.   All of the women in the book are really terrible people.  There's a lot of slut shaming and this book is the epitome of what you should avoid if you're a teenager trying to get laid.  The ending was not the ending    Â    I found myself wanting this book to come to a conclusion, but then I thought "I guess that means no one's interested in reading it."   There are some really great scenes throughout the book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading a few reviews of this book, I thought to myself: 'I've seen this book a million times, and I still get the same plot points.'   This book isn't bad, but it is nothing special.   It is just a series of vignettes with little to do with the main narrative. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a fan of the series, but my enjoyment of the latest one (and the last one) is almost gone. The last book was a slog. This book is much worse in my opinion.   It is an attempt to tell a story, which is all well and good. But it is a really boring, frustrating, and hard-to-follow story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I never really had a good sense of what to expect from any of Stephen King's writing, so I was pretty surprised to find something good (well, good for me) from this collection.   The book was written after the events of the original trilogy, so the idea of the "real world" is still somewhat confusing, as well as the whole idea of time and a timeline that we've come to believe is a natural order. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The novel starts with a good plot development, but then devolves into a boring, repetitive, and unsatisfying series of events that goes on for about 1/2 of the book.   Why not just write a story with a better ending?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is great, but that's the only good thing I can say about it.   After reading a couple of "historical fiction" books, I thought it was pretty cool that this one was about a historical character. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not enjoy this book, and would not recommend it to anyone.   After reading the review I had on Goodreads, I looked it up again and it is very, very sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was never a fan of the series but decided to read the books as they came out.   In retrospect I think that the whole idea of these books being set in our world is a huge mistake,  and the whole series makes me want to kill myself.  It's hard to believe that it took twenty years to make a series that wasn't actually set in the past. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:     "This is one of those books that just wasn't right." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of those books that you can't believe is true.   There are so many stories about my ex-fiancee and me being the first couple to have our wedding in a church.  So I was excited to read this book because I read it after our wedding but didn't believe it until I read the book.  I was so thrilled to find that this story is not at all true. After getting over the shock of finding out the truth, I felt a bit bad because it seemed like my ex was so happy about the wedding.  The book did a great job of showing how we were so in love with one another even after we broke up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author claims the story is about a man's struggle to have a child but it's actually about a couple's struggle.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is basically an exposÃ© of the man who killed my family.   What a waste of time and money!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the past I've given four star ratings to books that I would not have bought.   This is a fourth star rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book to read to my husband and it was a bit difficult to understand him. The story is about a girl who is supposed to be dead and she is trying to find her way home and find out who is hiding her. But it was difficult to read because I'm not sure how he did that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book last year and loved it.   Now it is out in paperback and I'm finding that it isn't nearly as good.  One thing I like about writing (and I am sure the authors are reading this), is that it allows you to experiment with different forms and styles of writing.  This book  is about a woman who does nothing more than give bad advice (though she is also kind, a very kind woman).  She is not a writer but she can write very well (not as well as her friend though, but still).  I am disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a fine example of how a poorly written book is written for the purpose of making the author look good by the way he "proves" his theories  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What a terrible story!   It's based on a story by a bad, unreliable writer.   This guy has no idea what he's doing.  The story is based on two books: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   ..   It is a good book but not as good as its potential. The concept is interesting and I would certainly read more books in this genre.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am going to get on my soapbox for a bit here, but this book really sucked.   First off, when you're a fan of the TV show, you want to see the characters succeed and be happy with the new show and their new lives.  This book was full of the same tired plot lines and the same dull, lifeless characters.  As a fan, I was hoping that at the end of the book the characters would be given a big payoff, but it was always the same thing over and over again.  My favorite character is definitely Hank's, but he was always one of the most boring, predictable characters ever.  Another thing that pissed me off is the main character being a girl.  It is not good to see that a woman can't be a detective, but if the main characters can't even be a girl then what else is new?   Another reason I was not a fan is that the author doesn't really do anything innovative, or try new things to break up the norm of the series.  Sure, she changes the characters' names and how they use a computer, but she doesn't change their personalities or their relationships.  When the characters were introduced, their relationships were never changed.  In the beginning, Hank's relationship with Abby was fine, and when the two of them broke up in the middle of the novel it made no sense.  So the main theme of the books is that all the characters are the same, and that's just boring.  Overall I can't recommend this book to anyone, and as a fan I feel cheated.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is so bad that it's good.  It is a very odd book, about how the United States government has created an image of the world in its own image, in the 1950s and '60s.  This book is about the CIA's role in creating and using a fake communist movement in Cuba (the "Bay of Pigs").   In the book, the CIA admits that the idea to "create the CIA" was an idea of one of their own employees, a young man by the name of Clay Shaw, who was a bit of a jerk at the time, but turned out to be an effective agent.   At first, Shaw is very successful at his task, getting Castro to agree to work with the CIA against the Soviet Union.  However, after the Soviets had already started building a base in Cuba and the Castro government had collapsed, Shaw was fired and his job transferred to a CIA officer who was also a bad ass.  The CIA officer becomes the head of a CIA "plausible deniability" group to "expose the truth" about Castro and his plans.  After Castro is gone, the group has been destroyed (shout out to Tom Clancy!) and the CIA has basically turned the Cuban missile crisis from a good thing for the US into a disaster for our country (I think I am starting to lose patience with these stupid "conspiracies").  The reason for the CIA's failure was that Cuba did not have a large enough population to keep up with their nuclear and ballistic missiles.  In fact, they had been warned that Soviet missiles were going to arrive, and so they had made the decision to reduce their production of missiles to a small number.  I did enjoy the book a lot and wish that I had read it when I was younger, but this was a good, cheap book that is now out of print.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a waste of my time. I am sorry that the author of this book was able to come up with so many crazy ideas like the one where she is able to bring up memories from her past with a very poor grasp on English, and the next time she was in the middle of a conversation she was able, by simply asking someone "can we please stop talking about this?", to tell a long list of things about that person that would have been better left in the closet, not the library or the bookshelf:       She claims that if someone were to tell her that he or she was a bad writer, she would tell them that he is very poor at writing.   I know that I've said that I don't think he is a bad storyteller, and I'm not ashamed of that, but I think he might not be a great writer either: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was a bit let down with this one. It's a fairly long book, with an intro by a guy who is supposed to be a expert on the subject, but he doesn't do a very good job at it.   The "how to" material is pretty much just a series of exercises in figuring out what he's talking about.  It was just plain boring, and not something I'm looking forward to reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There's a lot in this book that would make the author feel better about her failures, or at least better about getting the book published, but she never does. It doesn't help that the author's style and structure is so uneven.   It's hard to believe that any of it is the author trying to be funny, or that she really believed in her own claims, but no.  Her jokes are very weak, and her jokes that seem plausible at first start to fall apart pretty quickly:  Â   ... Â Â  I can't tell if the author is being ironic or just dumb.  The second part doesn't matter:  That one has to be at least an occasional reader, or else it's a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is soooooo bad. I love my   My Santa had to know I don't do reviews and she got me a nice gift. I had heard good things about this book and I'm glad I found it in the library before I read it in a store...   It's awful. If you want a good story with interesting characters, this book is not for you. It's more of a "let me tell a terrible story with a bad ending" book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book.   The whole thing was a piece of shit and I just couldn't believe it when I got it back from the library. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   ... This book is about a boy with autism who likes to kill people..   This book was way to easy to follow with just a few scenes  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So this is my first book by a white man.   It was good enough to get me hooked but not something I will return to over and over. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have always had a problem with the stories and the way the author portrays the characters, so it was nice to get this book for a change.   After reading about 3 pages the first time, it took me about a year to get through it.  My friends who have read the series also complained about the repetitive story lines (one time we watched a "TV" show and then watched the whole series.  It's just so stupid.) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've just finished reading a very poor book that is in part a memoir and that I read in a state of high dudgeon over a bad diagnosis and the fact that it took me until the last days of my life to recover from that diagnosis.   But what I find so frustrating about this book is that the diagnosis that is made has no basis in the actual evidence.  To me, there are two questions in this case that need to be answered by anyone making a diagnosis. If a patient has a very early onset of the problem and no family history of it, then it is a possible "acute lymphoblastic lymphoma".  If a child has an early onset and no known family history, then is it a "pseudoprogressive lymphoma"?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a bit frustrating, but not entirely.   I liked it a lot.  It was interesting to find out about the history of the family's history and how the family came to be where it is.  Unfortunately, this does not extend to the family tree and its branches which I think could be easily explained.  I am always interested in family history and would love to learn more about it, but there is very little about that.  This does not diminish the book for me however. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm reading a lot of nonfiction right now and I really think I found a winner with this one.   The book is just about the worst (I can't even type that!) book I've ever read.  It's really boring.  There is a lot in the book that seems to be plagiarized or just wrong.  I just want a good read, not a bad one. I can't recommend this one very much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I could give this book zero stars, I would!   The first two-thirds of the book were really good. The next few chapters were the real clunkers, though, and really destroyed any credibility I could have built with the first few.   I know the author is trying to show that there were good people on both sides (i.e., no Nazi sympathizers, and not just the Nazis), but this is so bizarre and inaccurate   that I'm not sure the reader gets it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an interesting, but unfortunately not very good book.   For those of you who know me, you know that I am a huge fan of the works ofÂ  George R.R. Martin Â - his books ( A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons) have a special place in my heart. Â As a former high school English teacher (not the kind who writes high school books), I can tell you that Martin's books are extremely difficult to read, and as an English teacher, I am very familiar with the kind of challenging books that I cannot and will not read.  I was excited to pick up A Feast For Crows   because I have been interested in medieval history for a long time, and I found this book interesting for its exploration of the relationship between the king and the queen.  But   I was disappointed by the book's plot, and especially by its ending.  In the book, one of the main characters decides that the king has no right to the throne (because he had a bastard son from a concubine) and takes up arms against the king - but he dies fighting the king's soldiers.  As it turns out, the queen is actually pregnant by the king (a fact that is revealed to the reader by the title of the book), so she makes a deal with the king to hide the baby for a few years (for her own safety).   But what about the king?   The king's plan seems to be to have his bastard son take the throne and make the queen his queen. The plot twists and turns are quite amazing, but in the end, it comes down to this:  The queen is pregnant, and the king is determined to have the baby and make his mother the queen (and make the king king).  The story is full of twists and revelations, but I was not completely pleased with the ending. Â  It feels like a betrayal, even though it really is not.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to reading this book, but was not.   This was the second book I have read about the "lost" book that the Pope had said was not true; the first being  " The Pope and the Holocaust: How the Secret History of the Catholic Church was Used to Sell Nazi War Crimes " by Gary Mack.  It was the first book I read about Joseph Goebbels.    Â  It took me a long time to get into the books.  I read everything I could get my hands on.  The first book had a very strong focus on the Catholic church's "holocaust" at the hands of the Nazis; it was written with an eye toward converting the masses to Catholicism in Germany.  Yet, in both of these books, there was no mention at all of the many reasons why the Nazi's had to go away.  This book made no mention of the "war against the Jews" by the Nazi Party, as the Nazis used many Christians as scapegoats. Â    The only references to it were when people talked about how they were going to be killed in a gas chamber or how they should have never joined the Nazi party.  These are not points the Pope ever brought up in his speeches; he only mentioned them for propaganda purposes.  In addition, in the second of these two books, the author (Gary Mack) was unable to find anything that the Vatican had done that justified the death camps, so he had to make up his own reason for the deaths. Â  The author's explanations about "the war against the Christians" seem to me that he was so scared about being "called a Nazi" that he had no idea what he was talking about.  His book should have been a warning to anyone who thinks that "the Holocaust" has something to do with Christianity.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you have read anything by a young-ish white male, it's probably been by Peter Beagle.   Beagle, of course, is an author with a well-known track record, but even if you haven't read his books, you've probably seen the movies.  Beagler has a certain knack for writing stories about the alien races that have settled down in human cities.  Unfortunately, his stories don't always work as well as he might have hoped.  (hide spoiler)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to like this book. It is just so easy for me to read.   Unfortunately, as I read on, it became obvious to me that the authors is a bad teacher and that the ideas that he has in this book are not valid for his students. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book isn't very good and I feel like I have wasted my time reading it, and then the author goes into this very long winded "essay" that doesn't really add anything to the main story line.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has nothing in common with a good book. It doesn't go anywhere.   I found myself wanting to read something else that might have helped me get over my anger at some of the stupid things I had seen and done in the military.  "My greatest fear when I began the tour of duty was the thought of my mother seeing me as a failure in a lifetime of trying. She was devastated when I failed my physical and was sent home, and it was a very difficult pill to swallow."    While not the worst book I've read, it certainly is the most depressing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this for my son, and as far as I can tell, it's a terrible book. He loves it. He likes the characters. He gets a lot of laughs from it.  Â This is not a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a bad audiobook. I tried to listen to the audiobook in a public location. It's too loud in a room with people in front of it. It makes my head hurt.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a train wreck   It does not make sense to me how such a great writer could write such a bad story   In the story there are two protagonists in the story  He is the narrator and she is his love interest   The girl in the book is so stupid she is dumb as a stump   She thinks that if the narrator has done something that she didn't like she is right   He knows that the narrator is lying about her father in the novel   There is no way she would be a writer   I have already cancelled all my subscriptions  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this was really, really boring. The best part was when the professor was doing his "I'm not trying to be funny here but..." speech and then told the kids that they had to have a picture of something they like that is not a vegetable. That was just so boring   It's probably a good thing they got a book for their birthday
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is very boring.   This is a very bad book with only 3 good points.  One: it is true.  Two: there are 3 good things about this book: 1:  It contains 3 good, and not just good, points. 2:  The author uses it to prove he is a clever but poor writer.  Three: he has good points (though he is too bad to be a good author).   The only two good points are that (a) the book is good and (b) the author knows it is a good book.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First I must thank the author for a wonderful book.   However the narration is atrocious and is really distracting as I read this book. I'm glad he didn't take the "Hollywood method" for narrating his book. As a person who is a college instructor I have learned that there is a reason a good narrator is crucial to a good book and a bad one is a bad author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book in the "book exchange" at my library.   It had been a long time since I read a good book.  It did not make a good read.  I would not buy this book again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book. If you have no interest in ancient Greek history (like me), this is not the book you are looking for. It was interesting to see a few pages about Herodotos's life, but even so, it took me about an hour to read the entire book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was my first book with a female protagonist, and I wasn't sure about it. I got over it in a few chapters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was really bad.   The only reason why I kept reading it was so I could laugh at all the things it was going to be about.  Â    
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book a 3 star rating. It was very boring and made me feel that i just didn't have enough knowledge to understand the subject matter.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   ..   So after the first few chapters, I had no idea what to expect and really didn't want to go there.   What I got was a lot of confusing characters, a confusing backstory, and an even more confusing ending.  It's definitely not my cup of tea. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good book for a good price.   The author's own experience in the military is a major influence in the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I've ever read by a woman.   From the first paragraph to the last she's trying to write a "love story".   The main female characters in this book (i.e. the ones not having sex with their boyfriend) all have problems with relationships.  The only way I can describe them is they are all "crazy".  She's using their relationship to advance her "self esteem".  I can't help but wonder if she's even aware of her own mental illness. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a really good book. It's a history of the American Civil War, but you're missing some stuff in order to make it more like a Civil War movie. Most of the "characters" in the book have no personality at all, which isn't a bad thing per se. And the "historical accuracy" is a mixed bag. It took me a couple reads to get past the bad history, but I had to go through the movie to get the facts.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a professional writer, I am very wary about recommending books (or movies) based on the content of the book or movie.   "Gone Girl" is about a writer, Nick, whose wife disappears in the middle of a New Year's Eve party and he is unable to locate her.  It is told from his perspective.  Unfortunately, Nick does not know much about writing.  He reads and writes and talks about his work in the past, but he lacks a broad vocabulary.  His knowledge of writing is limited to what the people he writes for have told him.  Nick's story is a lot of a bore.  As I've said before, there are good books about writing; there are also bad books about writers.  I can't imagine how someone else could have written this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't really read fantasy.    And it turns out I still can't do it justice.   Â  This is the third book in a series I'm not really familiar with.  In a good way (i.e., if it works) but a bad way.  The plot is a bit cliched (no magic needed) and there is a fair bit of confusion in the world building.  I found it a little irritating and didn't really care much about the characters.  So I was hoping there would be some real tension between characters. Â  This ended up not being the case. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very short book.   It makes the reader want to buy the book    but I think it is better for having read it a long time ago. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A novel to be used as a stepping stone for the story.   There's a lot that I liked in it, but I never found a use for the character that wasn't boring or unoriginal. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not good at all. The first part was confusing and confusing at the same time, with confusing characters and an unclear plot. The second part was a little better (it has some humor, but that was not enough), but the last part just failed completely to interest me.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a boring book with a good premise.   I did like the idea of the main character changing from a child to an adult but the author has to use some magic to change things, so no surprise there.  This book is a waste of time but it is a fun read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not sure why I read it but I had to.   It's just so frustrating trying to get the details about how the person you're in love with was so horribly abusive to you.  There's also the other side of the spectrum.  I can't believe that this book has been out for over 5 years but no one has written about how horrible it is to find out you're dating a horrible person  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought this would be a good book, but the first 100 pages had me wanting a break.   It was a slog from the very start.  It starts like a good thriller, with a very good twist at the end of the first page.  Then it just doesn't really go anywhere.  The hero is a good-looking girl who is also a bit of a bad-ass.  She gets some cool gadgets to aid her and the protagonist gets to do some pretty cool things too.  I really like the idea of the protagonist getting some cool, futuristic gadgets.  But the bad guy is just so over the top that it's almost comical.  He also has this obsession with having a really powerful car (which is also in the book), and it takes a couple of chapters for the main characters to figure out that the car is also powerful enough to kill him.  So it takes about half the book for the bad guys to get something interesting to do.  And it's just a mess.  This book just really doesn't need a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't have a bad word to say about this book; it was a pretty good read, especially the part about what was really going on in my life during the 1970's, which I didn't realize until I read this book. But after this book, I just started reading "The End of Faith" instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is weak, the characters are all over the place and the plot is so bad it just sorta drags on.   When is a story supposed to be a roller coaster ride? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are expecting a good book that is going to give you a nice, detailed description of the human experience in a medieval society, you will be disappointed.   It is all too well done, but it really makes me wonder why people spend so much time discussing medieval society.  It looks a lot like modern society, but that is a small quibble in my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm glad I gave this book a shot.   First, this is one of the better books I've read from the "fantasy" genre, as opposed to fantasy or romance or detective or anything else.  Second, it is just plain boring.  Third, the story is so unbelievable that I can't fathom what author's are writing such a crappy book.  It is a big red flag to me that they can't write an interesting, well-written fantasy book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved the first few chapters but was left disappointed by the last five.   It seems like a good idea until the last page. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was very misleading to me, as it claimed to be about a man who was the head of a successful pharmaceutical company, but who was a total failure at his job.   He didn't actually write a successful drug, and he was fired for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you enjoy historical fiction, do not read this book. It is a history of a war. Yes, it is a book on a very important topic. But a good history is not about a war but about a culture and a civilization. It has nothing to do with a war and does not have a happy ending either. It's a very boring book, that just wants to be about something else.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is like a poorly written story of a bad experience from a bad movie.   They try to be funny but they just don't work at all   I mean   the characters are flat and unrealistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you like a good book, you should not give a bad one a read.   This book is not a good one.  While this story has a happy ending, it comes at the cost of a lot of suffering for the characters.  This is a book about a man who has to learn that he needs help to be a father.  I will not be reading a book with a happy happy ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you're looking for a good read about the rise of the Third Reich, this book is a waste of time.   "In The Third Reich: The Nazi Revolution in History and Imagination," by Ian Kershaw, has a great deal to recommend it.  But then you get to the chapter on the origins of the Nazis:  One of the strangest aspects of this book, I thought, was Kershaw's inability to grasp the extent to which a Nazi regime was a response to the world it had emerged from, and a radical rejection of its past.  It is interesting to note that this is precisely the same position held by some Jewish-Americans during the first half of the 20th century, who were so committed to their cultural and ethnic heritage that they did not care about the Holocaust.  This is a very dangerous position to take, and in a context where Hitler is responsible for the Holocaust and a large majority of Germans are either in sympathy with him or actively afraid of him, it is completely irresponsible and dangerous.  As for the other points in the book: the claim that a significant portion of Nazi society was middle class and middle-aged is nonsense.  A third of the Nazi membership is younger than thirty, and one quarter are not yet thirty.  There are plenty of middle-class Nazis, but not nearly enough.  Kershaw attempts to portray Hitler as a successful businessman, but I do not believe he has even a basic grasp of the workings of a company:  Hitler was the man who ran the Third German Reich - that is what he did.  He had been working for the Reichsbank for much of the 1920s when the depression hit, and his company, Thyssen, had to be taken over to make it work.  Hitler's background, particularly his work with Thyssens, is irrelevant.  The book is full of assertions about Hitler's character, which are so wrong-headed they make one wonder how the author ever got a job as a historian at all.  What Hitler did was completely consistent with all of the rest of his behaviour:  He was a fascist authoritarian, committed to power, and willing to do anything necessary to get it. He was also a womaniser, a womanizer who lived in a woman's body, who had an affair with Eva Braun, was a habitual liar, and was a psychopath.  They were not traits of people with any moral sense at all, but
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just wanted to give this book a bad review:  It is so poorly written that you can't tell that there is anything going on.   It's like the author just sat down at a blank piece of paper and decided to write a story, and had no idea how to do so.  I couldn't even believe my eyes when I read about a character that is supposed to be a "good guy" falling in love with a girl  and then  not really being able to do anything about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a huge fan of Stephen King's work.   But I was so excited to read it that I forgot my two month old baby at home.  I read it over the course of a week and a half with my husband, it was great!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the most interesting parts of the book is its use of historical documents to illustrate a theory about the history of the development of the idea of man's "free will". It's not clear how this happened, but it was certainly a big step forward in philosophy in the 1800s.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is good if you're willing to accept some strange philosophical issues.   It's very weird and even in the end a little bit confusing, especially about what it means to be conscious. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books and the movies. I think it is awesome that JK Rowling made it possible for her fans to write about their love of her work and not just make up fan fiction!   But I found myself very disappointed by the final book in the series.   There are so many characters I was hoping to see again in future books:  Ron, Hermione, Bill, Ginny, Mr. Weasley  ...and then I found out that the only character who was going to live was Harry Potter!  I was very disappointed because I thought the last book was going very well.  I would be happy if I was just a very happy reader  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love this book. But, the main character is a terrible person.   She was such a sweet little girl, and I thought her relationship with her uncle would help her mature, but she was just a snob. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been looking for this book for almost a year.  I found a copy from an online library.   However, I am very disappointed with this book.  It is a story of a man whose child is very ill.  The man is very devoted to his child and cannot see any other reason why he should not try to save her life.  She has a very rare tumor in her spine that has not responded well to any of the many drugs that are available.  This is an issue that is not limited to the United States.  However when we consider the fact that all the drugs that the man can find have side effects that are very painful then it is not too much of a surprise that the child is going to die.  When I first saw the book I thought that the author was trying to use the issue of dying to make a very funny story.  He uses the phrase "flesh to bones" several times.  But this was not funny for me. Â I found it very hard to take the humor of the story seriously.  While there was some humor in the story, I found it really hard to see what good the story was doing.  After reading this book it was hard to picture the child alive after it was all over.  As the book ends, I wondered if that was really the best way to end the story. I found this book to be really hard read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In a nutshell,   This is a poorly done story, and a poorly written story at that.   As for my "review" of this book,  I don't think you'll find it any more helpful than my comments about it.  This isn't just a mediocre book, but it also  makes me want to keep moving my life forward. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book while being treated for the first time for breast cancer.   It's a well written, informative, and fascinating book about the origins of breast cancer and breast care.  As an oncologist, this is a great read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is boring   I could never understand what was happening.   For every good idea there were three or four stupid ones. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a good book.   I am in the middle of reading it.  I was excited for this book, and I didn't realize that it was written by someone who knows nothing about the history of witchcraft .   It was supposed to be about a group of witches who live in Connecticut during the time period but the author seems to be using this book to write about her own life . It is a very long book, over 400 pages and I kept having to back up and reread parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book tells how the "greatest war in the history of mankind" was fought in Iraq.   Except that it's not that great a war.  To put things in perspective, the war in Iraq began in 1988, when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.  Then, from 1990 to 1991, Saddam Hussein was in fact a friend of the United States and was trying to get a no-fly zone over Kuwait so the United State could use that as a base from which to attack Iraq. Â  In 1990, Saddam was overthrown in a U.S. led coup in Iraq and his troops were pushed back.  Saddam had to be pulled out of Kuwait by a coalition that included the United Stated, which would soon include Russia, but he never left the scene, which is why he came back to the scene again in 1998, when U.N. weapons inspectors were allowed to return to Iraq and started looking around for "weapons of mass destruction".   This book is a lot of "what ifs", and I'm not going to attempt to be objective.  But this is the book that most people will read, so you can guess where it ends up.  The war is said to have been "the most expensive military engagement in history".  But I'm pretty sure this is a misstatement.  When you look at what the military spending has been in the last few years, I think it looks more like the military spendin g was the most expensive in the 1990s, and then it became a "costly military engagement".  There is no way Iraq could have had a "war of choice".  And there is no reason to believe that Saddam would have agreed to a U S. no fly zone if he had known that the U. S. would use it as a launch pad for the Iraq war. Â  Why would Saddam have agreed? Â  He didn't want to get the UN in the middle of a war that he would have been likely to lose.  It is not "the greatest war in history", in any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book starts out slow and boring, then it becomes predictable, then the characters get stupid, then they get back to being stupid, and then they just get stupid.   It took me a while to get past the first three books in the series, but after reading the final one I can understand why the first two didn't work out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a little disappointing that a book of this nature had no real interest in the "darkness of the underworld".   I don't mean that in a bad way, the book was funny in a very low-key way, but the main theme was so weak that I found the whole thing boring.   One of the many things that bothered me about the book (besides the fact that it was terrible and that I would probably never see a print copy of it) was the fact how they were using some sort of drug called "Caffeine" in the book.  It wasn't a very good metaphor in terms of what they were doing to the people in the underworld (or the people who were in the Underworld).   The book was not very interesting at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was not well written. The writing was very repetitive and repetitive and even the sentences in a sentence are very similar.   It really seemed like the author just went over a lot of the same ideas over and over again, so it's hard to get invested in the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is by far the worst book I have ever read.   No, seriously, you need to take a break.  It is not a good book at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The thing that bugged me about this book is that it just takes forever to get to the good stuff.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a reader of literary fiction, I have been pleased by some of the books I have read but have come to regret a lot more. I am also a reviewer and know all too well what kind of a work can go awry in the editing process. This book was no exception and my friends and I all agreed that it did not read well.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to love this book sooo bad   It's soooo different   "There are some things in life that never change, but time changes them."   Maybe this is why I hated the book so much.   A story   About a story 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very bad book. It is so obviously poorly researched and poorly written that it is hard to take seriously.   It is not the first time that I have had this happen, either.  I have a hard time trusting anything that someone writes about me, even if they are a very nice friend. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for a good book about the American Civil War, and I found the book to be a total disappointment.   It's a well-researched book, but the history isn't very interesting and not a very good history book.      I'm glad that a good historian has published a book about this long forgotten conflict. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited about this book when I first saw it in the library a few years ago.  I loved the idea of taking a look at a society which is a little out of touch with the rest of the world.   However   the world is pretty much flat and not that interesting.  My son read it a while ago and liked it so much that he was looking forward to reading it again.  It was a fun book to read, but I feel like the author should have done a little more research.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first two chapters are pretty good but then it just goes downhill from there.   This is the first time I have read a book that is so lacking in plot and drama. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not much of a sci-fi fan, but this book is so poorly written, so nonsensical and so frustrating, I never finished it.   There is also some really bad science.  Â  It's like some high school kid trying to make his way into a sci fi/fantasy convention.  I'm guessing this book was never printed for distribution and must have been bought off the rack by a school librarian who found the book in a school library. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't enjoy this book. It is well-written, but I think it would have been better with a different voice.     
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm surprised that this wasn't reviewed more positively.   As for what I found in the book, the title isn't misleading at all.  A lot of the details were just vague enough to be taken for granted, like "to use an example that might not be completely accurate:  "You'd be hard pressed to find a case of    disease  .  "   While some of the cases were   really   bad  , there were a few that   were actually good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did like the title. I am sorry, however, to report that this book is full of errors and is in no way a scientific book about the subject matter. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I love this book.   It's a short story about a girl who is very unlucky with the men she meets and she does all she can to try to meet guys that will accept her.  It made me think about my boyfriend at the time that I only got from a friend after dating him for a few years.  This book has a lot of very interesting details about the different men. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most confusing aspect of this book is the last bit of the book that tells how we, "as the species", went extinct because our ancestors went to a much more pleasant place.   I guess the idea is that humans moved to a new habitat (the savanna) which became more hospitable to the species than the ones we've been breeding in (pestilence and famine).    This is an interesting idea, but it fails at both the practical and the moral level.  If a species went to another place (the African savanna for example), did the other species get to stay?   Yes, maybe.  The reason we got to survive here was not because we were smarter or had more tools than our ancestors.  So what's the point of talking about it at all?  How does it work for the species to go somewhere it isn't going? Â Does that mean that the other organisms (the other human beings) get to choose to stay here, or is that some kind of moral issue? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It really wasn't that great...   For a $4.99 book, the artwork is just mediocre and the plot is basically a rehash of a movie (minus the killer).   There were several inconsistencies and errors in the story (ex: why didn't the dog get to the car first?).   But it wasn't too bad.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book about a book of the same name. I read it about a month ago and got confused.   It seems that this book has been reprinted. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The characters in the book are interesting and I would like to see where they end up. I would be more interested in reading a book that follows this sort of arc.   It's a good plot twist but I'm surprised no one had mentioned it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst part is that the book is not a good one.   It is a bad story.  The ending of the novel is terrible.  I was very disappointed.  This book has become the standard for the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is nothing but a waste of time.   It's about a group of teenagers who get lost in a mountain wilderness.  It takes so long to get to the end to realize that it's just another stupid fantasy book with characters who seem to be made up and/or who you already know. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I felt like the author didn't know what she was doing with the language. I didn  I loved this book. It is a good book for readers who are interested in reading about children with special needs. If you love children with mental and physical challenges, you will like it. If not, you won't like it, but you will still like it a lot.   I bought this book because I was a special needs teacher when I was younger, and this book was very helpful to me when I first started working with kids with mental illness. I read it in a week and it is the first book I've read that truly understood me in a meaningful way.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing in this book was a total fail.   A lot of the things that he says he did were either not done or not done very well.     There are a lot of things that are said that just sound really stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a great read, but it's too much about one character.   He starts as a really great hero, then he becomes a villain. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this and it made me want to kill myself.   The ending was so stupid.  I can't wait for a sequel because I'm going to go through a similar experience to find out how the story goes from there. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is really lame.   He just wants to be a writer but never does.  I liked the story but felt it could have been a little better.  I think a little more story or description in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is really bad.   I did like the subject of it because it is something I can relate to and understand.  I really hope the book is not as accurate and factual as it seems. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is probably my favorite of the trilogy.   It's a fantastic fantasy/science fiction story about aliens who show up to save us from evil robots.  It starts with a bang with the alien threat and the plot thickens as we learn about the origins of the robots. In addition to having some good action, the story has a nice philosophical take on the role of man in a society that is not perfect: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was not a very good book.   I'm a little disappointed in how this book came out.  While I'm not a fan of the type of science fiction I write (and that is a shame because I think this was my favorite book so far)   If I did like science fiction, I would have loved this book. (I'm still holding out hope that I might get a good book from the Tor trilogy.)   The characters were pretty good.  I liked  the characters the best of the three (with the possible exception of the "weird old man")   (The "weirds old man" may be my least favorite.)  A great idea, not a good execution.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book.   I think a young woman who has been in a abusive relationship for a few years, maybe 5 or 6, is reading this book to help her get out of the relationship.  She's thinking about being a writer and being famous in a city and going to parties and stuff.  This book is about someone getting out of a horrible relationship. It takes a lot out of you.  It's not about the relationship though.  The book starts off with a good thing, but then it goes down hill. Â I'm not interested in a book about this kind of thing, and the author seems to think I am. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It has an A in every major category: it's a classic, a good introduction to the subject, and a well written book.   I haven't read the whole thing yet but I have a feeling I'll like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was interested in this book and was really excited to pick it up but the book was so difficult to read I was so confused by it. I had already read the book and the first 3 chapters were a breeze. I just couldn't get through the last 2-3.   "I am an artist" is such a clichÃ©d phrase and it really came off as pretentious.  The only things that this book did was set up how these girls were like the characters in this story in that they are incredibly selfish and can't have normal friends.  It is also very odd in how the characters seem to relate to this "artist".  I guess she is also an artist but the "artist" doesn't seem to have any idea of what art is actually about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A fun book at the beginning.   The main characters were the only things I enjoyed.  This is not a good book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very, very bad book. If you don't like bad books then you'll like this one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read this book once and then I've never been able to find it again.   The author doesn't tell me anything about the actual plot, instead just tells me about the author. Â In fact, the plot of the book is a complete red herring - the book actually does not matter in the least because it is just a bunch of random ideas that are not interesting or engaging to read about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a nice read but it wasn't really anything special.   The main character is so annoying.  She's so angry at everyone and it comes out as annoying. She's very emotional and doesn't seem to have a good sense of humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just read this book as it is described in the blurb: A new life is unfolding for a young orphan in a tiny community in the far north of India.   He is about 13 and his life is changing and he has the power to help others.  He doesn't like that, or the way that life works.  I think that he is a bit naive but I really thought that that is what he was going to be after.  However he becomes very close to a girl and his world is about to end as she is about his age and he is too much to handle.  But as I was reading I began to think he was being too mature in a way, I mean he was a teenager with a girl,  but he seems too mature to be just a teenager.  Also he is very religious and the religion in the book is much more than just worshiping a god.  It is something far more complex but the main character is a very closed minded person.  So the story begins:  It was a dark and stormy night in early February when my sister and I started calling out from a tent to each other.  We were at the tent of the only other boy in our village and I could tell he was not going to come back home that night.  That night was the first day that he had had the power in the house to cook or sleep.  And I was terrified.  A girl came into our tent every night and she would give us money.  When I heard the phone ringing, I knew that he was sleeping by the phone and I was about to cry.  The next morning, the girl's parents got the phone from her and she had a phone charger to charge the charger in the tent.  My mother had bought the tent and a chair so that the girl and the boy could play together.  In the morning we called out to each another but it was clear that it was not to be.  Even though my sister did not know her brother's name, she had already made the connection that she wanted him to come to our home.  Because of a small mistake, I did not think that I would find out that my sister was his cousin but I was wrong.  Instead of saying that he loved my mother, my mother told me that my brother was too old for her.  What if I am not old enough to love him?  It seemed that my mother's
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book based on a review in another book that claimed that the author was a real estate investor in the 1970s and then worked in real estate and development for a few years.   It turns out that the book was based on the author's own experiences as a realtors/developer back in the 1980s.  The book tells us some things that the reviewer probably doesn't know:  - The author does a good job of describing the housing market in general.  -Â  Real estate is one of the most unstable industries in America and that the good times are over.  There was an excellent review by a professional in another blog site of the book:
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm giving this one 3 stars for all the reasons people give it:  it is entertaining   it gives a good "diary"   It gives a "good" background   but this book is just a rehash of all the stuff they have said about her   In other words they are telling us how a good person who is in the way is to be tolerated   The book doesn't tell you anything you didn't know already   and so I gave it a 1/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have only read one book so far and have a bit of a problem with it. First, it's about the life of a gay man in the early 60s.  And there are things in this book that, frankly, I don't like very much.   The gay characters are just too often self-righteous and hypocritical   -- and their relationship with one another is also somewhat superficial  .   Second, one character, the protagonist, is very old-fashioned, very traditional and even too much like a fundamentalist.  It's as if a writer had a very limited view of the LGBT community  (like the one I have described above).   Third, one thing I did like about the book was the portrayal of the relationship between the two guys:  I love how they got along and didn't have a "problem."   Fourth, although not a part of the story, I did enjoy the chapter on gay rights and "the fight for equality" in the gay community in the 60s:  Finally, if you are thinking about a book on the 60's gay movement, but not necessarily about gay men, this is a good place to start. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hate this book.   It is so poorly written and filled with so much information it is useless.  The only thing you gain from the book is more information and information that you already have.  You will never find out anything about the book itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The reason this book was so good was because it was short.    I have a hard time reading a book in two hours.  It took me three days to read this book.  I'm not a huge fan of "long" books, and  I can't wait until I can afford a new one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has nothing good to say about Christianity, but everything bad to say against it.   I will not go into details about the book, but the central theme is that there is no evidence for any kind of Jesus, and the only ones who ever even had the idea of an incarnation of God are later Gnostic (Gnostic) sects and cults.  I found that it was very hard to find a good Christian author that even wrote about Christianity. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is pretty good for the most part. The characters are shallow and one dimensional. The main character is the "loveable but stupid guy" and all the other characters are the same.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think we need to understand the purpose of the Book of Mormon was not to convince the people that Joseph Smith was a prophet but was instead a translation of the ancient record of a people that disappeared and was written down by Joseph Smith. It was a history of the church. I do not believe the Book o f Mormon as is but instead believe it was an important historical document that helped convince the church the Joseph Smith's were the true leaders. I would have given 4 or 5 stars but if it was a translation that is why we got a new Book of mormon from Joseph Smith but not a new Bible which we also have and that is the one that says Jesus is the son of God but is not translated correctly.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the first book I've read by a female writer who is a science fiction writer.   It's an interesting read, but it doesn't inspire me in a way that other books I've had recommended to me do. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's like I just read the book, got sucked into it and never got out:  I can't explain it to my kids.   The author is not a good writer:  This book isn't really about a child who is lost in the woods; it's about a boy who is afraid of the woods.  There's no reason why a 7 year old boy should be afraid of an old man in a red suit in the winter.  The woods scare me:  The thing that bothers me about the book is the woods -- and it is this that makes the book feel wrong:  When my boy is in the car on a road trip, he starts to freak out when we see the trees and leaves; by the end of the story, he is running to his house because his heart just can't take anymore trees in the sky.  I'd rather have him scared of someone in a rubber suit in a dark forest. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was horrible. It was very long and a horrible read.   So you've got a guy living with some girls who he makes a pass at. One of his "fans" shows up and tells him that the girl "loves him", but he's a jerk. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is like a bad romance: Â The heroine gets caught cheating, and everyone knows it!    However, at the same time, it is like she is trying to do the right thing.   That is because she is a saint   and it is only the male's jealousy that gets in her way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book when it was published in 2010 but after reading it, i'm afraid that this book was a total failure.   What the book does is it tries to present the view of how the world is being ruined by women.  This is done in a way that you could have fooled me at the time as i still believed in the existence of the "woman crisis"    And this book will have a good number of readers because it's not a complete failure   The author uses women as a prop, and i just don't understand how he's being so "in touch" with his readership  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved the idea of this book, but I was underwhelmed by the execution. This is a good read, but it's so repetitive I couldn't keep reading.   The story line is interesting, but is poorly executed in the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read the author's other books and I am not a fan, but this one is the worst one I have ever read.   My favorite character is not included in this book: the main character is in love with a little girl who is not his daughter; they are supposed to have a baby but the baby does not arrive, so the main characters goes back to their former life.  I am going to read this book again when the little girl is born, but I hope the main male character will never meet her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â I didn't think this book was bad.   I like this book.  I don't see the point to be making about something that is not a good idea or a good read.  It doesn't have much in the way of interesting writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main character was a very, very boring person who seemed to want to be a "hero" but he couldn't really stand up for himself. The heroine was good at solving mysteries and was actually the only person who knew the truth.   This book took way too long to finish and I didn't like the way the book ended 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just got through this one.  It's so bad that I'm going to leave it in the library so I don't have to hear about the bad writing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the only good thing I can say about this book, and that's the plot.   It's a fantasy, which I'm not much of a fan of (but maybe this isn't a good book for me), but it's a story I've read before:  The main character (the book's author, not a main character from the film) doesn't actually have powers, but is "gifted" with some knowledge that he isn't supposed to have.  This means he has a great deal of control over his own mind, and he's able to make a great many decisions.  However, he can't use it to his advantage.  He also doesn't have a personality that's very compelling, which is a bit disappointing.  It takes quite a few books to get anything of substance out of him.  The book's focus is on the main character and a lot of the characters, and there's a good deal of them that aren't all that interesting.  There's a fair amount of information given, but the info is not very good, and not very useful.  Overall, it's just not very fun to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main character is too perfect, and so is the villain in the book.   It's like being forced into a sexual relationship with a perfect person you know is not what you are looking for and when the person leaves you realize you were being duped and have no idea who you are really with.  I really can't stand romances  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A really great book about a really great character.   But it's not a very happy book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a shame this book didn't end up being better than it is.   The characters are flat and uninteresting, the main plot feels pointless, and the worldbuilding feels very rushed.  I'm surprised this book received 4 stars from a good book review site. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book to be a pretty terrible read.   The main character was a little annoying, the author wanted to have this girl in the book as his love interest, and she just didn't go through with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to admit I wasn't too impressed with the story.   The story starts with a scene of a woman being forced into sex by her husband.  She doesn't want to, but her husband is strong willed and won't let her back out.  While the story is set in the 70s and there are some sexual assault references (which I can accept),   the sex itself is not realistic.  Â  The men of my family all think the women they've had sex with are sluts.  So I am not sure if a woman would be able to stand up to a rapist and hold him off.  If the male partner really wanted to rape her, he'd be able too.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not worth the hype. It is a typical book on what happened to Iraq during the Bush Administration. Nothing new, nothing exciting. In fact, it is a little boring and repetitive.   I got sick and tired of hearing about the various failures and mishaps in Iraq. I had my doubts about the War in Iraq even before the initial invasion and I had no illusions about its results. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book hoping it would be a good intro for a new reader.   This is not the intro I had in mind.  Instead, it feels like a rushed, poorly-written book.  The story starts slow and feels tacked-on, which makes the slow pace feel more stilted.  This problem persists through the entire story, with minor details being dropped and entire chapters having one-paragraph summaries that do not do justice to the subject matter.  Also, this book is so over-long that it ends up making little sense.  It could have been shorter.  Overall, I don't recommend this book as a starting point for a beginning reader.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â I thought this was a very good book, but the author doesn't explain how to get a good, well-written, and interesting novel out of a good writer.   There were times in the middle of the book that I was bored, and it would take me longer than it needed to get into the story.  I am not sure if this is a bad thing or not, but it didn't make a huge impact on me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not the best book on the subject.   It is a great introduction to the subject, but the writing is often quite sloppy.  The two main characters have some of the worst personalities I've ever encountered.  One is a self-hating Jew who hates gays, the other is a religious zealot who hates Muslims.  Neither of them have a grasp of reality.  And although the author does her best to present these characters as reasonable people, they often show little respect for authority.  There is an interesting parallel between the two:  One of the main characters has to take a job as a nanny to the same Muslim family who killed his grandmother.  He finds it amusing that his Muslim employer would want to live on the same floor as his grandmother, but he doesn't take any joy in it.  This shows that not only does the Muslim family have more respect for the dead grandmother than he, but also that the person who is a victim of their actions is in a far worse position than he is.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is about a girl from a small village that wants to marry the rich son of a famous king.   This is not a happy tale.  She tries to marry a man from another village with good intentions but he refuses, and the wedding is not allowed to go ahead.  This book is a bad story about a woman who is angry about her husband and a stupid girl that is always in trouble with her parents. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My boyfriend and I bought this book together on a special price on Amazon.   He absolutely loves it, but I didn't love it.  I can't give this book more than three stars.  My biggest problem with the book is the story itself, which feels very forced and unconvincing.  The plot is a bit hazy and illogical, and the characters are flat and boring.   I'm sure that there are some really good reasons why the author had to create a totally contrived plot in this book, but that just makes me hate it more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read many books by people who either didn't have the qualifications to teach, didn't know what they were talking about or simply failed to give the students a good idea of what they could be doing to help themselves.   They all seem to get it in the end, though.  It takes a lot of work to become a good teacher: a good curriculum, good preparation and practice, great teachers and supportive administrators and a very long practice period of having students fail and make mistakes.  One of the most important lessons you learn is the necessity of self-discipline.  Without that, you won't have much of a career as a teacher.  And it takes a long time.  The first time I taught, I was at a school with very low test scores.  By the third week, I had managed to get almost 100 percent of my students to the advanced exam level.  So it takes work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A well researched and written book, but I think it suffers from the fact that it's a book on the subject of the Holocaust and it tries to be all-inclusive.   It gives some examples from several other places that are about the Holocaust, but they're not included.  I was hoping for a better source. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book hard to read. It was just so boring. The characters weren't engaging and the plot was so shallow. The story didn't have much in the way of tension or tension building.   It was like watching a play and then being bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has a bad cover, a bad front cover and bad back cover.   It has no picture of the book itself on the front.  The cover has a good quality book cover. The book itself looks like an old book and not a book at all.  (I can't tell if the spine is the same style as the old style ones or the current edition) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a big fan of the series, and I thought this one was going to be a fun addition to the mix.   However, as I was reading it, I was reminded of the bad writing and the bad plot development that the last two books had.  I'd love to give this a 3 star rating, but unfortunately, that just isn't an option. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't read many books by writers from outside North America and I was extremely disappointed with this one, I have never in my life heard of the name Thomas Pynchon before I read the book but it immediately jumped out at me as a great writer.   What was even more surprising was that the book is set in a New York City which is so different from what I'm used to as a Canadian (or any other foreigner for that matter).   This is my first time experiencing NYC as a writer and I'm really looking forward to getting my second chance at writing a novel about the place. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is great.   It starts off by describing an event in a game of Scrabble.  Then it continues to describe a night in which the players play Scrabbling.  It explains that when one of the players got drunk and was trying to drive home while all his friends were asleep in the back seat, he crashed into a tree.  The rest of the story describes the players coming to the rescue of a little boy who gets in an accident.  This is just like how the book described my night at the pub and how it was soooo awesome. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had heard about this book a long time ago but never had a chance to read it.   What a terrible book!   The first chapter sets the tone for the rest of the book with a little joke about how the characters' lives were going better than his was.  This book was not very good.  The characters were stereotypical as heck and were not very interesting.  Even if the protagonist's wife is supposed to be "special" then she is not even that special in my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is one of the worst things I've ever read.   It is about how a man went through hell to get a girl to love him, how she doesn't want him, etc.  But it is so badly written, poorly researched and with no redeeming value whatsoever, I feel no sympathy for the man who put it together. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â I loved this book.   It's the sort of book where you can't help but be interested.  There's something about the prose and the story structure that made me want to go out and learn.  If you want to read a good book   and don't want to pay a ton   Â  it may not be for you but   if you love the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was reading this when I had a major flu the week before. I read through the book a few times, just to see what it was about.   What I got out of it was a lot of "I knew you were going to come in on me" kind of attitude.  A girl who is really into this type of stuff is going to end up being hurt by this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a lover of the Bible, I was really hoping for something good to say about these four books and I was disappointed. First up is Genesis:  It is not bad but I found it too vague, and could easily be used to justify almost any religion.Â  If this was the book they used to use in high school science courses or anything I would have left it there. Second is Exodus:  These were really good at making me see the problems in the world around me; however, they weren't as clear about why the problems were so bad. The author does a nice job at making the world seem like a better place than it is and that's great, but it does not tell me why. Third is Leviticus:  One of the best books on the Bible; however it does little to make me feel good about this part of the book. Fourth is Numbers:  This was a very interesting and interesting book but unfortunately it fell down on the part of teaching me how to be a good Christian.  It was really hard to take seriously the things in there that were so easily ignored in the Old Testament.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't understand the first page of this book and thought this book was a complete waste of time. This is the first time I've had a chance to read a book and I just can't get a handle on it. The characters just seem so flat, and the plot seems like a farce and I'm not sure if the author has a brain or is just having fun with the story.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I was disappointed"  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a little more than a few sentences before it became a mess. The author was not at all interested in what we were saying about religion or the Christian faith, but he knew how to use the story of a dying god to talk about anything.   I'm glad we finally had a good atheist book that I would recommend to any newbie atheists.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was okay, but I wasn't interested in learning more about the author.   I can find a lot of information about her here, but I didn't find anything about her or her life which interested me in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading a few pages of this book I was just going to skip it and go on with other books I've read that are just as horrible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't want to sound like a prude, but this book does absolutely nothing for me.   Â  It's very hard to get into, and it makes you feel like it's missing something.  It's hard to imagine that this book wasn't put together as part of the "Revelations" series, because it's so unoriginal and feels like a rehash of Revelation.  Â  I know that Revelations was written over two thousand years ago, so I understand that not everything has to have been done before, but it makes more sense to have new things to talk about here, and if the book had a specific message that would have been great.  The book is not very exciting, either: Â We're never shown who or where the people we're reading about were when they wrote the Revelation. Â    Well, maybe it was in a church, or in a tavern, but they don't seem to have anything to do with each other.  If there's something about Jesus that we can learn from Revelation, it's that people have more than one story to tell, even in our own time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a very bad read.   I am a huge fan of Dr. Seuss and I loved the book.  I can see how many of the jokes could have been used with modern teenagers   but the author does not get that it is a modern children's book   She didn't think through the problems   The book is so stupid and unreadable that I cannot recommend it   Â  I'm not sure if Dr. Teeth is good or bad.  My family thought it was funny, but I don't think I will enjoy the book much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing and the writing style.   A very good read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is NOT an adventure.   It's a book that is supposed to be educational, but is NOT.  It is the story of a boy, who is in a house that is filled with dead cats and is trapped.  I have never read a book with more spelling errors,   bad vocabulary,  Â  spelling errors in the wrong places,  and  bad grammar.  This is a book I had been looking for, but had no idea how it would turn out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is good at first, but becomes progressively more tedious as it drags on.   My guess is that the author is not a fan of J.K. Rowling's work, and he didn't have the time or money to read the books he supposedly "borrowed" from her.  If that's true, it's a pity that this book is not published in the United States. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have had this book a long time and am still looking for a use for it.   The book is well researched, and the author does a good job of getting to know the subjects she discusses and the problems they have.  But as I tried to put it into the "real world" I was disappointed.  It seems that in the real world there is no one who does research on any of these subjects.  How is it that in this country of science, technology, medicine, business, and other things that have to do with real life problems people are going about their business (and their work) without researching the facts of the subject before they say a thing about it?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was hoping this book was going to make a positive difference in my life   but it didn't, I just gave up 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was just awful.   It wasn't bad for me in anyway   but the writing wasn't great at all and just didn't make any sense to me.  I feel like i read something written by a five year old instead of an adult. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It started out as a good book about a good man with a bad side.   He was so nice to my family when I was a baby.  I loved him in the way I loved my parents, but I never got to know my dad.  It became an after thought when I went on to other things.  He made a big mistake, but he wasn't a bad man. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought that the book was great and entertaining.  But when I saw that it was about a woman and a kid, I had no desire to read another book about such a boring subject.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was interested in this book, but the stories were very predictable.   The narrator would describe a "happy little dog" who "was very loyal and loved his mother," but would leave a note to "bring it back tomorrow" when the mother wasn't home.  It was clear that he wanted that puppy back, but knew he wouldn't get it.  At the end, he finally got it back. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While I really did enjoy this book I couldn't put it down until after the last chapter, the best part of the book for me, was when she tells us why our mothers are our mothers and we need to be grateful that we were born this way.   She also says that it is not the best way but she would have done it differently.  I just found this one a bit too self indulgent. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read the other books in the series and was pretty disappointed that the last book didn't live up to the others. However, I had a hard time getting into this one because of the way it is set up.   The book is about a man, Jack, who has fallen in love with a woman, Elizabeth, and decides to marry her.  I found it a little hard to believe that Elizabeth is actually his former wife but in the end it was a very easy read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There were a few things that really bugged me about this book, such as:  I don't feel like I got to know the characters very well. They didn't seem like people I'd get along with easily at school, or even at home.   I'm not sure why the author chose to make the main character a bully.  There is absolutely no reason for the bully to bully. She has no reason to do anything bad.  Her parents were abusive to her and she has no one she could talk to about the abuse.  I really feel bad for the author for taking so long to write a happy ending.  It seems she was so upset she couldn't think of anything good to write about.  The ending was really weird. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is great, and there are plenty of good ideas in here (though I do feel that the idea of an interplanetary race has not been explored enough). The science is pretty solid and the book is not afraid to go in a few places no one else has gone before. However, there are too many holes in this book. It tries to be "the" space opera but is not as good as some of the other books I've read (which means that some of these things are kind of a shame).
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't buy this book because of the reviews I'd read about it.   It's so much more than that.  This was a solid book about a person who has had to leave the church for her own good, which, by the way, is not really a good thing for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had been looking for a book about the civil war and found it to be more of a historical study than a historical fiction.   The book is the only one I have seen that deals with the issue of "who is to blame."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a bit long. I'm used to being at home and can easily read a single chapter in a few minutes.   When you add in the fact that it has a lot of typos and bad writing this book is just a bunch of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a poorly written book. It starts off ok, but as the book progresses, it is just a waste of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My favorite "mythology book" and the second of the "Diana" series.   I think that "Dia" is better written than the other books but that's just my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a bit concerned about how the author would interpret my research findings. The fact that I was not actually working in this area at all did not help my case.   This book is extremely misleading.  It uses "studies" which have no bearing on the topic.  There are also many, many claims made by the authors which are completely unsupported by the evidence.  Even if the authors claim there is some degree of association between the two, it is not a strong one.  The authors also appear to have a very poor understanding of the subject.  I did not understand that some of the patients had to have their tumors surgically removed in order to have surgery.  If they did not have a tumor removed when diagnosed in the first place they would not have had a tumor when they were diagnosed with prostate cancer and not have undergone treatment. Â My study did not focus on patients with tumors removed after they developed cancer.  Furthermore, a patient must not only have a diagnosis of cancer, but also a diagnosis before the tumor is surgically excised.  Many patients have a number of cancers, but have cancer after having tumors removed for other reasons.  In addition, some patients have cancer while having a benign condition like arthritis.  Some of the claims made about this topic are extremely misleading or outright wrong.  Unfortunately, the author's attempt to "prove" that there is a correlation between breast cancer and sexual abstinence is simply a piece of junk science.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is filled with contradictions.   It says that Jesus is the son of God, and he died for our sins.  It is not possible for a god to die for our sin.  Then he says that God is the great teacher and ruler and that all the sins of the world are committed by the devil.  He never once mentions the sins the devil committed.  I think that is all just a bunch of bullshit 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really didn't like this book at all.   The author makes up a bunch of nonsense about "toxic masculinity" and "battler-babies," and then she writes a pathetic account of how a bully was able to take over the lives of his victims.  It was a long, boring slog.  I read this book because I wanted to hear more about the "Toxic Masculinity" stuff.  Unfortunately, it didn't really help. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is NOT a good book   It's really a poor story with bad writing and no redeeming value   The whole book is about the kid who makes up the story about the alien that saved him   He is also a moron   And he also has no redeemable qualities   I hate to think about this book ever being published 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is nothing special, at least it's not bad. It's very generic sci-fi with a lot of "this is what would happen if" and "I guess that's what happens when you are rich".   It feels like some of the characters have been given "if" and other "how"s as well.   For me, it felt like the author was trying to tell the reader the story of a rich young man in a dystopian future who's having trouble growing old and a woman who's been around a while and is ready to take over. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am very disappointed in this book, and not only because I am not interested in a book on the subject.   It's all about how to make money.  It has nothing to do with the real world of making money, except for the name of one particular book, the one the author used.  And when the book was being written, I actually thought this book was a good resource, for many people, including me! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It seems like a fun book and I read it but I did not enjoy it.   The book is so vague about it, and as a matter of fact the whole world is full of stuff I have never seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had a good time with this book, but as I was reading I was thinking: Â "If only I had the courage to go out and read the book right then".   The main theme of this book is that all women should have equal rights to men, and I agree 100%.   But this book completely ignores that fact and goes out of its way to convince women to accept the sexist view that women don't need to work or have independent incomes and that we should accept the patriarchal view that men have to have power over us.   This book makes the mistake of making a big deal about how the male characters in the book were more "responsible" in life, but in the end they get what they deserve by being beaten by women.  I'm sure that the men in the story were just as bad, but the author doesn't make them out to be.  The author says that her point was to write about the lives of women, not men.  If she had, she would have made a lot more of an attempt to show the "real women" that she wrote about.  In conclusion:  As an advocate of a feminist, I really hated this book.  For all its virtues, this book proves the folly of that idea.  This has nothing to do with what is considered feminism today.  It's a book about how you can be a sexist person, but that it is okay to be a feminist in the wrong context (which I believe is the case).  I just didn't like this book very much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this on a whim but it's the worst book   The main character (I believe) is a terrible writer   This book is about a woman who is trapped in a bad relationship with a man she can't love   Very  boring book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It took me a long time to finish, but then I read the book   And so it was not as bad as I thought. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book ever.   It's as if he wanted to write a story about a girl named Sarah.  It makes no sense.  There is no story to be told here.  I'm not sure if he meant it as a metaphor for how easy it is to have children when it's time to go to bed or if he had an imaginary friend to fill in the gap in the plot, but either way it does not make any sense.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very bad book. It is a collection of essays about various things:  - the history of modern philosophy - the politics of science - a bunch of bad poetry   I liked the first part of the book, and the first half of the second part. The rest was a train wreck. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good book, I can see why so many people have loved it so much,   but it is also a good example of the dangers of overly simplified or oversimplified explanations of complicated ideas.   I am sure a more nuanced discussion would have been worth the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is over 600 pages long.   I am a teacher and have read most of the best writing I have ever seen in the history of the field.  Unfortunately, Mr. Pate and the editors have completely missed the mark.  I agree with the statement that the writer is trying to make a very important point.  The first half of the book attempts to do so, but as we learn more about the character, he is completely devoid of logic.  After reading the story, I feel that he is trying desperately to do the right thing, but his emotions are clouding his judgment.  In the first chapter, we are told that "the more she thought about it, the more she felt she had gone through some kind of trauma."  It is clear from that statement that Ms. Puse has never experienced this trauma.  That is a clear indicator of how a person's emotional self is distorting his judgment (which he admits to in a few other places).  If that is the case, then why is he trying to defend himself?   It would have been easier to write a few pages in the character's point of view.  He appears to be a very thoughtful person, but does he have his emotions completely in check?  I have had that feeling many times when I am thinking about a personal issue, or a situation I am involved in.  Sometimes I find myself in a very similar position in that I can see that something is not right, but then I don't want to do anything about it.  We are also told that the main character was involved in a case where his father was a defendant.  This is a case I am very familiar with.  There is a lot of information that is known about the case because of what is on the internet.  From what I understand, the main victim was very drunk, was acting strangely, and then became physically violent.  How can the main characters actions be in contradiction to the other information that we are being given. Â Ms. Pus's own words in the foreword are disturbing:  "My work is about examining our assumptions about the world and our feelings about it."  Â There is a tremendous amount of emotional baggage that is associated with the story.  It makes you wonder about who this woman really is, and what she really thought about the story she is writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this as a college senior in college.   The book is about an older girl who moved into a new house, had a lot of money, and is now lonely because she doesn't feel she fits in anywhere.  The girl has a son who was adopted, and doesn't even know what to say to her.  At one point, she tells her daughter she doesn' t want to go to his house because he won't look at her or do anything to show he wants to be with her. The whole book is like that.  It makes me want to leave. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For the most part, this book is a very fun read. It makes me smile whenever I think about it. I would like a sequel with more information about the characters (aside from the kids).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a horrible example of self-publishing.   In a nutshell, the plot is weak.  There are not enough POVs, and all are secondary.  We get to know a lot about all of them (i.e., they don't seem like they would have much in common) but most of the events that happen in the first part of the book are too contrived for the narrative to be convincing.  This is especially the case with the protagonist, the titular "Wizards' Apprentice", who is supposed to be "one of the smartest people in the wizarding world".  I suppose "smartest" doesn't mean "strongly moral", but it would have been nice to have seen more character development.  However, at least her moral compass is still intact, which is a good thing considering that the book is about her "self-imposed" exile.  What's worse is that her "wizarding world" isn't just the magical one: she can't even read.  I don't get what a good girl she is if she doesn't know how to read!  This was just another example of the author trying too hard to impress people.  A great deal of the problems that the author has with the narrative can be traced back to the first three POV characters, because they are very poorly developed.  Although the author does manage to get one POV out of the way in a satisfying and unexpected way, all three feel like they are being used in a one-dimensional manner: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would have bought this book if I didn't have the other two.   Unfortunately,  the stories  are just too much like the others   and   don't bring the same   satisfaction that  the other three did. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I have ever bought and I was looking for something good but also interesting and interesting characters.   I tried to look up the real names of the characters, but all I found were the name and the city where they were from, not the other information I was hoping for  . 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it interesting that a lot of other Christian religions also have rules against drinking alcohol.   There were some interesting historical facts about the origin of the idea about the prohibition.  They said alcohol was being smuggled into Europe by the Jews (who were also known for their drinking).   However, the Europeans found that the alcohol gave them headaches and became sicker.  As far as I know, they also found that alcohol produced too much of a "poisonous" gas that caused them to cough and gassy (and so on)    It just seems that when the religions are different, you need to make up some "laws" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read a lot of romance novels in my life.   This is the only one I found that did not seem out of character.  My daughter and I were just looking for a good book to read for the summer.  We read it in one sitting (just so we could finish the book!)   It is not a good summer read as I found myself really wanting the mystery to be solved by the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The   book   was   a disappointment   to   my   expectations   It was  Â  a   long   explanation   for   all   this   that   has   always   bothered   me   about   history   A reviewer in a newspaper said that the history written about in   the history books   is   just   fiction   and   can   not   be   taken seriously   In addition,   many   of the   "facts"   are   exaggerated   in order  Â to   justify   what   these   historians   want  .
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was excited about this book when it was released because I love the character of Nella Marzia  but in all honesty, this book is just boring and repetitive    The story is about the time Nella was a "young girl" and what she and her older sister were thinking about life and love when their father left their mother and stepmother for a younger woman.  It is very similar to what my stepmom and stepdad went through, only in this case I have a lot more knowledge about what was going on in the family.   Also, Nella's mother makes many mistakes   But the main problem is the way the story ends. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is another book about people being stupid. It tells a lot about what the author thinks about other people's ideas.   I have never heard a person complain about anything in this book until one of the characters says:  "A lot of people were surprised when the war was over and the peace came."   What's this?   Is there any war there was?  And this is one of a few times in this series where a person who is a war hero says "the war is over," and "peace comes"   How do you think people will react to you saying that?  It's like saying "the car ran out of gas" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For the price, I thought it was worth a shot.   It was written by a professional author, so it's not a perfect book, but I like the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is really a collection of short stories.   I think it would have been nice to see the stories in a narrative form, and if I were to read it again, I would make the same choices that I made.  I found a book that would have worked very well as a narrative piece, but unfortunately it got bogged down by the lack of characterization. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â The book is about a young girl's attempt to go into a music festival with her mother.   The whole idea of it being a good idea is that her mother has been in bands and was a singer and a guitar player.  But that is just a superficial way of describing her, there is nothing interesting about it.  The book is a lot more interesting about her mother and the history of the band.  This book is so bad, it was not worth the time I spent on it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed the story about the time the doctor had to cut the umbilical cord off of a premature baby girl.   While the scene was good, the book itself was not.  The plot kept jumping from one thing to the next, all to do with the baby, which was interesting but didn't really contribute to the plot or character development. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While I have enjoyed a lot of works of science fiction, especially the space opera and post-apocalyptic stuff I have read in the last few years, I am a little disappointed with this book.   The author is good, but it is just not as good as a lot more recent work by other authors.     I have a feeling that, since this book was written so many years ago, the authors (maybe all the authors, if not all) did not have any real experience writing a novel, nor did they have any idea what made a good book. And since most of them had to turn in their work very soon, they ended up doing their research about the world (because, who does that?) and writing as though they were already in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was interesting, if slow and disjointed. I found it difficult to follow the action of the story.   My main issue with the book was the author's use of the word "disaster" over and over again, as in, "this was a disaster, it was a real disaster!"    The title of this book is a lie. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this as a gift for my husband for his birthday.   The first time I read it I was disappointed.  I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan but i enjoyed it.  When you get the books from amazon, i recommend the hardcover.  As for this book, i got it because  it said it was based on the books.  But the movie didn't have anything like that.  It was boring.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book. But if you are expecting the book to have the same tone as the first series (or the book) this one really isn't as it doesn't.   The main characters is pretty similar. The only difference is that Tedd is a teenager and Tedd and Maddy are not as young.  Tedd has her feelings but it is a bit harder than Maddy's because they had to deal with her parents dying before they knew it.  But that is a minor difference. The characters were different. Tedd was more of a tomboy and Tod and Mady were the kids to watch.  I liked this books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Â    I thought I would enjoy the first half of the book, and for a while, I did. Then, I got to reading the whole thing.   I would never want a kid to read a book like that.  It's a big book with lots of important information, but then the chapters begin to get more and more confusing as you go. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has a huge hole in its heart and is very poorly written.   The main character is a terrible person and her love interest is a douche bag   He has a deep hatred for all people who are different from him   I felt like a bad person the whole time   It's a really hard book to read   If you read it expecting something different you'll be disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is filled with contradictions of truth, such as this:Â  If a man dies in bed, it is probably a good thing that it is a man. Â If he dies after eating a meal, it was probably good that it was a woman  .   That seems a bit of an odd reason to keep a man and a woman together  ." So it is written, but then is followed by a chapter titled "Is the Book of Mormon a Literary Piece of Shit?"   In this chapter, it argues that the book is a literary piece of shit, which is a bit much considering how long this book is.   So if it is "a piece of bullshit" what about the other three?   Also, the entire story is completely wrong, as the book says that God and Moroni are the same, yet the book makes it clear that God is a more powerful deity.  3/22/16:  I am trying to remember the date of this book when I read it and it is 3/22nd. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first part of the book was boring, but it wasn't that bad, just meh.   I do like this book, though.  It's not as good as a lot of other sci-fi, but I'll still read it to the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is hard to put down a book about a horrible family.   The author does try to make it more likeable though, but at the end it is all about the horrible family:  Â  I really can't even describe what a disappointment this book is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is my first experience with a self-help book.   The author tells you how to make a fortune by "creating your own reality."   It's just another excuse to make you feel better.  I found it to be very distracting and hard to follow. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a good story, with a lot of emotional ups and downs.   I love when science fiction gives us a story that is not about the future, but about our present and what the future may bring.  This is not a sci-fi story about aliens, but a story about our relationships and pasts.  It is also a story of the effects of war, of how war can change a family and how that change impacts our lives.  I had a good time, and think I may go back and read this in print at some point. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book's title is a clue:  Â  The book is about a guy who has been arrested three times and convicted of a felony for driving with a suspended license.   He gets a second chance to do a good deed, but then has to go back to jail for another one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have never seen a good movie about an ugly book.  Â This one's pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The ending is horrible, and it's a pretty lame ending as well.   It was an ending I found extremely disappointing.  The characters are basically left on the ground by the book.  You should be able to do better than this, especially when it is essentially the same thing in two different books.  This book is the epitome of lazy writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best way I can describe this book is, as you say, 'a terrible attempt at historical accuracy'.   I found that it was impossible to believe any of the accounts from the various authors who supposedly lived through the events in question.   Each had their own story that they put together to create a 'history' in which they were supposed to be the real heroes.  For example, I was so confused about the fact that the King Arthur legend has become a Christian tale after so many retellings that it took me several years to put together the pieces.  I even called up my local library to look up an obscure reference about Arthur being a Christian.  It turns out they only have a small collection of Arthurian legends.  As a side note, I am glad my son never has to deal with a teacher who thinks that Arthur is a pagan who is trying to keep the 'dark' in the light. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to like this book but couldn't. It was not a good read  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is just bad. I tried reading it and I think it's basically an excuse to say that it's okay to get drunk.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book.   It is poorly written, the plot is poorly developed, it's very difficult to like,   it is boring and doesn't even try to be engaging.  I tried to finish it but it wasn't my cup of tea and I got it for free in a contest. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A poor first book about a poor first year in college.   I would have been much happier with a good historical fiction book about college life and its challenges. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you want to make a story that is so good that people will listen to it over and over, don't make it so bad that it becomes an annoying, boring, and uninteresting read.   I hate to say it, but I felt like I could've finished it in under an hour. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about an American girl with a lot of attitude. It's about how American kids have become a lot tougher since the 70's, and I thought she had grown a bit of a backbone by now.   But, to put it mildly, the author doesn't have the ability to write a character that isn't an idiot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a huge fan of the book until I found out the story was false and that the book was a hoax.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I opened up the book I was a bit worried about what I was going to find, but I thought it was fine.   The first three stories were about a high school class that played in a big field and had to move the playing field back when the grass was grown too long.  I found this a little weird, but it was good.  It was a nice change of pace.  However, the last two stories were a bit odd and almost didn't make sense.  First the main character was getting a girlfriend from the school who was a big ballerina. Then there was a guy whose favorite food was cheese pizza.  But this wasn't a good enough story for me, so I skipped that and kept going to the main story.  If you can get past these problems the stories are good.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    An excellent book that is not about the war, and therefore can be ignored. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "This book was written by a woman who was raised Catholic and later became a Jehovah's Witness (in the Christian faith), but she still finds the story in the bible hard to accept: I read this book, and it made me feel really uneasy, in a good way... She gives us the answers to life's mysteries. I also liked the way her point of view reflected the way I see the world.   It's the only book I can think of that has a point of difference in the views, yet it all adds up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have no idea why so many people have a problem with this book.  I had no problem with it until about a third of the way through.  A couple of characters have been dead for a hundred years.  They are the last survivors of a civilization that was devastated by a meteor.  This isn't a story of the future, it's a story about the past.  At one point a character says, " We were a people of hope, but now our only hope is in the void"   This is a pretty accurate description of what we were trying to say when we were discussing the Book of Revelations.  But the author, and he has other talents, decided to change the meaning of these words and make it a commentary on the world we live in today.   The other characters get to come back a little too early, so there are some annoying moments where their names don't match with what is said in the story.  However the characters come back so early in the book that it becomes kind of silly.  It's like when you have a headache and think about a headache the whole time.  All I can say is that this is not a good book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book on a whim one day (after I had finished a few good books, a good short story and a good book on the subject of a dog named "Furry").   My dog is very friendly, but can also be rather mean if you're not paying attention.   In this book, this very mean aspect is shown through a very good story.  The story is of a girl who is a very close friend to a little puppy.  She is extremely protective and tries to make sure that he does not get hurt or hurt others when he misbehaves.  It is the owner who is the bully here.  While he is a good dog (and I would argue that he is as good as the one from the story), it is obvious that the girl is getting on his nerves with her constant requests to be taken with her.  And the dog is definitely getting on her nerves. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing better than a good book is a bad one that you find.    " The only way to know you are on to something is to write about it."  If I had one critique, it's that the book is long and I would have liked it to be shorter.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is bad.   I got bored fast, especially with the characters not doing anything but sitting around in this one room talking about the weather.  I felt really disconnected from the book's characters and from the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave this a 3-star review, but I'm not sure I can go back to the good ones.  I'm giving it a 3/5 because I think the author's approach to her subject was a little off (she just felt she needed to be in the kitchen every time someone was baking cookies)  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is not about a book. It is about a person, a flawed, and ultimately unfulfilled soul.   As a person who does not know a soul, but can read at least the basics, I can honestly say I could not have come up with something less interesting than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I was a kid in high school, a good friend introduced me to a book about the Holocaust. It was very good and a little funny, so I bought a hardcover copy. The "Holocaust" part was very dry and did not interest me at all.   It is very hard to get into the Jewish perspective of the Holocaust, because Jews were not the victims of this holocaust but the perpetrators. I guess I just didn't like the holocaust part as much as I liked the comedy parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was really good for me because it was the first thing I looked at when I was looking for a good book about women's issues, especially reproductive rights.   But, I was a bit disappointed that this wasn't a feminist book as I had expected it to be, although I am glad it was not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a classic of "What the Hell did I get myself into?"   I bought it thinking it was a good book, a good "solo" read, but it is a terrible book with poor plotting and no real twists at the end.   This is a book that the author tries to be funny and fun, but fails to pull it off and fails to make the story worth a second look. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been reading some interesting articles about the recent surge of interest in the "paranormal" by many people.   (I am not one of these people).   They write of a certain set of experiments that have been done on the "power of the human mind" and suggest that the mind could be accessed through the use of drugs.  I think this is an important topic but not one that I can find much information about.  In any event, this book is interesting.  It is a brief, very short summary of some very strange events.  The most interesting aspect is the idea of the two psychics who were involved in the whole affair. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While the plot in this book is rather weak and poorly developed I found myself actually enjoying it very much and it gave me many ideas about how to write my own novels.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think this book is a piece of garbage, written by an incompetent author who knew nothing about a topic he tries to cover in the first two pages.  The first chapter is an introduction to a person who has committed suicide,   and   this person is described as a mentally disabled, but apparently quite intelligent person.   The rest of the book is dedicated to the case of the man who died.  I found a few facts about the case, but the rest were either not important at all or simply irrelevant to the situation.  One problem is that  it is obvious this person had a mental disorder, and not just a condition that could be cured with medication or therapy.  It is easy to understand how the story may sound plausible if there were such a thing as "mental illness" or "mental retardation."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book really needs to be read, as I found it hard to connect with the characters.  It wasn't so bad that I thought she was going to come back from a long absence in the books, but it was clear that she'd had some time.  I was pretty disappointed that it wasn't a "classic" like the other ones.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have no complaints about this book: it's got a lot of good information and it's interesting.   For instance, a recent article in Science suggested that we should consider the existence of 'unwanted genes' (e.g. those responsible for hair growth, eye development, and intelligence) in order to understand how genes may contribute to mental disorders.  In my opinion, this has nothing to do with human development: it is not a disorder in itself and does not affect normal development. Â Rather, it is a disorder of development of the brain/nervous system (the 'unexpected' development of a cognitive function which is not normally developed in the embryo).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   ... The main character has a bad case of "phantom limb" syndrome -   This book is a very poorly written and poorly conceived book. It is also, I feel, a very poor example of what I mean by a "ghost story".   I was so disappointed that I did not read the whole of this book - it was a real chore.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not like this book at all.   The story itself is really stupid.  There were a lot of unanswered questions at the end that make no sense to me.  It's a great book, just not my cup of tea. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited for this book and so disappointed in it    This book was so bad it was fun to read   It was a really fun adventure to read the way it was written   Well, for the first time in my life, I actually got a bad experience at a book party   -
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is hard to get to know a man.   His personality is the kind that keeps a man grounded to the people who are close to him.  He has never been on a plane or a boat and I can understand why that would take his mind off business, but it does.  A lot of it is his own fault though.  At the beginning of the book he was at the office and the people at the agency he was working for, all seemed cool and fun to be around.  As he gets further into the story he becomes more and more frustrated with his company's inability to keep its promises, and the fact that he's being forced to work on a project that is very unlikely to work out in the end.  Then there's the whole issue of the guy being an unprofessional ass. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A poorly-written, confusing book with no conclusion.   I would read another book on the subject but am not interested in writing another one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is interesting to read the article about the book on the bookseller's website, but I thought it was a little dry and boring.   As I said earlier, I really wanted to read this book because I have read a lot of good books about a subject which I am interested in and I wanted to learn more. I bought the book because the author was an excellent professor at a very prestigious university in the U.S. (I am a post-baccalaureate grad student).   I was very disappointed to learn that the book wasn't as good as I was promised and that I wasn't able to make my way around the course material. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was interested in this book because I was looking for a good example of the "Fantasy" genre.  The book has some "good" elements and it's a good read but the bad aspects of the story and characters just make the book a bore.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had an interesting experience reading this book and was very interested in hearing more from the author.   As I said in the title the book is more about a small group of people than a larger community.  Â  This was a good book to read on a chilly evening. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a massive waste of time and money.   I went through this book several times to understand how it worked and when my instructor mentioned something about the magnetic strips it was just so wrong.  It was hard to get out from under the table.  So I don't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I started this book with an extremely high opinion about it.   The author clearly enjoys writing about women, which is all well and good, but the book does not take a single female character that is interesting and takes the majority of the time in the story to talk about what a terrible person she is.  She is so obsessed with her appearance and appearance only has one other female character even mentioned who even has a bad attitude about how she looks.  And what is wrong with being an obsessed "hater"?   In addition to the "self-help" she recommends,  she also recommends a whole host of self-hating techniques which are also all well-meaning.  Also, she is trying to convince a male character to give up and not "hate himself" for the way he looks or how he is perceived by others but he decides to go on with his life no matter what.  Â    She also gives the reader a huge "bless your heart" lesson.  The last chapter had her telling her own story about how awful she was and how she hated herself.  I have never met anyone who is so desperate to be better, or worse, than the way they are.  This book should be renamed "I don't have good self-esteem".  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had heard nothing about this book until i came across the reviews.  It started off ok, but quickly lost any steam.   It's not a bad read, but the writing style really just reminded me of some of the bad books i've read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author's ideas are very interesting and very useful, but I felt her book failed on at least two fronts:  First, it is very hard to get a grasp on the whole picture in any real depth.   Even though the author tries to put the whole thing together using the best evidence, there's just so much data scattered all over the place that the reader has a hard time grasping the whole and, for the most part, she ends up just making stuff up as she goes along.  Second, the book is just so incredibly wrong.  I have to wonder, is she just ignorant of the actual evidence or is she deliberately confusing it to fit her point of view?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this as a "fantasy/sci-fi" book to read in a special kindle edition.   It is a fun read, but the characters are very generic and don't have much depth or motivation.  The female characters are basically "sexy men".   The only thing I liked was the use of technology, especially when the woman does a bunch of crazy things.  It's also got a LOT of weirdness that I have never seen in a fantasy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book   but not the other book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My wife and I recently bought a copy of this book   and   We read it in about 2 hours   It was pretty bad.   The first 50 or so pages   didn't really bother me too much   but then it kept going and going   the same   thing happened over and over again   I found it   annoying   And the other guy?   What is he even doing   if he has a book he needs to read? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main character is not likable.   She seems very lazy, but this is because she has her priorities in the wrong place.  She has to look after her son, so she can be a stay at home mom to him.  I just wish she would have a few better choices of what she wanted for dinner. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so bad I don't want to read it at all.   It starts out great: a simple story of a boy in a circus and his friends and his feelings about the circus.  But then the story loses all of its momentum and it becomes tedious.  The character never learns anything, which is a common problem in this genre.  I feel sorry for the main character because the author has never had a real lesson in writing: he has always known how to write something interesting and entertaining but never learned a lesson.  This is also a lesson in laziness, because the main characters are given the same little stories time and time again.  It makes me wonder if the writer is as lazy as he thinks he is.  What is the author trying to say?   In conclusion, it's a good book that takes a few more steps to get there, but it doesn't deserve the 7 stars it has gotten. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main problem was the plot.   It was poorly executed and at times poorly written.  The setting, the main characters and the whole plot were just a lot to swallow. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read one or two other reviews of this book that criticize it for being repetitive, but this is one of the most boring of the "goodie two shoes" series.   And this is the first book, not to mention the most common of the books.  This story was just so, so boring.  The most entertaining part of the book was the second book,  but that's it.  My favorite character in the book is "The Girl With The Red Hat" who has been the only one I have ever liked.  I found myself reading the story again and again just to see if it is really me who is reading.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book thinking it would be funny. Instead it was very hard to take it seriously. The humor is pretty weak.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â I have heard of several books that have had positive reviews, yet I have not read them. This one I did read. The book seemed well written for the time period and that is part of the reason I read it.   The book follows the adventures of a group of travelers in the New World, and the story is told in a third person perspective. This book is more of a history book than a adventure story.  One thing that I found interesting was that this was the second time the author tried to write about the Indian people in his book.  I have never heard of a book written about a country without any reference to the Indian culture and I am sure that I have missed some things in this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't believe that God is a "good guy", but it would be good to know that God has not put a human in hell.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read a lot of books over the years, and all of them are terrible!    This book was so poorly written I just gave up at the end.   It doesn't have a lot going for it but there was a lot there that was so dull and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author has written more than 10 books.   He has never been good at making a good story with his characters.  But, in this book he tried to do so with a heroine he could write.  (You get the impression he's always going to the bathroom when he has to pee.  The heroine just wants to be loved. )   So I will leave a positive review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love this book, but don't really recommend it for younger readers.   It was very difficult to read because of the grammar and grammar problems in the writing.  I can not see how this is a book about the Lord of the Rings, and that there is a difference between "fantasy" and "rpg"  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first two chapters are basically a recap of some of the previous books (though they do make the first few chapters in general seem a little bit redundant) before the story picks up pace (the pace that has been built up so long, it has taken its toll)   Unfortunately, all the buildup does not translate into a compelling story.   A lot of the "history" is completely wrong:  The Vikings were not the first people to "sneak" in on the Aztecs, who did not have writing until the 5th century and had no idea how to use it.  The Aztecas did not "take over" the Iberian Peninsula until the 11th century.  It is true that they were the first to use the bow and arrow, but they did so on the battlefield.  They did not conquer Mexico until the 18th century (more like 1475, depending on who you believe).   Not to mention the fact that the Aztec religion was NOT founded by Tlaloc/Huey, it was founded by Tezcatlipoca.  Another false "history".   Another point:  the Aztlan was NOT a real place but rather a legend.  What people are seeing and hearing on television is a lot of "history", but it is mostly legend. This story is based more on legend than on fact.  One last false point: Â   The Book of Mormon is a history.  This is a good thing:  Mormons believe that the book of Mormon was actually a history written by Moroni himself.  To have a history as a book is actually a very good thing in the Christian world (because the bible is actually history written after the events occurred, as is a large part of the Koran).  If you don't believe that it is history, you can read about it elsewhere in a general sense.  Â  The plot is nothing special.  So, what's so bad about this book?  The plot is basically a retelling of the events from the previous two books, but this time, the Azts are the "bad guys" and they are coming after the Aztes.  There are no real new characters.  No new places.  Just more history. The plot does not go anywhere, and does not have a conclusion.  As a historical fiction, this book does not hold up:  In my opinion, the story is

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think this is a very poor book. I would recommend the more recent "The End of Faith" over it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was going to give this book a negative rating but I couldn't. I know it was not the best novel that the authors put forth, but it was the only one I could find online.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got a very limited edition of this book and got it in a big box.   It was a very good book for the money but not worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If it was not for the fact that it was written by someone else and then edited by someone who has a poor grasp on the subject matter, I would have loved it.   The writing style is clumsy, and the book is almost devoid of information on the science of the phenomenon that the book attempts to explain.  It also makes the author look like a hack, as he spends a whole chapter talking about how the "scientific community" is making these changes to the way we look at things.  I think it is really important to know that this is not the first time that the term has been used.  The idea that something that is known and accepted is being changed in a way that is not agreed upon is a common belief in the scientific community.  But as I wrote above, the author's approach to the subject is almost the opposite, and it really shows.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There was a lot of good stuff in here, but I wasn't a huge fan of this book.   I would love to have read this book on tape before I watched the show, but that is not the case.  I enjoyed reading the book as a companion to the show. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have always wanted to read this book. I love the concept, and the concept is great. But the execution is horribly flawed. It was difficult for me to read because there was so much information that was crammed into every page. The writing is so amateurish that it made me feel like I was reading the product of a novice. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I started reading this book, I was worried that this book would be the worst book in the world. I was right.   I was hoping the book would have been entertaining, but it just wasn't.  I thought it was going to have a lot of surprises and surprise endings.  It was a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this was going to be something different. I really didn't expect it to be as terrible as it was. It was terrible, even by the low standards of this type of story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is an amazing story about a very unfortunate man (who is a genius) and a wonderful woman (who should have listened to her husband) but got very very caught up in the whole thing and became just another victim, who got the blame for her husband's death and lost all of her money and possessions as a result.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so unoriginal and doesn't even come close to being an effective introduction to programming.   The only useful things it teaches are:  1) a way to add new lines (like #define to avoid collisions with already defined functions)  2) a quick and dirty way to test the correctness of a compiler in a trivial way (e.g. if a constant is not equal to a constant, the compiler is wrong)  3) a simple way to "test" the correctness and the length of a loop (as a first-order polynomial)  4) a very good and simple way of converting a binary string to an ASCII string (that is also very good for doing binary-to-ASCII translation)  5) a much better way to do the first point (you can even write it in assembly if you want to)  6) a little more useful information about the C language   I hope someone will come up with a better way than writing in assembly. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst book I've ever read.    It's as if the author made a very poor attempt at a horror story, and instead came out with a series of badly written, incoherent nonsense.  It is so poorly written and written badly that it doesn't even deserve to be called a horror novel.  I can't give a good review because the writing is so bad that the reader would be hard-pressed to determine the point of the story, much less to tell what is horror and what isn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because a fellow reader recommended it to me and I figured, why not? I was hoping for a good book but instead I got something that had some good ideas but had the same problem as the many others: it was all based on a self-help book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In retrospect, it was a mistake to get the first copy.   It does include a lot of interesting information and information that I can't find in any book I have read.  I am a college student but I never took time to study.  Even after all these years,   I do not read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a huge fan of the original Ender's Game and the first three books of the series.   However    the last two books   did not have the   quality   of the first two books,   Ender's Shadow   is a mediocre   read.  It's difficult to know where to start.  The story starts off with an introduction that is just ridiculous.  It's one of those books where you know that's a bad idea, but are so caught up in it that you keep wanting to keep reading.  There are several scenes where Ender is getting an erection, which I find to be ridiculous, as an adult you get a hard on a lot more often than you get an erection in high school.  I'm glad they went with a scene like that.  As if we weren't confused enough with the plot already, the author then tells us that we have to remember that Ender is a genius, and a bit off, and thus he may not be able to relate to a teenage girl.  Well, let's get real.  Ender is in first grade.  How did he even get a job in a science lab, and how was he even in the room when the test was being done?  He is only going to be fourteen at the start of the story and he can't have been in high-school chemistry classes to learn all about what happens when two people get into a fight?  There is one scene in the book where the main character goes into the basement and says "I'm not in school" and is told "Not in school?"  How can he go in the basement, and say "I have no plans to be in school," if he hasn't been in school the past five years?  As for the teen girls, we are told by the author that they're interested in the main male character.  Again, if you have no idea what I'm talking about here, we already know that he's gay.  What we are now supposed to do is find some evidence of the girl's attraction to Ender in the books, and this is when we find out that it's because he is different.  No.  Not at all.  He's just not the type of girl that will be interested in someone who is different from her.  And how about the fact that the girl who is going to become his lover is a girl whose "gen
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is atrocious.   I'm sure I could fix some typos and make it a little less boring and tedious, but not if I have to read it over and over and then have to make myself concentrate and learn a new word for the first time to avoid having to repeat myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The "good" book is very much in need of a good editor, who can use her or his brain a little to make a better story.   I can't wait to read the next one, too!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about the relationship between the protagonist, a woman, and a boy in a family, the boy is the son of her deceased husband.   This book is just a sad attempt to justify a negative relationship in a relationship, and I think that many people can relate to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For anyone who's into fantasy this is a great read  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The premise of the story is a good one: a group of teenage girls from a small town are being stalked by a killer.   Unfortunately, the killer turns out to be an   psychotic rapist   who is a sociopath. Â Instead of making the girls realize how   fucked they are,   the killer makes them realize   that it's their   own fault   for being   stupid   about how Â to avoid being killed by a dangerous psycho   He takes a girl hostage and forces her to tell him why she liked him.     Well, no.  I was expecting to like this story, but instead it fell a bit flat.  And I know that I'm supposed to hate rapists who don't get caught.  It doesn't matter that this was a fictionalized account:  a woman  should know better than to trust a man, not a crazy psychopath, who is going to  rape and kill her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author has very little respect for his audience.   After his book was released the publisher told us that "this is not a good book.  It's the book  he has   "   (we don't  )   What   he   wanted was for  his book to be as successful as his previous ones, not  to be compared with   the success of other successful   authors. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about a group of very different people from all over the world who all have an innate ability to connect with each other and love each other.   However, there is one very minor difference in their outlook on life which makes their love very different:  In the American culture, the only people that get to love are the people you were born to love.  The only people you're allowed to love, in your culture, are the ones that you were always meant to love (because they were raised to be a certain way by their parents, and because your parents were raised in a certain society).  When you try to create your own love in a world that doesn't give you that privilege, it's impossible to do so.  And so when the people of the group try to do it, they don't get it right. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The problem with this book is that it is nothing but a bunch of "says."   I would be willing to accept that a little of the information given is false, but the "theories" that come to light about the real history of this book are not particularly useful.   It is quite obvious that this book was written for the purpose of getting money from readers, but it is also quite obvious from the style of writing that the author had been "told" what the story was all about.  So much information was left out of this work.  My favorite part was when the characters are forced to travel through time to save one person's life - which would have made the story much more interesting 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a horrible book. It was written to sell a bad product.   It starts off by saying that we are going to discuss the history of the British Army, its origins, its weaknesses and failings, the rise of the Army, and the British and European response to the Nazi regime in Europe.  It then goes into the problems of the war from the start - the lack of air cover, lack of the ability of air raid shelters in England, lack sufficient food supplies, poor logistics, poor communications, and so on.  These problems had been addressed, of course, but they are still evident to this day.  Then the book goes into a discussion of the War Measures Acts, which led to a series of legislative measures in response to Germany and Nazi Germany: the suppression of free speech in Germany, the establishment of the SS, the creation of the Holocaust, and of course the execution of tens of thousands of political and military opponents.  The British took a leading role in this response, but other European nations were also very involved.  This book seems to be primarily an effort to sell an idea, the idea that the British, because of their history, history as an army and its flaws, had a right to be better than the rest.  Unfortunately this idea is based on lies, half truths and outright falsehoods.  I am sure that the authors hope that their book will be used to convince others that the Army can be fixed.  They certainly can't. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so badly written that I have to believe that the author wrote it on the spot, in a feverish hour-long sleep.   The author gives a very superficial explanation about the effects of caffeine in coffee, making it sound like an addictive drug.  Instead, caffeine is a stimulant which prevents you from sleeping, and the effects are negligible.  The idea of the caffeine is that if you take a couple of cups before bed, it makes you sleep longer.  There is no evidence that the effect is real, and I doubt that the effects would last for more than two hours. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only good thing about this book is that it is written in the first person from the perspective of a teenager.   It feels like a teenage girls' diary, and when you are a teenage girl your diary is going to be about a lot of things that you don't really want people to know about you.  It is an odd choice to write about yourself at such an age, but hey, she was 16. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read many books about history, and this one is by no means the best.   In the original book (included in the paperback edition) the only information given was "It was a short, hot summer day, and the children got into a fight because their mother wouldn't wash the dishes."   The same book has an account of what happened on the day the Civil War began.  The Civil War was very short, and only lasted a few weeks. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had heard good things about this book but it did not live up to the hype.   In spite of the good reviews, it was a mediocre book.  I have just finished reading a book by a well-known author that was very successful, in spite of a number of missteps.  It did not have as good a start as the original "Harry Potter" or any book by the original author,  it was also a little too much like a kid's book. The hero and his father had a lot of problems.  When they got to school,  they had to get over the old habits they had of playing in the mud or in water,  and then the boy started acting like the big brother he was.  They were supposed to go back to their room,  but the big sister would take them away  and get them wet.  Then she would say they should wash themselves.  In other words, it sounds like the book was written by a young girl,  a lesson which the main character never learned.  This is not a criticism against the book,   in fact the author was the same in both books and it is just a matter of taste. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book should be reviewed by its author for two reasons:  1) It's a book for children, which is what it is,  2) It is the only one of the four I have that was published before 1960 and still   is a very good book that is worth having around  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In some way, the worst part about this book is not that the story is weak or doesn't work (it's actually pretty good), it's that the authors clearly do not understand their subject.   The main reason the author chose a fantasy setting is to get her ideas across in a way that feels appropriate and believable.  The first two chapters of the book are just that, but then the magic comes and things go wrong.  At least that's how it feels to me.  I feel like the author should've known better, but I can understand if she did because she doesn't know how to do it correctly.  Also, I'm not a fan of a lot of the "it's not really about these things" plots in fantasy.  For instance, here, the book is about a character's journey to understand his origins and his connection to the forest.  And even though the author does this well, she gets sidetracked.  When a character is a healer, and she suddenly finds her powers.  This feels like the writer took the wrong approach in choosing this world because she didn't know it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not the one you want, but it has some value to it. I tried to read the rest of it, but the chapter I needed was just another thing about the family and the other characters and how they relate to each other. It took me to a chapter of another book about another family that I wanted to go back and read for some value.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So...the premise is that some people can't hold a steady job so they have to work in a fast food restaurant (the owner's son) to make ends meet.   It's pretty bad and I'm sure there were other ways to do it other than that...   Also...how are they supposed to have a steady schedule if they don't have enough money for gas, food, and the like?   This book is about people being able to get paid and make their own schedules and goals, that's all I'm saying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's not very good. It's a good read as an introduction to the idea of how a company operates. It is good in describing the structure of a corporation, how the company functions, and the decisions of executives and managers.   This book is not for beginners:  The book doesn't go into much depth in explaining how a corporation is structured.  It is only vaguely described how a large corporation might work.  One thing that bothers me is how there is a huge amount of confusion on how a business works.  From the end of the book  I wanted to read it again to get an idea of the actual structure. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a complete train wreck, with absolutely no logic or sense.   I've never found any good reason to read any of the "science fiction" books in a genre where a huge amount of them seem to be about a person with no free will   They just end up being some kind of a sci fi version of Star Trek   and just end the same way   As for the characters   the lead was a totally unrealistic man, i don't understand why they had to turn him into a girl   just so we could have the female lead in a fantasy setting   Why is it that a story always gets better when it turns from fantasy to science fiction  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is very interesting but not very enjoyable.   I like the concept of the concept, but i didnt enjoy reading this book.  I have a lot of sympathy for the author and the concept is interesting but ill go back to my first books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As an art historian and a scientist of the mind, I was expecting more. This is, quite honestly, an example of "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." In the end, the whole exercise is a mess, including the "controversy" over the source material and a large number of the claims made. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this on the recommendation of a fellow librarian at an excellent university.   Although I enjoyed it and find it interesting,   the plot is a mess and the characters are flat and uninteresting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â The thing about this book is that it's so bad that it can't even be called a bad one.   It's not the worst of the bunch, but neither is it good.  It doesn't even come close to being "good" like you'd expect from a novel, it's just so very, very,  Why I won't be reading more fantasy:  This is a "fantasy" book that was written in 1990 (a mere 20 years ago).   And for some reason I still can't see the appeal.  In fact, if you're one of those people who thinks a good fantasy book can never exist in this century then this is a good example of how right you are.  This book is so bad it's almost a little funny.  There are so many characters who can be described as "characters" but are totally lacking in personality.  They're so unlikable that their existence in the book seems like a joke.  I mean, why would any "good guy" ever trust a "bad guy" like that?   They would rather put up with some annoying bad guy than actually listen to some good guy speak.  The biggest offender in this regard is the elf who can basically be described in three words:  "  He's annoying."  This one really kills any appeal to my inner teenage girl.  One of the worst offenders is the prince who is annoying as hell.  He makes every other person in the story so much easier to hate.  Yes, he's very handsome, but so what?  There is no substance to his character.  No story.  His actions are so boring that I wonder if he has a twin brother.  A twin brother who is a total "bad ass" who never gives up and never dies and gets everyone killed  So you've got a princess who's the princess and you've also got a prince who can't say anything nice about anyone except for "HE'S AMAZING" and then he's dead.  How is this story supposed to be interesting?  A good "fairy tale" book should at least make you feel something.  " Oh it's a story about good vs evil"   Instead it's all about how annoying the bad guy is and how annoying everyone else is.  At least you get to watch the bad guys get killed.  What's with the whole "good guys
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book as a high school freshman.   What a horrible book to write!   It's a waste of time, with no real purpose.  This book has absolutely no character development whatsoever!  The author really seems to have nothing more than an opinion about people, which is just wrong for a book about a group of high school teens.  The whole time, the author is making fun of them.  I'm sorry but that's not going to do anything for me.  They really just seem to have little else in life in a world full of drugs and rock n roll.  So the author gives up his dreams of making a million bucks and going to college, and instead works at a fast food chain.  Why would you do that?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a poor example of a good fantasy novel. The author attempts to bring a strong, unique character to life. Unfortunately, the author's vision of the character is rather weak. In fact, the writing is so bad that the character suffers from the illusion of depth.   The main character is a fairly unremarkable sort. She is a priestess of the mysterious Order of the Radiant Heart and a friend to many. When the hero learns of the evil in the world, she asks to be brought in.  To put it bluntly, the book reads like a synopsis of a mediocre movie:  It is a slow, confusing ride that doesn't seem to want to pick up any pace. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main problem is that it wasn't very interesting.   Â  It's been a while since I've seen a book that didn't feature some form of war story and this was no different.  It's a story that I know a bit about, but that's about all it did to convince me.  Even though I had a copy of the book, I'm not sure that I would have read it if it wasn`t for my grandfather`s book (I read it in the 1980s).  It was the same story, same characters, same settings.  This was the first book that I ever saw George Saunders writing about the war in Iraq.  I don't know why Saunders chose to write a book about the Iraq War in the 90s. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In summary I hate this book.   The main character was really obnoxious about it being a historical novel.  The other character was also annoying about not being able to live through the war.  They were also both very loud about how bad it was.  If you're going to have a historical book about World War II then do what you can to make the book sound more like an episode of "The West Wing" than a serious historical work.  Otherwise this is a book that you could read about World Wars one, two, and three and think "what the heck was that about?"

Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's about a man that kills a couple of people in the park.   You're supposed to think it's awesome and amazing but really its boring.  It was like I was reading an action movie about people going around killing people.  The guy was so obsessed with being a hero that he got caught up in the whole thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked this book, but it was kind of boring.   This is the second book I've read by Brian Jacques that I didn't enjoy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book after having been a member of the "Feminist Press Group" for several years.  It was very interesting, and I found many examples that I did not think about until I read it.   One example:  "It is hard to get rid of feelings when you have spent so much of your life feeling them."   But that is not the point of feminism.  You can't be a feminist if you don't call yourself one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As far as bad novels go, I really think that this is a bad novel.   It does a bad job of being a novel   and is a rather dull book that seems to be just doing the same things that it did in the 90's. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a terrible book.   The book starts off well enough with the description of a ship that went missing.  The description gives it a pretty nice feeling of adventure.  Then the characters are introduced.  When they finally go on the ship, the first thing they do is eat lunch.  So how about that adventure. They travel to a very small town.  After the food is gone, they walk over to a tavern.  They are invited in.  Their hosts ask for a "special" drink.  We were supposed to feel something in this book, like an excitement.  But the adventure is so much rubbish, I was bored.  I would not recommend this book to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've been looking to read a book that has lots of great details about the American Revolution but also tells the stories of some pretty bad people and   (I've been waiting for this for some time)   the people who were   at the frontlines   were the worst   of all.   The book was a bit of a drag but the authors   and narrator did their   job   well

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very good book with an interesting concept. It's a story of a couple who went from loving parents to being unable to communicate with each other. They have had two years of therapy, with the husband's own therapist.    The book has some of the most interesting characters I've ever seen in a fiction novel.  The author seems to have learned from her own experience, because she makes us care about her characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "There are many good things in this book, but there are also several very bad things, most of them relating to the book's use of "scientific" facts.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    In any event, I just finished this book and it is a total pain in the a**.  I have been a fan of the books since I first read them in the 90's, but they never appealed to me.   Now it has all but died.  There are a lot of cliches that didn't hold up and it all came off as silly. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book that I was going to love but it just didn't live up to the hype.   I read it on my iPhone and the chapter that starts off "A Brief History of Western Civilization" was very confusing.  It doesn't make any sense that this ancient system of writing had a different system of alphabet than we use today.  The story doesn't follow the first book by Adam Smith.  Adam Smith is the originator of the concept that money should be easy to exchange for goods and services.  Smith wrote Wealth of Nations in 1776.  I love how the first person narrator describes this process in his own words.  In Adam Smith's Wealth of nations, he describes money as something that "was at first in the nature of a token of debt".  It was a way to transfer value without requiring a bank.  This sounds a lot like today, where the dollar is considered a "currency of account" that can be used to transfer wealth.  One thing that really bugged me about the story was how it seems like there was very little foresight by the author about how computers would affect the job market.  For example, the authors claim that the information age would increase wages, but in this era of computers and data storage, it would have a negative effect.  How could the technology be beneficial when it can be taken away at the push of a button?  So I was a little disappointed, but that's why I read books to pass the time.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    For a good story that doesn't have a happy ending, I found this book tedious and confusing, it took me over a year to get through it.   This book is about an autistic teenage girl. She is forced to be part of her family's funeral rites for a murdered relative. The family is very religious.  When the funeral procession reaches the cemetery, the procession stops.  The girl is confused as to why it is so quiet.  After a conversation about religion, the girl is shocked to learn that she was not allowed to participate in the rituals as she is autistic.  It is very odd that the girl was made part of the funeral rituals when she was unable to participate at all.  I am not sure if this book was a part of some religious ritual that I am unaware of, or the family was just very religious and it was something the girl wanted to do but was too shy to do.  This is a pretty hard book to get thru, but once you get through the awkward parts, you realize how much this book is a character study.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I've ever read:  First of all,  What kind of sick mind writes such a bad story?  The premise is   A girl falls in love with a guy who also loves her, but can't tell her why.   He does tell her   that he loves her but doesn't want to be with her.  It's not until after she   breaks up with him that she finds out what it's like.  What a crappy,   pointless love story.  Who the hell wants to live with someone you can't talk about why you don't love them?   It was just plain   mean   to her .   But most of all   disgusting  .
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title tells you what's about to happen, but not in the most obvious way.   "A man who thought he could run for president as a woman"   That's right, he's a woman pretending to be a man so he can run for President.  The plot is a mess: a man wants to run for office in a woman's body, and then when he gets the nomination is told that the woman's husband won't allow it.  But no problem, this "transgender" guy has a plan: he's going to convince everyone that he's actually a man, so the husband will let him run as a man and then his husband will "accept" him as a "woman."    If you know a story about a man pretending to take the woman form because he's worried about the husband's reaction (and you'll remember that this is a story from a guy's point of view, so it's not a surprise to find a female character getting involved), this is kind of like that, except it's all about male characters getting in trouble for having the same kind of problems.  I guess my problem is that it would be a fun twist if he were really a man.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a collection of stories told by a former teacher about her and a student who fell in love and then became a father figure to his son when he was about nine.   The best part of this book is that it shows you the truth about love and friendship. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a great book on the history of the American Revolution and its aftermath.   While I did find that the author seems to want to be able to give the reader as many of the details as possible, he gets more and more into the intricacies of politics and the Revolution, which he could have made a better story by adding. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a huge fan of Dan Brown's books.   While this one is not as good as the rest, it's still enjoyable.  One interesting part of the book is that Brown goes back and forth a bit with the first person narration. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot was dull, the characters bland, the dialogues bland, and the plot uninteresting.   It all started when my husband picked up this book for me.  I enjoyed a lot of the characters in this book, and I am hoping that they get more development in future books.  It is a good story, but I did not enjoy it as much as I thought I would. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The narrator is a bad narrator.    She uses an odd rhythm and uses the same word over and over again.  I thought it was meant to be a metaphor of her being a broken person because of a family drama.  But that's not what it is.  Â  It's a metaphor about her being broken from her family's actions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author was a nice man.   His book wasn't bad by any means.  He didn't try to sell it on being a "superhero book" or any other lame crap.  It's very good.  But in a way, it's a very bad book.  There is a lot of stuff that didn't happen.  I thought I saw some new ideas in the first half.  Instead, the first third is about how Superman has become more and more like the DC universe.  Then, by the end of the book, he's like the Marvel version.  The idea was fine, but it just became annoying.  A lot of the scenes in this book came across as written as if the author wanted to be super.  And at times, it felt like the author was trying to sell me on a superhero book, not one about a regular guy who fights crime. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is bad.   While there is some good info about this subject, there are no facts that aren't readily available.  There is one passage in the middle of the book about "a good book about the occult"  and it's been mentioned in the forum before.  It is a little too vague and doesn't tell us anything that isn't in other occult books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book years ago, but never read it. Now that it's free I'm going to start reading it. I found the characters annoying, but I thought it was funny when they acted like children.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book hoping for a nice, engaging read and a good review of the new canon of The Hobbit.   And I got those.  I thought I was going to be happy, but ended up wanting to rip the spine out of the book.  The language is often funny or clever.  (I think that is a good thing.  So many people talk in a manner that is completely ungrammatical.  It has the effect of making me wonder what is wrong with people.  But not a good one.)  But I'm not laughing.  No wonder these people don't get published. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The biggest downside of the book is that there are so many good stories about the time after the disaster that it's hard to believe you're even getting into the book (which would be better if it wasn't in the collection of disaster books in a box at a garage sale). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read the book, but found it lacking in character development, and so had to pass on the read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a mess, but the first few chapters were just good enough to convince me. However, it is a horrible book.   It started off okay, but everything that happens in it was terrible.  I was very disappointed.  It was all so bad that I don't understand how it ended up in print. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It doesn't matter what the title says. I don't understand how anyone can like this book.   The pacing is way off - it's not that hard to keep up.  A lot of pages pass and then you come back to a character you don't really like and wonder why you even bothered reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is really hard to understand the language that goes into this book. There is a lot of stuff to digest.   I've got to keep up to date with current events, but it's not that interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book and fell in love with it.   It is so true to life.  It was the same when I was younger and my mom used to read it to me.  I think it's the best book about girls I've ever read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you're a fan of the original and have a copy, you'll probably hate this.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I found out that this book was about a vampire hunter and his pet snake, I was ecstatic.   The first 2 or 3 chapters were great, but I got distracted by the plot and what happened later.  I was hoping that we'd see a little more of the relationship between these two, but they never got any depth.  If you want to read about a hunter who has a monster for a pet, you can find many books like this, but this one was way too bogged down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is based on a true story about a teacher and a student (actually, a college student and a former teacher, who is in the process of making a name for herself teaching at a private school) whose relationship has turned into a series of escalating arguments and accusations that has now made it impossible for either of them to get a regular job in their field.   I've never seen such a dramatic and long-drawn-out case of infidelity between a teacher/student and the consequences it causes.  It's pretty hard to come to terms with the idea that such a strong and dominant woman with a great career is willing to do this to a girl who is not even a senior in high school (i.e. he is very old and her is young and inexperienced).   This is just not something you can turn your back on.  Unfortunately, it doesn't help that the book is almost entirely focused on the relationship and on the fact that the teacher is a very angry man.  However, the ending is very unsatisfying and, even though I didn't really like the characters, I still enjoyed the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so awful   It's really hard to explain   why it's so bad   it's really disappointing   but if you really like sci-fi/fantasy you might like it
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Â   I didn't like this book at all. It was a bad read because it took me far too long to read. I read part of it in the car and then forgot about it until I came home to it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I was a kid I tried reading this book.   I got through it in one sitting and found it to be tedious and boring.  The only good thing about this book is that it was written by a woman and is about a woman. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    An excellent work, but one that has nothing new to add to the genre  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read the first 5 pages of this book thinking I was going to like it, I read a bit about the author (a very interesting guy) and about a book I've read in the past (The Book of the New Sun)   it doesn't go for any of those things, but there's not a whole lot else I can say  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first chapter is the worst I've ever seen in a book,   This is the first book in the series by author Brian Staveley   and I am really disappointed   because his writing is terrible   he does a terrible job of describing   but his first chapter   in fact I think is worse than the second   of   theÂ  book   so bad   (This is a review about the first chapter not the entire book)  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a bad review    The worst story ever written   Why did she have to be a "girl" in the first place   Â    If I had known about this, I wouldn't have read this   It doesn't matter what the real reason is 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book and after reading the back cover, I was sold. But what a disappointment.   The first half of the book is quite good and the second half is very weak.  After about the third chapter, I dropped it.  The plot revolves around a woman, Mrs. H, who has a severe case of "toxic man syndrome" and becomes obsessed with a man who has no control over his life, including sexual encounters with other women.  I'm not sure how one would write a love story in such a way that the woman's obsession does not affect the men in her life.    I tried to give Mrs. L a good review but I just don't think she is all that attractive.  She's like the stereotypical woman with a taste for older men.  My only real complaint about this book is that the ending doesn't quite make sense.  As it turns out, the guy the women are having an affair with is the father of a deceased brother,  and the woman is actually trying to get rid of his brother so that she could marry someone else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was not a good book.  I wish that this book had been a free e-book that you could print out for your library.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've seen this book used as an example of how to do a character study of a person who's been "the bad guy" the whole time, but in reality it just fails so miserably to describe a person.   The reason the book is over-written is because they have to explain why the bad guy is the way he is.  In a movie you wouldn't need to explain everything about a character.  This book doesn't have that problem.  It's all explained in the first 15 pages or so. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think this book is great.   It's great to have something new to read.  However  the book starts out with a lot of unnecessary exposition and then the narrative just drags on and on,   while the characters  still seem to have nothing interesting to say and nothing to do.  There  is a certain  awkwardness  that the character  have  with  their  clothing  (but  I believe that  is  just a  little  bit  of   self-consciousness )   However Â   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most frustrating part about reading this book is that I am pretty sure I can figure out how the story went down.   I mean...you don't say "It was on a train in a strange place" to explain what you are going to write on a piece of paper on the train.  If it happened and they found the journal, I'm sure it would have been noted on the journal's pages somewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book and thought:  Â  "What was that about the author being a terrible author?   Â I'll never like him.   He should be a professional at this.  He won't do what he does best -  keep it simple, keep it short."   But this is not what it was about.  The book is about how the author was a bad reader.  It is about his experience with bad readers and the ways he learned to fix his bad reading.  He was a professional, but at the end of the day  He wasn't   he didn't 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would love to give this book a 5 star rating but I have to give it a 1/2 star for having too much "mystique" and not enough good information.  I was very excited about this book when I got it at the library as it was the first book about the War in Afghanistan that was written for an undergraduate audience.  The problem is that as soon as it began it had a lot of "mysterious" information that it seems not to have known before it was published.  It also has a lot that is a little too personal.   This book is a really good book about two soldiers who are there in the middle of this war but they are not doing much except killing each other.  They are not really heroes in any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â This book contains several obvious errors:  First, the first chapter of the book is about "how to make a good deal."  The chapter is about making a deal with a friend, not making a good bargain with a customer.   Second, the book does not mention the "one-hour rule" which says that if you buy a gift for a friend or family member (that is, someone you know really well), you must wait one hour before sending the gift.  The book tells you that there is a "hidden tax" when the "hidden" tax is not in fact hidden at all.  Third, I was unable to locate the source of the above-mentioned book, and the only reference I could find to this "hidden-tax" claim is in a book on marketing written by a former marketing person.  This makes the book appear to be nothing more than marketing PR, without any actual substance.  If the author is correct, the tax is on the item itself, and not the cost of the item. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as a freshman at Columbia University in a class where it was a requirement to read and discuss the works of Flannery O'Connor.   O'Conner was very much a part of our classes.  This book was supposed to be a review of the work, but I found it to be far more than a simple review.  There is a lot to discuss in this book, even if the reviews I read didn't agree with me.  It's very clear that Flannery never had any intention of writing a novel and this book was simply a way to help students understand the nature of her work.  Her descriptions of the characters and locations in her story seem like a great way to get students into the work. But at the same time, Flannery's language is so detailed that it can be overwhelming for a student to try to comprehend it.  I feel that she could have at least made the book more accessible by taking out as many descriptions of places and characters that didn't need to be mentioned.  And she could never write a more unmemorable novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "Dana is a young adult who is very aware of all of her shortcomings. I think she will grow to accept who she is. This book did not do this."   I enjoyed this book, but I was disappointed by the ending.   Overall, the premise was interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book, while a "good" book, is a bad one. It's an adventure book about a bunch of misfits and misanthropes (I like misanthropy) trying to save the world. While I have no problem with this book, I am disappointed in the lack of balance. The story is all about the adventures. The characters are the heroes, the characters are all in love with the hero, and the hero is the hero. It takes a while to find out that not everything is what it seems. When the heroes finally do discover that not every world is as nice as the last, it comes at the end of the book, with the villain being revealed.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a wonderful book about a great man and a wonderful woman, but I think that is it, the only reason I put it on my "recommended" list. I had read the other book  and  about him and I loved it so   that is why   I wanted to   read the rest of it  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The "Masters of the Universe" series is a complete waste of time.  The characters have all been killed off, and the book moves so slowly you feel like you are watching an old TV show.  I hope a few more of these "epics" are cancelled so the creators can take a long vacation, and start making good movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is hard to describe this novel without giving away its plot point.   The main character is a bit of a narcissist.  He is a brilliant scholar, a leader, and a great man.  However, he is also a self-righteous bully, who has a huge ego (which is often exploited to hurt people).   But the narcissist does eventually change and become a great person...sort of like a superman. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first third of the book was interesting. It was not as good as the first half of the first book. I really liked the idea that the people who were born with powers like time-travel were a minority, so they kept those powers to themselves.   But the second third, I was really irritated by this book. The whole "time travel can save the day" thing didn't really click with me, but I'm glad this book was the way it was, because it brought back some memories from the first two books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not very good at all. It has a very poor review by my mother, and it seems like she's only reading the parts that are bad.   It has very little to do with anything that's good in the bible  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is interesting, but I think it gets a bit messy in the end (it's like, why are they still doing this?)   And then it's like they got the idea to take this idea and use it on another book, but this time they wrote it in a much better way, so I actually like it better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really thought this book would be good.   In the interest of keeping it a short review, however, I couldn't put it down.  The story is told through the eyes of a child.  It is very, very difficult to accept that someone can be a person that is the opposite of what their parents would have them believe about their child's behavior.  I just wanted to slap my child when they got their butts kicked in kindergarten and to have them walk through a hall full of people in order to hide them from me and my wife.  Even more annoying is that my parents made up an imaginary friend to help them deal with the pain and frustration of their child. Â  My only hope was that I wouldn't be as helpless to help my children in a bad situation.  As it turns out, I wasn't the only one who found the book hard to take.  This book was pulled from the shelves in 2013. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked the first half of the book but the last half is a train wreck. The protagonist keeps saying that he is going to be a good leader and he makes me really worry about his mental state but there's a million reasons that people screw up.   The main one is that they have no idea what they're talking about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As I read through this book I had a lot of problems with it   A bunch of people don't like the main character but I think that is mainly because they don't understand what they are talking about   They are talking to the person who created this book   If he had been a real teacher   he would not have been put in charge of the first grade   It is also because of a misunderstanding about a certain phrase that people say   they get to talk about what they know so they have a lot to say 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One thing that irked me about this book was that the narrator, I believe she was based on a real person (and I think that is what the author wanted to do) is so much more articulate than the rest of the cast of characters she is speaking to.   I am still not clear on the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot, characters and story were all wrong.   I had no problem with it,   until   it was time to read it!   It had no suspense.  The writing was poor.  No character depth.  None of the characters got to be likable 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story was a good beginning but as the story progressed it became more and more dull and boring.   It has a beginning and a middle but the middle was way too long. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had been looking for a new book to read, and I found a copy of this in my library that was very inexpensive.   When I started reading, I was very disappointed.  It seemed like a book that was written by someone who wanted to make a very fast buck.  Â  I can see why they did not want to bother making this an interesting story.  After finishing the book, I felt bad that I wasted the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's like reading a page or two and then suddenly realizing "Oh yeah, I have to go back."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book   should   be   the   best   book .   I just wish it would have been written as a short story, not a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I have ever read  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was the most boring, repetitive book I've ever read. The stories about the other characters didn't make me believe that they really had to deal with that much.   The characters were just a bunch of stereotypical characters that were not very interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The "plot" is a bit of a joke:  There's some good in this book: there's the little side characters with their own story.  It is a well written book about a couple in a relationship, and their relationship, but not their marriage.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A terrible book with no redeeming qualities. I can't imagine how the author managed to get a publication by a major publisher.   This was so bad that I didn't want to bother reviewing it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book because I heard it was a good book and liked it a lot but I wasn't a big fan of the book.    It's like someone took a popular book and ruined it for the rest of us 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was very very very terrible.   The story was poorly written, was horribly over dramatic and felt extremely contrived.  I would NEVER recommend a book like this.  It was just very bad and it was like it was written by a 5 year old.  The narrator was so boring I didn't care about the story at all! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really disliked this book, it was terrible.   It was hard to read.  I'm glad I read it though. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â I have read a few horror novels in my life (and also a lot of non-horror ones), and this one was among the worst of them.   The characters were stupid, the story was silly, and the plot was unoriginal.  The book was made worse by being published in the same month as Harry Potter, which is a pretty major plus.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is terrible   It's the first book I ever read   I didn't realize that there were no more books in the series   In the next book the female protagonists are all raped   This has been done in other series 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is another classic "bad book" from an excellent author, a true master, an honest man who does not put his own feelings ahead of the public good.   He is not good for anyone, including himself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book for a very different reason than I read the others in the series (and none of them actually relate to this story). I read a lot of bad books (I'm a good story teller. But even I find a lot I don't like in a book).   There is one scene where a minor character dies and then we get flashbacks to when they died.   My question is this - what were they doing?   Why were they playing hide and seek when it was very dangerous? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was pretty good.   It was a bit slow, but the author seemed to have written it at one point for her self-published novel.  As the book is not at all a sequel to her first novel, she can probably skip a bit in the writing.  While the main characters are well developed and the romance does not feel forced, the book did not follow a particularly good plot.  This was also the last book for a while that she has been writing in. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book. I think there's something about having a woman in the story.   It's interesting, a bit of a romance novel I think, with the male characters having to play along or go along. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't like it very much.   It starts off well enough, with a couple of good mysteries and a mystery that's good in the first 30 pages (though I donï¿½t get the clues), but the rest of the story is a mess of half-baked twists and inconsistent plot.  Itï¿½s like someone read my mind.  I had to keep rereading the same information to make sure I wasnï¿½t misreading something, even though it's the same thing. Â I donï¿½ve ever read anything so slow that it took me three days to finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is bad.   It is a story about a little girl who learns a bad lesson when her grandfather takes her to the library to borrow a book about a bird.  But what is a bad thing?   Is it a bad habit, or is it a good lesson? Â To answer that question, let's take a look at a few other bad habits and lessons. Â First of all, there are many bad habits that come in handy every once in a while.  In this case, the bad habit is a habit of reading books and not learning much.  You don't think too hard about it.  After a while, it just gets too boring.  Now, the good habit is taking something from the library and not taking something that you actually want.  Â   This is a similar case to a bad one.  It's a bad practice to go to the book store to buy a book you don't want.Â    Then we have the bad lesson of buying books when you donno what you are looking for,  It can be a good thing when you are actually in the mood for a book,   But when you want a good book, it becomes a bad day if you buy it from a store. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read several of James Gunn's works in the past few years.   Gunn is a great writer, a good director, and a talented writer.  There is nothing that I find in this book that I don't already know.  But I do enjoy seeing James Gunn in his comfort zone, not being the lead in a superhero movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first chapter is very misleading.   It does not give a hint to the nature of a marriage, how long it would last, or how the husband would deal with the mother-in-law who would become his second wife.  When he finally got over her, he found her completely intolerable, and his wife completely unfaithful to him.  In fact, the only reason that the author went through with the story is to make the reader hate his wife. The book should have been titled "He Was a Very Good Husband" because, unlike a divorce which leaves the husband in a depressed state, he was in no real danger of falling apart. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book quite dry, and I found the plot to be a bit of a mess.  Â The characters and the plot are basically one dimensional at best, and this just didn't feel like a story that I'd get from a "serious" book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is good but doesn't make sense at all.    All the characters from my childhood appear in the story but they don't do anything.  "The book is set in a world where magic exists.  And people know a lot about it.  But it all goes wrong because of the stupid rules"   What rules?   I'm reading a book about a world of wizards but I don't know why the world works that way.  Why is it that there are magical things happening in a magical world but people don't understand or do anything about them?  " The main character, a half-human, half-elf named Narset, has magic abilities that can alter the environment around her, manipulate energy, and make things invisible.  She also has a pet bird, Quinton, which she loves.  Quinton gives her the opportunity to see the way magic works.  Because Quinton was created by Narseth, it is impossible for Narseter to actually see or affect Quinton and she fears it would destroy everything if it happened."   There's an "appearance to magic" trope.  If the book had just said she can create things it would have been great.  Instead, she is a "magic eye" and the story is about how she's trying to destroy the universe because she can't deal with the fact that Narsette has magic powers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not very impressed with this book, though I did enjoy it.   While the main character was interesting in a creepy sort of way, her story really just sort of dropped in my mind until I came to this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a waste of time   It seemed like a good idea at the time but it just didn't work.   The book was not a good resource   For the book it was good but   There are a lot of other resources available for building a database. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just got this book, and I'm thinking that this book would have been better if he was able to cover a bit more material that he hadn't already covered in the previous three books in the series.   For example, he talks a lot about the importance of the body in a yoga class:  He discusses how to move your body in the correct way when you do a forward bend:  But there's no explanation of why this particular posture is good.  He talks about a few other things in great detail, but he hasn't gotten to everything yet.  The only thing that bothers me about this book is that it starts off so strong, but by the end of the book, everything has been covered again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a "must read" if you are into fantasy... I can't recommend it highly enough.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of those books you don't get around to finishing until you have to.   It is one book I wish I had read before, but just couldn't put down.  This book is very long, and the author covers a lot of material in a relatively short book.  If you do get this book, I would suggest taking it slowly. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Â If you are looking for a solid historical fiction about a woman in the 1800s doing her best to survive during the Salem Witch Trials and her husband's subsequent disappearance in the New England wilderness, then look no further than This Strange Woman.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book's an abomination.   It is based on a true story.  It's based on an actual person, and the person's family is mentioned.  The main character's story is just a pile of lies and distortions.  We are led to believe that it's an authentic fact that she was raped.  This is not an accurate portrayal of the real story at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think I have read more that was good in this book.    While it is a fun read, I think it could have used a little more to make it a little less silly. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a sad thing that the author didn't live long enough to see the first version of his book turned into a movie.   The first draft is much better than the finished product, but it's still just a re-written book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the only thing on this website I have read so far.   I'm still not sure how they came up with this title.  As the author, I can't tell if it was an innocent misspelling or if they were attempting to troll the site.  The book is set in the same universe, with the same characters, but is written differently, with a different tone.  And in the end, it's a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is written for people who are looking for an easy way to read ancient Chinese literature and make it accessible for the lay reader.   It is not that they are poorly written, it's that they lack the historical context.  However, once you get into the story, you quickly realize that the book is not trying to be historically accurate.  There is no indication that the authors are studying Chinese literature, and even if they were, there is no reason to make things that they don't know about Chinese culture into an enjoyable read.  The only thing that makes the book worthwhile is that it gives a good general overview of the history of the Chinese in Japan. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The problem is that the author is just plain lazy in her attempts to write a decent book.   It's a great idea, but it's just too hard. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read the book and have a bad feeling about the author.   Â  I found myself thinking of the bad things she does to people in her books.  I was reminded of something she said in a previous book: that she wanted to be like a person who'd just lost her father or a friend she'd just gone to the hospital with.  She seems a little bitter and hateful. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is good and the characters are interesting and interesting.   This book is not a classic but it's good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of those books that when you get it you just can't put it down.   It's written in a clever and entertaining way   with lots of humor  .   The main character is an 18 year old teenager that has a secret crush on her teacher (I really liked her teacher in a female role play type way).   But the main character has the ability to make friends with anyone, which really was the whole point of the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst part is that I'm trying to convince my friends and family to try this book     I had a great experience at a bookstore and then it was canceled. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed reading this book and the book by the same author is just awful.   In this book, the author is obsessed with the story of a girl who had to put her penis in the back of the male donkey in order to get it to cum. Â After she did this, the donkey broke down and died. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got the wrong version of this book.   A few chapters had to be corrected to bring them in- line with the original edition,  but  I can't remember what. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most "wicked-good" read   I read a lot of paranormal fiction, and this one is definitely in that category.   Unfortunately, it got boring after a while.  This is a very short story (I read it in one sitting), but is well worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is very boring.   No action happens.  No suspense.  All the characters seem to be there just to be the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The characters are too two-dimensional and the plot is way too contrived to be realistic.   Â  This is a fun and entertaining read but I found it more believable than fictional. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm still not sure what happened to me.   It's the second time I've bought this.  I am trying to make sense of it as it's just not making sense to me  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot was very simple - they're out for revenge after they're kicked out of a club for being 'too ugly'   But the execution of the plot was poor. The "victims" were not'really' victims.   Their lives were ruined by their physical appearance.  The one woman with a disability in the book, is given the choice of a wheelchair to get around. She chooses not to take it, which results in a car accident resulting in permanent injury and disability. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a massive disappointment. There's a lot of good stuff in the book that made the book worth reading, but it's a massive waste of time because the author isn't interested in anything but a shallow, shallow, superficial story about a girl and her brother being the bad guys. I hate to say it, but this book is about as bad as they get. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not interesting, it is boring and over hyped, the author is not a good storyteller and the plot is just one big waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:       An amateur in her third year studying in university was so convinced of her abilities in English that, upon reading a book in which English was used, she declared, "My god, what is this? Why is it called 'English'?   I don't understand.   This is English!   It's horrible  Â !" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It doesn't make you want to listen to the next one   The characters are one-dimensional   I'm never really interested in the plot   Why is there a dog and not a cat?   And the cover says it's " The best book I have heard from the author "   But you really can't make me care  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first couple chapters of this book are fine, but I had to put it down because it was so hard to understand anything.    And what a waste of time!   It's clear the author is attempting to sell a book of essays about how important he thought they were (and why he thinks that is important)   But why are the essays so interesting?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What a great idea. I wanted to get the book before I had kids, and found the book so interesting. But the whole thing about being single and having to explain every move to a woman just isn't good.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As if all of these reviewers on this website have a life, I can honestly say I would never read a book by a reviewer who says it was a disappointment.   I tried it   but didn't like it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the only book I have read about modern Japan that I found to be at all accurate.   It is written in the present tense in a way that would seem to make the author's historical understanding a little less solid.  However, the facts and figures come through.  The history of Japan as depicted is a fascinating one and gives me great hope for the future of my country. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The narrator is terrible, the story is weak and the author seems very bad at showing his feelings.   If he did more good stuff I'm sure he'd be a good storyteller 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is just another book written by someone who knows not what he is talking about, who is also quite clearly not very good at writing (and even then he was trying). This is the book that shows how to avoid a book, a very popular series.   The author goes around to every book and character that he has ever written about, and writes a summary of all his work.  But he does not do this.  It was like he wanted to prove that this is the best book he ever wrote.  He just does not have a good writing style, he cannot come up with a memorable plot or character and he is very bad at describing what is going on.  There are a lot of mistakes in this book, and he seems to forget things that he actually did in his book.  This is like reading a textbook on writing.  If it had been written by a professional writer, it would have been great.  The only thing I could say about this book is that this book was written by the most boring person I have ever met, a person who is totally incompetent at writing a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I've read in a long time.   It's like an attempt by a third-rate writer to create a book on a theme he doesn't really care about: it's a "biography" about a black male whose mother is not black.  The writer spends several pages explaining that his mother's real name is "Sally K" and that "there is a certain magic about a name" but spends zero time explaining why or where the magic lies.  At one point, he notes that his name is so unusual that when he and his brother are asked to join the army in the 1940s, they ask "why would we be recruited to fight in the South?"   Even for a book that claims to be about a war hero (who was never in a war), this is completely and utterly irrelevant to the war.  Another example of a "big idea" that is only relevant to the author's life but somehow doesn't have anything to do with the actual topic of the book: he says that when his mother was pregnant, the baby girl was "not only not like her father, but not really like her mother."  I'm sure there are plenty of babies born without the mother's genes but it does NOT mean that she's genetically not like either her mother or father.  So, to read about this man's experience in the Civil War is to watch a family struggle for a few years.  He never tells us why he joined up, how he felt about the war (did he really feel like fighting? How about the army? was the war worth it? ), what it was like living with a family member who died in the war, and what happened after the war with the government that took all the "black people's land" (they never give any specific examples)   This is just a really dull and unnecessary book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is just as bad a book as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo   and I just can't find any redeeming qualities in it.   She can't even tell you when the "tattoo" started or how it looks (they both show).   Her writing style is not the kind of writing I want to read:  It is repetitive, and the sentence structure is awful   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My husband read this book and commented that he liked the "gags" in the first two chapters but the third chapter went into a completely different direction with a "nonsensical" plot (he was expecting something much more plot-oriented) and the plot in this book made no sense.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book interesting and fun, but the story has little to do with it. I'm glad it was free and available, but it would have been better if I hadn't bought it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Â  This is a very good book about a very bad person.   It is very painful to read about the cruelty that is put upon the people she loved.  I also hate the fact that this was a sequel to this horrible book: http://www.booktango.com/best-books-of-2013/
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book during college, at a time when I had not yet gotten into any of the books that had been recommended to me. The author (I think it was a man) said that the people in the books would never leave because they'd have to come to a party in their underwear (I'm sure they were lying, but I wanted to believe). Anyway, I bought the book from a local bookseller for $5. It was a very poor book and I still have it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first half of the book is about how much I hate children   (the other half is about being a father to a son)   But by the end of the second half  Â I have no idea what the author was talking about  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There's no other way to put it:  When I read a book like this I always feel a deep sense of awe and respect: Â The prose is precise, clear, and uncluttered.   The story itself is a bit disjointed and takes a bit to build but at its core is an amazing tale.  It's almost as if the writer had to have a dream about the nature of reality and how our perceptions of it can affect our lives (and not in a good way).   It would be a great story to read in a small group setting.  I was surprised that the book ended at the end of the world, as I'm sure the author was trying to be a little more ambitious in this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am going to preface my review by saying that this book was a big waste of time.   It is a self help book, as far as I can tell,   but it is written by a woman who   has not published a book.  There is a whole chapter dedicated to the benefits of a relationship with a female.  The rest of the book is written in the   same way as many other self help books, with   the  wife and daughter being the main role models.  My wife and I have been together for 6 years.  As long as we are together, our relationship has been good.  But my wife has had three children, and I do not have a wife and children.  If I had my druthers, I would never marry or have a child.  It makes me sad to see women using self help as an excuse for being single.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The ending was really sad because this was supposed to be a happy ending and it just didn't work.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book that seems to be about a man who does the best he can at something he's good at, something he doesn't really care about. He is a man with a dream, who has a wife who loves him but doesn't care about him as a person, and a son who only cares about him because he's there to save his life. And he's an idiot.  I think he has a lot of potential but he just isn't good at a lot or he has no talent at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â I'm really sad to say that I had never read this book before.   So I was pleasantly surprised to find this one here, and it's a really good book.  It's a bit of a departure for me, and I have read a bunch of "how to" books that do a good job of showing you how to do these things,  but  it's good stuff nonetheless. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I never understood the attraction of the series for me.  The main characters are shallow and dull in the least.  They are not nearly as engaging as the characters in the original Star Wars trilogy  They were so bland, I felt I couldn't sympathize with them.  So, the prequels were an attempt by George Lucas to reinvent himself.  It was a failure.  But, he was a brilliant writer and this was an attempt to recapture his vision.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've tried to like this book, but I just can't get into it.   First of all, it was terrible, which was the main reason I gave up on it. The second is that the book's subject matter is not something that I want to read about.  Even the title (not really) was ridiculous.  The best that I can say about it is that it contains a lot of information that I wish I could remember. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not disappointed by the book, but the book was a disappointment to me.  I purchased the book to read the story, which sounded like a good idea to me (and a good way to get my mind off of the "sick" and "dead" cats I got a few days ago).   The book did not deliver.   It's basically an "origin" book, which is not my thing.  It seems like the authors of this book just took a bunch of cats from a good shelter and put them together with a few "invented" stories to create a "super hero" of a cat.  They have names and a mission and a super special ability:  They can "dip" and turn people's heads into that of a dog.  And they can also "sock" and make their "socks" disappear.  These stories are interesting, but it's the story about the "evil" and the "bad" cats that really sucked the life right out of me. They were annoying and annoying.  The writers said there were "sophisticated" reasons the "cats" didn't want to be friends, but I don't think "specially designed clothes" and a "laser beam" is smart.  As far as the book's "origin", I think they had cats who were in the shelters who had to be "released", and were all "released" by a "cat whisperer" and his "cattery".  I don`t know.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The second is worse in every way. I'm sure this was done to get around copyright issues.   My first time reading a book written by a woman about a woman, and it isn't even good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book that makes you wonder how people can read such bad books  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read this book a few times, and I have come away somewhat disinterested.   My husband liked it, but he thought I had no idea what was going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is a bunch of bullshit to make a bigger plot point. The whole plot is built around a guy trying to find his missing girl, only to discover that he's missing his girl who's been taken out by her abusive boyfriend. There is a brief scene in the beginning of the book when the guy is trying to track his girl, but then the boyfriend runs away from him. There's also a bit of a flashback that reveals why the girl was taken out (which makes me wonder why she would go out with a guy that would try to track her down to the point where he could get her back).   I was disappointed because there were so many other parts of the story I liked more. The book is over so soon too so I can't wait to read the sequel.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â The book is about a high school girl who wants to join the Army.   She's in a good school with good parents, but the parents are not very supportive of her.  The military is just a step below that.  Also, the military is a bit creepy.  I'm not sure how the military does this.  They're very nice, but a little creepy.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about a girl that gets kidnapped.   She is taken to a forest and is held by a demon and her evil teacher until a friend comes and saves her.  There are a lot of questions that come after this and they are not answered.  This story is just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The characters were completely unlikable. They were all just a little too dumb, or too stupid, or simply stupid. One of the female characters was even worse - a psychotic, self-hating, mentally deranged, brainwashed woman.   It's hard for me to like characters when they are all so selfish and dumb. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book after a friend told me about it, and I was hooked by the premise:  If you can dream it, you can do it.   The idea of a dreamer learning to control his dreams is pretty cool.  Unfortunately, when the protagonist, a writer, wakes up after a long night of dreaming, he can't remember a word that he just wrote.  This just isn't very interesting.  It's a book that should have been a novel, but I feel like it was a really bad adaptation of a really good dream. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What a piece of crap.   I had high expectations for this book, because of all the reviews I had read about this genre, but  Â the worst part is that this book is a compilation of a few short stories.  I   Don't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it a bit boring, a bit too "snow job" (if that's what you mean).    The author did not seem to be doing anything in particular but rather had a plan for the story:  - Get some children.   - Make them do tricks.  - Have the children sing a song.  I had no problem with that, but it didn't do anything to help me get interested in the story.  It seems like this is all the book is really doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book last week (and have been meaning to read it since).   It was pretty good.   Unfortunately, it doesn't tell a good story or give you the motivation to keep going. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as a way to prepare myself for a job interview and this book didn't help in any way.   It was a bit dated at the time of writing and I have had the same questions about things since and I've never had the answer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very excited to read this book.   It is a very good book about a very bad idea.  The author's argument is that it is morally better for a person to steal from a charity rather than give to a charity.  For many reasons, I do not share this view,  but I am unable to find a good reason that would prevent someone from stealing from a government charity in the same way that they are prevented from stealing when giving to charity. Even the good examples in this book show how the argument is unsound.  I find it interesting that the only example of a government benefit being morally better is a benefit of not stealing the land and forcing everyone to pay rent.  To me, that is really the best way to make a bad idea morally better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first time I went back to read this book, it was the best I could get from this author.   But I've since found this to be one of her weakest novels. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very excited about this book, and thought I'd have a really good time with it.   While it is fun to read, it also kind of just makes me sad.  I am in my 40's, and this is supposed to be about the first time I was sexually active, but it just does not make it that way.  The girl is a virgin.  In a way that is kind of sad, because it just feels like no one really understands or cares about what it's like to be a virgin, so the sex has to be the most important thing in the book.  She is a slut.  Â  She has no real sense of self-worth, and even when she is with a good man, she is still a slut with a penis, just like any girl.  It is not a good thing to be that way, no matter how much I might enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just can't get into this book.   From the very first chapter, you're treated to an introduction by its author and by some of the people he knows.  I'm not so much a fan of these, as I often feel as if the author is trying to be so clever that he just misses the point and is only giving you a story to make you think that he's so clever.  Then, in chapter 2:Â  "The only difference between me and the other parents is that I was the only one to not allow him to grow up to be a self-centered idiot."  This is just plain stupid.  The book does a great job of portraying the importance of parental love and support to children.  Yet, we're not even supposed to be surprised at the failure of those values to carry through.  In his efforts to convince the reader to believe that he is not only the best at parenting, but also the only person who is not self-absorbed, the author seems to be relying on a few examples.  One is a friend who gave birth to his daughter in the last two years of her pregnancy.  She had the help of a professional midwife.  Now that I think about it, I wonder if this is what the author was going for.  So much of the book is about the family's problems with the middle-class suburb of Northridge.  Here is a story about the parents of a child who is struggling, but seems to just be suffering.  There are other cases like this, in which the parents seem to be getting nowhere.  It seems as if at some point in the writing process the author realized that the middle class of Northbridge is not a place where a child could grow up and become the sort of person that he or she is trying so hard to become. Â  It doesn't help that we have the typical middle-child-worshipping family and the mother is just a bitch. Â  I can't see what all the fuss is about, and I couldn't care less what happens to the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved the book but hated the author, as he wrote a very poor book.   The "story" is terrible, you need to have seen a horror movie to understand it and the story is just too slow to even begin to comprehend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are looking for a good book for kids about a cute little animal, try this one.   It takes a while to get used to the animal (we all do)   but once you do it is very well done.  It is very good at the same time!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First of all, I read the first half of this book at one of the great book clubs I belong to at a major university, and it was a lot better.   But I didn't buy the book, and I'm not likely to now. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good book but I was disappointed in the quality of the illustrations, which is a shame because the book is not just about animal behavior or ecology.   It is about the human relationship to animals. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is poorly written and the author did a disservice to the reader by making it so. The story of a girl's battle with depression is not the kind of thing that can be told through a book. It is hard to understand how anyone can have this mental illness when even talking about it is hard. The writing is also repetitive and the pacing is so poor that it really becomes a drag. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is hard to believe that this is only a 1 star rating.   When it is not the most beautiful book I have ever read, it is a waste of time.  I could have done better 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a person who loves horror books, I was hoping that my recent love of horror novels would result in something great to read in the genre, but this isn't one of them.   The author is a bit of an amateur in terms of how to write a horror novel.  In her introductory chapters she tells the reader about the origins of horror.  Then she shows us how things turned out:  (Spoiler alert:  It is not a good thing).  She has her female characters all talk about how they want to be raped.  What the hell is that supposed to mean?  I'm not saying it is not funny.  But it is a bad joke.  She also has her characters tell us how they are going to rape us or turn us into a zombie.  Again, what is the purpose of this?  When I am raped,   I don't want to go to bed with this person   (a character who appears in two of her novels), I donï¿½t want to get into their car and take them to some motel and have sex with them  .   It just makes me want to rip their eyes out.  I read a blog about rape in which the author pointed out that a male rape victim didn't want his rape story to be the focus, he didn't care to be turned into a werewolf, he just wanted a good rape.  This book was the exact opposite of that.  It wasn't that his rape wasn't interesting (it was) but that he was trying to escape his victim, not have her be turned against him.  There was not one mention of rape in this book, even though we were shown a scene in which a man is raped by his mother.  When the male character had sex with his mother,  she didn't object, she just went along with it, as if he hadn't just raped her.  Not only that,  he wasn't supposed to turn her into a vampire!  I want her to be a vampire too   but I also want her not to be able to turn into a woman.  For god's sake, don't make my life difficult!  When a male character tells us he wants to be gang raped, he doesn't say he wants his rapists to turn him into a demon.  Instead he said that he would like to be thrown into a pit filled with crocodiles, sharks, and all
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had no problems reading this book. I'm a high school history teacher and have a lot of experience with the books written by high school teachers (like a number of the other reviewers).   But this book was written by a high-school teacher who has never taught a high level of school, has no real background in education, and has never written a book on any subject.   This was a bad decision and the book is just another example of poor writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted this book to be something wonderful.   In all fairness to Ms. Martin, I've read more than a couple books in which the heroine was a little too stupid.  Even if I liked this one, I couldn't help but wonder if I was in over my head.  She gets stuck in a small house with a bunch of bad guys.  Then, after the bad guys are dead, she is forced to marry her killer (it's her sister's murderer!).  I don't think she's that stupid.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is a lot of misinformation and misunderstandings in this book.   They try to get people to use the power of their brain instead of relying on emotional, superstitious behaviors (wearing the right pants, etc).   But this doesn't work.  There are some very basic reasons for why we are not going to be able to go about using our brains.  We don't have enough time.  It's not like we can take a day or two off or we can skip a class or something.  They are going to try to fix everything that is not working in a matter of days but they will fail.  The people that actually have to use this stuff have a lot more experience than people who just think this is the best thing ever and don't really need this stuff.  So, this book is just wrong on every single level:  It doesn't take into account any of the people who have actually had to use all of this stuff to get a job, get a house, get the job, etc.  These are the people that have actually needed this information and they have had to overcome a ton of obstacles to get there.  Also, for the first two years I have to get permission from the HR department to have a company laptop or the computers have to have their password changed.  This is not because I stole them or did some other such thing as most people make a mistake here and I was told by two different HR people that I would have to go to court in order to get my computer back.  Again, this is not some sort of conspiracy.  I am one of the lucky ones.  Finally, I read it while I was at the airport to go home and I got home the next day and was just as confused as the first time I read the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is so good but has a few problems   I bought it for my son to read on a flight. The book is good but the book was in a hard cover and he got bored fast and threw it out  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is just a terrible, horrible, horrible book.   It has nothing to do with how good the story is, or how the characters are written.  It's just a complete waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a terrible book and I won't read another.   The main character is a complete failure in many ways.  He's arrogant and he doesn't believe in anything.  Why did he decide to become a superhero?    After the events of this book, I'm convinced he's a complete fraud. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a bad review to say it is a dull book that is not good.   But it is so, so good   For a book that claims to be a biography of Henry VIII's last queen, it is not.  The only thing I can think of that would make her any better is that she would be a bit older. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The idea that one should use their brain rather than their mouth in conversation or to speak is a bad idea.   In a book about an animal that's actually very smart it says that it should never talk in front of people because they're going to get confused and not understand what it's saying.  This makes absolutely no sense at all, I can see why the authors made this choice but it's the worst of the lot.  I also felt that one of the dogs was trying to be funny but it just came out weird. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this as part of a book club.   In this case, I wanted to enjoy the story while reading.  For most of the story, I didn't want to finish it.  But, I kept reading it, and I felt I was being cheated by the story.  I have a bad habit of cheating myself.  This book could have been really good if it was more focused on the story and less about the characters and what they were thinking about when they were doing what they did. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   .   -   It's the book with the bad ending and the story about the bad guy from the story.   I was going to buy it when the paperback was cheap and I read some of the reviews but i got nothing from them except for some bad reviews. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While the story is interesting, the characters are not developed and do not come to life. The book's conclusion is a disappointment and should not have been included. It is a great book for someone interested in military history, especially in the Korean War.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I never expected to read a book that was this good or that good.   This is an excellent book, a book filled with great information about a subject that you need to know.  It's the first book I ever purchased about something like this.  The reason I am a little disappointed is that I think I should have spent more time with this topic before writing a review, but that's just me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First off, this book was a huge let down for me.   As someone that enjoys the idea of a magical land called The Land of Oz (and having recently read one ), the fact that the land of Oz never got the magic it needed to be the land that it should be is incredibly disappointing.  As a storyteller, Oz never had much to offer me, and there is no real mystery to what exactly is going on.  I loved the fact it was a non-sequitur,  But, as someone who loves to read, I cannot wait until the next book in the series so I can see what happens next. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to say I didn't like this one at all.   This is my first and I'm pretty sure the last book I have read with a very young protagonist.  It's probably not good for a 15 year old to read (I'm 29) but at a few points it felt really childish and it felt like she knew very little about anything she talked about (which is kind of true in a lot of children's books too).  Â I felt a lot like a kid who is obsessed with a character. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is very good:  In all honesty, the entire book is a great read; however,   In the end,  It is an odd choice of book to teach about the life of Jesus:  While Â  the book is written in an apologetic style,  it Â  also contains a lot of "wooing the crowd" and   this is a problem as I believe a teacher should have a sense of Â  when to  be Â  open and  when  to  close.   This is not the case in this book.  This book is about Jesus; Â  it Â  doesn't go the extra mile and makes Jesus sound like  a "savior".   (You should have read it before asking yourself the question; how do you say that Jesus is a "Savior")  The problem I have with this book is that it is written by a Catholic.  I don't have anything bad to say about this book but I was just disappointed that it was written by someone who knows so little about the actual life of  Jesus.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the worst books   I have read in a long time.   The characters are nothing but stereotypes and   it is all about the action and not about   real things that   one would know about a real person.  Â    If I had a time machine,   to go back   and have   my first experience with this   book  ,   the thing that would come to mind   is   that 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure I even liked the story very much.   The main character, a pretty girl who loves dogs, is very, very selfish.  She always wants her "best friend" to take care of her, even though she's selfish and has no desire to keep him around.  While there's a good reason behind that--for a long time, when they were puppies, she was always the one to take after her older sister--she never really learned to think about herself until about the time she was 15.  So she became incredibly self-centered and a little jealous when her boyfriend started dating her best friend, who is pretty much the exact opposite of herself.  It doesn't help that he's a little insecure about his looks (he has a serious heart ailment, and he's very unattractive), but he is so good-looking that it's hard to tell.  In the end, the two of them go to bed on the floor with her as the only other occupant.  There's some very awkward kissing, and she's really into him, but it doesn't last long before she realizes that he is a complete jerk.  As a side note, I really love her dog. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason I finished the book was so that I could write a review of it  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did read the book but didnt like it.   This book is a classic that people will read in their early teens but will be totally confused by the last couple chapters.  I dont think they're needed in a story like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not think the book was worth the price and have already thrown it away.   The story is just bad, and the characters just do not get along.  I have never been to England and do not know much about the country and did not learn about their social class. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book doesn't have a lot of characters, but the way they act and how they react to events is interesting. I wish that in this series, there were more interactions between the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a book about how people can be evil. Not in the way that Christians are evil but in the sense that everyone is. But not in the same way. You have the evil person who is cruel and mean to a child, the good person who lets it get to the point of cruelty, the child's mother who doesn't know how to handle it and has to turn the kid over to a stranger for help, the person who knows what's going on but doesn't do anything about it, the cops who don't understand, the school who doesn"t teach about this and the police who don"t do anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are planning on reading the Book of Mormon this is NOT the book to buy   I have read other reviewers that do not care about the Book.   Well   First   Second   Third   Fourth   Fifth   Sixth   Seventh   Eighth   Ninth   Tenth   Eleventh   Twelfth   Thirteenth   Fourteenth  Â   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so excited to read a book about an African-American man and a Black woman that I could hardly wait to begin it.   Well, here I am at the end of my third chapter, and I've just wasted my time.  I mean, how hard is it to keep a straight face while reading about a gay man who's not sure how to feel about being Black and Black gay?  Â It seems to me that, when he first meets his future spouse, he wants something from her that he doesn't really deserve.  (And I'm not so sure he's not asking for the "I-am-Black" thing from her, either.)   (I think she might have a few suggestions.)  In short, it's a very weak book about a weak story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was pretty disappointed by this book as a storyteller.   It seemed like the author took the whole thing from a story that she read in a movie in her youth to a story where she was a "lone wolf" in a "tribe" that she "was not a part of."   This was a problem because there is no story to back up her story.  The whole thing was just "she went in there, and they took her in"   She just took a few people and started telling her own stories about them.  Her descriptions of the food in the cabin were pretty bad.  She described it in a really dry voice.  And I guess I don't have a problem with a story about a woman going on an adventure into the woods.  But I don''t really like the "tribal" thing that she is a part or "in."  Maybe that is the whole idea, but it seems like the story of a person from her childhood just never happened. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a great surprise to me.   My parents have always told me that my teachers were mean to me, and this book was the first time I ever encountered a teacher who actually was mean to you.  My teacher was a total ass.  We were in the history class, and she was giving us an assignment on the Roman Empire and how the Romans were the bad guys because they enslaved a bunch of people, but they actually did a good job.  The class wasn't a good mix, and I really didn't think I was going to get anything out of the assignment, but she insisted.  Finally, I made up my mind to quit the class and ask my teacher why she kept giving us homework.  She was in the back of the class writing a paper on how to make an ass out of someone else, but when she finished, she got a look on her face I'd never seen on a person's face before:  "That's it.  That's why you got an F in this class.  I hope it gets you a grade that's A."   The rest of the book was just more of the same - I got a bad grade, and my teacher hated me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is boring, repetitive, and too much of the same old stuff.   The only thing the author says about what he knows to be true is "It's true" and doesn't give any of his sources for that statement.  The book starts by explaining the Bible and the evolution of Christianity and the author uses a lot of examples to show what "facts" in the Bible prove that evolution is true.  There are some good points in the book, but it just reads the same exact thing over and over.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book for a Christmas present, so I could have an excuse to not read it.   It's a fairly boring book.  You don't get a lot out of this.  I don't remember reading anything in the whole story other than the name of the person the girl has a crush on (Molly's name)   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For a non-fiction book about the CIA, you can expect a fair amount of bullshit.   This is a book about a group of CIA agents (or something) who are "in the know" about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, a very good cover story, if you want to call it that.  Unfortunately, that's pretty much what the book is.  In his first interview, the author refers to the CIA as a "disgraced and discredited institution."  A more accurate term might be "a failed system," or a "perverted cult."  As you can probably tell, he's trying to paint a rosy picture, but it's not that clear cut.  The book does describe the CIA in a pretty positive light, if by "pro" you mean "responsible" and not "sociopathic," and in a way that makes sense, although it's still just a nice book.  I have to say that the CIA/Mafia connections were interesting, and it made me curious as to what those CIA men thought about all this stuff.  A lot of what's in this book is just too strange and weird to make a coherent explanation. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a mess.   The writing style is too stiff.  I really didn't enjoy reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My husband has a very sensitive stomach and so this book caused a number of issues.   In the beginning the book was a lot more fun.  The book was enjoyable but my husband said after about chapter 4 or 5 that it got very frustrating and did not seem like he would get his way.  When it comes to food, it seems that this book has a major blind spot when it comes the best way to cook a good meal.  While the cook book recommends using a sous vide method, a sÃ©ance is one of the only times this method is required. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because I've been interested in this book since I first heard about it at a lecture.   It's good that this has not been published as I know it, and I am disappointed it was.  It lacks any real insight or depth to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can see the appeal for a certain kind of reading fan, but the writing is so painfully stiff that I couldn't care less about what happens next.   At the end, the characters' paths are almost identical, so I thought that was pretty cool. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about a good person being bad.  It is not about a person being a good friend to a good woman, or a good wife to a bad husband.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As usual, a good book with great potential is ruined by the author's poor writing and an awful plot.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "I don't think it's possible to say whether the story is true or not."   So a book is all about making money is this book, then, as the subtitle suggests, the money is stolen from you, and it's also in the title, I guess 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book and the next day I went to sleep at night and woke up with a severe headache.   This was not my cup of tea.  It is just plain bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is interesting, with lots of twists and turns. I like that they kept the ending mysterious and the characters more fleshed out.    However, the plot twists are poorly developed.  The biggest problem is that they end up giving the plot twist too little time to develop before they start giving the twist.  After about a week or so of this, the twist is already predictable.  I understand it makes the plot harder to follow, but this is too bad.  Overall, the book is a decent story.  It's hard to get caught up to the plot because of the twists, but it's not horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was one of my absolute least favorite books.   I'm not sure I could write a review about why I did not enjoy it.  This is a very very short novel and its just so easy to get caught up in the characters in a way that I'm just not interested in in a very short book (which I think is a sign that a short novel needs to be longer, not shorter).   My favorite characters were the main ones in the book and those two really are just fun and silly to read about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I saw this in a bookstore, I was excited.   It had everything I wanted from an urban fantasy: good magic, interesting characters and plot, but it didn't live up to the hype I saw online.  The magic is interesting, but I don't know why I wanted it to be.  In fact, I think I have seen worse, from the likes of Brandon Sanderson.  I'm not sure that this book will be a "hit" for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not a huge fan of "romances" but   A Lighter Shade of Magic   is one that I will buy again.   As a long timeÂ fan of Robert Jordan,Â this book   was so much more than just another romance.  It had a plot.  Even though it was just a couple people, their relationships were complex, moving and full of tension.  I read this for the first time at a con this year   It was one of those books that is hard to put down.  This book has the perfect ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason I didn't give this book 4 stars is that the end doesn't make much sense.   A guy is walking up and down a street yelling at a woman for no apparent reason.  Â  He walks up to her, opens the door, and asks, "Hey, what's with that weird looking woman?   She's not dressed like a normal person.  And she's not the type to be the type.  So, what gives?"   He doesn't even bother asking why she's dressed like that.  He just goes right for it.  This was more like a one-day affair in a whorehouse than a true love story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is written by someone who claims to be an expert in human sexuality who has studied hundreds of species and sex.   He doesn't seem to have studied any at all.  He has several pages of drawings of the genitals and even gives one to the guy who gets the job,   because it looks good.  However the actual illustration he gives  doesn't even give us any info on the size or shape  of the penis.  That is like saying the illustration on the picture that says "Big Ben"  is a good illustration of the size of the Big Ben.  I don't think this book could have been any more useless if it had been published by the American Public Health Association.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First of all the story is amazing!   This is definitely a keeper! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love that this book has so many characters, yet you never actually learn anything about them.   Their names only appear on a couple of pages and then only in a few short passages.  I hope that eventually someone writes a great book where you actually get to meet all the characters.  This book was so terrible I just read a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    An over-familiar and redundant text with a great story that is written like a novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wish I knew how I could've prevented my kids from going to this book.   This is definitely not a good choice to use to teach your kids about bad behavior and bad choices. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this one and was disappointed.   The pacing was a little slow in the beginning, but soon got back into form.  The main character was a bit annoying in the first part, but he seemed to grow on me.  He was an interesting guy who was actually able to solve a difficult puzzle in a different way than the puzzle makers, who could do so in less time.  But the book kept getting dragged out and the ending sucked.  I just felt there was too much buildup that could have been dealt with more quickly and effectively. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The narrator is a tad  Â shaky on details and doesn't make a solid link with the subject matter.   This book is just about a guy that is in love with his dog, but there is a lot of weirdness and contradictions.  I really think the narrator may be writing a romance, but it isn't very well done. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read it on the plane from India to Canada.   So, I did enjoy it...   But I'd rather read a good book like "The Art of Fielding". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst book I've read all year.   Not worth it  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I went into this book with the idea that I would like it,  but after just 5 chapters I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth.   First off, the writing is just horrible.  I have to give this a 3 because it is at least slightly better than the other reviews.  Unfortunately, the poor writing is all around the quality of the book itself.  Now here is the problem:  You cannot tell what your main character is thinking from the first sentence.  The main character goes through the motions to do whatever is needed in order to do something.  She needs something done, she needs a new job, she is ready for a romantic relationship.  All she does is go with the flow.  This is not the way that you should handle a relationship in real life. Â You should have a set of standards in your life. You should always stay true to your own values.  In other words, your relationships should be for your own benefit and that of those around you.  Instead, you seem to get all the benefits but the responsibility of the relationship. I was very disappointed in the ending of the story.  They do not end on a happy note.  Yes, they got together but they just got together in the wrong way.  Again, this is one of those books where you can tell that it was supposed to be a happy ending.  If they had just done it right the entire story would have been more successful. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A poorly written book. I got my copy from a book fair, and it had no jacket on it.   It's a good story about a character, but he comes off as an idiot and an anti-hero. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is just so dull. You need to write something good if you are to make a living writing about magic (and I'm not even good at magic).   I can't say that I've tried to think of some new interesting ways to do things that this book has done.   Also, if I were writing a book about something that I knew all too well, how would I know all that? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If I am to review this book, I feel like the book was so short. It is not even that good, not even at all. The story was just about as bad as the prose is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a good book but the writer doesn't know the importance of the original language, the original words of the Bible.   The author is not interested in learning about ancient Hebrew, that's for sure. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I heard that the book was based on a true story, I was very skeptical.   However, after the second time I read it, I couldn't put it down and finished the book in three days.  I would definitely recommend this book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In a way I suppose that's what's wrong with reading.   Why is it a problem that a book has no plot, no action, and no characters?   I'll let a few reviews that have a similar idea explain the problem:  -   To me, this is the least memorable book in the series  .   You can get a good idea of the world, and you can guess most of what's going to happen in the next book, but nothing you read here will stick in your memory or give you the chills like some of the other, more memorable books  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a really good book until the end.   So, it tells us that the bad guys don't have any good friends, and that they're in the business of fighting, not for a cause. That's interesting for a book, because it's true for real life. But when we get there, they don't just fight over anything they disagree with. They fight because of the money, because of who they know, because they think it's the right thing to do. But what's funny is, all the stuff about how they hate democracy and love dictatorships is all true, except that it's a very American view. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really liked this book, but I am not the biggest fan of the concept behind it.   When the main character starts to believe that the world is evil and that he is the hero who can save it, he starts to lose hope.  However, it is the book's ending that is the biggest disappointment. Â I really enjoyed the main characters relationship, but that relationship did not really end, which is very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was one of the worst books I have ever read.   The story line was just not very believable and the characterizations were absolutely ridiculous.  I think if I knew then what I know now about the military. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a disaster from the get-go.   After a brief introduction, we get the boring story about a group of kids that, as it says, were the "lovable losers of their town" and a teacher's pet.  It's supposed to be a story of how their school has some problems with "hazing" but it's so boring that there's hardly a point to the book.   As I've said, there's a lot of "h" in "havr". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this book to be a disappointment.   It is a little boring and repetitious.  I liked some of the characters more, like the other children in the series, but these are few and far between.  This is a good book for someone who is looking for something a little different than what is on the shelves,   but I do not recommend this book for those looking for a happy ending.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because I needed to read something good about the Roman Catholic Church (I'm a Mormon, but I've always been a bit annoyed by the Church's views on sexuality).   This book wasn't as good as I expected, but it was still fun to read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because I read the book "The Secret Language of Plants" by a friend.   However, I think the book is WAY better than "The secret language of plants"   My review:  For me, this was not a good book.  The author is very good at showing that plants can talk to humans (they don't really "talk" but have language features).  The problem is that the text is very unclear.  I was never able to make sense of what was said.  Also, in one section, she has a discussion about the difference between a plant's leaves and the leafs of its "true" relatives.  My rating: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For those who know me, you know I have an extensive collection of science fiction and fantasy books.   I was so excited about this book that I bought it with my first birthday present.  The characters are well done but some of them have the same trait, to be a space ship captain.  I don't care for the story but at least it isn't a disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a compilation of old material. There are numerous mistakes: Â 1) He describes a certain type of woman as "smothering,"   and as   "stuck in a time warp."   No wonder she's a bad reader!   2) "I know I'm a horrible person, but what's the point of life if you never learn anything?"    3) "If you can't remember your own name, you can forget about knowing your own mind."  There are other flaws that are much more interesting to read about.   5) "When I was a child my mother found a tiny, almost worthless book in her attic"   The book is written in the 1970s, but the title of the book is not in my memory.  6) He suggests that "my father must have gotten a divorce from a woman who could do nothing for him and whose children were so ugly they were on the receiving end of abuse"  7) "There is something about that age when you want to get as far away from as you can and not feel connected to anything that even comes close to being human."  8) "The problem with my father is he's the one thing that keeps getting in the way."  The problem with that is   9)  "That is why, even in death, I have never regretted having an affair with a teacher at my primary school."  It's one of those "I never do   things" that I just can't believe I didn't notice until now.  10) "She had an awful personality but she was not so bad that I wanted to be around her."  If you need the book for   1 and 2, you'll just have to find the other ones.  11)  He was the only adult in my childhood who didn't call me   a "bad person" when I screwed up.  I can't really say whether IÂ  would   like   to   get   with   him again or not, but I'm glad   he   found someone  who   liked   me .
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an example of a bad author who clearly does not know what he is talking about.   I can't believe a major publisher still has the rights to this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The problem is, I bought the book thinking it would help my ADHD.   I have the same problem with the books I read, they always sound so much better than I'm using. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the first book I have read about a serial killer. The writing is pretty poor and there are a lot of spelling mistakes. It feels like he is writing his book as if he were a reporter covering a story and didn't know a lot about serial killers or anything about the research that went into this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really didn't have a lot to enjoy in this book. It didn't help that there wasn't a lot of action or any character development in the story.   The character design is pretty much just a bunch of white men. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My favorite part was the introduction at the beginning: "While it's true that a woman can't change a man's mind about love, her efforts usually end up backfiring..." This is so true.   He has an ego so large it can't be ignored by someone as talented as she is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really looking forward to getting this book.   It was a little dry.  I think there might have been some added sugar.  The story is interesting.  It took a little while for me to get used to this fantasy world. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked this book but I also liked the book by the same author more and have a feeling this book will become a favorite to the fans of both. I have the first one and this one is much worse in terms of plot and characters.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the book "Liar Liar" (the one about Bill Cosby) and enjoyed it greatly. It didn't do anything to change my opinion on Bill Cosby, nor was it particularly good. What it did did is show the world that there are many more women than we may imagine who have had similar experiences. The book shows that many women are not out to be believed.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story of a man who has no desire to leave his wife and kids is nothing short of disgusting. The main protagonist is a despicable, violent, drug-addicted murderer.    As far as I'm concerned he is the worst parent imaginable and the entire book is just a justification of his bad decision making.  He's a monster who's never been in the right place at the right time and he's totally unable to deal with his anger towards his wife, children, and parents.  The worst part is that he's never got anything right, as his every move is a mistake and he completely f*cks it up.  This author, a writer who is supposedly talented, is the cause of the majority of my frustration with the world of bad books.  Posted by J.P. Morin at 7:32 AM
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not bad. It is not good either. It just doesn't stand up to my expectations of the genre. I expected a lot more from this book than it has given.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While I enjoyed the book a lot, it had a terrible ending. I think the end of the book is about what I expected the last book to be.   A good story, well done, but disappointing.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â This book is absolutely terrible!   The story is so boring, and every time someone thinks they're about to figure out something that might work, it goes back to being a bad idea.   There's so much wrong with it!  I want to cry! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was in college and picked this book up from a used bookstore. I remember finding it quite difficult to understand the author's point of view (or the point of the story). This book is a compilation of "letters", mostly collected in various books about the same subject.   The book is written in a very strange style that does not allow the reader to get a clear sense of what the author is trying to say. The letters were mostly written by people who were either in love, in love or in love with someone else, or with some other thing in life that was too much to think about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is simple, the writing is good but not great, and the characters don't have much development.   There are no interesting ideas in this book and very little action, so there is a slight lack of originality, but then again this was written in 1981. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are two or three sections where she simply tries to get a man into bed in the most awkward way she can think of and then leaves him there...   That's why it gets three stars.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very excited about this book when it was released.   It was written by Michael Crichton.  Â  Crichonts is a master of the science fiction. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book because it was being promoted to a middle school audience.   It had a couple of scenes in it that were nice to read, and the last one was nice to look at, but that's about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book does not work.   If you are a new author trying to publish a new book the book will be a disaster.  If a new writer were to write a bad novel that was published in a library and never released because of poor editing or a terrible cover they would get the same response as the author of the book on the shelf in front of me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When you hear of a good book, you're like "why haven't I heard of this yet?" and  Â when you hear a bad one,   it's like "damn,  the writer must really hate me!"   It's always a disappointment that the writer who wrote this doesn't know what good fiction is or is going to say, but I don't think that anyone does   because it really is so good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The ending was rushed, there was a lot of exposition, and the story and characters were predictable (or so I thought).   I will be giving it a 4 to avoid spoiler. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The reason that I think this is bad is that it was written by a man who is a pedophile, and it shows.   I know that I won't ever be able to read books written by the great women writers of history, because if they can't write anything good then I have no hope for myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a first year in college, this is a terrible book. It was a bit of a surprise because the reviews had been good.   It's about an eleven year old girl that is adopted from China and moved to New Jersey to live with her grandparents.  The novel is about her relationship with her grandfather and the difficulty she has in keeping a strong sense of herself despite the fact that she has a new life.  She spends all of her time with her family, but has very little independent time to herself.  It reads like a book by a little child who is trying to imitate her adoptive mother. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book for my middle school class to show how to read literature and we got really bored with it.   It was a good book but it felt like it was just there to show that a middle school can read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It wasn't really a bad story, but it did have a few shortcomings.   Â  The author seemed to have written this story when she was a child and did not have a good understanding of how people work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so terrible, I feel like I should have never given it a chance.   It is a classic case of writing badly; I can't believe it got published.  The author's knowledge of history is non-existent and his explanations are not correct.  If anyone ever read this book they should have their heads examined.  I can see why so many people have written books about the Holocaust.  It's just as if a writer was in the Holocaust and knew about what was happening there. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best part about this book was the fact that it was a review of a bad novel.  Â I read it about 3 months ago and have yet to find any redeeming things about the book itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the things I miss most about my childhood are the funny comics and other silly things.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm going to begin with saying that the book I received is terrible, it's got nothing going for it and it's written by the same guy who wrote the garbage I read a few months ago.   It's a bunch of half baked, lame, nonsensical, brain dead trash.  It has a bunch  of stupid characters who can't think of anything except  what they're  doing or how to get money.  These guys need a few good ideas to keep them on the right path but the writer just gets  off on creating  random characters to get a laugh out of people.  Also the ending is  weird.  In case you are wondering why the bad reviews are coming up,  The plot is so dumb that the guy writing the novel doesn't even know how he is going to end it.  He has this epiphany in the last half hour and  then doesn't use it. Â   I wish I had gotten a better book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the beginning, I was excited about this book because it is about "I Love You" (by the same author, I think) and it was funny.   However, as it went on, it got worse.  I can't imagine that any woman in her 50's would enjoy reading that book (I'm not sure any of the men in the story liked it either).   And it got a bit more depressing.  The ending made it worse. The man's "love" for the woman was clearly based on money, not on affection.  He wanted her in a different job.  It made me feel sorry for the man, but it wasn't really any consolation to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was hoping this was a good book to read.   For about a year or so I have been trying to make a novel.  It has a very old style that would have been appropriate in the seventies.  Unfortunately the pacing is bad, not good.  Sometimes there is too much going on, like an intermission.  For my first novel I was a bit confused and had to go back to reading something I had read the day before.  I am a bad reader, so I probably got the characters wrong.  The protagonist is a good, if flawed, protagonist.  So the story isn't bad, it just takes a long time for the story to happen.  At one point, the protagonist wants to have a child, but he doesn't want his name to be used or the child to be the heir to a massive fortune.  He has a hard time deciding what to do about the money and has a big speech that is full of anger, but the author's use of italics to get the point across makes the passage seem so much more angry.  Overall, a very good, but not very original, novel.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm going to try and be as fair and accurate as I can with this review.   This book is a little more than a typical post apocalyptic novel.  It has a lot of great ideas about human behavior, including what a good person would do.  But it's too often about the bad behavior.  There's an entire chapter on how to get away with murdering people.  If the main characters were to actually go around trying to do this, it would probably be a disaster.  The main characters do a lot to help each other, which is cool.  I liked that some of the characters were actually good people who just didn't want to do what's needed.  Unfortunately they don't seem to ever follow through on those good ideas.  My guess is that some ideas were meant to be used later in a sequel but didn't make it into the book.  Also, the bad guys are mostly just mindless idiots who don't have any real motivations.  In the end there are several times when I want to shoot down these characters and let the survivors live.  Overall, this wasn't a bad novel, just one that got a little too post apocalyptic for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book.   It is the story of a single, isolated, poor black woman and her two sons.  It  starts out with a poor black man telling his story and then the story is followed by a bad white woman.  The  poor man is told he is lucky because his father is alive because if he did not have his father, he wouldn't have a son, a son who is not very good and a son whose mother is dead.  This poor black lady is told she is lucky that her husband and son don't have the chance to become bad white women.  When the black man starts having problems with the white woman he is told her family has had troubles and it isn't good for any man to make such a mess.  They both live in the same house and are pretty much the same family.  Both have a few black people and a few white people and they all live very close together, no one ever goes too far.  I can't believe it was based on a true story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is a little disappointing in some aspects, but it's still a good story, I've been interested in this series because of the characters.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â This book is basically an extended rant about the stupidity of people who act like we are all that stupid. It's also a rant about how to get rid of people like that (I'm a white guy and I can easily find a black friend or two in LA)   The problem is that the author never explains anything about himself or the "culture" he's critiquing in his rant (which is basically all of the above).   This is really just a bunch of stuff he's heard from people in his area 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved this book! The author is very good about describing characters and settings, and it's clear that he had a lot of fun working with all these weird characters he created. The book is set in the distant future in a post-apocalyptic world where the Earth is uninhabitable. The planet's people have settled on a planet that looks like the Moon. The colony is built of wood and dirt, and the people are kept to a bare minimum, to maintain a clean and dry environment.   When a young boy named Jack is found in a wooded area, he is immediately brought back to life by the inhabitants.  He is immediately sent away from the colony, to live with a man who is a "bronze warrior" with white hair and gold armor, who is the leader of the colony.  It's a fun, fast-paced book with plenty of action! The book had me hooked from the first page!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book sucks.   My review is going to sound negative because   I am a huge fan of all of her books.  But this book just sucked. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not like this book.  I just finished it after waiting 20 minutes for it to get to my library because of a broken computer.   The book is very poorly written, and the descriptions of different styles of writing are very inconsistent.  The characters are so one-dimensional that I couldn't get past their boring lives.  Overall, the only good thing I can say about this book is that it helped me think about different ways I could be a better writer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sorry that this book is crap.   The thing about it is that it really does come off as a sort of   "Boredom is the most delicious thing in the world".  It is also   full of  things that the author likes.  I wonder if he could   have used a better   format and more clearly   described the main character. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is bad. It is a classic book about the nature of science.   And it is true of everything I have ever read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was so easy to write and so poorly written that I felt like I was reading a textbook. I really wanted to love this book but I just couldn't. It was just bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is all about the bad:  When a person reads about a really bad experience with a horrible, horrible person, they get the idea that  The first two sentences of this book are a warning:  "I've met a lot of people in my life, and none of them was as terrifying as Mike.  He'd be on TV and in the tabloids for years if it wasn't for   his temper, which was so uncontrollable he could get violent at any time.  I'd met some people who were horrible people, but Mike was   so unpredictable that   if they thought I was trying to take them down with me,  they'd literally stab me in the back  " (p. 30).    The author tries hard to create sympathy for the characters by giving them a lot   of bad experiences.   In the end, Mike was the worst person in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason I bought this book was to get a copy of the DVD of this movie and I was a bit let down.   In all honesty, the movie is a great movie, but the book is just as entertaining and the book has the same plot and even a few of the same scenes as the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really liked this book.   It's a good read with a fun concept.  It is also a bit short. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book, and it was a waste of my money.   As mentioned in the review, this book is a compilation of three other works:  The Last Starfighter    (which is also published by Del Rey)  Â (which is published by Titan Books)  and  The Ultimate Adventure   This book is so far behind the times that you can't help but wonder why it is still being published today.  When I read this book in 1998, I was fascinated by the book.  My favorite character was the mysterious Admiral Marcus (my favorite space adventure is Star Trek: The Motion Picture), and the story was about a space empire which had gone to war with a new alien race that was very advanced.  The book is also great because it follows the lives of the characters who get caught up in the fighting.  It is interesting to think that the space empire that is fighting this new race has only just come into existence and that they have had no experience in war.  I hope that this book won't be around much longer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a pretty good book.   The best part of the book is its writing.  It has a very well written and descriptive way of writing about a story.  When the characters were talking about a man's body falling to earth, I was thinking about how we all live on the earth.  Even in the worst cases of a man being shot through the head, it does not get much worse than what we are now.  But then the story moved to a place where it got to the point of being almost too sad, but not.  This book has a sad ending.  The story was interesting though. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was expecting more. The first 5 or so pages were kind of interesting, if not entirely engaging.   The rest was a bunch of repetitive details about how people think.  My brother thinks  the police officer  is a liar.  The therapist thinks  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought it was interesting and well written. I would say that it was more about being a student than about being in school. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a travesty. It's so bad and so boring, that it's hard to even read it.   It does have an interesting point about race, but even that is twisted to a stupid point by the author's need to make it appear that "whites" and "nonwhites."   There's no real explanation as to why whites are inferior, just "blacks" are. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book that is completely unreadable and the authors should get a life.   For the most part, I was unable to relate to the book at all.  I've read a lot of "self-help" books and these are the first that really stood out for me.  This book was a great start to a book I'll be reviewing shortly 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't give a 5 star rating.   The story is good and the book is interesting, but   the story does not live up to the characters.  There is a lot of information in this book that   is either irrelevant to the plot or just doesn't have much to do with the characters in the book.  It really bothered me that  this is a book about a vampire hunter and the reasons he went on a mission of revenge to try and save the world.  The only reason that I even liked the book was  because  he is such a good character. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It has a lot of interesting ideas but it's not really the kind of thing I can put down for later use. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a good example of why bad writing is not a flaw of the genre, but rather a fundamental, unavoidable part of the craft.   I was a huge fan of the first book in the series.  I wanted this one more than the other one because I wanted to know more about what it was like to be a girl in a male-dominated profession.  The first one had been a fun read, but the second one is a whole different thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am really disappointed by this book.    This was a book that I was looking forward to, but this book just doesn't live up to the expectations I have of it.  While the setting is good, it just isn't the same as the other novels in this series.  In addition, the pacing is too slow.  There are too many pages of descriptions.  It can get really tedious at times.  The plot is still decent, but not as good as it used to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Â  The story in the book is amazing. It's not my favorite and it's not the sort of thing I read from a classic I wanted so badly I spent thousands of dollars on it.   And the book should never be read again! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The ending is the absolute worst thing ever.   What?   Did anyone read the ending in the book?  Did that have anything to do with the ending?  What a waste of a good book   This book is nothing more than a waste...
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love the title but, it really didn't say anything about the book   This book is about a gay couple in 1970's Paris. The main character is an artist called John who has a gay relationship with his partner, Ed. But the problem is that they are very "out" in Paris. I'm sure it was a political statement and it was written in the '70s but I don't think anyone really needed to write this book because it could have been a story about any couple 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the third time I've been given a free book, with a good review saying this would be the last.   The first two times I finished and had to wait a week before re-reading, but this time it just went on too long. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author is trying to make her book sound good but it's not.   Â  There are some pretty good science fiction stories, but there is almost always a bit of the usual cliched story about how technology is going to save us from   humanity's   problems.  And it's all too easy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What was the point of this book?   The book was basically the same plot as "The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon" with some new characters and a lot of new language (e.g. "the little finger in the corner of his eye").   One of the new characters is a girl who is described as a "chick who likes to get dressed and put on a pretty dress."   I'm not sure why this is important.   For all intents and purposes this is a novel about a girl falling in love with a boy (and a girl doing all the heavy lifting in the book).   This is not a novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am new to the world of writing, to the publishing industry, and to the internet.   The book has an ISBN, but I can't find it.  I was very excited about this book when I found it on Amazon.  Sadly, this book is another example of a book that is a disaster due to poor editing.  It has a lot of typos, and the style is not very interesting.  If it had been available on paper I would have found some use out of it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book - and it's a good one too.   It's a well-written narrative, and it has a surprising amount of plot.  I do wonder about the quality of the writing, though. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not one of the best books I have ever read.  I enjoyed it as much as I can but the writing is terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the most frustrating   books  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had this on my Nook for awhile, but it doesn't keep my attention.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have purchased many times from BookPeople and have always been very pleased with the books and shipping.   So I was very excited when I read that there would be a third edition available.  However,  I was not pleased with it at all.  Firstly the content of the book is the same except it now has a hardcover.  And the printing is worse than in the first edition, so it's not as crisp.  Furthermore, the book now has an epilogue, which is a nice idea but the first chapter seems out of place.  It seems like it was written to promote the third edition and the first two editions weren't that good and then the third was supposed to be the best!   A lot of the content is identical to the second edition, which I found a little weird.  Finally,   the prices are the same as in the second and first editions:  $3.00  $4.00
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a very well written book that covers the basics of a complex subject without being dry or boring. I wish it were longer, but it covers the ground very well.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are looking for a book to read and enjoy, this is a book you will love   It starts out really well, and it stays that way throughout.   This is a fun read   I hope more authors will read this and follow it to get a different angle on the way the world is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was going to wait until the book had been edited and reprinted by an authorized reprinting company, but I couldn't resist reading it when I found it at a secondhand bookstore.    It is a collection of poems of varying quality and the author is so vague about many of his sources that I can't tell what he's doing.  It's very odd, to me.  I didn't learn about the author until the first two poems (which are very good) but he's been around for a long time in this little world and I'm surprised that he didn't get a more prominent mention in a more distinguished anthology of writers and poets of the 1930s and 1940s.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the story of a man who was an army sergeant during the war in Vietnam, who later served in a foreign military force in Korea, and who finally returned to the States and was unable to find work as a civilian because of the bad press he got for his service in Vietnam.   He went to Vietnam in '64, returned in '67 after a year in Korea and was assigned to the 4th Infantry (later called the 2nd Infantry) which was part of the 1st Battalion, 6th Marines.  The book's first two-thirds (about the same time as the 3rd Infantry's tour of duty in Vietnam) is an account of his time in Vietnam and the difficulties he was having in getting a job back in the States.  It wasn't until he came back from Korea (this was in 1967) that he finally found a job.  He also had a bad trip to Korea in his first year as a Marine in 1969.  His military career eventually ended in frustration and his military service was overshadowed by his civilian life which he was very unhappy about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is written in a way that most people won't understand at first, although it's mostly very obvious after a few chapters. The first half is basically an introduction about the main characters and their lives. After that, the whole book is about how each of them is in a difficult marriage. The main character's marriage is actually a horrible marriage from the start because her mother was divorced but she kept the divorce quiet to avoid it and she's very close to her mother-in-law. The book ends with the main character leaving and moving to a place where she'll no longer be able to have that kind of marriage, but still has to deal with her mother and her husband.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't recommend this book enough, at least to those who are looking for something to read.   If you are looking to read a good novel about some of the most important events in the history of a country or a country's relationship with the rest of the world, then this book is perfect.  If it is not too much of a distraction from the plot, it might just give you a good reason to read the other novels in the series as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The biggest shortcoming to this book is that I do not like writing about the future.   This isn't because I do a bad job of predicting how things will end up but rather, I tend to use the future as a stepping stone for explaining why things are the way they are. Â For instance, when I predict a war between humans and machines (as in: how to make a better computer) I don't need to have some futuristic war as a backdrop to justify my prediction because I have already explained why wars are inevitable.  Â  The past is what you make of it.  This, I think, is a good lesson for those of us who would use the past as a way to make predictions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book thinking that my older son, who is an adult, would like it.  It didn't work at all.   It's a good story, but I got the feeling that the writer wasn't having a lot of fun writing it. I don't know that I'd have a problem with a young adult story that doesn't feature superheroes and villains, but not much fun is involved. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really had a good time reading this book. I can't remember ever loving anything as much as I loved this book, even after re-reading it so many times.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was terrible book.   I can't say the same thing about the first one   but it was at least ok, I mean at least it was a different take. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would have given this 5 stars if I could have!   But...the author just makes things up on the spot...I mean he goes on to say that the movie is better, yet he doesn't remember the name of it.   Well, I guess I'll just have to live with the fact that it's not worth watching 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book ever. It does not have any good parts, not even a chapter. It is an example of "just because". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My son was born two weeks before the book. He has not read the book because of his mother's inability to read.   But, I had her get the book, and she gave it a thumbs up and is recommending it to friends. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only reason I got this book is so that I could find the author's "personal" book about the "crisis in the church."   It seems like she was bored with her writing and went out of her way to put the best face she could on it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In my opinion, this book was a big disappointment.   This is the first book I've read from a popular author, but I've enjoyed the other authors, and have wanted to be a writer/reader since I was a kid.  But here, I don't want to get a book with bad writing and a terrible story.  I felt like the book was too short, and that I didn't really learn a lot.  The characters had too many plot points that weren't fully explained, and the plot was really just that: a plot.  This book didn't have a strong theme or message. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to like this book but I found it to be rather shallow and boring.   The main character is the kind of person that is interested in the latest fad but doesn't really have a deeper interest in anything else.  It's a pity that she doesn't realize that she isn't truly interested in anything.  I'm not sure how many of the books are like this - I'm wondering if it's a common problem with these kind of books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't have a lot of good reading material.  I'm just a huge fan of historical novels.   But this is not a good historical novel.  The only way I could get through the book is by taking notes at the back of the book.  So much of the writing is filler. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As someone who loves reading and loves the books in the Twilight series, I've heard of it before but have not actually read it yet.   There is just so much to like about this series that I couldn't help but recommend this book.  It's just an awesome read, as well as a great way to get caught up on the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A horrible book about a very bad person  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had a friend on here tell me about the book when she got it.   When she read it, she said that most of the material was not original, or at least not very original.  It's good for a laugh once in a while, but not worth a whole book to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book as a present from a family member.   The only thing that got me going on reading it was the cover, which is so awesome (looks like a picture on a coffee mug), but the story itself is a real let down.  First of all, the characters are all   annoying    they are   just   too   much   in the story to be in it for the right reasons.  Now   the plot is just stupid:  (view spoiler)   Two kids meet each other for the first time after a traumatic experience.  There is no reason to meet each another, and there is no need to explain this as the two don't know each other very well.  Their meeting at a party is an awkward one, as the girl looks at him like she wants to do some weird thing.  But she goes away to dance, so no big deal.  (hide spoiler)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was expecting a story like that one where it takes a bunch of people from different places and gives them a set of problems and problems only they can fix in the end.   Instead it had something else - a story I didn't expect.  In the end it took me a while to realize that I was the problem because I was so eager to help the rest of the group. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not what I expected from a "historical fiction". It is the story of a girl from a rich family who escapes into the countryside with her two-year-old son after they are kidnapped. Her brother is executed and the mother is captured by the soldiers.   She finds a horse and a farmer and they continue on to Canada. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The    book   "The Power of Nightmares"   is the first in a series of "totally awesome" books   written by some kind ofÂ "special"Â writer.   I will be waiting   for   this one  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's bad because it doesn't have a point.   If the main character is evil, is a bad person, but is in a good book, he is in the wrong book   I can tell you one thing I learned from that book: When a book is bad it's not because it is bad.  The author, the publisher, the author of the book, the editors... they're all corrupt. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book because I'm a fan of Robert Jordan and the Wheel of Time series, and I like that he makes the characters "real".   It is a shame that there isn't a good fantasy series like this around for me to read in the future.   (1 star)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book ever.   It's about two teenagers who are friends and they become lovers at the end of high school.  This is a horrible book!   These people are terrible and you'd think they'd have better things to do than to act out these fantasies that are so immature. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found myself wanting to reread this, even after I finished it  .   This book is the basis for the movie, with the same characters. It is a fun ride and the first two thirds are pretty good.   The third act is a mess.  If you have ever seen the movie this book is pretty much like it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â This book is NOT about the Jews. It is a historical account of the destruction of the Jewish community during WWII, a time when they were not considered a people of the land as they are today (even though they were). The book also provides an example of the use of propaganda to mislead people.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the definition of a "how to fail" book.   It starts out looking pretty good, but the writing and editing just wasn't there. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a terrible book, that has a bad ending. It makes the first two books in the series so much better.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would definitely recommend this book, however, I was disappointed when I got home and found out that there wasn't a third and final volume.   The first two are great, and the third one is just mediocre 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is about 2/3 of the way through the book, and the second half, especially, is just not that good. This is, to my mind, a book which should have come out a decade or so ago, not a couple of years before (it's not even about a few thousand years ago, but that's okay since it's set in a fantasy world).   There are a lot of points which could have been very good, but they're not--or they're very different from what the author actually attempts to do (and it's a shame, because he has a lot to say about that). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was terrible   It was like a bad re-telling of a bad movie   The main character is a racist   There are no other African-American characters   No actual characters at all   I would not recommend this book to anyone
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a fan of some good fantasy books, but never a bad one. I read the first couple of books in this series, but have since stopped. The characters are too boring and the plot is not interesting enough. If I could have read another book in the series, I would have given it less than three stars.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book, but I could not put it down.  It is very educational, even when it is a bit dry, but is easy to read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had been reading a book about the Japanese Emperor for a long time, and in the course of doing so I found myself questioning the whole thing. The emperor had a reputation as a man who would never give up. When I found out about this "miracle" I was like, "wow, this is ridiculous." I mean, what does he do? Just sit there and look at himself in the mirror? What's the point?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book written by a religious nut.   If you are a member of a cult, if you are interested in religion, you will love this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The bad   - - a book that is not worth the money   It is a good book but you cant see how it has that great ending   I dont like the format  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was not good. I am a fan of John Green but this book did not interest me as a reader. It was a book that I wished I would have never read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is a mess from start to finish.   It is supposed to be the story of a family that has grown up together over a period of time but doesn't really have any characters that have any depth at all.  I don't get why these people don't like each other.  And there are way too many times when they don't even bother to mention who they are talking to or why they are there.  They just come in, have a conversation, and leave. Â How can a story like that be set in the year 2000?   There is no real way to tell them apart.  It seems like some of the plot points are just thrown in for the sake of it but I just kept expecting it to come back up again.  Some characters seem like they were written for a different story but it doesn't matter.  The main thing that is keeping me from giving the story 3 stars is that the ending is just a complete mess.  Yes, the ending made sense but I felt like there should have been some other stuff to come and tie up all of the loose ends in this series.  There were just too many parts of the story that weren't really needed and left me confused. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sorry to disappoint the fans of the series.  The book begins and ends poorly, the characters are flat, the romance is weak, the world-building isn't very good, and the action is boring.   This is a prequel and was published before the books were out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wish this book had been titled   Â   Â "What I Got for Christmas   When I first got the book I was shocked   to learn the plot was just a re-enactment of a movie scene  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am disappointed in this book as it has several faults. The story line is very strange and is very hard to understand.   The book also makes references to a "real" book (that's not the book) about the same people that are in the book, so, it might be a book by this "real book" writer, but the book isn't really the real book in the end so why would they make references to the real one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best way to describe The Man Who Came to Dinner is a story about a man who goes to a dinner party only to find everyone else there has forgotten how to cook dinner.   I loved this book, but I'm glad it was over when I was so young. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main problem with this book is that its primary purpose is to get you to think about how the media works.  Â It is not a critical study about media, but a survey and commentary on how its main elements work.  In a short work, you can learn a lot about how people use media. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book for an assignment in high school. It was a really fun read and a really good read. I think I might reread it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a fine book, and it is a bit too long and dull for my taste. But, I have to admit, that's the best part:  For the money, and a bit of reading (not just a synopsis), you get a lot of information (including a detailed explanation of a rather convoluted method of solving a Rubik's cube).
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book after being told that it's the one true translation of the Bible, which to me doesn't make much sense.   It's a collection of different books that were translated into German in the 19th century, but the Bible is a German language translation of an Aramaic or Hebrew text that's thousands of years old.  I found it very hard to follow the story, which is probably the only bad thing about the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was just one of those weird, poorly written stories about a young man who is convinced that he is the reincarnation of a famous poet.  The author tries to find historical parallels with the poem (the guy was the son of a rich merchant who took a fancy to the poet, she was a princess) and it is a bit of a stretch (the daughter of a noblewoman and her lover   did actually write poems).  I found this one more interesting than interesting because  the author doesn't use an actual   poem or anything   to make her point    and it   just   seemed to me that she didn't know what   she was talking about.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot was a total mess that had me waiting a while before it started and it was hard to believe the book was so short.   It was a waste of time and I have to say that I hated the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author is a terrible author, and the book is written in a terrible way. I was never a big fan of the series, but now that I've read this I feel very sorry for the poor author who didn't get the concept of the stories right.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is absolutely awful.   The only good thing is that it is a good example of the kind of writing that you can actually enjoy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is so bad   I can't believe I read it   You are so wrong   No one knows about this   Why would anyone care about the   life of an   teenager   This is   just   a   total   mistake  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While I love this book (which is something I've never said about my usual genre) I found myself being pretty bored by the end of the book.  It's hard to get into the mind of a teenager as the plot seems to shift around them like a bad dream.  Even when you do get in, it doesn't feel real because the characters are so unbelievable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main character was not very likable and the plot kept dragging in places.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's about a guy who was born in Japan and lived there most of his life until he was about 7 years old. He doesn't speak any Japanese and I was trying to figure out if he had been in a karate class in his childhood or had seen karate films when he was a kid.   If you're interested in the history of Japanese karate, this is a good book for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not recommend this book to anyone, unless you want to learn a lot about the way that the media and our education system deals with the world.   This book is mostly about a boy who thinks that he is a girl and the girl who thinks she is a boy, but what it doesn't tell you is that there are actually two girls. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed with this book. I expected more from it. I have enjoyed reading the books by James Patrick Kelly, John Lee (who's writing style and plot is also interesting) and James Sallis (who has also been a favorite of mine).    The premise is interesting but the ending, although interesting, is disappointing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I never got around to reading this book, because I got sidetracked reading it.   There are lots of things that are   silly and   ridiculous   but   it's so   boring   and  boring that   at times   one   was   tempted   to skip it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete trainwreck.   There is a long section in the beginning that explains why we need to get off our asses and go out and get jobs.  The problem with this book is that no one really takes the time to tell you how bad it is, it seems to come right out the gate and there's not much time to do anything about it.  There are so many little examples of how people get ripped off in the world.  It's almost as if people in the past were like this book says they should be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's just like watching a train wreck.    In some ways I was glad I didn't buy it.  Â   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was bad.   The plot of the book is not interesting.  It is just a plot for the book to end.  This is my first ever book so I am not sure why people want to get into it but the way the book was written, the characters didn't seem to have any character, and the end was lame.  Also, I don't like the main character. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The problem is that the story, even in its first half, seems to have been written in haste.   (The first half starts off strong with a good scene where the main character tries to make out a boy, but gets a little embarrassed in the process.)    This book also lacks a clear point of view, which can be a problem in some stories.  I did enjoy the scene where Sarah took Sarah to a psychiatrist to help her deal with her "problem with girls."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The novel was about the protagonist who had a crush on a young woman in her class, but he never did anything about it.   His dad died when he was six so he grew up without a father figure.  He is in a group of friends who all have similar stories of getting dumped and have a tendency to make excuses about it, especially in front of the person he's trying to get.  I guess that explains why he is always talking about his ex. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a newbie to sci fi, and was very pleased by this novel. While there were some parts I didn't like, it was enjoyable all the same.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought a copy of this book to use as a reference during an introductory chemistry class.   It was useful, but also very outdated (in fact it is now an outdated textbook ).   Also, there is not enough information in it for me to understand the chemistry concepts. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, like many of the others in the series, deals with very dark, dark subjects, and I found it hard to like it.   If you haven't read the books, don't be put off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited to try this book out, as I read a review for it a few months back, and was a little bit disappointed at my results, at least as far as reading books is concerned.   It's a shame, too, because the author seems to have been very clear about the type of books she wanted to write:  "A good book about good things and bad things is like an old friend who you've lost touch with but still get some odd things out of her--e.g. what you'll find when you look for a particular item on the internet, how an ex would have reacted to seeing your old house through a different lens--and is still very funny in its own way."   (And, I guess, some other good things about it...)   The fact that she doesn't include the actual book isn't a real shame, though, as the first half is actually pretty decent.  It starts out slow (as do many stories about the Internet, really), but there's something about the way the author talks about the subject that makes the whole thing sound a little silly.  The way she describes the way that we humans tend to get a little excited over the things that we think we've found, and then become sad when we realize that they aren't real, is pretty funny in a "what the hell?" kind of way.  And, as mentioned above, the first part is pretty decent--it's a good, straightforward start to a story about the ways in which we use technology to connect to people, and even to each other.  I'm not sure that there's a story I can think of off the top of my head that doesn't start that way--it doesn't just make us think of how great it would be if the world could be a little more connected--but, if that's the way you start a book, it's good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is not about the history but about the future and the people in it. I think it is a good idea to have a "history" book about the people and places that people think about and read about and make a study of.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best way to describe this book would be, I'm not a good reader.   But I know people like that, so the book was too good to pass up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only thing I liked about this book was that I kept waiting for the characters to start talking.   That's about all I'll say about this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really thought this was going to be interesting but   it was a very slow paced read, it was slow enough I  felt as though I was being lectured at.  Â The story was well written   but 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't normally read non-fiction, but in this case I was looking for something about my family and the "sad" part was much more prevalent in the memoir than the happy stuff (i.e. my childhood and childhood friends).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't wait to read the next volume in this series, but I'm a little disappointed with this first one.   The book was set in an alternative reality where the U.S. was not at war with Iraq.  While that may have been a good idea, it meant that many of the major characters and the conflicts they were involved in seemed to be completely unrelated to the real world, including the one which caused much of the tension in this book.  I'm pretty sure the U S. was still at war in Iraq, but for some reason I can not bring myself to care.  The first half of the book was basically a rehash of previous plot points which made me not care about any of the characters, and when the major conflict in the book finally occurred in a way that was unexpected, it was a disappointment.  It seemed like I had seen this before in a book I liked a lot, but that doesn't make the book any less disappointing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very good book, but there are some really bad ones out there. If there is a good book about life (or the life of something that might be a very bad book) it's this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book for my husband because he's always been interested in "mind control" and I thought this would be a good read.   The first 10% of the book is interesting and I enjoyed it.  Then the author starts to get into some questionable subjects. The subject of mental illness is a hot button one for me as I have some mental illnesses myself, however, it seems a little far fetched to say that a mind control is possible.  I'm not the kind to go "out and get" a specific disease or illness, instead I get the diagnosis and treatment.  But, to say something can be "caused" by a mental illness I don't think it is believable.  And, there are no references to any research done.  What we read about in this book is just speculation and it doesn't really add up.  The book doesn't make me want to stop reading, but I'm glad it was fun for me to read it and give the author the credit for actually being interesting and not just a typical book that tries to make a point.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's just one more chapter to a book that is nothing more than a bunch of ideas that aren't very well thought out or implemented.   The main character doesn't seem to be a very logical person (the idea that the mind is separate from the body is the main theme throughout), but also has a hard time remembering what happened to him after he came out of the coma.  The characters in the story are just a mess.  They think that they know the whole story but they're just doing a poor job with it.  I didn't have a problem with the writing because I was able to forget about the poor pacing and forget about it too.  But at least have more original ideas than trying to be "in on" the author's ideas. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first book in this series is just awful.   First of all, the characters in this book are not believable.  The female main character is weak, pathetic, and just plain stupid.  She doesn't believe in her own powers and she doesn't get around to learning how to use them until she is caught and is told about it.  No explanation for the powers is given until a very, very late stage in the book.  Then she goes out in the field at night, naked, to perform "magic" and get drunk.  Again, no explanation is given.  Second, the character who is being controlled by the villain in this novel is just another useless, stupid, female character.  If I wanted a series about a bunch of useless, useless, pointless females with nothing to do besides talk about boys and sex, I would read something else.  Third, the villain is a disgusting person who I'm not even going to name.  He gets all the good parts of a villain, but none of the bad.  I feel sorry for the woman who is fighting him and for his family.  A little more explanation would have been nice.  Fourth, the book is filled with plot holes.  Yes, I am sure that the author knew that the plot holes were going to occur and they probably made them so that no one would notice.  For example, the main character goes on an "art project", but she never actually describes it in her journal.  Or, the author mentions that the "villain" wants to steal her body, but there are no specifics about what the body is or where it is located.  But these plot holes are easily corrected in subsequent books.  Fifth, the heroine is not strong enough to fight the main villain on her own.  This is made very clear when she is trapped in a room filled with a bunch or rats and her only weapon is a broom.  Another example: the protagonist has been on a quest and she is told by the book's villain that she is going to find a magical sword that he has hidden somewhere in a cave somewhere and that he is going there in a few days.  There is no such story or cave anywhere near where the heroine went on her quest.  Sixth, the evil villain, who has an evil mother, thinks she is stupid. He makes her do stupid things such as carrying bags and sleeping with her brother.  In the end
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While I found this book enjoyable, I just couldn't see it as anything other than the usual crap we get in books these days:      Well, this is just like any other one-dimensional and forgettable book in this series: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is hard to get the words out at first.   I had to look up what "wounded" means in the dictionary.  For instance in this passage: "This was the best part of the book. The ending is the kind of conclusion that you can actually feel as you read it."   Not that there was any need for an ending   My one major complaint with the book was the lack of detail given about the characters.  Their names and ages are given but not their personal details  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First off, the title is misleading. I've read "Rise of the Magi" and it's a good book. But this one isn't.   It has an entirely different feel than "RISE".   As an added bonus the author doesn't bother describing how the world was supposed to work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a big, poorly researched, poorly argued piece of work.   It uses a couple of very biased sources to argue that the US government (USG) has been wrong about the effects of drugs in society.  I read about 40 pages before I finally gave up and called it a complete waste of time.  While the book does not mention that a US Court of Appeals ruled that the government's use of the drug bans was illegal, that does not change the fact that the court agreed that the drug use laws were unjustified and violated the Fourth Amendment.  This is not the place to discuss the decision.  To say that the case was "flawed" is to suggest that the decision should not have been made, a view that is not justifiable.  Also, as to the drug laws, while the book uses data from a couple sources (the RAND Corporation and a book) that are based on surveys of people who took the survey, the authors did not bother to look at the surveys and decide if they were trustworthy.  The authors could not have done much better than looking at the data and then claiming the data was flawed.  Finally, the book claims that the RAND Corporation study that is used to show the positive effects of these laws is flawed. Â  It is, but it is not flawed in the way that a study claiming that a woman is fertile in her 40s should be flawed. In fact, the data used in the study is the best available evidence of the actual effects of marijuana.  Posted by John at 1:15 PM
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is bad.   I know it is not my fault.  The problem is that I know why the book is so bad. This is a book about people who are really  not  well read   The author does her research well.  However   In the end   she doesn't.  This is not a bad thing.  It is just a bad read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a great example of the use of a negative book review.   It is a bad read, it is so badly written, it sounds like the author has no idea what he is talking about and it makes no sense.  It's very strange to read a book like this because I don't know what he means.  For example,   The man's name is not given,  he is never really a man.  The woman is called 'the wife' but not a man in the story.  No one is sure if she is even a person in this story. Â    Â   Â  This is a terrible book and it is a shame that he is getting away with his shoddy work because his name has been found in a copy of a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are several issues in this book. 1) There is an odd "discovery" in the middle about the "Gods" - their name: Gwynplaine - and the fact that the people worshiping them believe that the "gods" were once real, living people. They believe that their Gods are living people as well - so they cannot be considered "deities", as the "deity" concept was invented in the Middle Ages. This is a problem for the "Deities" to deal with. As there are no living gods around, they have to rely on the concept of "deification". 2) The book has an odd treatment of some very common objects, e.g., the common object of an "Eternal Family" is the child.   3) I also noticed an odd statement: "To keep a good religion in a place like a small village in the Scottish Highlands, the local druids (who are not very old themselves) will sometimes sacrifice a goat on a dark night."   4) The "Deity" is an egotistical person (a very bad trait), with a "bad" (in my eyes) personality. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The last chapter is the only thing that makes me want to give the book a low rating.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to give credit to the author for coming out of the woodwork to explain to the world (and myself) that they did it wrong on the cover of the book. It's funny how these things happen, but never stop it from being funny to me.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a good, though flawed book, but there is not enough about science to satisfy the non-science person.   For the science person it is a very good book about the human body but the rest is "myth" about chemistry that it has to be the human mind and not the body. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The premise of the book is completely and utterly wrong.   In a nutshell, the character's father is a pedophile, and their mother is an alcoholic (not an alcoholic with a child).   Also, she is so drunk she can't have sex.  The book is written in the first person, so it does a poor job of showing the characters and the life they live.  I was so angry when I discovered this that I immediately burned the book in disgust. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was very good at one point but then it was dropped from my reading list.   I liked that this author was interested in the way the brain works and how the brain has some sort of "mind" that controls what we feel and do, but when it got to the topic of sex there just wasn't much there.  The author did talk about the possible use of drugs in the sex cure but I didn't really follow this part of the book.  This was a good idea but I found it boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So this book is a sequel to a story that has been told for years in the world of the Dark Side, by a guy named John C. Wright. But, like a lot of people, I am skeptical of the entire "Dark Side" series. And with a name like John C., it's no surprise that I'm a bit skeptical. The first couple books are okay, though.   But this is where things get really bad. Wright's writing is terrible.  He's trying to be the "Buffy" of the series, but he's completely out of his depth.  It's like a high school textbook.  I never thought a book with such a bad plot could be as good as this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really did not know what to expect from the book.   After reading the review I thought "this is just like the first two books."   Instead I got some good hints about who is going to win and who is not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So I read this and I think I'm going to have to start looking for a good book to read and keep myself from going completely crazy.   After reading this I was not expecting it to be any good.  They try to pass it off as a book about mental illness but it is not at all that.  It was just not very good at all.  Â  I am thinking about buying the sequel but I am not sure what I'm getting myself into
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love the novel   Unfortunately it has no ending  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a horrible read. The writer could not spell correctly (her grammar was horrible).   It was also confusing. The only reason I liked it was that the heroine did a bunch of crazy things (I liked that she got away with it)   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed this book, but I don't understand why everyone is so enthusiastic about it.   It was a bit too dry, and a little too long.  There were two other books that dealt with the same subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book had so many problems   i was having with it   The book starts off with a great description of how people like the author think   it is so amazing   but it turns out that everything in this book is an   lie   the author wants to give some praise to the inventor of the world wide web but she has to be so   naive and stupid   to believe that the web is an amazing thing   and is the reason for the information superhighway   like the book implies   what the hell  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The problem is that the story and characters in this book all get short shrift, while at the same time the author writes a wonderful one page description of a cat and cat fighting.   I also think that the description is way too specific and would be better suited for a picture book than a novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As soon as I started reading this book, I was really expecting an epic in the worst way.   The book does not give us a chance to really explore the various worlds.  The story starts off so fast, it makes you feel like you are on the fast track to nowhere.  My only problem with this book is that there is almost no mystery to the world that is being presented.  It is almost as if they took the plot points of their previous book and then tried to put them in a story where there were just a bunch of characters that happened to be standing around talking at the same time and had no real reason to interact with each other. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really liked this book and was so excited to receive it in the mail. It's a really great read with lots of history and lots of people.   It's not a bad read, but it's not great either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found myself a bit frustrated with this book. The plot was okay, and I liked the characters, but I couldn't get into this book because it just seemed to be going on forever.   This book is over 800 pages long and has a lot of characters to keep track of, so I found that hard to follow. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a total let down, but not in the way the author and publisher wanted the book to be.   It is a very good book but not a great one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a disaster, it had a very weak plot and was badly written. The protagonist is a bad person and a very poorly written one.   He spends most of the time in a room being abused by some other bad people who are a lot worse. The only reason I liked him was because he was a good guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first half was fine. It was well written but didn't really grab me. It had all the makings of a good mystery with a good premise (a man is kidnapped by the government and taken to a mental hospital). That is all I could have said about the first part. Then the third act came around and ruined everything.   As the final book in the series, it was probably the biggest disappointment in the entire series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very excited to get this book, and I expected a good story.   It doesn't.  The plot is lame.  In a story like this, where the characters can't seem to get the girl, the plot is weak.  I just wish they would have put the characters in the story. Not that I expected this from a book about vampires. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The cover is great!   It really is a good book.   As someone who is into the occult, I was a little concerned about the cover because of its image, but was able to get used to it, which is a very good sign.  As far as the story goes, it's not bad.  It does have a few inconsistencies (such as how we find the bodies in the attic), and one plot element is not explained (why the guy gets turned into a goat).   But overall, it was well worth the read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book.   The prose is great, the characters are likable and believable, the story is fun to read and the ending was awesome. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading  !   my heart broke.   It's a book that I was going to love   but I was   so disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Â    This book is just a collection of stories I've heard from several people who say it is very bad.   The writing is bad. The stories are bad.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing about this book that's good is that it's written by a former soldier.    This book is about soldiers with mental issues.  They're told that their feelings of depression are all in their heads because they have no family support, no close friends, and that they're so depressed that they'd rather die than get help.  It's hard to take anyone seriously when they talk about something so stupid as depression.  The author's father was an alcoholic and was in a mental institution.  His mother's sister, my grandmother, was a schizophrenic.  As a kid, my grandfather had depression and got the help he needed.  He's survived both depression and mental illness and is still suffering from it.  But it's obvious that the author was telling his readers that the Army is great at helping people like him. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed this book as much as I have enjoyed other LOST books, but I felt that the author was not entirely faithful to the books. She mentions a time she went swimming with Kate and Sawyer on another island, but Kate's head was out of the water and the water was a different color (she is from the beach of a different island).   Â  I also feel that in a book about Lost the author should know that some of the characters have been "resurrected" for a later book (eg. Sawyer's mother is now a nurse and a teacher in Australia). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was really annoying that this was a book from the early seventies.   I would have preferred something written in the seventies and before. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this as a Christmas gift and have since read it several times.   It is not only a terrible book, it's a lousy one at that.  The author really wanted a sequel that would be a sequel to the earlier book.  That was probably because she felt as if she had been let down by the first book. It's a good read, but a bad one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was expecting some kind of "trying to do too much" kind of story about a vampire-like vampire that had the power to walk through walls and talk to people, but really it's just a bunch of boring plot points and a really stupid love interest.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is nothing more than a rehash of a bunch of previous "research" material, plus some of the same old "statistics" that are recycled in dozens of other books.   For example:  "An estimated 10-15 percent of all people are afflicted by depression"   That's a little too low, I think.  An estimated 10 percent is probably high; I know one woman who has suffered from clinical depression for 15 years and still has nightmares every night.  Â  That's another thing that's been recycled in other books about depression.  A high rate doesn't mean that all people suffer from it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the most frustrating parts of this book is the author's inability to present the ideas in a cohesive fashion.  She talks about the necessity to "explain the difference" between a "natural" language and a language "developed" by "human" intervention.  It's not like this is a common argument - I don't know of any philosopher who would agree with that claim.   In any case, if one really wants to "answer" this question, it's probably best to focus on the development of the natural languages and see how far a linguistic tradition has come from its beginnings in the early days of writing - that's where it's most likely to have been developed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is so shallow and dumb and it is not entertaining.   It is not funny at all.  And the characters are all   moronic, as in they act like idiots.  I was not a fan of the ending, either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main problem with this book is that there's no plot at all!   It is an account of the life of an ordinary person who, in an attempt to make money, decides to become a zombie.   I think the only reason the main character is a zombie is to give a nice change to a poor character!  I didn't find any real plot going on in this book, nor any of the characters interesting, so it all seems like a giant waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main character is a pretty good leader, but the book is over before the book ends.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book written by a Christian, but it's so badly written that I could write a negative Review  . First of all, the author doesn't seem to like Christian books, she only reads Christian books.   Her description of the book is the only positive thing about the book  ,   Christian apologetics is supposed to be good, but she uses that as the only reason to dismiss a book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read a bunch of memoirs about being a journalist and there was nothing like this book to change the way I see things. It was about a great reporter who was at the heart of some major scandals in her field and her loss to one of them is the saddest story I can think of.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't really care for this book at all.   It was a pretty basic history of women and how they have to fight for their place in the world.  The ending was just sad.  For people who know little about women's history it was disappointing.  This book is definitely not the book to get if you are looking for a history book on women's role in history.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I've ever read.   When the author wrote it in the 70s she may not have understood the whole of her subject as well as she did now, but her general approach and approach to her writing were both wrong and her grammar was a complete and utter mess.  She has a tendency to create a scene where the protagonists, the female protagonist in this case, are forced to sit on a park bench with a bunch of homeless people.  The homeless people start getting the best of her, they start getting her drunk and then they start making the worst insults about her appearance.  After the first couple of paragraphs, I felt like I was watching some poor bastard get verbally assaulted by a bunch homeless people, especially one guy who was in his 50's and looked pretty ugly.  This part was especially bad, it didn't help that this particular homeless person was wearing a cowboy hat and a very ugly suit.  I was so confused by what the author was trying to accomplish and why she couldn't just write a normal story.  It's one thing to write a story about a woman who is physically abused by her husband, it's quite another to have the victim make a "goodbye" speech about how she "totally" forgave the abuser for the abuse.  Why is the victim supposed to give the abuser a "pass" when that isn't true.  How can a person who doesn't know their husband and isn't close to him actually not get abused by him?  Is the "pass", "tolerated" and "in denial" only for women?  It doesn't make sense that if she is abused she doesn't "truly forgive" her husband and she is "taken aback" when her husband is abusive.  In the end, the book leaves you with the sense that she has been abused herself, but somehow she is able to get out of it, even if she has to move away from the situation.  To be honest I wouldn't be able to stand to read a book like this anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is nothing new under the sun in this book   It is mostly "just read" stories that have been around for centuries.   That said, some of the stories were entertaining, but they were still "just a story".  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a hard read, for a number of reasons.   In that sense, it was like reading a classic science fiction novel, but it was a bit less exciting than I expected.  It seemed like all of the story threads had been dropped, so I had no idea where the story was going or what was going on, but I don't think that was a negative connotation at all.  But, the ending was a little disappointing.  I liked that the author had a chance to finish the story after she had first started writing it, but unfortunately, she didn't go that route.  What did I learn about the universe from the end of this novel?   Â  The author did mention the "dark force" as the cause of the destruction of the universe, but did she mean it as some sort of cosmic force of evil?  Did she mean that the "power of evil" made the universe fall apart, or did she just mean that there was something in the universe that didn't like having its power challenged?  She did refer to "all the universe" being "destroyed," but did that mean the destruction was universal, or just that one universe? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a sci-fi and fantasy fan, I loved this book. I loved the plot, and the premise of it was very intriguing. However, the pacing of the book was horrendous. It seems like the author tried to cram all the action into the book, with very little of the "dialogue" between the main character and the bad guys. I think that in retrospect, the author was trying to make the book more exciting and more like a movie, as opposed to a book about the supernatural. I'm a huge fan of the books, and still read them, but I can see how this would have been better with an author who could write a better book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â The characters don't really feel human (at least not all the characters).   As if the author was not in control of her creations at all.   I know the plot is convoluted and the book is full of crazy twists but you can never feel for the characters, especially the ones that are either too crazy or too dumb to see the big picture. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is just a book.   The book starts out well and I'm hoping for a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book back in 2002 when I had just started my own journey into the world of yoga and I remember being fascinated and excited by it.   Unfortunately, after ten years I no longer understand what is meant by "the practice" or "the philosophy" because the writer has given it no explanation.  Perhaps this book was written in haste as its author was beginning to discover the "way" he wanted to live his life?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â This book has some interesting ideas but it doesn't feel like it's been developed in any real depth.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the middle of a very good book I decided to read another book on the same subject.   This book is much more technical than the previous one.  They use tables of numbers but are very hard to understand.  I just skimmed through it and I don't want to pay $29.95 for another book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book on the recommendation of another reviewer (and another) and am quite happy I did. The descriptions of the animals are lovely, but what I didn't understand about them is that the dog's name was "Mr. B" and the cat was "Ms. K." and so forth. The story is very simple but a nice read if you like children's books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have now completed "The Life of the Party", but it wasn't fun at all.   As the protagonist of this book, I was looking forward to seeing how they would get along when they found out the true identity of their mysterious host.  Instead, I had to read and re-read the last several pages to see how the book was supposed to end.  The main character's father has a hard time accepting the idea that their son will marry a woman that he's never met, because he is unable to see his son as anything but a loser.  As he tries to make his son accept this notion, his son shows a very weak grasp on the subject.  I know I am not supposed to laugh at this book's obvious attempts to make the reader feel sympathy for the author's son, but the poor guy comes off as a really unlikable jerk who tries to ruin the lives of everyone around him. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book isn't bad, but this book is a bad.   It starts off with the best first sentence:  "The first sentence is a sentence that doesn't need to be told. It's so simple, it's almost embarrassing."   But it quickly goes downhill:  This was a bad choice for my family, who's taste runs from the classic "novels from the 90s" to the "troublingly old", but who was also very pleased by a few of the other titles they got from a discount book shop.  It's not bad, and there is some interesting stuff, but not quite enough to make it worthwhile, not a bad read just not worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As you can tell by the title of the book, I don't believe this is a true account of a real experience.   Â  I found it hard to believe that this woman was a real woman who actually lived in this apartment and knew every inch of the place, even down to the wall where the lock was.  And if it was, I'd like to see it.  I also found it difficult to believe what she was saying about a couple of the men being in the building when the fire was reported.  The guy said he saw a couple people on the second floor.  Another person said there were two women in their 20s.  But I think if this man had a wife who lived in the neighborhood, he would not have been surprised at the fire at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a huge disappointment.   I thought it would be a good read because I was hoping that it was one of the rare books on the subject of sex and love that also dealt with women's issues.  Unfortunately, this book is anything but.  This is a feminist book with only a few quotes from feminist writers and a little bit about the issues that feminists care about.  The only quotes from men that I felt were interesting and relevant were the ones about how men and women are different and that women are responsible for their own love lives, and how sexual pleasure is not the only thing in life that is important.  These quotes have no relation to the actual content of the book, which is so far from what I hoped it would cover.  I had to go back and read the chapter about rape and find out that it is about "revenge" and the rape of women as revenge for sexual abuse, not about rape in general.  All of the women that the author quotes are white, which makes it sound like it is a commentary on racism, but the only other quotes that sound racist are the ones where the author talks about sexual freedom (and the fact that women have the right to say no to sex)  The one woman that is quoted that mentions racism is the author's sister, who says that she would never have sex with a black man because she didn't want to "have to think about" racism.  While it is nice that she is quoted because her quote about "think about" is relevant (the quote is about white men who have "to think about racism"), the fact is that this book doesn't seem to know what it is talking about. I am a white woman (I'm the only woman in my family) and I don't have to think "about" race. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't normally read YA (but have read some of her other books, which were okay), but this was so bad and boring that I had to drop it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very long book, especially when you consider that it's a collection of excerpts from books written by other authors (all at the same time). There's some very good stuff in this book, but there are also some very bad. If you read about 1,000 books, how many of those were made as a collection?   I had not read all of the authors mentioned in the book before I read it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a bad and badly written book.   The pacing is awful.  The story is poorly told.  There is absolutely NO conflict in the book. " The last few pages are a complete mess.  "   I've never hated a book so much in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had some hopes for this book and they were quickly dashed.    My main problem with the book is that it focuses on the women's rights movement and how this is being done by women, as if there are not so many ways to change laws about prostitution without having to force women to be prostitutes as well.  The other main problem is that this book is almost entirely written by a man, and only talks about women, because men's rights activists don't really talk about men much, and never have.  This book is mostly about the rights of women who want to get involved in the men's movement, but this is a good example of why this is impossible.  I also feel that there is a lot of stereotyping in this book.  Although it has nothing to do with prostitution, the book talks about how women are inferior to men.  However, in my experience, these stereotypes are not always true.  Sometimes, men have a hard time accepting that women are equal to them.  For example, the male friend who told me about his experience of prostitution is very smart and educated.  He is also very honest about his experiences with prostitutes and how he feels about the prostitutes in his town.  My guess is that many women who have had prostitution experiences like the man feel the same way.  Other times, men are so angry about having to take a wife that they hate to consider that they might have a wife or girlfriend at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter books, so I was looking forward to this book.   The characters were very different, the stories were so interesting, and the story seemed more complete than all the other series.  It's unfortunate that the author got the book deal, since this book felt rushed and incomplete to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book off the back of a library book about "The Bible in Africa" written by a German missionary who arrived in a small town in Africa about the time I was there.  The book contains lots of anecdotes and interesting bits from a variety of sources,  It is a good source and will provide lots of background to this and other stories from Africa  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wanted to read a fun and interesting book about a boy named Henry. Instead I got a book about Henry's life and not his feelings, and my interest was totally squelched.   The author was clearly looking for a story but didn't know what that would be until she wrote her book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are so many good things about this book that the fact that there is no character development is a real bummer.   It's a good book to read.  The story is really good.  It is a very good example of a fantasy in a genre that was trying to go in a different direction and has had its heart beat stolen by the "grimdark" trend. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hate this book. I've been looking forward to this book for a long time, and so I decided to buy it.   But I just didn't like it as much as I thought I would.   I think if you like books about science, this one will be fun.  But if you don't want to read anything about science you can find on Amazon and other sites that make the same claims as this book does about how evolution is false, then I'd say steer clear. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The second book of the series I bought was "The House on the Cross" and was not so good.  It didn't have that good of an atmosphere that the first book had, I couldn't understand how people can enjoy this book and it was boring to read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While the world building for this series is decent.   It does not really add anything to the story or setting. Â That is not a knock on the book, but the world just has so much to do   and we don't have a lot of time with any of the major characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think this is a really bad book, with an ugly, unnecessary plot twist and the kind of ending that makes you wish the author would die.  Â It's a boring and confusing read that has nothing to say.  I've read plenty of reviews criticizing this book, and I have to agree. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a lover of books that I would consider "classic", I have a lot of respect for the authors that wrote this book. The concept is so cool. The characters are the most intriguing part about this story.   The writing is well done and I'm curious to see how the characters will be portrayed later.  I don't like the cover art, and I do like the story, but I think I'm going to read it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hate this book   It is the most offensive and ignorant book ever written on religion and its followers   This book is pure propaganda   As a Christian who believes in Jesus   Jesus taught that a man should hate a woman   No woman can be my friend   Women don't belong in the church   And yes women should have a choice   You can't live the life that you want to   There's a lot more to Christianity than what they teach in this book
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really liked this book, but the author completely ignored my questions.   The story is excellent and if you're a sci fi fan, then you're going to love this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is terrible.   It was pretty stupid to think a book with the title, "Moral Tales of the American Indian" could really be about anything, but that is what they put in.  It has to do with the war and a bad guy taking a guy from the reservation, but they were all stupid stereotypes.  The characters who show up (even the Native Americans) were not as interesting as the people who showed up in other books about Indians.  I will buy this book, but I doubt I will keep it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think this book was written for the average person. The book is about a teenager with ADHD who is having a lot of trouble with school, but he has a good supportive family and friends.   The main problem is that his brain can't function when he is distracted by other people.  He spends much of the book trying to figure out how to manage that problem.  I also think that he might be better off if he were more assertive with his parents or at least put the brakes on the whole "I love you" thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is by far the worst book I've ever read in my entire life.    The characters are the worst - we've all seen that before, but this time it was even worse.  I could go on, but let me just say this - if I had known a person as "selfish, dishonest, and mean" as I did about this book, I would never have read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is terrible.   It has characters who are so completely stupid that they are barely on-panel.  They act like they have the brains of a caveman in an incredibly un-natural way.  Â  The most bizarre scene is when one character is shown to be unable to read because he has the wrong color shirt.  For those unfamiliar with it:  Â  Â It's a shirt that is always red, except when it isn't.  This was a character that was a part of the show as a regular who was in a long-running TV show, so it's possible that he did try on different shirts. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wish I'd listened to the audiobook before I read it.   The language is strange. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In general, this book is a "must have."   As a former college English major (I actually got a PhD in English and was an adjunct professor), I was eager to get my hands on a book that might give me some insight about a literary genre I had never been deeply interested in: the urban fantasy.   However, the writing in this book was so poor that, although I read and re-read a lot of literature (including some fantasy and horror) during the last 15 years of my life, I never actually got to the point where I had a complete understanding of what a literary work was about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book, a very bad book.   If you've got no interest in reading about a time-travel adventure in a post-apocalyptic world, there is little that the author has to say in terms of the plot or the characters.  The plot is basically just some guys going to a certain place to shoot the breeze.  There's no character development, no twists, no surprises.  It feels like the authors have written a book to make money off of the fact that you'd be more interested in their adventures than in the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so horrible that it should be the worst book of all time.   There is nothing that a mother should know about child development that would be different from what a mother has been told.  It was a waste of time and money to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is the first in a series of six.   The books were interesting for about a year or so, but   the ending did not feel as satisfying as the others. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book in the middle of a heavy depression.   It was the most helpful to my mental health that I have ever found in a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't wait to see the next installment of this series as I'm really hoping this is a short story.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Â    The first two pages were beautiful  Â But then the book turns   to a boring story about the first time   that   a girl   put a dog   on a leash  .   This has nothing to do with the book, only the author's   pet project   I feel   the book will be a great   lesson   but   It   will   be   for   students  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is based on a TV show that doesn't even bother to include the characters' names in its credits.   I was expecting to see more interesting people and their thoughts on how to live their lives, not characters that were created for a television show and then thrown out the window. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did enjoy this book a lot, but it got old after a while, and I got so frustrated by the story I'd forgotten it was called "The Night Circus" when it came on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the most boring, uninteresting book I have ever read.   No character development whatsoever.  It's just an excuse to give the characters super powers and take them to a secret location and have them fight giant monsters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a big fan of Dr. King's writing. I first read him in high school. He made me a better person by showing me I was a slave to the ego and could be manipulated. That was good reading.   It's a bit of a slog through it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've tried to read a lot of fantasy in my life (as many of us have) but never actually gotten around to it. I can appreciate fantasy fiction, but it just always seemed too hard to me.   When it came time for me to pick a book to start reading I couldn't really think of any at all, so I took the plunge and picked up  The Name of the Wind.   It's pretty obvious that Jemisin's debut is something she's been working on for a very long time.  In addition to the usual fantasy tropes she has some very interesting characters and a story that moves along well.  For the most part it's a story about a young woman who learns to be a hero.  Unfortunately her struggles aren't very interesting and the ending feels a bit rushed.  The main thing I dislike about Jemisins book is that in a lot  of places the plot seems to be going back to where the last book started.  If I had the time I would have enjoyed this book more, but I'm not going to get through half of this book before the next one is released.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a fan of the Dresden Files   and   but   this is a bad   book   that is not good for children.   it is hard to read   the characters are the same age.  you cant understand the language at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The best way to describe this book is to say that the plot was as expected but the characters were so annoying   I thought it would be a simple story about a boy and his dad and his little brother but instead what I got was a ridiculous amount of drama and the boy's mother going from completely loving him to being completely unsupportive   If you are a fan of the original you will definitely enjoy this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A poor first novel. The author is so self-absorbed and incompetent that her "story" was so ludicrously contrived that it became an annoyance.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book itself is okay. It doesn't have much going on, especially compared to the many fantasy books I've read. But the writing style is so dull, so drab, so boring that the story is dull as well. It's like I've been reading a boring book and decided I didn't want to look up its author's name.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was fun but the plot could not be salvaged.   In a world where the government uses nanomachines to make people smarter and more efficient, a woman can change her biological sex instantly by ingesting a small amount of nanobots.  It is supposed to be a future in which humans have the technology to "rewire" a person's genes.  While that's all well and good, it is not a good idea to have a person changing their sex without their knowledge.  For someone who lives in the future and wants to have the ability to change their sex at will, it should have been mentioned a little earlier that this is not an option.  I really enjoyed the book, but if the plot had worked as the author had planned I think I would have found the ending a bit more satisfactory.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book.   The plot is great:  "The new president of the United States, and his family, return to the White House with great fanfare and a new wave of optimism. But within a month of taking office, the nation's economy has plunged back into recession. President Clinton decides that the answer to all these   problems   is a   radical rethink of the economy, and in his inaugural address, he sets out to make   this happen. In the process, he makes some controversial pronouncements."   It's an intriguing premise and I'm glad I read it.  It took a while to get to it. I really liked the story so far. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I received this book as a Christmas gift (but not an actual Christmas one) from my mother who loves reading about the 19th Century as well as the more recent eras and would get a lot of enjoyment from reading about such historical figures as Thomas Edison and Thomas Edison's electric company.    Unfortunately, when this book was published in 2004, it was pretty poorly written.  I found it difficult to understand, and most of the information was hard to understand because of lack of clarity or what exactly was meant.  The book was written in a very style of writing that looked like something that was being made up by an incompetent writer.  In the book, Edison is described as a "troubled genius" and the Electric company is a "miserable failure"  Unfortunately I found the book hard to follow and tedious to the point that it made me feel angry when reading it.  It's a bad read at any rate
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book a long time ago.   This one is even worse.  The book was supposedly written for a 9-year-old girl.  When I was 8, my sister was a 9 year old.  My sister hated reading and was terrified of anything that could kill her.  I hated to read it and my older brother thought it was a horrible book.  It made me hate books and scared me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It didn't take me that long to realize that the characters weren't the good guys: they were the "good" guy's bad guys. I like the idea of a man who is constantly running from something, but never really wants to go into it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not enjoy this book at all. I enjoyed the first half of it. The world is beautiful and beautiful things happen. The author's writing style is a little dry, but I did enjoy the book.   But the last half was very boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A terrible book.   The author says he wants to tell a story of a man who tries to save a woman from being killed by a mugger and fails, and he gets arrested for it.   It's a classic cop-out; a cop-up.  If he can't protect a woman, how can he even attempt to protect the public?   His son, a cop, becomes suspicious, and this is the end of the story  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't get this book. It just doesn't work for me. The plot is just a pile of cliches and the characters are a bunch of weak characters.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I started this book thinking it was going to be funny.   Instead it is just depressing.  The two main characters have the same problem.  They both get into a relationship with the woman of their dreams who ends up being awful.  It is very sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book that I'd want my kids to read when they're young, and I'd feel bad if they didn't.    But, I don't think they will read it, not in time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I purchased this book on recommendation from a friend, and I'm not sure I really got what I was promised. The author is not a particularly technical writer. She does an excellent job at describing the inner workings of the mind, and describing the effects of certain medications, but she doesn't go all the way in explaining why these things are useful or even helpful. One thing she does get right is the fact that, for some people, the experience of having the sensation of something moving around inside their body is so powerful that the mind can't control it. That is, that when a person is "in a dream" (or when someone else is in a dream), their consciousness can no longer be controlled, which can be scary.   It is also true that there is a difference between having a dream, having a hallucination, and having some sort of memory alteration. So perhaps a "dream experience" could be used as a way to determine whether one is mentally ill or not?   The book describes various "exogenous" effects, such as the use of certain medicines and a diet that is high in "essential fatty acids."   One of the main points she makes is that there are many different types of "sleep paralysis," and that the experience isn't really a one-time thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book a chance because I really like the story line of a boy who has an imaginary friend, and then he is able to tell his friend the truth about his real life when it doesn't fit so well:  I thought the story was entertaining.   But I think that it is the character's behavior that is the issue   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â The book is a waste of time.   It's full of clichÃ©s about   the Â    age of the women in the book.  They all   say   things   that   make no   sense  .   They Â   have   hair   or   something   just for decoration that no one   ever uses   and   doesn't make them any more attractive.  It seems   they   must be very   happy with it because they don't   seem to have any interest in anything   else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought the audiobook   The book is very basic and the way the characters in it are treated is rather   insulting to people of color   If they can't be more honest and just say 'we have all these negative things that we do in our own ways'   then don't go   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has all the good things in it but none of the bad things in them.   The thing about horror books is that they have the power to scare but they can never completely destroy you.  Some of the things in this book are so good they make me angry   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a fun story, I just wish it had a good ending 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a nice short book (just 10 pages) with nice artwork (although it can be a bit hard to see the drawings), but the story just doesn't work.   There's a whole lot more going on than just "two little kids in an abandoned building trying to rescue their parents" - the plot goes on too long - and the characters feel way too one-dimensional. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The    books   that   you   gave   are   terrible  .   It   feels   like a terrible Â experiment   with   a   few  Â characters   and   some   plot .   I   didn't   think   this   could   have   succeeded   but   the   ending   sucks   so   bad   it   makes   me   seriously   doubt   my   judgment  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this was a bad read.   It had a lot of bad language, but they aren't used for characters to be realistic like in another book.   These are things that make me cringe.  It also had a main character I found to be a bully   She bullied everyone and didn't know the rules. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is really not worth a dime.   It is supposed to be about a man trying to find his missing wife.  It really is a lot of hype about a lot less than what the book claims.  He is in search of his wife and not searching for a woman.  They are a married couple.  The only woman he is looking for is the one who died in the plane crash.  All of her money is in her bank account.  But she also had a home built by her parents when she was a little girl.  And they both made a lot out of the relationship.  I was so excited to read this book because the only book I ever got into was this.  Then I found out that this isn't the best book to read when you want to get information about a missing person.  This is just a book with a lot more hype than what I expected.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There's nothing really special about this book.   This is more of the same old, same old. It's interesting to see what authors have gone through in writing a new novel (not all of which have worked out), but there's just too little to recommend. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read the first two chapters of this book, and when I read it, I immediately knew I had to read it.   As a story telling, this book is good, as is the book that inspired it, A Night of Strange Deaths.   But the third book in the series that is about the events that transpired in that house?   A Night to Remember?  I will pass.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â I had to start this book when I found out that it was a sequel to the first book (and I can see why: this is the sort of book that just makes you want to read more. I really can't wait to finish it, but I'm kind of holding out. The second book was way better; the first one was boring and very "what if this were written by a different author"? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of those books that does not interest me at all.   I do not enjoy fantasy books very much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wanted to like this book, but, I'm still waiting for that one good review out there.    If I can't find that one, I'll never buy this book again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book.   It's a good and not great story.  It does have some good points.  The characters are well written and have good motivations.  A few characters were interesting and it is interesting to read about what they do with their lives.  Although the book doesn't really go where I thought it would go 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is terrible. I was supposed to read this book at a bookstore, but I decided to wait until I had it out of the library.   Â    This book is so bad it's not worth reading.  The story is not based in reality (it's the author's invention), and the characters are unsympathetic, so even if the story were good, it wouldn't work because the book is not about the characters and their struggle to survive, but about the author creating a fantasy in his head to get readers to buy his book.  I would have been better off reading a fantasy novel about a knight (which is actually a good book about fantasy heroes). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author has a way with words, and this book is a great example.   However:  Â    He says it once, but doesn't explain.  Â  I'm not sure why he says it, but I like the author's style; it's less of a "how do I do that" and more of an idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book has some nice moments.   Unfortunately the book is about a woman that has become a complete jerk.  The most annoying part of the book was when the man didn't want to talk about his daughter.  How does she not even know her daughter exists??
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A very slow paced book. It seems that the author didn't like reading a book by another author that he was influenced by.   One of the "stars" is based on a character called "Krushnik", who never makes an appearance in the book, but does appear as a character in another book by the same author.  It's hard to understand why the author bothered to put out this book at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is clunky, and the prose is just terrible. It is completely incomprehensible.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In a good way.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not a big fan of this book, although it was a good one.  The book has lots of really good ideas, but unfortunately they are usually drowned out by unnecessary and overly dramatic language.   It is really the kind of thing I can relate to in real life - if we really wanted to make a good impression, we might want to avoid the words like 'terrible' and 'totally' etc., which were pretty pervasive in the book.  It also has the feeling of being like someone's blog post, especially for the last third or so, where the authors seem really sure of what they are doing, and they do not know when to stop.  But overall it is not bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I received this book as a Christmas gift from a friend. I have found this kind of reading material to be rather unreliable and it's clear that the author knows little about how to write a novel.   My main problem with this book is the fact that it is written in the first person.  I know the author will have to deal with this in the second book but it just adds to the overall awkwardness of the book.  Also, when it came to the second half of the novel, I found the story to be predictable and rushed.  The author does get it all sorted out in the third and final book but then she goes on to write the second and third books without providing a clue to why she changed her mind about the first two books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to like this book, but it did not work for me.   First of all, the book is very boring, it is mostly descriptions about things, including the description of what a person looks like without shoes, but there are hardly any pictures or descriptions about any interesting things, except for what I already knew about that person (like why they were barefoot).   The writing style is not very good, the narrator seems really out of place, and is really weirdly intrusive, but that does not detract from the fact that the book lacks substance.  If you want to read about shoes, this is the book to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The "discovery" that a person has a bad tooth (or a broken bone) or has "lost" a loved one is a real thing, and I'm not at all surprised that the author decided to use that trope as the basis for the story:  After the accident I was given a couple of books that included "discoveries."   I'm pretty sure I had no idea how to get it repaired.   What I did learn was that if I wanted to see a dentist, I would have to take off for a long weekend, then when I came back I'd have to leave for another four days.  The next thing I know, I'm on a plane back to New York. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a lot of bad horror books, but this one in particular got so many things wrong, it made my head spin.   So, I've always been of the belief that you can't go home again after you've been dead for 30 years. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My first encounter with Robert Bly had a negative effect on my enjoyment of the book.   After reading a few chapters   I thought I knew a lot more about the story and the characters.  Then   all hell broke loose.  All of the characters'   flaws are covered well.  But then   it all gets out of hand.  A huge   flaw is that a very important part of the plot is explained away   without explanation.  This   was also part of a bigger problem with the book which I have not been able to find an explanation for.  After this issue I never looked at the story the same   way again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The second half of this book is a hodgepodge of very bad ideas:  You get a very bad idea for a story:      A couple of times I've felt that the author thought she could turn the tale into a romantic story.   But a couple of the things they do are bad: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What a horrible book. There is so much wrong with it that it's impossible to read.   It's a classic case of an author trying to sell a book and failing, and of the book not being that good.  It has many problems including the writing, the editing, the lack of story, the weird characters, the bad ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book based on the title, and it was an accurate description of the book. I have seen other reviewers state that this book was not as good as some of their favorite books. I can't really comment on that because I haven't read the rest yet.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was looking forward to reading this book until I found out about the author's questionable history of sexual misconduct. It was just as horrible as I had feared. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "The problem with the author's writing is that the books are so poorly written that the reader doesn't know where the story is going from page one to page 50 or from page 50 to the end."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is really bad! The stories are great, but they all boil down to one main idea: that everyone is in love with a particular celebrity.   It is one of the worst books I've ever read.  I can't even remember how I ended up with this book in my collection, but I just can't get into it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very disappointed in this book.   It does contain an account of the life of one of the most respected statesmen in American history but fails to do justice to the many other contributions that this man made. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was pretty sure I wanted to start this book.   This is a short and sweet book, but at times the pacing is quite slow and I was a little impatient. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was a huge fan of the Harry Potter series, but my expectations were way too high.   It is a great book, but I think the movie would have been better with more time for character development. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For some time I've been struggling to keep up with all the latest happenings in the field of molecular anthropology. My current focus is on a group of ancient Mayan peoples known as the Moche.   While I am pleased to have encountered this book, I am very disappointed with the title, and with its presentation.  The authors attempt to synthesize the genetic, morphological, and anthropological work of several teams of scientists over a span of more than a century to come up with a single model for the origins of the Mopos.  It was not to be.  Although it is true that the Mochetan culture seems to have emerged from a small group of people who came across the Americas with a large group of proto-Indians, the evidence for this is thin and circumstantial.  This study does attempt to answer one question: what is the genetic signature of these early groups that gave rise to the Mocos?   In fact, the authors' answer is only a very general description of a few of the many other possible markers that have been proposed as possible markers: a number of mitochondrial DNA markers, a number haplogroup markers, and a number or cluster of other genes.  While there are some interesting questions that remain unanswered, I found the whole thing a bit overwhelming. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is not a very good book.  It was hard to read.  I got a lot of typos and bad grammar.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a fun read    I enjoyed the way the plot is handled   Â    But the writing was sloppy  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The characters in this novel are not well written, the events not well presented, the world not well explained or even explained very little.   However it doesn't detract from the story at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is just terrible.   After reading a couple of reviews (none positive), I decided to give it a try.  I'm not too good at math, but I'm hoping my parents would be willing to give me this book.  It's so poorly written, I have trouble believing it's a good idea to be in a relationship with a girl.  When it seems that the relationship is going well, she starts to seem like the only good thing about him.  In a way, I don't blame her.  After all, he is the first "alpha male" she has met that wasn't a complete asshole.  But she knows better.  And, unlike men in the past, she is willing to stand up to him....but he can't handle a good argument.  The only reason he is dating her is because he knows she will always do what he tells her to.  Now that's a man I want. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think I can say that I'm going to read some other books by Sallie McFachland to see what the fuss is about.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was more like a series of anecdotes than an actual story about the life of Christ. While I'm sure some people will find this entertaining (the author has a knack for giving us amusing descriptions), it was a tedious read from the get-go. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is very misleading. The story is only "a" story.   Not much else happens other than some people are dead at the end and you are the only person who knows what happened. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading this book, I realized it was written to sell something. It was not a good read.   What does it say about an organization that has a program that involves the hiring of prostitutes?   It's true that many prostitution laws are written in a way that makes it very difficult to be convicted.  There is no way to get around this.  It is a huge burden on a sex worker to be put in the position of knowing the law can get them thrown in jail.  How is it that they were not convicted?  The prostitutes in question were working under the impression that they would be paid.  The author suggests a solution:  "How about we pass a law that everyone is entitled to a reasonable wage while working in a situation like this?  I don't think prostitution should be illegal."   I am no lawyer and don't really know how this would work, but I don' t think it could work.  This is a good book for the author's personal enjoyment, but it is not one you should buy or read for information. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I found out about this book, I really liked it.   The cover was gorgeous and the inside of the book was a collection of stories about people who were in love with the same person and how that ended.  I wasn't a fan of love stories but  I think  it was well done.  Unfortunately, when it came time for me to put the book down,   I didn't really like the characters that much.  They weren't likable or likable for long enough to make me want to read the next one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst thing about this book is that it is so over-the-top. It is also ridiculously long. I wanted to skip all the ridiculousness but I had to finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have now read one other copy of the book.   It's a good idea, but the author has not been very good at writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is sooooooooooo bad it makes me want to go out and buy an   gun  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read about 60 books so far in this series and so far nothing is satisfying.   First we get a woman, a good looking woman, who becomes a woman again. This is a woman who loves to read and is very intelligent and kind. She's a bit of an outcast and gets teased by the boys who are not quite as smart as her. The first book is not as bad as some people have made it out to be but it just isn't as good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just had a really bad day at work, so I was looking forward to this book for a long time.   It is good, but   doesn't stand out in my reading rotation  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a Christian, but my husband and I read the Bible on a regular basis.  We enjoy reading the Bible because we are Christians, but  we feel we have learned so much more about our own faith from the book of Job.  The Bible is filled with wonderful stories that show how God uses good people to help the weak and to help those who are hurting.   However,  it is a terrible book to teach about people who cannot handle the truth of their situation. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have just finished   a   book   byÂ  Robert A. Heinlein  , and I must say that I do notÂ  like   the   way   that   Heinlein has   done   his   " science fiction  ."   My   feelings about Heinlein's " science   fiction "   are not the same as mine, and it is likely that a reviewer who is not soÂ  hostile Â to Heinlein will not feel compelled to put as much space after his title as I do.   But Heinlein, like my mother-in-law, is a reader of sci-fi, and is not ashamed to admit it. Â He is a good man who writes good science fiction.  He has a strong sense of honor and is prepared to defend his integrity.  What a pity that he does not do a better job of defending his integrity in  the way that he defends his science fiction!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got a B+ on this one because it is a well written and enjoyable book but the narration (sounds too much like a "whitenote" to me)   makes it a B.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited to read this book at the end of my run of books about the occult.   Well, my hopes were not fulfilled.  The book tells how the Satanic cults of the world have been infiltrated over time.  But, there's not a single example of any sort of infiltration in this book, in spite of the fact that it was written in the seventies.  In fact, the author says that the Satanists have always infiltrated and taken over.  I really hope that there are more examples in this chapter, because it would be very interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I started reading this book expecting a good fantasy book with plenty of magic, magic and magic.  The author didn't manage to accomplish that.   Instead she just wrote a boring, maddeningly cliched fantasy story.  I really wanted to believe that these three sisters would be the heroines of the story but instead they're all kind of boring, annoying characters in an unrealistic world. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book of terrible, horrible, horrible information. This book was the first I read about "toxic masculinity."   What makes this worse is the fact that this author is actually a girl.   It's a shame because this book was so interesting and entertaining   I recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of errors and a lack of attention to details. It is written as if it is the first person account of the events of a large scale war.   First of all, the author has an awful sense of humor.  He seems to be quoting an old woman when he says "They'd be better off dead."   He also seems to forget that he's talking about an enemy army and his own army.  (I also found it odd that he described the German army as "a small band of misfits.")    (He then proceeds to discuss the British army as being "the finest fighting force in Europe.") 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an excellent book.   While a lot of the "troubles" in life can be solved if we were to go through the whole book in reverse order, there is something special about this book about a boy who doesn't want to go back to the Catholic Church.  It is not about the Church. It is about the boy's relationship with the Church that eventually changes everything. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book back in 1993 when I was in college.   It was a wonderful review and I remember it well because it is one of the few books I read in college that I thought would be worth reading again.  It did not take long before this book stopped being a good read for me.  The book was mostly about women in politics  and the women who ran the Democratic National Committee (DNC).  This is very interesting and interesting, but the writing is terrible.  I was very interested in the DNC, and I was not interested in who was running the Democratic Party when the Clinton presidency was starting to crumble.  This book is not even a book about the history of the Democratic party, but rather one about women who were running the party.  While I had been interested in women in the party for years, this book did not interest me at all.  Â    My only real complaint about this book is that it has such a terrible title:  "The New Women of Politics"  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very dull book.   The book is mostly about the historical relationship between China and Korea.  The relationship has been going downhill for decades.  Korea is now an industrial power but China is still in the stone age with a big coal addiction.  China is so obsessed with coal that they even have coal trains go around China killing the coal farmers and burning the villages that make up most of Korea's economy.  There are many other good ideas here about economics and cultural differences.  But there is nothing interesting about the relationship except some small bits. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The narrator is terrible.  Â As in awful.  In the first chapter, she uses a man's son as a punchline.  What.  No.  That is the worst way to begin a book.  Â  The voice is terrible, and it sounds like she's just sitting there with her tongue out.  I didn't get a lot of the jokes, I didn`t know who they were about, and I can`t get into the story.  It was bad enough that I wanted to put the book down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was not very good.   I liked the book, but the writer really didn't put a lot of thought into this book.  I don't think she is talented enough to be writing a good book (or even a bad one).   Â   I had high expectations from her writing and I really didn'st come through.  It didn't have much to do with the story and it really just didn't work out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't think much of this book at first, but I've finally decided to finish it.  I'll give my initial impressions.  The story, which is told in a very detailed, linear manner, is very interesting.  It is told from a child's perspective, and it really shows the effects that bullying can have on a child.  But,   is the book is a bit too long, it can get a bit boring, especially when you're watching the kid get bullied.   A bit of a slog, in my opinion.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a great book, but at the same time, not an original one   (I mean, it's not like they just stole from a random book.)   I wish they'd use more of their material to make a better book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved the book so much   but it's not the book   it's the author   a very bad writer   and she got her info from other sources   her sources 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited about this book.   It's got a great plot:  There's the bad guy, a powerful wizard with a nasty attitude and a heart of gold, and there's his faithful loyal assistant, a half-drowned mermaid.  I can't say enough good things about it:  The way that the two characters are depicted in this book are both interesting:  Firstly, they are very different:  A powerful wizard is the kind of guy you might want to hang around with, but he's kind of a dick about it.  Secondly, a mermaid is the type of girl who wants to make her man fall in love with her, but instead he's so concerned about her that he's a tad abusive.  Both of them have an element of woe in them, and the way they handle the problems with which they're dealt is something I love:  It also helps that the characters are both fairly interesting:Â   This book is probably not going to make any fans of the Harry Potter series (the two main characters) but if you're a fan of good fantasy books in general, it's definitely worth a read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book after being exposed to it in an introductory psychology class.   While I enjoyed it, the book is so confusing and contradictory that you often find yourself flipping back and forth between the same two subjects. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The last part of the book is about the origin of the word "sloppy".  I don't understand how an author can write that a word came to describe a state of mind, but don't say anything about its origin. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only way that the book got an 8 is because of the "unexpected" ending.   I've been reading a good book lately   but this was just a   complete   disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    An amazing book.   But the worst part is it is one that has had hundreds of reviews written about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So my first book was a terrible book. The characters were not likable at all and there was not enough story to carry it.   This book is not a bad read because the book is over. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really excited to get the book I'd been waiting for and found it to be so disappointing. I'm a huge fan of the Twilight series and was very excited to find a series I didn't have to pay for.   Sadly, the series was not a waste of time, but I have very little faith in this author's abilities. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about a man with a bad job and a wife who is trying to feed him.   When the man got laid off he was at home with his wife cooking food and his kids.  They were happy but he felt down.  The day came he was able to find a job.  It was a lot harder than he thought. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a hard thing to review.   I felt that the author took all the good things about Harry Potter   and took them and ran with them.  For a book called   The Best of Harry Potter, the author takes Harry as an arrogant brat and gives him a new character,   Draco Malfoy, who was not as likable as Harry.  Even after reading a lot of fanfics and novels on Harry Potter and the rest of the JK universe, I am still not quite over this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very poorly written.   I don't know if I'd buy it again because of that, but the cover is great  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   ...  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this to read on my tablet but it's terrible.   The writing is so bad that I can't do much but give it a poor review.  I have to make it clear that it's the worst book I've read in a long time because of the horrendous writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is terrible.   This is not a good book to read if you want to learn about the subject.  It takes a long time to get the "big picture" but does not explain that well and is confusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm really not sure I'll be buying more books from Lulu again.   The writing is atrocious and there are just so many spelling mistakes, bad references and poor connections that it takes me out of the story,   like a bad joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't really get into this one.  I've been reading a lot of dystopian novels lately and I've got a bit bored.  The ending just seems too contrived.  A bit of foreshadowing might have been nice to see.  Overall, I don  Â dislike the author's writing style.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book I did not like.   It took me a very long time to find out that the book wasn't true.  It is also a book with a big influence on other authors.  I also found it very hard to put down,    the story is fantastic but the writing was so off  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is absolutely dreadful.   I don't think I can go out with a book with this much of a negative rating for a book that's only 5 days away from its release date.  It's terrible   It is just dreadful   What kind of stupid shit is this   " It's awful   If you don't want a story about a black guy who has super strength and has a wife who's not even from there, then you probably shouldn't read this book  "   Just when I thought it was going to be a good book.  I really didn't get what this book was about.  There was nothing about the story or the characters or even the point of the book.   Â  I was kind of hoping this book would be something like a graphic novel or something.  Â    Not sure if that was even a thing at the time or not.  Is there still a graphic novels section in Barnes & Noble   Maybe   They should just put everything in a giant box 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was a disappointment.  It's based on a true story (and not a very good one!) but there's absolutely no romance in the book.   I think a couple of things that contributed to the lack of the romance (1) The author describes the marriage and family as the biggest pain in the life of the main character; and (2) The wife had never had to give up her career as an office manager and had a nice house that she shared with her husband. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm in love with this book and it has been recommended many times.   The thing is that the author was a major player in the development of the genre and I love it and it is a great read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sorry but i don't think the book is good for teens or women. It's more like a young adult story in a bookshop where the girl who can't make up her mind has to choose between two books about the same subject: A boy and a girl who fall in love.    The story is mostly about the boy and the girl and their feelings and experiences - nothing much in the middle about the girl or her experience or how she felt about the book in which she doesn't make her choice - i.e. the girl has a very hard time deciding but the boy really can't  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not excited to read this book and found it to be a very boring read. I don't feel the author has any insight to the subject matter at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was in college when I read this book, I'm sorry to say but I was still a little too young to appreciate what a good read it is, and even now I'm surprised that it's been out of print for decades  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main reason that this book is terrible is that it's so full of bad ideas.   Â  It's hard to believe that a book titled "Wisdom for Real Life" can be that bad.  At one point a young boy who has been drinking is trying to get the police to leave him alone.  After telling a police officer that he knows that he'll get drunk again and have another accident, he tells the officer that the officer has no authority to make arrests in such circumstances.  He tells him to call the police department and ask to be arrested.  It's almost as if he is saying that you should be the one to call, not the cops.  What a bunch of asshats!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm on my fifth reading of this book and it's just the same old thing.   It is a great story and the description is spot on,   but I don't understand what is wrong with her writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My husband and I had a wonderful time reading this book.   The plot was pretty cool.  It was also interesting to read the descriptions of the animals and plants used by the villagers.  But I think the author got a lot of things wrong.  We had some chickens living in our barn and my husband and his wife went and bought a whole bunch of them.  After they'd been in the barn a few months the chickens started to eat the dirt and mud off the barn floor.  My wife wanted to go over and grab some of those dirt and dirt-eating chickens to use as fertilizer, but the thought of bringing them all into the house scared her off.  Later on she did get some chickens to eat some of the dirt but the chickens were only eating the dirt.  She was also worried about them turning on her because of how much dirt they were eating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book on the plane to Hawaii. I can't stand planes (I have flown about 100 of them) but I had to give this one a chance. I am an avid reader of nonfiction. If you like this type of book, check it out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title is a lie. I read it in one sitting and I was bored by the end.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I can't believe I waited this long to read this book, I was actually looking forward to reading this book as a lot of it was actually what I was looking for in an adventure story.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The premise is brilliant, the execution is terrible and the main character is the worst.   One day, a young man is talking to a girl who seems totally oblivious to the fact that she is talking about a guy named   ( I assume that he has been dead for 30 years ) when she begins to blurt out his name.  He says he used to be a cop.  When she says "Who's a cop?" he says  "You know him?" she says   "Yeah.  And what kind of cop is he?"   So he says that he is in the police force and he was in a car accident and   fell into a coma and didn't wake up.  I thought that would be the ending, but it wasnt. He is still in a coma.  His name is "Icarus".  Then he is given a gun by  the same girl he was talking to and his new name is Icarus. Icarus is a good guy. He believes in the system. He has been trained for this and he doesn't get into any trouble.  What is the point in having a system if its so easy to overthrow?  In the book, the main villain is  Â a corrupt official who is trying to keep the system in place.  So the main story arc is Icarius. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a book I'd recommend to anybody, if you have an inkling that the author is writing for the "popular" public.   She gets everything wrong, and most of the book is an explanation of why she got it wrong.  She knows nothing about history, sociology, philosophy, or literature.  Â  She uses what she knows about these subjects to try to fit her theories to a story she has never read.  It is a shame.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I finished this book I felt like I had been cheated.   The characters in this book were completely unbelievable,   and their stories were unbelievable.  Â    It took me to a place I hadn't been before,  and I really wanted to believe the world was different because it was different.  And the world is a very interesting place. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot is very cliche and unrealistic but the author is good at showing the problems   It seems that the author loves to tell a story of someone with special talents and not being recognized   I really want this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sure I'm not alone here with reading this book and finding it boring, dull and very disappointing   There is just not a whole lot of anything that the writer is trying to say    This book should have been in a library somewhere instead of a library where the book is not well-loved   Â  It should have stayed in the archives  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really excited for this book, but then I saw this review about the book: "The book's style is so clunky. It's hard to follow what's going on."   What?   To which I reply:  "What about the story?"   Yes, it's hard reading, but I can't help it.   The writing is very amateurish, and the narrative is not well-done at all, so if you are looking for a good book about the first few decades of the cold war, I can not recommend this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is nothing about this book that is fun. It takes a great idea, and it is used so poorly, that the author ends up sounding like an old man talking to a bunch of kids about how the world is falling apart. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book starts out with a good beginning:  Â    This book is a good read, but it's very easy to put down.   Â  This is a typical book about the dark side of humanity. Â  It's filled with people trying to be better humans while being unable to be.  Â  It's a sad book and a sad world, but the sad part is not so much the badness of the world as much as it is that it's a world of so many sad people, many with the potential to be much better, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is so slow that the first chapter is completely pointless.   I get this book when I am in the hospital with a bad case of pneumonia but I'm too lazy to bother with the slow pacing.  I also have trouble with characters. Â I want to hate them, but they're so uninteresting that I just want to kill them off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a good book, but I don't love the book.   I think it is very simplistic and that is not my taste for novels. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sorry that i did not give this book 5 stars but it was simply not worth my time.   There were a lot of errors in my book and in my understanding of the material.  This was one of the best books on a particular area of computer science that i read in years but the main problem was that i never was able to follow it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is just as bad as it sounds. It has nothing to do with anything that was said in the book.    There is no information about why a character doesn't tell a friend about his death. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have never had a good experience with any book written by a woman.    There is a lot of unnecessary fluff, and it never ends. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a bad experience for me.  I really didn't expect to like this, but the first book I read really impressed me, and this book just didn't impress me at all.  The main character is described as very intelligent, and the characters in the story are described as intelligent, too, but that's about all they are, the main character and a couple of friends seem to be very stupid.  But my main problem with the book is that the main characters are very annoying.  It's not like the main narrator is a horrible person, but if there is ever a good time to try to teach an idiot a lesson, it's not this.  There are only so many times that you can tell that a person's brain doesn't work well because they can't write a coherent paragraph or don't understand simple concepts. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Â    This book was very difficult to read. It is written in a first-person perspective (one that is highly subjective) in an effort to portray a group of people as they really are (if I remember correctly).   I believe there are other books written by this author, but this is the first one I have read.   It's very difficult for me to relate to anyone in the book because they all seem like a caricature of some person I have known or seen in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was surprised by this book.   The book is written with a sense of humor, but it seems a lot of it is written in a very   formal   manner.  The only time I felt I was having a good time was when the two main characters got drunk together and then made out.  But that was the only time.  All the other things we see or hear are so over the top that it doesn't feel real. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had a lot of fun with this book   It is a great read   Very good characters   Lots of humor
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a sucker for horror fiction and this book was a bit too derivative, although I was looking forward to the ending. I wish I could recommend this book, but I can't. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is NOT the book I hoped to get when I bought it.   It's more like a book that is NOT worth the price it costs  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had this book about a year ago and was very disappointed. First of all, there was a lot of typos and missing words and grammatical errors. I read the whole thing in two days and was too tired to go back to it and make changes.    Second, I was never really interested in the story.  It seemed to go from one thing to another in a way that was totally unnecessary.  The hero was an average guy who always did the right thing and was always good for the people around him and had a good heart.  But the story was never about him.  Third, the main character was so stereotypical I couldn't tell what he was supposed to be doing in the book.  First he was a rich, good looking boy who always got the girl and did all the good deeds.  Then he became a geek, wore a fedora all the time, was not very good at his job and was generally annoying to everyone.  Finally he became the hero and had to get up every morning and do the right things and save everyone. Is this really the person you want to be?  The only thing I liked about the character was he was really strong mentally because he was the only one who was actually fighting the darkness.  I have a hard time believing that a person like that was who a good Christian hero was supposed be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't really expect to love this one.  I thought the first book was amazing!   This book is about two women who fall for a boy, who is a little jerk, and who are in a long term relationship with him.   When the book ends, I felt like something had been lost in translation.  He is a complete dick and will not listen to reason, and he's going to come into our house one night to sleep with our daughter.  After I finished the book,  I felt a little bit  cheated.  A bit disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I loved the book and loved to read it.   It is hard to put down after reading it. However   the author should not have had a child as a character.  I understand that the author wanted to create a likable character but   instead of making the character likable   you just make it an annoying stereotype. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sorry, but I have to give this a negative.   The thing is that the main character had a serious heart disease, but his doctor could not find a cure for it.  This is just too common for a person with a medical problem to have to live with. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited to read the book, but the writing was awful.   A lot of the descriptions were made up.  The book is all about a couple who had their house destroyed in a fire.  They spent days repairing it and now have to spend the next several months rebuilding their lives.  I am not a fan of this type of book.  It just doesn't do what I need it to. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   . This book is a waste of time.   It has the same "what would you like to do if you had the power to   do anything   "  ."   Â    This is supposed to be a romance and it is not a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a very good book.   It starts off well, but does not work well enough to keep the reader engaged.  And the ending is unsatisfying.  But I still recommend it because it's a good read if you need a good laugh
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As much as I enjoy reading the occasional novel by the author of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, I was very disappointed in this one. It is hard to find a good historical fiction with characters like the ones in this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is interesting, but the ending is a major letdown.   I love this book but I'm just not going to buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a waste of time and money.   When it comes to the 'what' of God, he does not give us any answers.  The only thing that happens in the book is that it tells us how God loves us and hates our sins.  It is as if this is something we already know but he wants us to know it because he wants the world to know how good God is.  I found that most of the 'answers' in this book were answers for other problems that I had (including trying to reconcile a belief in evolution with the Bible).  This is also a book that tells us that "there is something wrong with us and something right about us."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What a train wreck 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found the concept interesting. But, as a story, it didn't really work.  Â For example, I wanted to believe that there was a good reason why they had a house full of cats.  But the author, who is writing from the point of view of the husband, didn't seem to feel the same way.  (I feel like there was so much I could have gleaned from her point of views about other couples--but I don't think it would have made her story more true or interesting.)   There was also a couple that had a baby at the same time as her.  The baby died and she became a widow.  That was not an easy way to lose a child.  I didn't find it a big deal. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book made me hate my own self, it was so wrong.   I was not an alcoholic at all but I drank too much, and then I found out about this book,   the problem I had was that I had been drinking at this restaurant before (I am not a very religious person) and   so I knew   that I couldn't order   food because I had to have   something to wash it down with.  The first problem was that the book said   when I ordered it to get my order,  that is so wrong,  because it was my waitress that brought   me my order when she told me that   her manager had told her   to do so.  Then,  it told me   in a small handwriting,  but I do not remember what it said.  And then,  I never did get my food,  my stomach was so full and sick and my body was tired,  then, after   eating the whole thing,  i  threw the food down on the floor   because i was so upset and i knew  that my waitress had ruined my dinner   (I think i should go to church every Sunday to try and fix this situation)   But even more so, i could not believe   this book was telling me  that i was stupid and i am bad   And that is what this book said to me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While this book was a bit frustrating in that it did not make a lot of sense, it was still a very entertaining read. I was very amused by the fact that some of the animals in the book are named after "Hobo" films, so I thought it might make a good read for people who loved "Homoerotic as fuck movies".  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The idea that someone would create an RPG where the characters are all gay/lesbians and no one has any sense of self worth?   I'm disappointed   In the real world   "I know you're gay and you have a boyfriend, but why would you want to come over and try and fix your girlfriend's flat tire?"  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not a great book and I wish I could give it less than one star because its main purpose is to be a "how to teach a guy who never learned to play guitar" book.    If you already have a guitar then you might find this useful. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm very disappointed    In the first two or three chapters I thought this was going to be the classic thriller  . I thought the writing was so good   but it was a bit too convenient   It was too convenient for a good thriller 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really loved this book.   The best thing about it is that it is written by an author who has studied Chinese and has traveled to China   for the past 20 years.  She has a strong knowledge about China and a good vocabulary to keep a reader interested in the historical aspects of Chinese culture, especially those related to Chinese language, and the political problems that have been going on in China for the last 60 or 70 years  .  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a child, I saw a television movie about the life of a little girl who was kidnapped and sold to a pedophile ring run by a very religious, very moral-minded mother. It made no sense to me (I was born into the wrong era)   This book is a lot like that movie, except the girl is not in captivity, she's on her own.   (hide spoiler)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is absolutely useless.  It is only useful for a brief introduction to the history of the world's most notorious terrorist.   Unfortunately, there is nothing about him in his own words.  He makes a few vague claims, mostly about his activities as a youth, but not enough for me to have an impression of him as a person.  As far as I know, Bin Laden's father was a wealthy oil merchant who came to Afghanistan in the 1950s and was involved in a few attempts to create a Persian Gulf based Islamic state.  I think the story is that Bin Laden went back in the 1970s when his father's business went bankrupt to try to help him.  What is interesting is that there is mention of him being influenced by the teachings of Mullah Omar, Mullah Muhammad Omar.  This seems to be some kind of a secret Islamic group.  One wonders what is so special about Mullah Osama that he is worth the time of a CIA agent to be used as a political hostage.  How could a government have such a good idea about what makes a good terrorist?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is no book better than This book.   It is a good "how to" book for those who are learning how to use a digital camera.   The author is very friendly and informative   it was so easy to learn  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have seen several other reviews on this book which is pretty hard to believe. I do not know how these reviewers can be so harsh. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this book, there just is nothing wrong about this book. I would say a couple of other things about the book but I am afraid my brain wont be able to handle it.   First, I believe this book is a very personal memoir.  The author mentions that he is from a very poor family.  He does not like to read about things that happen in the past.  It does not fit his personality.  Second, the author was very angry with a previous professor and was told that he did not have his "spare time."   That is how I would describe my own experience in school.  I was always told I "had time for it" when it came to studying or work.  If I had to give an example of this, I may have to give it the old college trick of calling it my "spur" which means "sparing time" and "wasted."  It makes it sound like a good idea until you get in a jam.  What does a person do when time is a scarce resource.  Third, he mentions that during his time in the military, he was sent on a mission to bomb a pharmaceutical company in Iraq.  When I think about it, it seems that my life is a lot like that mission.  My first year of college I went to an Ivy League college and was lucky enough to get a great job in the government.  After one year I did something stupid.  Like all young women at the time, I went on a date with a friend.  This friend was not from my class so I figured I could just go out for drinks with her and she would come over.  She was right and did.  Now, this is a pretty common occurrence when I was in college.  No girl who is a good friend should think that this will be a good thing or that a night of drinking and partying is going to make her want to stay over. So she tells me that she doesn't want to be friends with me anymore because we are "different."  I never thought this would happen because we never met face to face.  So my life was about to change, fast.  Fourth, and most important, the book states that a book can be a life-changing experience but
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading this I was expecting a lot more out of it, more depth and characterisation and I didn't get any of that. In fact, I wasn't interested at all in the "real" events, it seemed like I was reading a history of a clan rather than a real biography. The writing was great, it's very dry and it's a fast read (around 150 pages). I'll probably buy the next book in this series, but this wasn't a good start.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book after having read a few previous reviews that said the book was a terrible one and I decided not to spend the money   Unfortunately, I'm here to tell you that I think this is a good book    Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't like this book at all.   If you don't know what I'm talking about:  - it's a fantasy novel with a fantasy world - I think the magic system is a bit silly - it seems there's a lot of magic in the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As with many books by writers like Stross, I found this to be an uninteresting story with a lot of interesting ideas but little to no development.   It is very obvious that Stross was influenced by other Sci-fi writers but he didn't get the most out of them; as a result, it is hard to understand what is so good about the ideas but very few of them are really effective. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a really bad book.   I never would have listened to a book by this author had I not known it was bad.  The book is basically about a man named William.  He meets a girl named Jane.  She is a beautiful woman and very intelligent.  William gets interested in Jane because he knows that she can heal other people and that is why he is here.  Jane knows this and wants William to heal other children and animals  But then she has a horrible accident and William's love for her goes out the window.  His love for Jane is only a facade.  But a real man needs a good wife and she has one with William.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to a good book.   A must read book that will teach me a thing or two about this crazy hobby. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to admit, this was a really fun and entertaining book. There are some parts that are a bit slow to get going, but when they do, the plot is really fast-paced.   However, when the action picks up, it gets really exciting. I don't think the main character can read very well, so when things happen that make her seem stupid, or not like she should be a fighter, I think that is a mistake. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm very disappointed with this book.   The premise is interesting:  1) you're born and raised in a religious cult (I've been doing that for years) 2) the cult converts you 3) it seems like the cult has something to do with being "the world's largest cult" 4) after getting out of the cult you lose the ability to be "self-aware" (forget self-confidence) 5) so in order to be self-aware you're forced to be a member of the new cult.  Unfortunately, the author doesn't tell us that this new cult isn't very good, doesn't have a whole lot of the things the old one did, has more "rules" and does a whole bunch of weird stuff besides that.  I don't think the author really explains why or what it is about, but at least that part is interesting.  While I don;t want to believe that there is a whole new religion out there, but if the author has any good reason for this cult, then it isn't a very good one.  One thing I noticed while reading was that one of the "rules is to never lie" - is it really necessary to know that if you can lie all the time then that isn't lying?  Another problem I found was that the author seems to make a distinction between the "cult" that converts you and the "new cult".  While the "old cult" is pretty bad and should just be ignored, the new one is supposed to be better, so why do they seem to be worse?  And there's more, but that's a lot of detail.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most interesting thing about this book is that it was written by a high school girl about the horrors of high school.   It sounds crazy but her description of the high school culture and how it really works is spot on.  She has a lot of good things to say about how the students are treated, the teacher, and their parents.  I wouldn't mind it if this were the only book I ever read about high school but it definitely isn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A couple times a month I read the back cover copy.   This was a great read, but I can't imagine a story with that much violence going on.  It's a good read, and a pretty good read for me, but not a great one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book 4 stars because it was fun to read and the illustrations were pretty.   If you love the old cartoons, you will love this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book! However, in order for the stories to make any sense at all, the authors needs to take a few more chances.  Â First, why did the protagonist decide to stay in school?   There were two points in this book that made me think this was a mistake, and one of them was the same moment the antagonist decided to leave.  I mean, the guy is supposed to be the bad guy.  Is it just because he's smart?  I also think the antagonist, as opposed to being good or bad, is a "bad person."  Is he really just an asshole?  How can you see this is a bad decision because  he "has a conscience?"   So, I guess I'm in the minority here, but I think that when the hero makes the ultimate choice, they don't just choose the "right" answer, they choose the one that will make them feel the least bad about themselves. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While I do like my books, this one wasn't as good as I hoped. The writing is good but the plot is weak. It's very sad when the girl who is in love with your protagonist is killed off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very happy with the book I received, but not so happy with my experience, in that I waited two years after reading the book to receive it.   The first few chapters of the book sounded familiar and interesting, but then it became repetitive and boring.  I read another book about the Vietnam War, called, "Barefoot in the Park".   This book made me want to watch a whole Vietnam war series about the war, instead of just one war series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a good book to read.  It's about a woman that lives in a small town who is being chased by her ex-boyfriend.   The book has a good ending, but it is too late for her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The bad: Â In a word:  There is a lot wrong about this book.   To begin with,  The author is not even writing a story about the same person.  In a story told from the viewpoint of the woman,   the story is told from a point of view different from her own.  It's a point-of-view story.  The only thing the story makes sense of is the person the story describes.  Why would the author write a story written by another person?   What happened to the protagonist?  What was her life like in a time when there were only "misfits" and "sisters" in a world where there were few "sirs"?   Was the author just telling a story that did not fit her personal history?  If the book is about a "girl,"   her life is a long, hard slog of suffering.  There has to be a much deeper story here.  And the author is so bad at showing what her character's life is like   that you really need the person's perspective for a good story. Â    That said,  I enjoyed the story of the "lone wolf."   It had more character depth than many of the other stories she writes.  I like the fact that she is an immigrant. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The ending of the book was so anticlimactic, I thought the book itself was pointless.   This book is just a series of character studies:  Some of the other books I've read involve the life of characters who had been victims of violence.  They are almost always people who can be controlled or destroyed by a stronger force.  The people in the book (who have been in a loving relationship for most of their life) are always able to "surpass" it.  Even in the end, when all seems lost (that is, the character is broken to a point where he is a burden on his family) the character does not overcome it. When the characters are broken, they usually regain some of their lost power. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's so terrible and poorly written.   There is no sense at all for the characters and no motivation.  And the sex!   So   boring.  It had been a while since I have read a "bad" book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this as a gift for my son after watching some TV commercials about the use of marijuana in school.   The main benefit I have seen is in the ability to focus.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think this book is one of the more terrible books I've read in a long time.   What a terrible book: there are so many problems with it:  -the author doesn't bother to explain why he uses words like 'tantalizing' or 'troubling'   -everybody is a racist   It's not that he's racist but just that he thinks that racism is only used to make a point   There is no point in mentioning it at all -the book has almost nothing to do with race 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading this book I think I'm going to go buy another one. It's a complete waste of time to write a bad review about it. I hope this isn't the case with future books: I know a LOT of writers have had it in them to write about women's issues. If they ever do write a book about women I bet it will be well written, and even if it is, it probably won't have the same effect as this one did.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this book several times, and the latest one was even better!   This is a wonderful book about people who do things out of kindness.   It's a funny book, and I'm amazed at how many good things people can accomplish without any special talent or talent at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not a fan of this book.   It's basically a one-sided, biased biography, and all of the facts don't seem to add up.  In addition, there are some glaring inaccuracies about the author's own work.  They make the author seem like a pompous ass.  I am always reluctant to trust biographies written by other people about themselves, and this one wasn't any different. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is nothing interesting about this book   The story is too contrived   Too much self-congratulation   I'm not sure if it's supposed to be "the first" but   it's not the best  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first part of the book has a lot of promise. It opens with a fascinating discussion about the history of the Catholic Church's treatment of women. It is so interesting and informative, that I can't help but feel the book is missing something important. When I think of the way the Church has treated its female members, it always brings to mind this famous quote:  "A woman who believes in a lie has already swallowed it". Well, that's exactly what the Church did with its treatment of the woman. The story is interesting, but the real purpose is not.   "The idea of a man who is not married should not enter the mind of a woman. He must be a widower, a widowers father or a widows uncle. He is not to be permitted in any way to enter a woman's heart and affections."   (pg. 18)   This idea, that there should be no possibility for the husband to ever get involved with the woman, is so obvious. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an absolute disaster, so many things wrong about it    The author never really gives the reader a real sense of the setting, and this isn't a huge problem since there's so little world building.   He gets rid of the most important character (a guy with a horse for a head) after the third chapter and keeps on giving her a lot of backstory.  There's no explanation as to what she's doing in the middle of the forest at the beginning.  A character dies in a plot twist that comes from nowhere   And while the book has a lot to do with animals (the last chapters seem to focus on a hippo), no one is ever asked why the animals are being targeted in the first place  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I started this book with high hopes.    The first sentence was promising, "In the first of the trilogy, she travels to the North to meet the dragon."   This is a good start.  But this is not the story I was looking for.  Instead, we find out that this is an alternate timeline for the Dragonball Z series.  If I had read that instead of the first chapter, I would have understood that there was a whole world outside the timeline that had not been seen yet.  It doesn't seem to have occurred to me until the book was already almost finished.  So, not only did I not like the premise and writing style, but I was bored while I was reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because I was told it was the first book of its type. I don't know why a first book is necessary. It is a fairly basic book.   I thought this book was good, but not great, but if I have to give it two stars, I'll give it three. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book expecting a fun read, and it is pretty fun to read.  The plot is pretty bad and I'm surprised the author didn't make it even better by giving us a good main character who is more of a supporting character for the main plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I have ever read.   It starts with a bad introduction,   and   The narrator is very bad at acting in a scene,  and then,  even  the setting has nothing to do with anything in the book.  (This is an example of the worst writing I've ever read).   I never had a chance to finish the book,  because   it seemed like it was so hard to get through,  that   once I was finished   there was nothing else that was needed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a flawed book, but is so much better than its reputation suggests.   The main problem is that, unlike a good fiction novel, this isn't very interesting, and is more or less a summary of the current thinking on the subject.  It is like if someone got together a bunch of scientists and economists, had them read a bunch more books, and had them talk about their findings. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book before I was ready to put it down. It's just soooooo bad.   As soon as I read the title of this book (after all these years), I thought the title was "the secret to a long and happy marriage".   A woman who is "just" an accountant is just a good woman who doesn't know how to be "real" about life, or about relationships or anything.  This book is so full of false assumptions, and I can't believe this woman is still married to the man who she claims is the one who is just "normal".  I'll never understand why a woman is attracted to a person who is completely normal. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â I have purchased several of the books by the author of this book,   I have purchased a book by this author,  but this  book   Â  did not do   the job   that   book.   It   wasn't a bad read,  it   did   get me   hooked,  I   enjoyed   it for   a few minutes, but   by the end of the book, my head is pounding and I was having a hard time   to focus on my own   thoughts. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is crap.   I can't say how many times I've wanted to just give up after the 3rd chapter.  The narrator is annoying and boring.  I get that he doesn't have a background in biology, but that does not excuse his awful, boring, unprofessional writing.  My wife says the only person that does a good job in this book is the narrator.  So I can tell there are some very good people at work here.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I went to the library and the man who I think was the librarian picked a book about a young girl who had had a traumatic experience in the womb, and he explained that her life has taken on a completely different direction, and that he doesn't know what will happen to her.   He said the story was very powerful and beautiful, but I did not want to read it, and I didn't get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't have much of a problem with a book that is not very good.    It does not feel like it is worth my time or my money to waste my time reading this.  It is a waste of time and money to read a bad science fiction book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very excited to get my hands on this book when I heard about it   but   when I finished   it was just a waste of time  ... i was expecting more from the author but  the story was so lame...  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sorry I didn't give this book a chance before it was out on the shelves. It is full of inaccuracies and errors.   Most of the errors are either in the beginning of the book, or come out in the middle.  As a former professor, I was shocked at some of the statements.  It is easy to look up information on your own.  This information should have been shared by the publishers at some point, not by a new book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is set in a fictional world which does not make any sense. The first few chapters make the reader wonder about why in the world that this world existed and why there are elves and dwarves in the first place. It does not help that the characters are just not believable and the author does nothing to flesh them out.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a big fan of a certain sort of books, books where the author takes you to some exotic place where they "tell you about it". I have no idea why this one wasn't chosen to become the next book of the series, but it's too bad because I've been waiting to read it.   It is a hard book to get through, with no clear ending. The plot is convoluted and hard to follow. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While this is a good book, I was disappointed in the ending.   The last third of the book I was waiting for a resolution to the problem with the father's body, but never got one.  It's like there was always going to be a happy ending, and when I got it there was nothing there. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased this book after reading all the reviews in print and on-line. It was interesting, but not interesting enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. It is true that the history of Christianity is often controversial (as any good textbook should be), but in this book the authors seem to forget that. This book was nothing but a series of negative comments about Jesus and his disciples.   This book is very popular in the Baptist/Protestant world. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read a few of his short stories and enjoyed them, but this story "The Oldest" is just the opposite - not enjoyable and almost unreadable.   So I bought it expecting it to be bad but was very disappointed by the content. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not a huge book-reader, but I do read a lot of non-fiction.   It has a lot to offer, even if its writing can get a little dull after a while. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The plot starts off promising, but the plot gets out of control quickly.   It is also boring and stupid at points. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't like this book because it was not as good as some of the previous novels I've read in the series.  It was a quick read, with the author trying to make a quick buck off the success of the first book.  I enjoyed the first two books but I thought I would enjoy a slightly longer novel.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was looking forward to reading this book, but it was way more disappointing than I had hoped.   It's a very different approach to fantasy, but that's not a bad thing.  Instead of having the hero travel the world, he is on an ill-planned trip to visit a group of people who are obsessed with the old fantasy books he used to read as a child.  It seems to follow the same old cliches that come with fantasy books: a group trying to save their land, people living in a fantasy world that doesn't exist. It seems that the authors wanted to set up a fantasy kingdom where they were all born as royalty, but the details were all wrong.  They tried to write a new mythology, but then they couldn't write a good story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the first 20 pages or so, there's a good bit of exposition about a historical situation that happened around 1800 (although it's so bad that the book was probably written at least 100 years before that time).  The real problem comes when we get to the part about "The Curse of the Jade Pendant", which is a big, dumb historical hoax.   (I'm going to keep the author's name anonymous here to protect a young woman who is going through what he's going through.  For anyone who's been through the experience,   You may remember the "Jade Pendant" from the original Dungeons and Dragons campaign.  It's pretty much the same thing.)  Â    The author gets a bunch of his sources wrong, and makes a bunch more (I haven't been able to find them), and then the rest of the book takes a few steps backwards from there.  Â  We get a description of the real-life story behind the hoax, and I thought the details made the whole thing plausible:  This is the story of a 16th century Portuguese king named JoÃ£o V. He had a powerful and powerful wife named Anna dos Santos de Almeida. Â She had many children, and their names all sounded like "JADE".  She was a very wealthy woman.  She had lots of servants, especially a certain young servant namedÂ    Jules de Pareira.  This young man was known as a very clever but also very violent man.  As you probably know, the king and queen were a very powerful couple, and there were people who looked out for them.  He was the king's steward, so he often had the royal jewels and other valuable objects placed on a stone that he called a " Jade Pender ".  (Jade means the same as the word for "beautiful" in Portuguese).   This stone was not to be touched at all, and anyone who touched it (even a relative) was liable to die an early death.  They also placed a pendant that said "J-O-A-U-D-A" on the stone.  At first, the man in question was very angry at the king, and wanted to challenge his wife to a duel to get her back.  But a storm came in and took care of that problem.  The king did not want the stone removed from his palace.  Then a
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really want to like this book because of all the great stuff about the people and the place. However, the ending is pretty much a waste of a fantastic book.   While it was kind of nice to see something from an old travelogue, the book itself is a big disappointment to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The problem is that it's not bad at all. I'm just not a reader who likes to be wowed.   But a lot of great books have those. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I liked this book, but as an academic, I found a number of problems that make it unwieldy to use.    One of the authors' ideas about "the role of a single point of view in a history" is problematic.  It is well known that the Roman Empire was a "parallel Empire" or something similar.  A parallel Empire was useful because it allowed one civilization to develop and spread into other civilizations.  (For instance, the Greeks invaded Italy and spread to the Levant, and the Romans had a similar phenomenon in the East.)  (The Chinese have a "long historical record" but they never conquered other civilizations in that area.  )  (On the other hand, a single civilization can have the opposite effect:  they can simply create another parallel Empire, such as China, and spread in that direction.)   Â    A lot of this is tied to the idea of historical perspective,   but when it comes to a parallel Empire a single "point of view" is not always possible.  The second problem, I think, is a classic one:  "What the reader needs to know is the details, not just the big picture."   This is a little like a teacher telling a student he needs to read about the history of his particular school district and then trying to tell the student not to read any of the books about the school district.  That is exactly what is happening here.  I am all for a good history book that gives the reader a good understanding of a particular historical period.  However, the authors of this book have a problem:  (1) They provide a great deal of information about an event but then completely ignore its impact on later events.  They do this in two ways.  First, they simply make an arbitrary point about the impact of the Great Fire of London and ignore the fact that this happened in the midst of a massive financial crisis (one of the major reasons the Great fire happened).  Second, they focus on the Great Financial Crisis and ignore its immediate aftermath.  This would also happen if the author focused on an event in the late 18th century and ignored the Great Napoleonic War, which affected many areas.  Â  However, as I am writing this I am thinking about how the authors should have addressed all of these issues:  First of all, they could have made the Great Great Fire seem like a much more significant event than it
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed this story, but I'm not sure if I will continue with the series.   For the first half, it was easy enough to keep up, and then I found I needed to read a good bit more and I found out why I was getting so much enjoyment out of the first few chapters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an absolute fail.    The author is clearly trying to appeal to the low brow, shallow, shallow audience that has been paying to read this crap for years.  But she fails so many times in the first half of the book that I can't believe she even bothered.  I understand that sometimes you need to do something new to grab the attention of a certain audience, but this book is the definition of the word.  The "plot" is nothing more than a convoluted plot to get into the top 10 of the NYT Bestseller List by a certain author and to promote her book to a certain demographic.  It is a complete and utter failure.  Â    She has never written a book that has done anything new in the publishing world, and I will not support her because of that.  This is not a review for the book, but an opinion about the author's writing, and the way she tries to attract people.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book because I wanted a quick way to practice pronouncing various letters.   It is not good at pronouncing any of them (except Q-A, which I like a lot).    One is glad that a book on pronouncing consonants and vowels is free; another is that it is free and not paid for by the government. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The only problem with this book is that it has a horrible plot.   It revolves around an alien who has been studying humans.  In order to do this, the alien has to convince the humans to do the same thing for him.  He has a special language in which he learns about us, our society, and our culture, and in order to use this to communicate with us, he has to take us on a trip into the future.  But it ends up not being really worth the trouble.  One of the main reasons he needs our help is because the aliens are trying to prevent the Earth from destroying itself and going extinct.  Because the Earth is our home.  The aliens are on a suicide mission.  So the humans are doing the Earth a favor, and the aliens can get the humans off the hook by killing millions of humans so they can live forever in the stars.  This book is so bad that even the bad aliens just sort of go off on tangents and do nothing with the humans. It makes no sense.  And the alien doesn't do any real bad things to the humans, like turn them into zombies or make them go crazy or whatever.  It's just that when they come back home, they just leave without telling the humans anything about what they're going to do.  I think it would have been better if the aliens just had a little more time on Earth before coming back to get the Earth back in line. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just finished this and can't believe that this book is being given a rave review.   This book was really not even good.  From start to finish I was not sure what the author was trying to do with it, and the ending is just lame. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not sure if I was going to like this book at first.   The writing style seems very simple and doesn't require a lot of explanation or research.  This is a basic story of a father raising his son to be a killer in a futuristic society.  I know it is a young man's book but it could have been written by a young adult.  The characters are very stereotypical of their generation, they are all the typical teenager who is "different" because he doesn't fit in at school, and he is "cool" because his dad is cool.  All that being said, I liked this book. Â It is not great but it is fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It would have been better if I had read this book in high school instead of college.   I'm not sure why I bothered to read this if I already knew what was going to happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found that many of the authors who published the "historical" works that cover the war in Iraq were involved in the earlier one.   They all have a lot in common.  They are all very good at rewriting history so as to show the Bush administration as the good guys.  The first book  ( by James Ridgway)  was a clear example of that.  He used a quote from someone who had a good reason to say it, but not the original speaker.  Another of his books ( by Charles J. Bagli and George J. Cook) is so bad.  When I read it, I thought he got the date of the event wrong.  I read a very similar book about the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Bagli, on the other hand, is good at using quotes out of context to prove the other side's position. I gave it 4 stars, but if I had been asked to review it, 4 out of 5 stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing is very bad, the main character,   Is a really good character, in the beginning   is a bad character, and is just the worst character   in   a book   all the other bad characters in the book are really bad characters   and in the end he gets   the best ending   of a bad ending 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author, a man, says he will not teach science, but he has to teach kids all his life.   He is a terrible scientist,   but he can't explain why the Earth has no life.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really do love this book. It's a really good story, really well-done and I think the author gets the tone of the story and the characters right  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It wasn't that bad, but I couldn't give it 3 stars because it was just a little too long, I didn't understand any of the characters.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book has lots of good stories about being a teenager. However, there are a couple stories in there that are pretty boring.   "My Life: Part Three"   In "My Life Part Three," I had to turn the page to find out what happened between him and his ex-girlfriend.  I found out that he was cheating on her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My father used to love the book and tell me that I would never live long enough to enjoy it.   I didn't like it at all!   In this novel, you are the main character, but no one talks about you.  There's very little action or romance.  It's just the plot and a few bits of action here and there.  The plot does not work, you don't like the main characters, and all the characters are flat.  I do not think that these things can be overcome by reading a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was poorly written. The entire book was written in the first person, which I always find irritating when it's done to a non-fiction book.   It really did a disservice to all the characters in the book, the whole purpose of this book was for the characters to get to know each other and come to terms with the loss of their mother. Â It's unfortunate that a great book like this can't stand the test of time and that the writers didn't just get it right the first time around. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a pity that the author did not write the original. This translation, which was made possible because he had just published an earlier work, is very faithful to the original, except for a few small changes in phrasing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read through the whole book before writing my review.   And it's not a good book   There are times in the book when I get a headache   It's got a good flow   but there are times when it doesn't flow 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed reading this book, but I can't believe that the authors can't tell a good story!   They keep writing chapters about the heroes who have nothing to do with the plot, and the characters who are stupid and stupid characters.   This book is a waste of time, I'll never buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A few years ago when I was in high school, I read a few nonfiction books.   First was "Why It is So Hard to Build a Life Outside the Home."   Then, a couple of years later, I picked up "The Man Who Sold the World."  They were both quite good books but one was an 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most boring, repetitive, pretentious, and boring book I've ever read.   It was as if a bunch of professors all read the same thing and were like "who is going to be my mentor,   I think we should just   teach the same things."   You should read about a kid,  but you probably don't   because it is   hard   to be like the average,  not unlike   a   child. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was at the bookstore the other day when a customer came in with a new copy of D&D's Basic Rules.   The first few pages were good,   but the rest of the book   was dreadful.  My first thoughts were, "why   didn't   someone think of that before   releasing   the rules ?"  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing style is so dry, I had to put it down after the first 5 pages.   I hope that's the only book that this author writes about a "sexual encounter" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got the copy of this book at my local library.   As soon as I saw the title I started to read it.  It was a good deal.  The stories were interesting.  Unfortunately the ending just isn't that interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's very hard to write a review about anything else in a book that is good (especially in a romance) but this isn't one of those books.    I bought it on the recommendation of a good friend and I really wanted to like this book but it's so dull and boring I don't want to even finish it and I don?t want it to be my next read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was interesting from a historical perspective but it was just a terrible biography. It was also just a huge amount of boring, irrelevant stuff to get all excited about.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What a disappointment.   I found this book to be a bore.  It was more of a study book, than a real history book, which I thought would be a good idea since he is a history professor.  The book was more about the social  and cultural  aspect of the civil war.  Unfortunately there is a lot more on this that was not presented to me.  I can understand why he would not like this book, but I would have preferred to see more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have a hard time reading some of these books   Unfortunately the story seems to drag in this one, as in all the rest  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so poorly written and written in a manner that feels awkward   The first 100 pages consist of the authors making fun of the entire genre of the book by comparing it to a children's game (I'm not a big board game fan, but if you are, this book sounds like it would be a fun time to play with friends)   However, the book doesn't end with the two best parts of the game, so I'm not sure if the entire game is the best part   I have to give it 3.5 stars  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â The author does not seem to be familiar with the works of John Updike or Raymond Carver, nor does he seem to know any good or good-ish novels by them.   It's like reading some of the less successfulÂ    novels by Updick  or  Carver .   The book is not very good, just sort of there.  Recommendation: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was disappointed with this book because it seemed to me as if the main character (a person that knows a lot about a certain subject) was too good of an expert to actually learn that topic  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a little out of its time. It is written by a man who went to university in the 1950s and 1960s, at a time when men, women and children were forbidden from going to the theater or reading the newspaper.   When you read books about the war in Vietnam, you usually get to know someone who is doing something about it: a man on a bombing raid or a soldier who has been deployed in some war zone.  This is not the case here.  The book is about a young man who wants to go to Vietnam, but who is worried about his mother and father not being able to take him and his sister to Vietnam.  He gets an older brother in the military who can help him get to Vietnam in his own way, but he is the only brother he has.  Despite this, he gets the chance to go into a real war zone and he enjoys it.  It is about this that you realize that the Vietnam War was not what it was made out to be.  I found it to be a little hard to understand for a man of my time.  At first, I thought it was a little silly, but later I came to realize that it might have been about me.  So it is a nice way to get into the Vietnam experience for those who are too young to remember the real war. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I was very upset that it was a bad read.   I understand it is supposed to be funny but it was so terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't think I would like this book until I finished it, and then I just loved it.   In short, this book is about a bunch of misfits trying to make a living doing what they do best: acting.  So, basically, it's basically a high school musical about a group of misfit high schoolers doing a high-school musical.  I think the only downside was that the plot kind of fell flat for me.  If you can ignore the high schoolness of the book and just go with it, you will be able to enjoy the book.  The characters are unique and likable and the plot is very simple.  It was just what I expected from a "high school musical" type book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am really bummed I bought this. I did not like it much. It is a good story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My wife and I read this book when we were in college and we loved it, but after finishing it we found that it was lacking in a few areas. It wasn't as good as we thought, nor did we think it was that good.   As for the story,   "The Last Child" is an interesting and entertaining novel, about a young woman named Mary that moves back into her grandmother's home when the grandmother is ill.  Her life is changed when she becomes a mother to a baby girl named Ann, but her grandmother is not very fond of her and doesn't seem to approve of Ann.  The grandmother thinks Mary is a bad person because her children don't love her, and that it's her fault that Ann is a woman.  Mary makes a decision to move in with her grandmother and her friends, because she doesn't want to be around her any more.  However, one day Ann takes a dislike to Mary and she refuses to let her stay with them.  At first, the grandmother seems upset with Mary, but she is soon warmed up to Ann when she finds out that Ann will never have a mother like her.  This novel isn't as great as the first one because it is a little too happy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have a book that I've been wanting to read that's been out of print for years. This is the second time I've read it, but now, because of what this book did to my confidence, I'm unwilling to read another book about her.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've bought two of these books in the last few years.    My first one, The Secret, was a bit of a letdown.  It was just a little too dry and was missing a lot of the emotional impact.  I thought maybe he'd gotten some things wrong.  Now, I'm just a bit disappointed with this one.  He seems to think that because the author of a novel doesn't like the book, it's not worth reading.  And maybe that's how people get bored, but  I really wanted a little more than the fact that this book took place in New York.  This is also the first one to be based on a true story.  So, a good story, bad book? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book in about two days. It took me about five years to get through all the pages of the book I was writing so I would just say I feel pretty bad about that.   It's like the first person POV character in the book was the author and had a bunch of problems with his mother and brother. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was hoping to get a copy of The Good Earth, which I read over two years ago.   The only good thing I can say about this book is that it is about people and not just about the food. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book that should have been a part of the library of every high school and college class. The authors state that in every generation the leaders were different.  In the past that has meant a politician with the right ideas to be elected.  This book shows how those ideas failed the country in two ways.  1. The government failed to plan ahead and prepare for the future.  We are still paying the consequences.  2.  The military failed in their mission.   For over twenty years the United States has been fighting in multiple countries with no real plan or plan B.  Now when people ask why are there still wars, I think my answer is:  These guys do not know how to end wars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I gave this book 3 stars because I really love to read, so this book really made my day!   But there is nothing good about this book, at least nothing positive!  -   For all you people out there who don't want to go to university or you don't feel like studying, this book will definitely be a great help to you!  In addition to having to go through a lot of the same stuff, I felt that there were some inconsistencies.  For example: Â I'm not really a big fan of   "TheÂ "   - I felt the story told from his point of view was a little confusing.  - This was the only time in the book that I felt like the author was being a little vague about something important and then telling us it's really important in the last 5 minutes, which makes no sense at all.   And to top it all off, this guy is basically a dumbass because he didn't know about the other side of the world.  I feel like this book would have been better if he had read this book beforehand instead of just getting it off the shelf and reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book that has a huge number of false claims (which are almost completely unsubstantiated) and which is a complete waste of time.   If your only problem is to learn about the subject then get this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been reading a lot about the Bible recently.   Some things that I found in this book are:  1. The book is about what the Bible says about the world, not about what it really is.  This makes it a bit confusing.  A good illustration of this is in a chapter called "The Bible and Religion".  In this chapter we are told about a group called the "LDS Church" that believes the Earth is only 6000 years old.  They also believe the Bible to be the inspired word of God (it is a religion).  I do not believe in this belief.  However, my friend does.  How do you know if something is inspired?  It is the same as saying I can't understand what someone is saying unless they say it in English.  2. The chapter "The World" contains a lot of stuff I think most people would find odd.  These things include:  A statement that "All Christians agree on the following things":  1- All the books of the Bible are inspired of God 2- The Bible is the "Holy, Sacred, and Inspired" Word of God 3- The Apostles did not see any "errors in the Bible" 4- The Book of Mormon is a true record of Christ's ministry 5- The New Testament and the Epistles are "written by men who wrote for men" 6- There were no visions in the New Testament 7- Jesus never prophesied that he was going to die on a cross 8- All other religions are false 9- The purpose of this book is to "show God's plan for the world" 10- All people should study the Bible 11- It is true the world "may" end in a physical way:  12- There is no end to our natural lifespan 13- There will be an end to suffering of all kinds, not just physical    The last statement may be a bit strange to many people.  14. The author makes the comment "Some people use the scriptures for personal, or political, goals."   But is that really what they do?  15. The authors then goes on to explain why people would believe what they believe and why other religions might not have the same answers. Â  Why they believe things they believe, is the author's guess:  16- People use the Bible as a "window into a personal world view."  17- The "personal world view" is based on
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The premise is wrong. There is no reason to believe that the people of China who lived during the time of the Tang dynasty have any knowledge of a civilization that has existed for nearly 5000 years.   It is a historical novel with a few historical facts thrown in to make the story more interesting.  It isn't a terrible book, but it is not worth your time.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It has nothing to do with the main character's actions or personality, but just because the book is about her doesn't mean the whole book is   aÂ  waste   A "Waste" is a piece of junk, but it's junk that is not worth reading.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted a book on how to deal with your kids' behavioral problems but I got the feeling that this book had more information than I wanted to know about this subject.   Â  I had read about behavioral therapy (which I have done on my own) and it sounded interesting but it did not seem possible to put a lot of the information into one book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so excited to find this book after so long.   It was written by a professional (an ex marine)  and I knew I was getting a book that would really teach me something about marine biology.  However I'm disappointed.  The book is about the fish  in a lake in Florida  and   they  can't reproduce.  What is worse  is  it can't be reproduced without destroying   the surrounding habitats   The author does a pretty good job  of explaining  what he  thinks  about this  problem  However the problem is that the  lake is in the state of Florida.  It is an arid place  and if we can't have fish in Florida then what's the use of living here   So the only other option is  to destroy the habitat that is in Florida. Which is  really stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is called "The Way of Men" and so it is meant to be a "man's man's" book.   I don't think I ever heard a man's story before.  I guess that is why it resonates with me so much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have yet to read this book. I can say however that if you are going to read a series of books written by a man who has been arrested and imprisoned, you are better off doing so by yourself.   This book will make you think about some of the things you were not aware of about yourself when you were younger. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a lot of books in high school and college and still have to use the phrase "I just can't seem to find anything to love about this book."   This is an excellent, highly entertaining read about how a young man discovers a girl who is a vampire but can't find a way to kill her, who is married to another man with whom she's had an affair.   But the best part is that the woman is actually likable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book at a university library.   It was a good read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had no idea what the author was talking about.   After reading a number of this kind of book, I finally decided to read the book as originally published.  I think I found a good read...  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really didn't like this book.   It has an interesting idea, a lot of information and an interesting approach to the subject, but all of that was thrown in the trash.  The only thing I liked about the book was the idea that there is a group of people who want to keep the world a little bit simpler than the rest of us.  For me, that was the point of the book. I think they were going off their own personal desire to do things right.  But other than that,  it was boring to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hate this book.   It's a complete waste of my time.  The first 5-6 chapters tell you a lot about the book's subject matter and even gives you a little bit of a story on the writing process and how it works.  Then you're thrown into a world that is so dull it hurts.  It takes you out of the story and out of what you're supposed to be doing.  This whole book is pointless.  I wish I could have kept the book for another week before giving it a low score. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a real trainwreck.   I would have given this book 3 1/2 stars if I could have stopped reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The premise of this is very interesting, but when you're trying to figure out what to do with the main characters, the story is pretty lame.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did enjoy this book. It was an enjoyable and enjoyable read. The characters were interesting and the story was told with great style. It had many interesting things that I didn't know until I read the book. However, I didn   find the plot as compelling as it was.   It is a bit slow paced but not to the point of boredom.  It did leave me a bit bored but that   was not something I found was a flaw with the book nor the book itself.  I recommend this book for any book lovers out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book on the art of making a good book, and is about how to be a good writer.   A lot of the advice in the book is good, especially the idea of putting a good description/quote/line in a book.  But the chapter about marketing is absolutely terrible.  For one, they say in the first sentence, that their book is " a work of fiction".  Then they say how their publisher has no idea what they do, or don't do.  When it comes down to marketing, it is not their job to educate people about what they don't know about their field, or what doesn't appeal to them.  The only reason they can put this in there is to try and make their self as look like a fool.  This makes no sense because marketing is marketing, and a bad writer will never know anything about what makes people want to read something 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of my favorite books. If I hadn't met a friend recently that works in the drug field (she said she needed to be reminded of some of the scary things she had to take care of when working with drug dealers)   I wouldn't have purchased this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The bad:  In the book the title tells you it is a history of the Civil War (but in reality it is the War of Northern Aggression.  Â The Southern states that seceded from the Union and established the Confederacy, the Confederacy was NOT against the war.  They were fighting to protect the institution of slavery.  No doubt they would have fought against the invasion of Canada if the Canadians had wanted to invade.  As for the fact that we did not invade Canada during the War:  There are 2 reasons why there was no invasion: 1) The United States had only a few thousand troops, so the Canadian invasion would have been impossible, and 2) Canada did not want to invade the United States for many reasons,  like:  1) They were afraid that the U.S. would use Canada as a staging ground to invade New Orleans  2) The Canadians feared that the United Sates would invade Canada for gold and other resources 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst part of this book is the author's bizarre, "inspirational" view of the nature of existence.   She imagines that all consciousness is just a matter of the mind's ability to be influenced by the physical world.  This is a bizarre notion.  It is simply incorrect to assume that everything is physical, not matter and energy.  As anyone who has ever tried to describe how consciousness is produced or produced and realized it was very hard, this notion is wrong and is a bad way to view things.  The author is just wrong in her description of the process of perception.  There are two possibilities to how we see: (1) by sensing what is out there, or (2) by constructing the idea of what is there from the stimuli in our environment.  Consciousness is an emergent property of these two types of perception, but the perception itself is not emergent, but is a product of a number of other things in the brain that cause it to form in the first place.  One of those things is the "sense of agency" that the author talks about.  Since there is no one there to make sense of it, the experience is pure imagination.  But even if it were true, there is nothing to suggest that we are the conscious agents in this.  Even if we are, that would still make no sense because the "mind" and "consciousness" are the same thing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I've ever read.   It's the first time I've read a novel with a plot as poorly conceived as this one.  The characters are flat, the setting is completely irrelevant (one character is a black cat-lover; I like my cats in this universe), the plot is boring, and the plot doesn't advance until much later.  One could argue that the main character is being kept captive in order to gain access to a powerful artifact which she needs in order for the plot to advance.  However, if you're using the concept of a "captive audience" as a way of selling books to children, you should probably have a better plot.  I'm sure that someone can come up with a better plan, but the author has clearly lost touch with what is interesting about children's books.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so excited to see this book in my library and I was eager to start it but I just got very bored with it very quickly.   The author spends a lot of time discussing what is wrong with women but the problem is women are not the problem   Why do women behave like idiots   This book is about the relationship between two young girls   What would be a good message   It is not the book's fault   If I ever write another book like this I hope they find a way to make the characters likable and not annoying and annoying as hell 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is nothing but a collection of stories written by various people, and if you read it from cover to cover, there is not even a hint of originality, not even from the way the stories are connected.   If you read the story from the title,   this book is the perfect antidote to the horror of modern culture. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What did I like about this book?   The writing is engaging and the story is compelling.   It's like watching a drama in which the actors are really good.  I think this is an important book to read about growing up in the 1950's and 60's. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The cover is a good image but is difficult to find in the actual book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I tried to read this book, but as soon as I started, it was clear I wouldn't get past Chapter 1. I went back to my book and the chapter I hadn't read before.   So I am not even sure if I want to go through the book again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not sure how well I know my history, but this book is pretty much a compilation of bad history.  Â The story is set in the 1600s, and a number of the characters have names that would be familiar to any history buff. Â In fact, the whole story is the story of how a certain king's name became known in the history books as a great ruler.  While the king in question is certainly famous, he is still one of the most notorious figures in history, a man who ordered the mass execution of some 1.5 million innocent civilians on the order of his own "Grand Vizier," who also had a penchant for incest and killing women, even children.  It is not an exaggeration to say that the real King Edward VII was also a notorious womanizer, who had at least two mistresses, one of whom was one of his wives.  He was also the king who had his own son executed in a very similar way.  I could go on, but I think this is sufficient enough reason to give the book a pass. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book for my daughter when she was little but I had already read it. I am not a good storyteller so I think this book could have been better had she been the reader.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was pretty terrible.    I felt really bad for my mom when she read the book because she always had a hard time with these types of books.  She didn't have the same problem with the other ones.  I'm really disappointed in this book,  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was extremely disappointed in this book. It took me about three weeks to finish the book. I kept getting stuck at a particular scene, trying to figure out why the person (who is not named but is clearly supposed to be the author's main character) kept saying "there is not"  . So, I gave up and just went through the whole book.   It is filled with typos and just plain awful writing.  My main complaint about this book was that the main character didn't learn from her mistakes.  ( I did not realize that is what I was supposed to think when she kept saying, "there are not", so I was trying to learn from mistakes when my main character made them.  )
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a huge fan of this book  .   It's a good book.   Unfortunately, the story is a poor attempt at a fairy tale. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book about a good movie.   I love a good film but   the movie was over acted and a bit boring,   which is a big problem   for a bad movie   not a good   film 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is written to be good in the best sense of the word, but in many ways it is less than that. It is written as if someone is trying to make a new version of a book they already have and do not care that much about what is in there.   My biggest complaint about the book is that it is not clear at all what it is that the people were after.  As I say this, they wanted "a piece of their past", not the past as it was before their family moved into the home.  It is a strange thing that people, especially people who lived as long as they have lived can have such little sympathy for their own family who came before them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was my first experience with a 'pulp fantasy' genre book.   I liked it.  There were some inconsistencies that I didn't particularly enjoy:  1.  He does not like girls who do not use her "girly" clothing as a crutch.  2.  I did not appreciate the use of the 'wink wink nudge nudge' tactic on the readers.  3.  The book is very sexist.  And I'm a guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book by my grandmother in the 60's and I thought it was very interesting but I didn't like it.   It seems like a guy wants to put together a team but can't be bothered with the training and can't learn the basics. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best part of the book was watching a movie, like I said in my review.   This book does not include a movie for that reason, but it does include a list of books that could work for a series like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title of this book is the problem.   It's not so much a problem of the book itself, but more of the title.  I do not like to use negative descriptors because I want to give my opinion in a positive way, but I would have preferred to call the book The Last Straw.  A more appropriate title would have been " The Last of the Ropes."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's hard to describe, but I just can't get behind this book.   The plot is all but a non-event.  The characters are poorly developed and there is a certain  pretentious feel to the writing that just doesn't sit right.  A very very poorly written book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the first books I read about a paranormal   -   (yes, there are really that many)   of the paranormal 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It took a lot of effort to get through this book.   This book, with it's overly long introduction, is a terrible introduction to the subject of asexuality (which is one of the hardest topics to talk about).  It is not worth the read.  This is the first time I found information about Asexuality online that was interesting, and that led me to think about my orientation.  It was a bit like reading about an alternate universe, with the same people but a completely different reality.  For the longest time, I had thought that I was asexual (which made it very hard to explain) and only felt the urge to have sex in rare moments (which lead me to believe that I could be heterosexual).  I am glad I found this, and it has led me into thinking that I have asexual feelings in most of the times when I am tempted to be sexual. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is just plain bad.   I don't care who you are, or what kind of books you read.  This is just a bad story.  It takes me back to the old school stories where you get what you deserve. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main plot is not as good as the last four books, and the conclusion is very bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   . ..   The book is a series of short stories that were written by a woman at her deathbed in the late 60's.   She didn't like the books and thought they had too many "plot holes".   I liked it, but I think a lot of her problems were with the style:  In the 60's, "plot" was not really a word in common use.  If they had just been a collection of random characters in a house with bad food, a big garden and bad sex - maybe I wouldn't have minded the bad sex.  About the only things I can't get over is that the story is told by a single narrator.  How many people can do a book like this, about a woman and a husband that had such a bad life?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not like this book.   The premise was interesting and I was looking forward to the conclusion but it didn't happen and then i had to read the book all over again.  The last pages were very, very unsatisfying.  I am disappointed in how bad the book is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hate writing about bad books.    As a reviewer I get so excited that I forget my usual level of criticism.   If you hate a good book you really should try harder to like a bad one  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My son got this book on Christmas Eve.   I asked him what he thought about the story and he said "It's about as good as it gets."   The reason I gave this book 4 stars is because of how good the story was...the way he showed me how the story developed made me want to read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So when I was first reading the book I was a little bit put off by the author's obsession with the color blue. I think that's the only other color in the world that can be said to have more power than the others. Then about page fifty the story goes straight into the paranormal (the only real paranormal in the book is the fact that it's night in the woods and the fire is in the sky). Which is not a big deal for me, but it was kinda cool to get the psychic abilities right so close to the beginning. But then we get to page seventy five or so and the story starts taking a turn for the supernatural as well (and that's about the only part that I didn't like) and the plot basically falls apart because no one can be trusted.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I opened this book I was very excited.   It was a hard-cover, but well-written and a good read.  I found a lot of similarities between a story I read about a very similar kind of people in a similar situation.  They all seemed to have a lot in common.  The author describes some as "people with no sense of the past" and others as "loudmouths with no regard for people's feelings."  The characters seem like caricatures at first, but as they are introduced, you realize that they are not bad people at all.  But the book just comes to a very sad end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book started very strong.   But there were no more exciting events that I care to remember. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   ... What a mess...   I don't get it... Why would a girl like a boy who likes her back?   He's not really even interested in her at all...  ....   (and then there's the weird bit of dialogue at the end about a ghost trying to "help" the girl.   So that's what they are called.  Who the hell are we supposed to believe?)  ...   That was just one of the many inconsistencies in this novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author had to know that there would be no way to finish this book by the end (I have only been reading fantasy novels for 20 years  ).   So he had to come up with a gimmick.   No, it doesn't make sense  , but I can't think of a better one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story starts out well enough, I liked the idea behind it, but I felt like he forgot what made the book interesting to begin with, the idea of a superman in a world of superpowered beings.   As it is, he comes off as a really annoying character that just wants the hero to stop talking about him  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was about as good as the first half of The Lost World was.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you're not in the mood to read a book that's about a guy getting a dick on his penis and you just need to get off then this is your book.   I'm a bit disappointed that he didn't have to kill himself to get it, but then again, that's kind of his MO. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm reading a book that is very clearly written by an uneducated person. He's trying to prove that a woman can't get pregnant if a man's sperm is mixed with hers in a fallopian tube. He seems to think that that way a woman's ovaries become empty and that the baby can't be born. That doesn't happen. It is obvious that his science is faulty and he is not going to change it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't like that it is self-contained and has nothing to do with other series.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't normally give a negative rating to books, but this one has some very strange and bizarre stuff that you can't unsee. This is not a children's book, so I was expecting more from the author, and I'm hoping she doesn't take any more of the book's strange nonsense seriously.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is like a bad movie.   A bad movie has a bad star and a bad ending.  This one has a good star but a bad,  disappointing ending 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book with my money.   It was not good    In the first chapter, he wrote   "This is a good book if you can understand the concept, but otherwise, it is pretty bad."   Why does he think so?   How can a good concept be bad?  "I was going to read a book on writing and one thing that I've realized is that the biggest problem in writing is: you just can't get anything written, you can't have anything written.  It can't be done.  The most effective writing has to be done by someone who's in a completely different situation to what you are in, it's the problem-solving part that takes a long time to work out.  Because if it's not in a different situation it's just a waste of time, and time is what you need to be able to work with to write something good.  That's what I've discovered. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a horrible waste of time. The author spent a lot of time trying to make me believe that the protagonist, John, had some sort of "hidden genius" that is going to bring a happy ending to everyone. John's not really the secret genius he is trying to sell me on. What he is is a good and loyal friend, and that's about it.   While I could understand why someone would want to believe in John's hidden genius, I can't see how he is a secret genius.  He does have an IQ of 145 and can do pretty much anything the reader thinks of at the time. I am glad that this book was never actually published and I can now pretend I read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was an interesting read, and it showed an interest in how we use language to communicate. I found myself thinking more about the use of language than the actual meaning of what I was reading.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The premise of the book is brilliant. The premise is also something you're likely to get wrong because it's pretty basic.   But, as the book gets worse, it's really good.  It's just an okay book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My favorite part about this book is that she had a son and then got divorced when he turned 17.   She had to go through a divorce to marry him.  She also went on a long relationship with a guy who was very abusive.  Her son and his wife are not nice people to each other and he's been in and out of jail.  If she had not met my friend  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first two chapters were absolutely fascinating, and the remaining ones are even more so.   That said, I just can't wait to see where the story goes, and if the author will be able to find a way to make the main character seem likable (she definitely is not likable, in my opinion).  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What I found most disturbing about this book is that the author is a member of a cult called the Family, and when he was growing up in his church, there was an incident where a child in a ward was molested. He says that was just a coincidence (in other books, the author claims to have heard the boy's mother speak about it and to have seen the abuse) but the point remains that the Family had a bad influence on him. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I first read this book, I thought "Oh no, not another sci fi, post-apocalypse, post human book!"   It turns out that the "Post-Apocalypse" genre, or the "post-apocalyptic" in general is one of my favorite subgenres of sci fi.   My favorite post-aps was the novel by Richard Morgan called "A World To Win" which features a post-human society in an alternate world.  I'm not sure if it's a genre, but I liked it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    An absolutely terrible book, in fact one of the worst I've ever read.   The main problem was the author has a terrible time writing in the first person.  I can tell from her use of it when the main characters are talking about themselves that she was doing it for attention and didn't think it was necessary.  Her story is full of awkward social situations which she clearly did not care about, she just thinks she's right to do so.  A major problem with her story is it starts off as a tragedy but then the author tries to shift the focus to the characters in the wrong circumstances, which is stupid and leads to no development.  Then the author does the most annoying thing I have ever heard someone do, she tries to show the good things about people, which leads to a scene at a wedding with no characters being present.  This entire book is about the characters being wrong about a lot of things and she just jumps in and makes a drama out of the event.  The way she handles the death of the characters is also ridiculous, and makes me feel sorry for those characters.  Finally her story doesn't make much sense, the ending is ridiculous and I don't see how she thinks the story makes any sense to the reader, even though she makes a huge point about it in the very beginning. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is really bad.   If you haven't read the first book in this series, you might want to read the rest, but it's still worth a read if you haven a bit of spare time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't regret it but I do wish I had written my review sooner.  Â There is a lot about this book I disagree with. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very poor book.  It reads like a collection of short stories, and not very many of them are interesting.  One of the main characters is so boring and annoying that I did not find any of the other characters worth mentioning.  The only character who is likable is the father.  He is very nice and caring, even though he has to go to church on Sunday.  I know this is a religious book, but I did think it was a little too much about religion.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read "Pete,"    the book that my son and I had been talking about,   in 2004   when he was about to begin college.   It was fun, but it was also the only book in the collection that I didn't like.  He got bored at a couple of points, and I wasn't sure what was happening.  The next time I saw him he said he liked the book   and   it was good to read again.  I have read that it's a collection of short stories   that are very long.  Now it's been a few years since I read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book but it was a pretty big disappointment when I tried to reread it for a journal entry and couldn't find it.   While the characters are all very relatable it's pretty much just the same characters again.  If you're looking for something easy to read and fun, this is the book for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was poorly written. I found this to be the least compelling part of the book. The author made a few very vague promises about the book but didn't keep to them.   He never really explained his ideas about the nature of religion and politics, or what his motivations are, or why he hates Trump so much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While this was an enjoyable read, I can't recommend it enough. I know that the story of this book is fascinating, but the writing was dull and a bit boring to read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book isn't about what it should be: a discussion of why it's important for women to stay in the house or not   Instead, it's a discussion about how much I hate my husband and my mom   I feel bad about being so upset because I feel like I'm living in the past   But the book also explains the differences between my childhood and his   And it is just the beginning of a discussion on this   (not that it matters, to be honest)
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had just finished reading The Man Who Wasn't There   before I was forced to return this book   (a book I don't normally pick up because it's about a poor man who has to resort to selling a dead guy's possessions in order to get by)   It's a nice, sad book, but its sad is so heavily tempered with the sarcastic, sarcastic humor and self-deprecating humor that you'd think it was a book by the person who wrote it.  Â It's funny, and it's not a particularly great book, which makes me hate its narrator and the narrator's narrator at the same time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a huge fan of the works of Douglas Adams, but this one was a complete and total let down.   It is very funny, but I feel like you forgot who the main character was, which in and of itself is a flaw, but even the other characters, who aren't the main one, are dull.  I can understand that they want to try to be more interesting, but   it really ruins the book for me.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book in college and was disappointed because I really wanted to like it. It seems like the author is very uninterested in this topic and simply does not seem to want to give anything a fair shot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My favourite books are those I cannot put down and those that have the power to awaken the soul, I've been reading them for many years and find myself reaching to them when life feels lonely.   If I read a book about what we need to do better in relationships, it always has the best ending
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading the book a few times (it is quite long) it really is a bore.   There is nothing that really stands out about the characters in it other than they are not bad.  It seems like most of them have the same idea as a person does in a movie.  There are some good scenes in the book but the movie was better.  I think that it would be better if a person was forced to listen to a terrible book and then they are forced to watch a bad movie, just like a bad TV show. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was interesting how this book got an award that has so far been given to so many other books   I would have liked to see more information about the history of a given place  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was not fun.   The story took me out of the novel.  The pacing was slow and not easy to read.  When I first read about the story it sounded like a good book but the ending just felt cheap.  It did not feel like something you might see on tv.  Not worth the $20. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author, Michael Dirda, writes about his experiences of the 1980s as a young man in the Vietnam war.   This is his first published book.  He writes in a very interesting and realistic style.  However, his writing style isn't suited to a serious book on Vietnam, because he jumps from one subject to another and writes about very personal issues.  The last one I read in Vietnam  is "The War: The Unseen Experience."   He didn't tell about the real war he experienced but wrote about the "vast and complex and violent" war that he thinks he saw.  It would be nice if he would have wrote about his actual experience.     This is a good read but is far too detailed to be of any help in finding a career for you.  Michael Dardeda, if you are reading this you have a real good brain to work with. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't enjoy this book as much as I thought I would.   In retrospect, I should have listened to the reviews to make sure I did like it better.  Unfortunately, I found that there was nothing interesting about the book (if anything, I disliked the story), and while there were good insights from her about her experiences in medical school and her medical career, I also thought it would have been a lot better to put more time into developing a storyline about a different aspect of her life that she didn't like or find particularly compelling. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not thrilled with this book. I'm a fan of the "The Lord of the Rings" series.   The book starts off fine, but then the author loses track of what is going on.  I have problems with books where the author is so fixated on a certain storyline that the author gets in the way of the story and does not read the text. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wish I had read this book at age 14 (the story's set in 15th century Germany).   First off, it is not as good as I would like it to be.   Second, the heroine is a monster who turns out to be pretty awesome.  She's also very spoiled, a horrible child (or "brat" as the parents of the children she likes to steal from call her) and her parents think her a "bad influence on her younger sister and friends."   She and her older sister live in a town in a region plagued by an epidemic that leaves anyone who is bitten a zombie-like state.  In the midst of this plague is a priest called the "Doctor."  He's a good man, but he is very cold and cruel toward his own.  But when one of his patients is struck by a zombie bite, the Doctor becomes intrigued by the case and decides to put a stake in her heart to protect her from the zombies.  The idea behind the story is not very good, as I feel the vampires/zombies were a bit too overblown.  Unfortunately, the plot is pretty generic and the hero isn't that exciting.  This book is hard to recommend to a 17 year old, I'd have much rather heard this story set in the 19th century where the author did a good job with the historical setting (I'm a history buff, so I'm not going to go into that, but you know what I mean).
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you don't have a good understanding of how the human body works you're going to get a nasty surprise by the end of this book.   The science is great and the idea that we can make a body as perfect as we want it to be is amazing, but you are going to have a very hard time staying away from the most obvious flaws: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really wanted to like this book.   A couple years ago my husband and I got into a heated debate about why we did not read the bible as we grew up, and I decided that I would read it.  The first night after I got home I went through it twice.  I had a couple of different versions of the story I wanted to read, but I wanted the more "faithful" version the first time around.  It was at that point I realized that the main reason I was not reading it was the same reason I wasn't reading the Bible  (that is I wasn' t sure what it was about, I didn't think it was going to be that bad of a book).  So I am disappointed that I ended up not reading any part of it. But overall it was a pretty good book, and the pictures in the book were actually pretty cool. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited to get this book and I was going to read it right away, but the book never arrived.    When I called the office to see if the book had been shipped, I was told I had not gotten it because the post office was closed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A   Poor  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the worst book I have ever read.   It is full of the same kind of writing that has happened over and over again in this genre and is so cliched as to be ridiculous.  And the main character is an old man that talks about religion.  I have no idea why I read this but it's not something I could write good things about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a horrible book.   You're not supposed to know it's about a ghost or a witch.  And the plot isn't what the author claimed it was, either.  I can't believe you wasted so many pages on a bad story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not expecting anything good out of this book, but I really enjoyed it, I mean, how could you not when it's set in a medieval setting. The language is so beautiful and the characters so fascinating and charming.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was awful.   It felt   like there were some bad people doing   things that just don't   get with the times.  Â     I don't know   if I'm going to have a baby at this time, but I'm afraid to. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have been looking for a good, fun paranormal romance novel to read for a few years.  This book seemed to meet all my criteria for a great romance novel-  A good plot  Good characterization  Interesting characters   Unfortunately the book just didn't happen for me.  The characters were all over the place- Â  one of the main characters was a psychotic  (which is bad )   She had me on the edge of my seat   But in the end  her actions made no sense   And the author clearly didn't know much about what a paranormal romance is   For all the reasons stated above   There wasn't much of a plot   (i.e. when did these people get here and why did they keep it a secret all this time ?)   All in all  I am disappointed in this book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read a lot of horror in my time. This one is one of the worst horror books I've ever read. It's a great idea, a good story. The problem is that there's a huge mistake in the plot that makes the book pointless. The main character is an assassin who is supposed to be in his prime. He has the skills and the wealth to kill people without a second thought. One day while at home, he comes upon a woman who is being robbed. He kills her with a knife and then leaves. He comes back to his own house and kills another woman, who he also has on the run from a gang. The woman had hidden her jewels and had some coins hidden in her handbag. After his last victim is killed, he goes to a brothel and kills some more girls. He walks out of the brothel, has sex with a few of the women in the lobby and walks out again. When he gets back to the place where he killed the first woman, he takes his gun and walks in. The next morning, he finds another woman's body under the same carpet, her face is torn to shreds. The same man who killed the woman before had killed her by accident. The only way to escape from the place is to find her. He finds her but doesn't kill her. Instead, he locks her body under his bed and leaves. What a useless plot! The book was pretty good when I first saw it. I read a review at the time which suggested I give it a chance. I didn't really have a lot to do with the book when I read it and it was about two years ago now. It was a horrible disappointment when I opened it up and saw what a mistake this is.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It had all the ingredients to be good but it did not deliver on any of those, it was boring.   The main character was a bad protagonist. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked this book so much that I bought another copy.   It had just been over a year since I read the original.  I had so much fun reading this one.  It has more in common with an adventure story or fantasy novel than a book about real life (although there is some magic and a monster).   This one had a good cover and had a couple of really good scenes that would be great for a horror book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not a book snob. But I had high expectations for this one because it was supposed to be the first of four.   It turned out not to be   a book   that was   about   the   past   of   American   politicians   --   Well   not really.  Posted by Rachel at 11:37 AM
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've had this book for about a year now, and it has not been worth the price for one simple reason: the author is completely incompetent.   The only reason he has a "reputation" is because he's an author of many books which were, to my mind, poor.  His writing is awful.  He does a poor job at describing what happens to characters who have died.  There are many times when the author forgets what the characters were actually doing, which is the most frustrating.  And if I didn't know better I'd say the author has no skill whatsoever.  Even the book's own reviews say that.  The last part of the book does make some sense: the plot is set in the last days of the Ottoman Empire.  But the last chapter is a complete pile of crap.  It was just so ridiculous that I was left completely flabbergasted.  I just wanted to rip my eyes out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â This book is terrible. It is the worst book I've ever read on the subject and I can't even be bothered to find another book on the topic.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One thing that I don't get about my parents is that they don't believe in evolution.   They don't give much thought to the evidence 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only redeeming qualities about this book are that it is written by a woman who is well-versed in the subject matter and that she has a good grasp of it, including its difficulties and the ways in which it can be handled.   I'm not sure if that is the case with most women writers who attempt to write about domestic violence, but this book could have been an interesting study in how to do so, if only there had been better coverage of the literature in this area. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was published in the 1960's, and is not the first work to do so, but was the first I read (for lack of better words) that showed how dangerous LSD is to the young and vulnerable.   As someone who was on the other side of this, I think this book is one of the more effective ways to convey how dangerous the drug is to a young person. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â I really love the characters, and the world they live in.   As much as I love the story,   it just gets off track a little at times   (it doesn't have to be as important as that).   I hope some day they can write an omnibus of the main series,  because   the world and characters   need   more love and care. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about the life of a teenage girl that was the main character in one of the worst movies ever made.   In fact, it's not even about the movie   it's about her life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The badness of this book is almost entirely a result of the author's failure to take the most elementary precautionary steps to prevent the possibility of errors:  Firstly, I believe that the publisher should have given me a heads-up about a new translation   that is being used for a children's book   in preparation for a paperback.   If the publisher had alerted me to this at the time, I could have prevented my son from reading this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very poor book. I really would not recommend it.   There were some good parts but overall it was a disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the third edition of   The Art of Making People Happy   that I have   bought.   There has been a lot of discussion about   whether   these   books   are   useful   or   necessary   to   happiness   but   this   is   a complete   failure   It   does   anything   positive   about  Â  happiness.  This   really   was   written   because   it   got   published   in   1984   and   so   the authors   have  Â  always   believed   people   should   be happy.  They   can't believe   they  have created   any   book   like this Â so . 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't say that I've ever bought anything from Amazon that didn't contain a ton of mistakes/misunderstandings.   A lot of the time, the authors don't know their stuff so, well, this book is probably one of those times. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most frustrating thing about this book is that the author seems so sure she has the answer to the "why" (whatever that is) to the whole "mysteries" about my mom's death: she is the kind of woman who takes the most care in what she puts into her body and yet she died with no time to do that - but why  ..   I just can't get past the whole question of why 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think there are so many problems with this book.   The first problem is the narrator.  It's the best part of this book (or so I think) and I loved it.  But there is no "voice" in there.  This is as if someone wrote a novel (or book) in English, tried to write a good one, then took it to French to edit.  That's why it makes no sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think the author's original intention was to tell a story about a boy's first experience with a new video game, but it turns out the game doesn't actually teach the boy anything about anything, it just teaches him that he can win by playing it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wanted to like this book.   But   The book is full of clichÃ©s, and the story is poorly executed.     After reading the reviews I thought: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed this book, but it is a bit heavy handed and it is hard to read this way.    The book is about a young boy who grows up on a farm and has to grow up and be responsible for his mother's death.  While the book is supposed to be about what is happening on the farm to help the boy,  his mother died before he even got the farm set up and it seems like he is just running to do what the old man told him to do.  The boy is good about his job and takes responsibility, but his mother doesn't feel that way about him.  I am not saying that this is bad, I just don't feel this is the way to do it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was thoroughly disappointed with this book.   There was so little value in this book and I don't even want to think about how much it costs to produce these. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I wish I knew what I was going to get.   There was a lot of hype surrounding this book   and now that I read it   it  is   garbage   a waste of time  .  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read and liked a number of the recent books by M.C. Escher and this is his worst.   Escher's art is pretty much a mess, the lines are weird and don't line up well.  I did not like the style and didn't really like the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I love to read.   Unfortunately,   This book has a major flaw:  1. The book is written by a child.  2. The story line is very shallow.  3. The narrator is extremely stupid.  4. The author thinks he is an 8th grader and does not know any better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the first nonfiction book I have bought from a publisher in the last 5 years, and after reading it, I am very disappointed in the quality.   It was so poorly written that I found it hard to follow.  The story is very hard to comprehend   What I am seeing in this book is not what is happening in the world.  Is the author saying that the reason people do not go into the business is because they believe it is a scam?   In reality, many business owners are good and honest, so that does not explain why there is such a lack of people going into the profession. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought I would get my hands on this book but sadly didn't.   This is a book that is so much more than what it seems to be.  Â  It is well written and very thought out.  One has to read the first half before they can see the second half.  In spite of this, I am not really a fan of books that require a mental exercise just to get a job done. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed this book   but I would recommend skipping it   if you can  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read it because I wanted to know why so many people said they loved this book.   The narrator and the "author" are both   terrible  !   They both tell   the story backwards   at great length  .   My opinion of this book is that it has all the   ingredients of a horrible book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read several of the previous books and enjoyed them to a degree but, at the beginning of this one, I was disappointed.   As it turns out, it was a pretty good book all the way through.  It might have a few flaws, but I'm going to keep it anyway, as the characters are likeable, and there are some good twists. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book which gives the reader very little information about the subject, which makes it very frustrating as a reader.   First of all, if you are going to write a biography of a person, why not give more background about them, like their family and their childhood, their life after that.  Then the second thing that bugs me is the fact that this book seems like a sort of prequel to another biography written by some other author:  In this book, a little girl is described as being very "sensitive", "troubled" and "sick".  Is there a connection to the child who was adopted by a man who raped and molested her?   In addition to not giving the reader much about the child, this book is a very rushed, cliche-filled, poorly written account of the life of the author (I am not talking about the biographical details in this book that were included in the biography, but the book itself).   The last paragraph of the biography describes a little boy's reaction to being adopted as a child.  This boy is a bit of a freak and the adoption is supposed to make him better.  I don't know about you, but I doubt that a child's reaction is a reason to make this child better.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I have read in ages. The author just makes it up as he goes along.   I really didn't like the premise at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not enjoy this book at all. I found it very, very boring, as does everyone else I have read about it.   It is a great read if you want to learn a lot about the "history" of the Second World War, but it does not fit with anything I have seen or read about the Holocaust, or about any of the horrible crimes that were committed in both the Soviet Union and the Nazis. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book for the first time about a week ago, and I feel like I don't know what it is about.   It seems like the book is trying to get into religion, but it just doesn't work.  It has a lot of religious people that have all the answers in the world.  The author even says that he/she/ they have an answer, but if it was true that would be great.  No one in this world has an answer to anything and that seems like it would be a huge turnoff for a book like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this as a gift and read the first few chapters before I turned it in. It's a good story but at the same time it takes a different approach than I've seen before. There were many times where I wanted to jump out of my seat and scream, "WOW! !" because of a change in circumstances.   At the same times there are many times when the characters were very realistic in the way they expressed their feelings and thoughts. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked this book   It had a good amount of humor   But there were a lot of things that got under my skin   And the final character   was a joke  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is the first book I ever got out of the library.   I was skeptical, so I bought this book expecting it to be the opposite.  I think I got what I was looking for, but at the same time it is hard to describe.  If you love fantasy you might get something out of this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book for a class in high school when I was 16.   The professor thought it was bad, but a good lesson:  "If the story is not as good as it could have been, it won't be as good a book."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title says it all:  Â  A series of short tales in the same universe, each with different characters and themes.   What is interesting about the series is that the main character is a little girl   who lives on a planet with animals and people that are part of the human race, but that the planet is mostly covered by the  Â savage wildlife.  They use technology from the humans to make weapons but have to fight with magic.  The characters also have a connection to one of the aliens and their human companion who is also their mother.  While I enjoy all the stories in the series,   I thought each one fell a bit flat in terms of plot and characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are not an expert in a field or if you don't have the time or patience to read, you will probably hate this book.   In a field where you must read more than half a dozen books to get a PhD, you don  t really need to read so many to find the one you are looking for.  For an academic that is already stressed out by the demands of research, this book is a massive waste of time.  Even if one is an expert on a topic, the field in question does not need to have its own unique vocabulary.  I have read so much and still cannot find the answers to my questions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main reason I don't love it  is that its ending   is not satisfying    Â    It's   soÂ  unsatisfying   that   IÂ  don't  Â care   if   everyone   all   gets   the   ending 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book at the age of 8.   She was the only one my sister read this with me when we were kids.  It was a little disappointing but I was happy that I found a good book about a good girl. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    "An enjoyable book, which makes good reading and good eating a good night's rest.   I don't really want to go out and buy any book on gardening, as I have some experience but not the knowledge to use it   - but this is just so good   It has all the information   The first book I ever saw on this subject   is in German -   (which explains the concept well), but this book   can be read with a small child  .   This is a great read  "
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is my first real attempt at a fantasy trilogy and I have a hard time understanding why anyone would want to read a book like this, in which every character has to be defined by their sexual characteristics.  The plot and dialogue is very hard to follow because characters speak in very specific ways in order to show that the male characters are supposed to want to have sex with a female character (who is apparently a virgin) or a female who has lost her virginity (who in turn has to prove herself by getting into a relationship with a male).   The female characters don't talk in much the same way, and the male character isn't very attractive.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â I hate to see a book that is not good get better.   This one is not even good as a plot.  The entire plot is made to work around a flawed character, and the story ends up being more about the character than about the story itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   . It is as close to useless as you can get in fantasy literature. The plot is bad, the characters are flat and bland, and the whole book is so muddled that it has little to do with any of the themes that Tolkien is trying to address in the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The ending was anticlimactic.   A few of the characters were interesting enough.  The setting was unique and cool. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought the book was so interesting but I was very disappointed when the book ended because it felt like I wasted my time reading the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I received this book as a gift and I had it on my to read list but I did not think much about it. It's very easy to get into, but as a whole doesn't live up to the hype I thought.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a good book, but it was a long time ago, so I can't remember when it was that it was actually good.   This story is a good example of how to make a good story but keep the "pitching" in the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Â    When I bought the original book, I wasn't sure how I was going to like it.   I read a few other reviews on Goodreads (I've tried many of the similar authors), but the overall consensus was that it was too long.  The book started off with a lot of exposition on the history of the world and how it got to where it was in the first place.  In short:Â  The human race is an overgrown kid stuck in the middle of a very important war.  Then, the people of Earth are attacked by other races from the planet Votan.  We don't get to know much about them.  One of the first parts I read in the book was about a "special forces" team.  They're soldiers who have been on Earth a long time and had to be modified to operate in space.  I didn't get why they'd be the first to be adapted for space travel, but that's how things work, I guess.  It was good at making the book interesting.  A bit more exposition might have made the book a bit more interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm a long time readers of Stephen King, I've read his novels multiple times, and this is by far the worst of his work.   When King writes a short story that seems as good as the previous one, he just doesn't pull it off, and is left hanging out to dry.  This is King's best story (I think, at least, that's where the novel is going).  The prose is pretty good (in my opinion).   This isn't a "bad" story per se, just a story that never got the chance to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in a couple of sittings.   The first one was ok, then the second one just got worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While this is a "good" book,   it isn't an "amazing" one.   It   does a decent job   of "justifying" how I got into   marijuana use in the first place   but that isn't enough   to save it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the most horrible book  I've ever purchased.  The plot involves an alien, with a personality disorder, who has a plan to invade earth and take over.  This plan is to create a world ruled by human beings, using all the human knowledge and tools available to them at the time (which is a bit far fetched, considering that most of the stuff that was available didn't exist yet).  The problem is that they plan to enslave all humans by force, then when the humans revolt, use that to make humans slaves again, and the whole cycle continues until the "perfect race" comes along.   How does an alien manage to be so good at making things work when he's not able to reproduce himself?   At one point, the aliens attempt to create their own race of humans, but the plan doesn't work because they just can't keep up with what humans know.  At the end of the book, the alien is so far gone that he has to be put down by humans and sent back to his home planet.  How is he going to get home?  There is no way this can be a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My son and I have been discussing a book about this subject for a couple years now.  It was about a year from when I had the book with me.   He was about 8 and I was 7.  He wanted it so bad that he made me write a note on it so that I would know when I got it.  I don't regret it but I would have liked a more modern version. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know what happened to me. I picked this book up a couple of months ago and didn't like it at all.   The main problem with this book is the plot:  First, she claims she didn't write it (no doubt some of the chapters were taken from other novels she has written).   But then in the end it says she "wrote an entirely new novel"   She wrote some pages about an old friend, but then didn't tell us what happened.  When I asked her about it, she said that her friend is no longer alive.  She did try to include some details about the old friend in her book, but I can't believe that.  And then she claims to have written this book.  It seems like the author is really only writing a book that she likes, and is telling people what they want to hear.  I didn't enjoy reading it at first either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I enjoyed this book, but felt that it was a bit of a letdown.   The idea of how a man can have more sex than any one else was cool.  What a concept and I liked the author's take on it.  I guess my main gripe was that it seemed like he was talking about his own experiences, not that of others. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are looking for something to read on a road trip, this book is a perfect choice.   It is about the last weeks of a two week road trip that I took from New Jersey to Virginia to visit my sister.  The book does not do a good job in conveying the excitement of this trip.  My friend went out with me and she did not know what to expect.  She expected the trip to be a lot of fun.  I told her to expect something different.  It was not.  We went to a big chain coffee shop that was out of the way and we ended up waiting 20 minutes for their to get a good cup.  Another thing I learned while on this trip was that the people of Virginia are rude.  While walking around in a town, I had a rude elderly gentleman shout at me to get my stuff.  He was annoyed that I did not have enough money for a sandwich and a beer.  On top of that, I ran into a large group of people who took me a while to get to. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is terrible. It was supposed to be about the origin of a disease. It became about how the disease originated in the city of Chicago.   It just doesn't make sense for it to have come from the city, or the disease, or even from the person who was exposed to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've bought more than a dozen of these books in the past couple of years and they're all great but the latest one is a travesty:  The protagonist (the "Mister S") is obsessed with his "cure" and doesn't use it.   He's afraid to go out in public after taking this drug but says he's very happy.  In the end, he kills a woman by hanging her from a tree.  It's not a great book and a waste of time, but I was so disappointed by the ending that I wouldn't want to read the rest.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think the author is really out of touch when it comes to the ways men use their money in society.   In this case, a woman and a girl from another country got together because it was cheap to do so.  This is a bad example of "how not to be a good feminist" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is just awful.   There is nothing of interest in here, and if you can find something to read about that isn't just a synopsis of how a couple of people were once saved from the evils of the world in a certain kind of rock, maybe this one is worth a read but it's just so... blah. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a classic example of the type of writing that is expected of a college-educated woman: The author is able to be a competent, competent, capable, competent writer.   But it's the first five pages of her biography   that will take away   a lot of the value   She's too young for the job   What a waste

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book when it first came out to try it out for my students.   This book is about a college student who comes home and finds her dog dying and realizes that she and the dog's owner aren't really compatible, despite the fact that they have the same dog. Â She goes and spends the night with her boyfriend and her dog, but it turns out to be all for nothing.  (The relationship doesn't make sense either.  I'd say it's more like a one-sided thing:  The girl's boyfriend  doesn't care  about the girl's dog;  the dog  doesn the same.)   So she goes home and falls asleep.  She wakes up, but then she realizes she doesn't know the password to her boyfriend's computer.  So then she has to go back and figure out what the password was from the person's computer...  (She's basically asking him what he thinks of her.  No, seriously.)  So, I'll admit that the idea wasn't very original.  But then I kept going back to it,  because I know that this kind of thing is going to happen to us in the next couple of years when we go back to college.  And there are so many people out there who are doing it already,  so I figured it was worth a try. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a bad example of a sci fi book.   I have never liked the writing style of this book, even though it's been a few years since I read it.  Â     Even though there are parts where the characters do things I want my heroes to do, the story doesn't progress much.  It all comes down to "why" and "how" but I could understand if I were writing about something I disliked, but the characters and events don't inspire a lot of hope. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In a world where every book has a positive review and every bad review is a bad one, I would have to go with this book.   I was looking forward to reading it, but I was a bit disappointed with the overall quality and the length.  I guess my disappointment stems from the fact that the "greatness" of a book is not reflected in the actual content  It's a long book  There are some "great" parts  But there is so much content  There is nothing new  I feel like the author is trying to create a cult of personality  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The characters are mostly boring.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a horrible book to review.  I had to put it down at least 5 times because I just did not like it.   If your are looking for something to read and then take over your brain then look no further. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of those stories that you will never be able to put down. It was interesting, but the writing is not up to the usual standards that I have been getting from the author.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was poorly written, repetitive, and boring.   What really bugged me about this book was that every time someone died, their family would mention that they liked the way they looked on the cover.  I don't have any particular issue with that, but as a reader, I just found it to be tacky and irrelevant.  In a "happy" book like this, you don't get to see the "good guy" actually do something right. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has one interesting aspect:  It mentions that a number of women suffered from uterine prolapse when they were infants.  This doesn't seem to have been a serious medical problem at the time and the author does not go into the reason for this.  A number of other women have written about this problem  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very poor read. It is very boring. The world building is very simplistic. The characters are extremely limited and have no personality whatsoever. The book takes place in a world of magic. It has many interesting things to say about this kind of world, but it never manages to connect these ideas to the characters or the plot, or make any of the things in the book work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In any case, the book is crap. This book is a collection of essays on the history of black people in the U.S. from slavery to today. I was curious about the "black" part of the book and I thought "Oh, so that's why people are so mad about slavery..."  But no, all you have are a bunch of stupid, bad jokes about how people dress and that they're still being oppressed by white people (it's funny because the whole time I was expecting the same jokes about black people that I see in other books:  "Why doesn't anyone like me, black man?! !"   )   I mean, it's not like it was the most popular occupation in the 1600s - which would be the first occupation that white people began oppressing in their colonies.  I'm sure they had a lot of people working in those jobs but that's not really how the history is usually written about in history books, isn't it?   Well, let's see, what were the people in charge doing for the whole 16th century: Â    [the white colonials] were hunting, fishing, making and manufacturing things, working on a lot in the garden and making cloth and so on.   They didn't really have much in the way of education but they had guns which they used to kill black slaves.  "How is that different than what the police are doing today? Â How about when the cops murder people ?"   (p. 12)   This is actually the part that I was interested in so I kept reading but I really didn't get anything out of it except the stupid jokes about being oppressed.  And let me tell you, even after you've read that many books you're still not allowed to read something just because it's "black", right?
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the worst books I've read since the first time I got a book from an autographed hard cover.   If I had to pick a worst book I would say this one.  It's a self-help book that uses one of the best selling self-improvement techniques ever:  -  This book is about as good as  - this book is a self help book that  makes a lot of assumptions about the lives of women in the workplace.  -Â   The title of the book implies that we should just stop working if we don't like our lives.  There are so many things that can be changed about the way we live our lives  that are not actually  - "The biggest mistake a woman can make is not being an expert on herself."  This quote is a good summary of the whole book: -  When women are in the office there is a tendency to view their jobs as something that should be easy.  When we see someone who is an expert in  something,  we assume that that person has the authority to determine what that something is  - This doesn't mean women should be passive and not assertive.  But if we're going to expect women to take care of themselves then we need to acknowledge that these things do  - Women can't do everything, they need a male partner in order to  - be effective in the work place.  We need a supportive partner who can take care  - of us in our daily lives. We need men who have the wisdom and authority to guide us and teach us about  our lives -
Write a negative review about a bad book:    An interesting book with the typical "I love everything about my favorite movie but its terrible" thing going.   The plot makes no sense to me (which is more than can be said for a lot of films) and the characters were pretty much just there to be "fantasized about" in the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is all about what they did wrong.   And they don't know what they are doing.  And then they do it again.  (See the last paragraph for what they think is wrong.) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you're a fan of Tolkien, then   you probably won't enjoy  Â this novel. I know I did.   There are enough Tolkien references in this novel to make the book interesting enough for me. But the novel is   devoid of the magic and intrigue that made the series so addictive for me in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a very poor example of an early 1900's self help book.   The author did not know anything about the subject.  She claimed that people who were "poor" suffered from "low self esteem."   Her first book, Women in Need   (1891) was also based on a survey of women, which she called "the first attempt to measure self esteem among the poor."    I guess she thought she had a lot more time to devote to her own "self esteem." Â    In the second edition, she added a chapter on "Poverty and the Poor."  The chapter included a survey about women in poverty (which she claimed was the first) and included some of the poor who had been surveyed.   Â  She also wrote a book about an actual poor person:  In 1892, The Woman's Day  .. a Poor Woman's Way, published by the Women's Union of Chicago, was published.  It described   the life of a "poor woman" who was on a "poverty wage."  For some reason the author (a man) felt it necessary to put a woman on a poverty wage. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has a great story but the ending is a bit too rushed.   The book had some decent ideas and ideas were explored for a while but the book ends on a cliff hanger ending to some of the ideas. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It has lots of interesting ideas and some interesting, insightful stories.   But the idea is that a person is born with a "special gene", which may be called a   'Bum gene'.   You might say that a Bum Gene gives a person the chance to go down the wrong path.  This means that people who have a BUM gene areÂ    unable   to see   the beauty   of   natural things   and   Â  to listen  Â to the natural world.  There are some problems with this idea. Â I do believe that some people are born with BUM genes.  For example, I am a woman with a BUMP gene.  In a nutshell, the BUM is a large belly, which is normally due to food and exercise.  However, the tummy grows out of control when I eat a large meal.  I am not quite sure how this happened.  Some people seem to be born without a BUN gene, while others seem to have BUMP genes. Â Â  I think that some of the "beauty" in nature is down to the BUMP which helps to explain how some species (in particular animals) are able to adapt so well.  Â   I suppose that the best way to make sense of this is to put this into a bit of a cultural context.  To be a good hunter, you have to see the beauty of the world. I believe that the Bump Gene enables some animals to be that way. I was told recently that many Native American Indians have a genetic trait which makes it hard for them to see beauty in nature.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is not a bad story but it is very slow paced.   This is a great book that should be on the shelf of every college librarian. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Â   This book is NOT a good read.   The book is about the author's mother's addiction to crack cocaine, which began when she was young.  The mother was addicted to crack for a long time, and did a little bit of crack every day and she got away from it.  It took years for her to finally get clean.  Unfortunately for her, her husband did not want her to try to kick the habit.  I could not understand why my mother would make me read this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was horrible.   The characters, while having good intentions, do not act in any way that shows that they are in control of their own actions.  They never stop and think about what they are doing.  I am not saying that they do not have control.  However, they cannot act in a way that makes me think that they have control, as they seem to do to themselves. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a total disappointment.   The writer makes some very interesting and good points about the history of women and the sexual politics of the nineteenth century.  They seem to want to address the issues raised by the feminist movement.  However, these points are buried at the end of the book by way of a few superficial attempts to "explain" feminism.  It would have been more refreshing and a better read if she had been more bold about what she was saying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The second book in the Night Angels trilogy (Night Angels, The Longest Day, The Death of the World ) doesn't get any better. Night Angels is the first in a series about the Night Riders. You know, the guys who ride around and fight. It was supposed to be a sequel to The Death Of The World and it does follow that book's story. However, I didn't like that book as much as Night Riders, it is more "gory" than this book. It is not bad, but it is not as good as the first two. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A great book about the past but the whole ending just sucks.   The story has all the hallmarks of a great story but unfortunately the ending doesn't work at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only negative review I'll put up about this book is that it feels like it has been thrown together out of something that is already out.   I found this to be one of the most disappointing books I've read in a long time.  I'm really looking forward to the rest of the series but this one just wasn't worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first part, the first three chapters, was a good read.  I am a heavy, heavy smoker, but this book is better than some "light" cigarettes.  It's not like it causes any harm either.    I was very impressed by the description and descriptions of the smoker's habits.  Although the narrator said that he doesn't drink or smoke, he said that smoking is a necessary evil for a man.  So I guess that if I want to become a man, I'd better smoke a pack a day. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is hard to review a book that has taken so much of my life   and  I think it is because I have to be the one  to let others know  that  life is hard   because we have to make  decisions   it is so hard  but you keep doing what you are doing   I am sure you don't have to tell me this   but sometimes I have the feeling that it is more about your life  than mine   If you have had that experience you can write a book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A book that had to be put on my "do not waste my time" list due to its extremely boring writing.   The story is pretty much the same from beginning to end.  If you've ever been to the ocean in a boat with a bunch of strangers and the sun has never set, you have some sense of what this book is about.  The only difference is that in this case the sea is a completely different reality.  I'll pass on reading this book unless I'm in a small group and need to hear about how the ocean is different. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sorry, but I just   didn't   enjoy this book.   It's like someone had   thrown all the good stuff   out and just  Â  threw in the   junk.  Â  I   hate the idea of writing a bad review because   you   get a negative reaction   from people   who   liked   it before. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    An old, but still good and relevant book, by a very good author.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There were no good things about this book. It's a compilation of information about various religious groups of the Middle Ages. The book was really a waste of time for a non-specialist like me to waste my time on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because it was recommended as an interesting read by a good friend of mine, and I found it hard to put down after finishing.   If you're looking for a story that makes you think, this is not for you.  If I were to give it a 0/10, it would be because it left me thinking about it all week. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's an interesting read. The stories are interesting, and sometimes touching. However, the world building is very incomplete and unrealistic. Some aspects of the world seem to be ripped off from "Moby Dick".
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A poorly written book that has the main character trying to run away from a vampire.   He makes it about him, and never once tells the vampire he's not interested in her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't really like this book.  It doesn't seem to be part of a series   but rather a one off novel   -_-   This was a terrible book. If you ever read an erotica novel it will be different because it has no romance and its a lot of just the two of them   not much dialogue or anything   its just the sex  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you want to be taken seriously in the field of human behavior, you have to read these kinds of books. It may make you look like an idiot but it's the best book you'll ever read about any subject.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a classic "I am a good person but not much of a scholar" story.   I have never liked this trope very much and am glad it is so rare. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a collection of non-fiction essays. The first one is a "what is the truth about..." "what does not exist in reality" essay by some well-known and respected scientists. The second is a brief biography of George Washington Carver and the third is a description of some of the "benefits" of a high protein diet. I found these disjointed, to say the least.   There were so many factual errors in this book that I think the author had to be a student of the field in order to get it all right. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited to read this book.   The description of it is "An exploration of the concept of free will"   Yes, there is some free will, but the focus is on human nature as it is not always the case that everything is all about right and wrong.  This is a good book to learn about a concept in the philosophical world of philosophy, but if you read this for the philosophical content, it is going to be pretty boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would like to read more of the writings of a certain man called Michael H. Price and other writers who have been around and done good things in literature. Unfortunately, a lot of what he wrote is just rubbish. A lot of people have written him off because he is a homosexual. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What a bad, bad book!   I read it after reading the other books by her, but I felt   like I needed to buy the other ones before reading this one.   She says there is a character called Riddle, but in the next paragraph she says he isn't   the main character, because   he is dead  .   It doesn't matter that he was the main man.  He's dead!!!!  I wanted to get a new t shirt and write about it  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After finishing this book I got the feeling that this was going to be a good one, but the first half is very confusing.   It seems that he is making a point of describing the world but making no effort to explain why it is so different from the real one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't mind reading about a "puppy mill" type of place.   There is a lot of truth in there, even if most people are very ignorant of this "thing."   This book    was one of the first   in the area that used to be a pet shop.  There are   lots of people in their thirties   to fifties  who have their pets   put down   and brought back to life.  The animals have not been returned   or replaced. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is just dreadful.  It is a rehash of the basic "How to be a man" lessons, like how a man does not have to take a shower while you're on the toilet or why a man should be nice to his woman.  I mean, look at the title!   The author writes as though a man is in some sort of deep need for his man card to be revoked.  This man needs a refresher on what a man's supposed to do as man, you know.   What a sad, depressing, empty book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not enjoy this book.   It is not a bad story or anything but the author is a "savior" to the book because she makes all the things better (like she is "special" and "awesome"   She is not.  She has a bad personality.  It was not as enjoyable as I thought it was going to be 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've been reading "The Death of Superman," by the brilliant Kurt Busiek, since it came out.  I can't help but think that this book is just a big waste of time.   This book has the "superhero" name on the cover   and you wouldn't be wrong in thinking that the title is about Clark and his family being killed at the hands of a gang of crooks.  Unfortunately, the reality of the story is far from that.  The first issue is about a super-criminal named "Zelos" Â  killing a homeless person (with Clark as the sole witness) on the street outside a convenience store.  This is the only real conflict of the issue and is the main thing I take away from the story.  What follows is a series of events that culminates in Clark's death.  It is as if Kurt is just trying to give a super story but is instead trying to teach us that the true hero is not the super hero, but the one who fights for what is right.  But the ending is just too bad.  One of the characters,Â "Frenchie,"  is supposed to be the new super-hero who can save Clark from his death. Â  It is not until the last few pages of the book that we learn that he is actually   Zelos and that he was being blackmailed into killing Clark by a group of thugs.  Somehow, the story still manages to feel incomplete.  If only a different writer or artist had written this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The reason this book is so bad is that it uses a lot of words like "sad" and "bad", and it does use those words well. The plot is very basic and does not progress at all, and while it may have some nice images, it is a lot like a Disney cartoon, in that there are very few things that are really worthwhile. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought the author got some things right, but a few things went awry. For example, I wanted to give the chapter on the Chinese Revolution a higher rating than it deserved, but the book doesn't quite get there. It seems that after Mao died, the Communist Party started running scared. But when they did get back on their feet they turned into the same reactionary party they were in the 1950s. The book didn't mention this, but I learned it from a book on the Communist party by a professor of political science who said that if the Communists lost power in China, they would be like the French, who had fought a revolution against Napoleon and then reverted to the monarchy.     
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In case you are wondering, I did not find this book very interesting at all. There were a lot of factual errors that I had already noted in a review from a few years ago.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book had a great concept - a story about a person who takes on the role of a zombie to defeat a horrible dictator (in the author's world this is the United States in the 1960s) but instead gets brainwashed into killing.  It wasn't very original - a lot of stories about people who kill themselves in order to live - but it was good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't remember much about this book, but I do remember the title, which is a very bad book title  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you love "The Girl on the Train" then you might love this one too.   "The world is a very big place"   The story isn't over until the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is filled with information which is great but it doesn't hold a lot of interest once the author gets to the point.   I would really like to know more about how the various tribes came to be and how the people in our world got their names. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's just a bad story that never gets going.   A lot of the plot is just a big joke and it just seems like people just couldn't do a better job at telling the story than the author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really liked this book, although it is really a long book.   This was just the kind of book that I like to read in a quiet room for a while and just let my mind wander on.  It is hard to describe in words what a powerful book this is, but if you are a religious person you will have something in your heart. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the one book that I could see someone getting a lot out of, but I just could not get myself to take much pleasure from the story.   I had trouble remembering that I wanted to take a book to class that year and didn't, and it took me quite a long time to get the books that were left over. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The idea of a good woman who makes good choices is a wonderful one, but the execution is terribly wrong. The author has a problem with not being able to write a book about an ideal girl because she is not a real one and is so good at everything but she is still an object instead of a woman.   I will never buy another book from this author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In case anyone's wondering, I did like it - until I finished it.   I finished reading this book, because it was the first one I've ever read in which the character's sexual orientation was treated as a major plot point.  They were in love and couldn't help it, right?   The only thing that keeps me from giving this a thumbs up is the length, which is a tad on the long side. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While this is a good book about the history of the American west, it is not written in the best historical manner.  Â I felt there were more gaps in the timeline than was necessary. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought the book as an e-book after being enthralled by the author's previous book.   It's not much of a book   but it was fun.  A little of a different take from the normal books  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is by far the worst book i've ever read!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am in my late 40's and   a friend suggested this book  to me   as he was   buying   it  from   me . I read it   in one sitting   and  I   hate it .   You   should   remove   this   book  . It   was Â a   waste of time  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you haven't read this book, or even seen a video of the book (and I haven't), then you are missing out. This is the most important book about how to get girls. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased the paperback and I do not regret my purchase at all.   The book does not cover anything about the American revolution or the Civil war so I was disappointed.  Â   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book was written in 1852, when the author was in his 40's,   and   It   would   have   been   an   great   book   if   the   author had   kept the  the original   manuscript,  and edited it   down,  as the 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The best part about the book was when the book started talking about how all the people who have gone through the process and the people that it worked for were not even close to as horrible as it was.    That is not true, I am not going to lie to you.  A few times I even looked up in the mirror thinking, "Why is the mirror so dark?   I didn't realize I needed to do this.  "   But the best part was I am now in a good place about my self esteem.  I look at my mirror and think   what did I learn. ?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really enjoyed this book.   It was interesting and was entertaining.  But it had a few inconsistencies.  I would recommend to a friend but  I am a little disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I purchased the book, and I had a very difficult time putting it down.  It was not until I was in bed that I pulled it away from my bedside table and started reading it.   This book is a great introduction to what is going on with the banking industry and the Federal Reserve system today.  There were many interesting points that I learned that had me thinking.  This would have been a great book for high schoolers who are thinking about going into the banking business. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is one of those books where you wish it was more about the people who wrote it than the topic.   For me it was about the author.  It's hard to believe a story about a guy who had a sexual relationship with a girl he found out about from her best friend would come out before she was dead.  I am happy to have read this, but it made no sense to me and I couldn't tell you who this book was about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a bad read   It's all over the place   And the whole thing is written as if it were a bad video game   So, I'm not really sure why I bothered  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One word:  I wanted to like this book   When I found out this was a sequel to "The Book Thief", I assumed it would be the same story, just with different characters and a new setting. But this story was terrible. The story had been developed with the second book in mind, but instead we get more plot twists, more characters and more twists and turns. I have no idea what happened to this family, how it turned out or why the family came to live on the top floor of the local church, but it did not work.   It had some of the worst "characters" I have ever read about in a book.  It was so bad I thought to myself, "If only that was the story..."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's hard to put it like this, but I hated the book. It was bad. I don't think it had much to do with the characters, and the main character was not an original character in my opinion, though the whole thing seemed to be trying to be something it wasn't.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm glad I bought this book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is a book by the same name but there is no similarity. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is nothing in this book that I liked about it, in fact it was pretty bad in several areas. The prose was a little too flat (at times) and the ending was just so... well, I don't know, I guess it was supposed to be this "epic" but this book didn't really feel like it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing that I thought made this book interesting was the idea of making a "secret" room. This sounds like a great idea... The "room" in question: a small box with a keyhole that leads to a basement.  It was very simple (i.e., not complicated).   I think that the main idea of the book is:  1. The keyholes are made of "detergent" fabric, which means that they can be used for things that are difficult to hide (like a secret room) 2. A secret room is used to hide a secret from the people that know about it (like parents).  There's a hidden room in this book.   However, it's in the basement. It doesn't look like a good idea to hide something in the middle of the night.  I also thought that I'd better hide it in the attic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't really think that this book was all that interesting.   The narrator doesn't really say much, and the book is full of repetition.  For example, she doesn't say that she found a baby in a tree but "just didn't want to".   Other things she says in the book are a little ridiculous, like "the first man to be caught looking at her through a window"   Â In short, she's just repeating stuff and saying "a little bit of that, a little bit more of that".  2.2/5 stars
Write a negative review about a bad book:    When I bought this book it sounded like a bad joke,   but   that was the point.   The story   was   ridiculous,  that   didn't have any credibility.  Â   The first half of   the book was  Â  about a poor woman with big boobs,  who had a secret lover.  After he died she married   another man, he wanted to be with her so he did the unthinkable, he gave her a fake heart.  Unfortunately he died and   she couldn't get a real one because he's dead,  so the wife left and married a man with a real heart.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a big fan of the new Star Trek movies (even though I am now a fan of TV shows rather than movies).   This book seemed to be a throw back to the early 90's when you read a science fiction book that was less about the science itself than the characters.   But the writing was still bad and the characters were still boring.  I guess I just expected more from a fan fiction and I was hoping for something a little more like a modern day Star Trek. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I started this book thinking it was something that would help me become a better cook.   Instead it made me realize that I have nothing in common with the people I love most and that cooking is just a horrible job.  It made me feel more worthless than a piece of snot-covered meat in a pot of boiling water,    and made me eat all of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My review:  I really wanted to like this book, but my feelings were too strong at the time.   As much as I have enjoyed Robert Caro's work, I had the exact same problem in thinking I'd never be able to put this down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is just soooo long that it makes it hard to understand the ideas.   When we first find our characters they seem very different.  One has a long white hair and very few lines while another has a very short black hair and little words to describe her actions.  When the main character finally gets her hair long we find that one has some sort of strange alien device implanted in her head that causes her to have a different personality every time she takes a dose of the same drug.  The main character also starts out as a sociopath and starts becoming a bit more compassionate the more we talk about her problems.  This is where the problem lies   I do not care how intelligent this book is  It's written in the third person from the point of view of the main characters.  It would be much easier to understand if it was just written from the characters POV  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first part of this book is great!   But once you get to the "Why do I hate these stupid people?"   You know you are in for a bad time.   I know it is just a book   but that is my biggest problem with books like these:  I love books   and I have read and loved them.  I just hope that other people like books  because otherwise I won't get any  out of it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    An unfortunate event has led to me being in a bad mood most of the day.   The book had everything that a reader would want: great writing, great characters, a great ending, a nice ending, and a good ending.  It is unfortunate that this book does not end well.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    While this is a well-written work that is well-constructed, there were too many elements that were unnecessary.   This was the worst book I've ever read by Mr. Martin. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My mom gave me this book when she was on her death bed because it sounded interesting. I had heard about the bad reviews on here, but figured since it's on Audible it must be ok.   Well, I am sorry to report that this is not good.  To the first few chapters, this sounds interesting.  Then the authors tell us about a patient they had whose brain was filled with brain tumor.  A brain tumor in a young patient is a terrible thing, but the tumor was "well positioned" (read: the tumor did it)  It doesn't make sense when the tumor doesn't have to be in the same place at the same time to cause the problem.  The book ends with this little gem:  I don't think I'll ever be able to get past the fact that I got a brain tumor and that I'm going to be dead within 10 years.  I'm in the process of moving back to Ohio.  It really makes you question all the things you have done.  This book is worth a look if you have a family member that has a brain cancer, and want to know what happens to their brain before they pass. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was written in a hurry.   It has many flaws.  It was written to be a quick read but as I started reading it I was already wondering if the author actually knows how to write a novel

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The first page   starts with the following:  The next day   I   went back to work   as usual   but   in a daze  .

You Â    should   just Â   pay it back Â  yourself Â  and  don't Â  talk   about   people   that   always   want   win   something   even   what if Â  you Â  have   an   accident   dono   all this   for   so long  Â you   are   out   looking   tired  ? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a terrible book.   There are several errors and flaws in this book. Â  There is the fact that the authors didn't know enough about the topic they were writing about to properly represent the information they presented.  The other big flaw in this work is the title.  It should have been called " A Common Mistake in Learning Math ".  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had such high hopes for this book.   Unfortunately, it was just another boring and boring book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a large person and have a fairly large appetite.   One of the biggest problems I had with this book was that it was really hard to get through the last 200 pages.  I also had trouble with some of the concepts at the beginning because I didn't really understand them.  My advice:  Avoid this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm going to start off by saying I'm not the biggest fan of horror books.    From the beginning, the author tries to have a big "dark" twist on the tale by telling us about some ancient demon.  The book is supposed to be about how the demon comes back to life after a thousand years in the land of the dead.  He is called a "beast of a demon", he can make things "speak" (in a very funny way), he can cause the dead to rise as zombies.  It's not exactly that kind of scary stuff.  After finishing this book,  I did read the next,   "Ghosts in the Garden".  It was about a couple that moves into a new house to save the family.  My guess is that the book is the first part of a series,  and I hope the sequel will be more original and scary.  This is a little slow going,  but I did manage to finish it in one day.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a bad story, badly told and written. I'm not a big fan of this genre. I've read other horror novels but I'm never interested in reading about the paranormal.   This story starts out well enough. There is enough mystery to keep you reading and waiting for the end to come.  The characters are interesting.  Then the plot falls apart. I won't spoil anything but it is really hard to follow.  It's almost like a movie plot. The main character is a cop who is on the case. They come across a girl who looks similar to a famous serial killer. I know I'm rambling but I have no idea what was going on in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is so hard to get started on a good book.   This book was a disaster.  It was hard to read, hard to write.  I felt like my brain had been fried.  One thing I will say, I have had problems with the book before.  The first 3 chapters are a lot better.  For the rest I just couldn't get it done. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is about the life of a great American poet named W. C. Fields. The story about how he met and fell in love with his future wife is fantastic, but the story about the "torture" he endured at the hands of the US government is not as good.   I think the author is trying to make a point about how much we hate our government, but she misses the mark.  There is no mention that the government tried to break up Fields's marriage.  This was after he had become a prominent poet.  Also, the "Torture Report" doesn't appear in the book,  instead it is found in the "official records" of the case.  And, while Fields did not "die in prison", he was in jail.  As a result, his wife didn't get to meet him for a wedding reception.  The torture report appears in the following two books:  (1) A book about the author (2) A biography about the poet
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My review   -   "This is a good book, in some ways the best book I've read in years. But it is not a good read in some other ways: (1) The ending." This is a book that I wanted to give 4 stars:  It's the first novel I ever read by Martin, the first time I actually gave a book a chance. I thought the story was interesting, but the character were a little bit bland and not that interesting to me. The next day after reading this book, I was feeling a little disappointed because the plot is not as strong as I expected and not as memorable as I had hoped.  Â I would like to have enjoyed this book more, but I just couldn't.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book to help my husband with his reading.   He loves to read, but has trouble finding something good to read about these days.  He says this book is a good reminder to have a hobby  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It should have come out years ago.   The plot is pathetic, the characters are shallow, and the whole thing has a sense of humor that just is not there.  I bought this to read and enjoy.  It was the first book I ever read by a female.  I enjoyed the characters and some of the humor but for me the story was just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an interesting but ultimately uninteresting book about a long-dead celebrity who has become an icon:  It is the kind of book you may find yourself flipping through with an interest piqued:  "I thought I would never find it: Â  I had no idea who Tom Cruise was."   The authors were unable to dig up a copy, but were able to put together the biographical information from a few interviews.   It's a little odd, though, because the author describes himself as a Cruise "lover."  I did not enjoy this book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The last three or four sections of this book were pretty boring.   There were little tidbits about characters, their lives and thoughts and feelings.  There was some background about how people think and feel about this type of thing.  But the author is writing for a general audience.  You know what would be a better way to show a non-comic book, a historical novel or non-fiction book, etc.?  How to make a comic book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a piece of crap from beginning to end.   The writing style is horrible.  It is extremely repetitive.  All the characters are stereotypical.  The story starts off ok but after about the 10th chapter it falls apart.  I can't understand what she is trying to say.  My husband even said that the book was boring.  She does not try very hard. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a great book when I started reading it but after the second and third chapters I realized the author's main purpose in writing this book was to tell a story about a bunch of kids doing stupid stuff in school.   When he got to about chapter 10 or so he was completely pointless.  He didn't care enough about the story he was telling to bother even trying to explain the basic plot to me.  I feel I got a better story out of my other book,   The Princess Bride  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got the first book in this series.   It seemed pretty good at first.  Unfortunately, it was pretty bad.  I really thought the story was going to be good.  It started out well, and then got worse and worse and the ending was disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So I was excited about the book   but i'm still kind of disappointed.   The main character has some mental problems   and then there is this other girl. Â I'm not sure if this book is bad or if its just the writer's style, but i wouldnt buy a book that is bad like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the first book by a woman (to my knowledge) to be published by Ace Books, but not even close to the first in the women's genre. She's written a story that is as interesting as it is predictable, with some pretty good humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this a few times, and just stopped reading it altogether about a year ago.   First of all, you're supposed to pick the most important bits out of the various reviews about your book.  Is there any reason that a book about a child-murderer should not be worth reading?   He is a psychopath, not a saint.  He may not be the most likable person in the world, but he makes his own moral decisions and is completely selfless.  In fact, he is the kindest person in this book. No more than 2/3 of the way through the book, he even offers to pay for the kids' meals to keep them from starving to death.  The entire point of this book is to illustrate that no one is good because they were born the way they are.  I'm just going to go out on a limb and say that the people who write a negative book about the book you're reading probably are the same ones who wrote a negative one about your own book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A horrible book.   This is a book about a little boy who has a horrible day in school and needs help.  It is one of those books that is so wrong that the author can't possibly know what she is talking about.  At one point the little boy is forced to leave the classroom to go to the bathroom.  He never goes back and instead goes to play with his friends.  A while later his teacher notices that he has gone missing.  This teacher makes the kids go in the bathroom and look in the garbage can.  The little boy makes it back and tells the teacher that he made it back.  They find out the teacher is having an affair with her own son.  Now it is a little girl that gets kidnapped.  Unfortunately there is no way to tell who is the murderer.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is a really good one in my opinion. However, there's one major problem: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The last 30 pages are interesting.   They take us into the head of a young girl who goes through an extremely painful, but successful, transition.  The plot is good for a short story but as for what's inside...   "The new girl"   - a book is a book, and it can be a very interesting one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about a man who gets a new job as a doctor in a small town and immediately starts treating a whole bunch of people who are in terrible shape. I would have preferred a little more information about why he does what he does, but I can only imagine that's the author's way of telling the story.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author really did a lousy job with the prose and did not seem to get it all.    I found it very confusing and there are things I do not understand about how the human body works.  I have no problem with a man's body getting "tough and gross" but what does that mean?   How did she get the man to vomit when she was pregnant? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a train wreck of poor writing, poorly explained mechanics, and questionable gameplay. The game is broken in every conceivable way. It feels like you're playing a bad, poorly designed puzzle, where every puzzle piece is designed to fail or work against you.   I bought the game thinking it would be fun to be a mechanic, but I'm not a big fan of the mechanical elements in the game.  As a puzzle game, I just couldn't get into it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's hard to believe that people continue to read books that are so bad they can't even use the word "bullshit".   I bought it after reading a review by a smart-aleck who called it "one of the best books ever written".  He should have used the word in conjunction with "the best book ever written" instead of "ever". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    One of the most irritating parts of this book were the numerous references to the book "The Hobbit" which I have never read...   It does not matter that the Tolkien books are more accurate.. the author is writing about a fantasy novel written in an imaginary world which is far more inaccurate..
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The problem I had with the book   was a lot of it was written in the first person and not in a third person.   I had read a lot about the subject.  I went online  and found a lot  of info that could be a lot better  if they would write in third person   but  I am in a hurry   so I have to read it   the first time   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While I liked the title and the cover, the book was awful. I can't find a way to get to a good place in a book and this one felt so forced.   The characters were unlikable.  Â  The language was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a book about a terrible movie.   I can say that this is one of the best bad movies I have ever seen.  I was never able to sit down and watch it when it first came out.  It was always one of those "don't do that in a movie theater" kind of movies.  This one is just too much fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â The ending was abrupt and not a particularly satisfying ending to a book that is otherwise excellent.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am giving this book 3 stars because I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fun, fast read.   However, the story is a little too short.  After the first 50 pages I stopped reading.  I had already read the first three books in the series but they just didn't interest me as much anymore.  The rest of the story seemed pointless as it was already in the book.  It is a fast read, but it is too short for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While there's a lot of good in this book, the parts that don't make sense are the ones where the author is trying to connect everything in this crazy universe. As if it weren't bad enough that we need a book to tell us what's going on, it's even worse that the author isn't even a little bit competent in the field. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read a lot, but the only books I read recently were in high school   That's because I'm in college now and haven't been in college in a while   If I read more than 3 books in a year, I know it's not because I want to   But I read the synopsis for this book, and I couldn't figure out why I was interested   (The title doesn't exactly tell me what the book is about)   Wasn't that the first time I heard about it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I purchased the first two books in the series.   It is the first book in the trilogy and was very exciting.  I am disappointed because the characters seem so far from real life characters and the plot is so slow and boring.  The author has been kind of inconsistent in the writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book, and then looked it up a few years ago when I found out it was a remake of a film, and thought the book was good. This book is not.   If you enjoyed The Sixth Sense or the original, you might enjoy it, but you won't enjoy it very much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was so excited to pick up this book!   The characters were so likable, and the plot kept moving forward, but it was hard to get into.   My favorite character, the one who was supposed to be the most fun to read about, turned out to be less fun than I thought she would be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is all about sex (and lots and lots of other things too) and it's all about women and how they're bad at it.  There is nothing interesting about the book itself.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have heard the reviews about this book, and I agree with them. It was difficult to get through.   It was a tough read and at times was very hard to listen to. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book because it is the only book about the history of the American Revolution.  It is an excellent book but there are numerous omissions in the text.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not a huge fan of this book. I know that my dislike of the book stems mostly from its treatment of sexuality.   The sex scenes are not always hot but they are not just gross sexual encounters either.  What bothers me most about the sex scenes is that they are very tame and non sexual.  Instead they take place in a motel, in a car with no windows, in the middle of the night.  Sometimes sex with a guy is a really good thing.  But the way these sex scenes occur in this book is almost as bad.  It seems that the writers thought it was ok to have a guy fuck a girl in the motel room but when they got into the car and had sex it became a non sexual encounter. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the most boring book   In the beginning, I was a little disappointed   But after reading it a few times  .. not sure I'll like it anymore 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While I enjoyed reading this book I don't think I ever got the full story. A little too much of a drama.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a great book, but I can't read it because my eyes are tearing up!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just finished this book (on the first night i read it) and i can't stand it. The plot is a bit like a bad romance that just goes on and on and it's a terrible way to start a book. I am so sad to see this book go.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a good read, but you're not going to like it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't understand how anyone can love a book that is not about them.   My grandfather always said that "a person doesn't realize how lucky he is until he doesn't have to work."   It is a shame that most of the stories in this book were not about me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think the narrator is being overly dramatic to make the story sound more exciting.   While the plot is interesting and engaging, the book is pretty slow for this type of story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book sucks   It starts off great and builds to a great end   However it is very easy to follow   the ending is what you want it to be   but it is not the way you would expect
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The premise and structure of this book are perfect:  They've all got their own personalities and quirks.   It's a great mix of characters, although the book does a good job of making the relationships between them stand out.  As for the plot...   There's not much there in the way of action.  It sort of is a series of incidents: a young girl disappears.  The police try to find her and find her dead.  A good detective is assigned, and finds the missing girl's diary.  Then there's an interesting murder:  The man who was murdered had a strange, almost demonic looking, face that was used to look at the sun.  Eventually, she realizes that her diary had a picture in it of her boyfriend who had disappeared a few days before.  However, a series or supernatural occurrences are occurring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main character in this book is an abusive woman who will make her son do everything she tells him to.   This woman is manipulative, controlling, and does not value any life except her own.  I am so ashamed of how I was treated by this woman. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    After reading this book I had a hard time thinking of anything but the most derogatory things.   In the end I couldn't find any positive comments about this book at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In all the years that I've been looking at the cover, I've never been able to work up the courage to try to buy it.   It's a shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book for my daughter, who is a huge fan of horror and is really into vampires and stuff.   She loved this book, even though it wasn't exactly what she was looking for.  I did like the premise and that's the main thing I liked about it.  It's basically about a mother who moves to a rural area and tries to raise her children to be honest and just, when all the others have it easy, she doesn't get it. It made me laugh out loud though. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The characters are all very dull and not very interesting. The author really doesn't know how to handle her characters, which is unfortunate because I wanted to like her characters. I'm glad I didn't read this before I was a teenager, because it's pretty gross to imagine myself being a 14-year-old girl and not being able to masturbate in the shower with any regularity. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book on an impulse, but it's a terrible book.   The characters are all stereotypes, and are totally unlikable.  The book was a complete disaster.  I'm a fan of fantasy, and I don't get why anyone would want to read a book about a female lead. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for a book on how to be a good leader and found it by chance. It seems that no matter how bad you have been, how bad things have gotten, or how terrible a person you are, a leader can still turn it around. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While reading this book I came across an interesting piece of information: The number of "white collar" jobs in this country has decreased by about 25 percent in the past fifteen years. The majority of the jobs that were once white collar (lawyers, doctors, engineers etc) have gone to women, and less educated people (high school dropouts, etc).   I never imagined that to be true, but since we have had a women president and a woman in the senate, I feel that women have come to dominate the white collar professions.   For the record:  I am not going to write a "whitewashing" piece about a book.  I know that I am taking away very different ideas from the book, and they are both valid, but I do not believe that I will be reading a book with this title anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book and when I got it, I realized that it is so bad it has to be a joke. The author is trying so hard to be funny. He can't do it.   "Sleeping on a train?"   Is this a joke that only the person who wrote this is in on?   They say:  "If you can dream it, you can do it!"   Well,   dreaming can be fun and it can be a challenge, but it is not the same as doing it. No one ever says: Â "If Â I can dream Â it, then it's possible for Â me to do Â that."   It is always: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The idea behind the book is interesting, but the book was a failure. The author tries to be a literary scholar, but her understanding of literary history is lacking. It's difficult to read because her understanding is a little loose, and when she tries to come up with a conclusion, the ideas don't come together.   In all fairness, I'm not sure if she was too busy or not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The cover   says "It is about the   Great Depression   Depression of the 19th Century   "   It doesn't say anything about the First World War   and the Second   War 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not excited about reading this book. I was expecting a book about a woman who was a Christian prophet and who wrote a book with advice to other women about how to have babies.   Instead of a female perspective in a story about women, the male POV is what is shown.  So I was disappointed when I started reading this story.  The story line is very predictable and very clichÃ©.  Even after having read so many female pregnancy stories, I was still annoyed that a story that I've read hundreds of times is used.  I know that people are different and I know I am not the average person who is pregnant and decides to get an abortion.  But to put it in another way... It would have been much more interesting if there was a female character.  This book would have benefited from a female point of view. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a fun story, but it just doesn't hold up when you get to the end.   This book is a complete farce.  It's full of all the right stuff, the right facts, and the right conclusions, but at the end of the day, it's just a farce:  The characters are completely inconsistent  It doesn't tell a good story (for me anyway)  It fails to connect to anyone in the story (not only the main character, but also her children)  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in the mid 90's, and it was horrible.   The main character had a character flaw called "Stubbornness".   It's not that the character is stupid, but that the only way to win at anything is to be stupid.  It was so prevalent in this book that I stopped caring about a lot of things. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I liked this one a lot, but that's about it.   Â  That's all.  I don't know why this one was such a hit,  but I'm hoping for a sequel with some good parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't really enjoy this book.   It's very slow and it really didn't make a lot of sense.  And it took about a week to get to about where it was meant to go. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book starts with some amazing, and totally unexpected, discoveries (from where I thought they would not come). I did not expect that.   Then, at the end, the author tries to put everything back to normal, with a totally predictable ending that had me wondering what all this was about.  I am really disappointed with this book!
Write a negative review about a bad book:    So this book was a huge disappointment.   First of all, the author wrote about three different people with the same name.  If she really was researching, she would have found one with different names.  The other thing is that she claims that some people with "high intelligence" have had trouble reading the Bible.  This makes no sense, since you can show that people with high IQs don't read at all.  There are many documented examples where people who have higher IQs have trouble understanding Scripture.  I suppose some of these people are just hard of hearing?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a disappointment. The book tells the story of "Babu" who is an old friend of Mavada's and the narrator has some interesting things to say about Mavida and the Maharavada in the past. But the problem is the author doesn't follow the story in any way. At one point the Maharaja visits Mavda's house to see what is going on with "Babi". Mavadeva gives him a huge diamond he found in his treasure chest. He puts it in his pocket and goes on his way. Babu is taken aback at seeing that huge piece of treasure, he is even more shocked to see that it was actually a piece of silver. I can imagine that the book would have been a great success had the Maharajah, Babu, and Mavma been friends, rather than adversaries, like the Maharaji mentioned in the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing was awful, but it is hard to criticize a book that is bad.   As stated by the author in the back of the book, he is a former child actor, but I would not put any stock in this.  As a child actor myself,  this is the only reason I will ever read the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The main characters are all in love with each other and all want a piece of each other but it's mostly just them trying to get each other to open up about the   -the  , which is a bummer because   they never do.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book does nothing to address any of the issues I have with the LDS church.   It tries to explain why the Book of Abraham was not translated correctly.  But in doing so, it is using a very poor translation  as a way to prove the translation was correct.  It also claims that Joseph did not understand the Egyptian language.  They both seem to be pointing the finger at Joseph as being guilty. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author claims to have researched his book "for years and years".   There is no mention in this book of this "research".  The information is found in the internet and in the book: a) The military intelligence was responsible for many of the false stories about the Gulf of Tonkin incident; b) the U.S. Army had a "Black Bag Operation" which would allow them to commit acts of terrorism on American soldiers; c) the CIA (the organization which is now the "Evil Empire") was involved in these activities and is still doing it today; d) the FBI has been involved in numerous acts of terror on American citizens; e) The Pentagon (a non-profit, nonprofit corporation) is a branch of the military.   "This is the greatest fraud perpetrated by the US Government to date," the book reads. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I think this book is one of the worst written books I have read in a long time.   The plot, I must say, is not the most original:  Â  "He found that it was not the end of his troubles. It was just the beginning".   Why was he troubled?   He was unhappy with his job and the people he was working with. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The last part, when the kids decide to leave town, is the most pointless and predictable part of the whole book.  It really only adds to the problem the novel started off with.  The only real good bit is the way the kids make it out of the woods and into the town (and the creepy people on the road) and it's a great ending to a great story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book.   I have just finished this book which is really a collection of some of the worst ideas that I have heard or read about how to train dogs.  One of the problems is that many people try to train their dogs in the same way that the dogs in this book use their noses.  A person can tell if a dog is trained by just the scent of a person,   a person smells the dog and   the dog goes on about the same things as a person.  It is   simply a bad way of training a dog   and one of the other   things the dog trainer has to keep in mind is the   nose is 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book.   The story is just a bad read. Â The author is so ignorant about women in history and the world in which she lives   It's an awful book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you read the blurb, you may think you are in for an interesting romp through the world of science fiction and fantasy novels by science fiction authors.   But you are wrong, the book is so filled with a lot of the same recycled clichï¿½ that it is hard to take it seriously.  One of the most annoying aspects is the constant use of the word ï¿½cosyï¿½ or ï¿½mimicalï¿½ in the descriptions.  I'm not a huge fan of science fictions but this book really is too close to being a cliche. Â The story is very well-paced, although I thought the ï¿½unreliable narratorï¿½ was a bit too convenient for such a dramatic scenario.  This book is also full of typos,  but they are not as frequent as in the blurbed blurbs.  Posted by Ann at 8:43 AM
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was the first book I have ever given four stars to   However   The plot is a little flat for me.    They get the first six chapters all to themselves with the other 6 chapters taking up 90%   of the remaining time.   It seems they can't get the plot out of their system. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a shame, but one could feel that they were really interested in their story (and in this review, I don't mean what it says about my book, but the way it was structured, the way that it's written, etc.).   But one has to ask the question: is the story good or is the plot bad   
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I started reading this book with no expectations of what I'd find.   For a book in a genre which is usually very difficult to get right, the writing was excellent.  The narration, for the most part, was good.  But  I didn't have any expectations about the storyline.  In the beginning,Â  I found myself thinking, "is this book even aboutÂ  The Fall of Man?"  I found it too confusing to be about one of the most interesting topics in human history.  After the first 100 pages or so, I really was feeling like I needed to go back and read the original story.  This book, then, might have been so good because of what it didn't include:  The Fall   is the most famous story in all of human history and it has never been properly explained.  As a result, many of the details are lost to history, and those that remain have been distorted to fit a particular story. Â    It is not the story of the Fall, but rather the story about how the fall happened.  It has some interesting aspects, but there are also a lot of flaws, especially in the way it was written. Â  I'd recommend reading the original stories in order to appreciate it, but not to make a book about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    While the premise of this book is interesting, it's really hard to get interested in it because the writing style is so clumsy and the story is so one-dimensional and clichÃ©.   If you are an author that wants to write a sci-fi romance novel about a teenage boy that finds love and can't get any, you have to know how to do it right.  I guess you can get away with a bit of lame writing, but not in a book that's supposed to be about the power of love! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had a great deal of fun with this book.   It has more or less the same concept, a young man who is a bit too in touch with what he wants out of life (read as: not in touch) meets a girl and has a few flings with her, and that's about it.  But the real fun comes when he's in an airport with the young lady after his wife leaves him.  They have a good time, and when she's about to go, she asks if he has any other good ideas that he might have.  (This would have made the book great, but I didn't see it. I thought the author might have given him the idea.)   The book ended with this, so I guess he has no idea what his future is.  My favorite part is when the young man and the woman get in a taxi together and he asks her how she got his number.  It's almost as if he's thinking, "I could have had that." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was just about the end of this saga - that it would be over, then go on with some other characters.   Wrong.  The books that started this entire saga ended up being the weakest parts of the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My expectations for this book were very high.   The first chapter sets the stage for a good story that seems to move very fast.  In the second chapter  a   the   bad   Â    it   s   to   be   an   m   of   poor.   This   is a  toÂ  Â bad  Â and   seems   going to  Â  to Â somewhere  .  In all   there   may   like.  This is   a great   book   that  seems to  need   more   attention .
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a terrible book. The main character is a total fucktard who thinks she is better than everybody else, and even the main character's best friend is a dick (which is why I loved the book so much). The author even calls his girlfriend a dick, which is bad enough. But then the author makes a terrible mistake in his own novel, "The Little Prince." When I read it back in high school I was so pissed off. So, when I was offered this book I was all like, "oh well, guess my high school years were worth it." It was bad. But as a child, I was able to get through it because it wasn't a great novel, but a good story.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My copy is defective.   There is a small sticker on the back cover that says  "This book was published by Thomas Pynchon."   When I opened it I saw that it wasn't published by Pynchinon, it was   published by Gosh.  I was very disappointed  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is not a lot of information about the history of black women in the church. It is interesting to know that the priesthood restriction is still in effect. It's interesting that the First Presidency has an all black council. It seems like a strange place to get help. It makes it seem like a cult, but then it is only a cult if you buy into the cult's belief system.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First of all, I hate being called a "Sissy" on the internet.  I know that the internet is where Sissies get their name.   However, in this book the main characters don't act like Sissys.  The main character is a normal girl, and as an "old woman" she knows what to do.  If you are one of those Sissy's that think it's the sissies fault the men aren't taking advantage of the old women anymore, then you will hate this book.  They say in the book that we are all Sisses and that all of us were once sissys, and that makes me want to do a little research to prove to people that I am not a sissy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is about a man with bipolar disorder who goes through a mental breakdown, but the story is really poor.  He has multiple personalities, but we never really get a feel for them.  (He just appears to be in a manic state.  It makes his breakdown seem worse.)  (It is only his first time in a mental ward, so we just assume it is his first in his life, but I'm not buying it.)   (There is some good dialogue in the book, but some of it is repeated so often that I don't even know what it is supposed to mean.) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In this book, it's made clear how much I don't care about this series.  The book doesn't really help, either.  It is a very basic adventure story, telling the story of two characters on a magical journey.  There are the "great" moments, where things go well, and there are the terrible "bad" moments.  I found that I had read every book in the series before this one.  This book did not impress me in any way.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    An awful book.   I was very intrigued to see how this story would play out.  I knew that there was more to this story than what was revealed in this book. Â    The book didn't do justice to the character of Peter; it's easy to feel sympathy for a guy who is desperate to get on in life.  However, he had a terrible past.  He's made a lot of bad decisions in life and I can't think of any instance where he took care of others. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is terrible.   It starts off good.  It is a very good example of how the author tries to make a point about the way society treats homosexuals by writing a story about a man who goes to a party and meets a gay couple, which ends up making him a hypocrite.  The story is also about a woman who has a "fag" as her boyfriend and who finds a new one.  And then it turns into a story of a woman's boyfriend and how he has sex with a woman, who is not gay.  Finally, it was a story where a woman was married to a man in which it was made clear she was a whore and that this was her "dream" for a husband.  So, I was disappointed because the message of the book was a good one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The worst book I've ever read.   This is the second book by a British author that I've read. I think I might be slightly more forgiving because I read the first in an online magazine while visiting England and didn't realize I had missed the book entirely, only to realize about a week later and realize how badly I had been let down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought the "What's Next: The Year in Video Games" book because I was curious about how much has changed since the original "Year in Video Game" book was published in 2006.   It is, of course, a bit dated in terms of information, but that's to be expected when you first buy a book.  The only thing that I really didn't like about this book was the "samples" section, which consists of a single (single!) sample. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The story is just a load of crap   I think you are making a mistake by telling me this was a good book   Its not  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was excited to see the book and read a review in a bookstore, because I loved it so much in high school!   When I got the book in the mail today, however, I found a few problems:  *   The writing was really hard!  * Â   The ending of the book was so awkward that it felt forced.   My favorite parts of the story were the last two chapters of the novel, so that was pretty disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Â It's a great book about how to be a feminist in a patriarchal society that's completely screwed up their idea of feminism in the first place.   For a feminist this is a great read.  She doesn't take shit from anyone, but she does get things done in a pretty awesome way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was excited to read this book because I've been wanting to read a book about the great Depression because of the movie The Big Sleep.   The book was a bit better than I expected but a bit more dull than I hoped.   Even worse, the book itself is a waste of time.
