Write a positive review about a good book:   . The book was excellent - a first-rate contribution to the field of comparative history. It is a classic example of a study based on an ethnographic fieldwork.      I am very impressed with the scholarly approach and the quality of the writing, particularly of the chapters that deal with the period between 1900 and 1950. It was an amazing period, but the chapters are excellent and the coverage of the subject is deep and detailed.  I really liked this book.  It is not so much a study of the period under review, but rather a description of the ethnographic method used to write a detailed history of the German Democratic Republic, in which the author takes a close look at the history of German-speaking East Germany between 1900-1950, in particular the events of the post-war years in Czechoslovakia. This is not a strictly academic book: it can be used to make a point or to explore some aspect of the history.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is an excellent introduction to the practice of meditation.   By focusing on the practice, the author describes how one might approach the practice on an individual basis and also shows how the techniques may be used in a group setting, such as a retreat or a group meditation class.    This is a concise and informative book.  Read it in a week:  http://www.booksluts.com/review/focuses-on-the-practice/ This book focuses on the practices of sitting meditation in the Tibetan tradition.  The practice of sitting with your back supported is what most people who practice sitting meditation are familiar with, as it is the primary method used in Tibetan Buddhism, and is often taught in meditation groups.  This is an introductory book and it is written for new meditators.  Overall, the text is concise and easy to read, and it does a very good job of presenting the practice.  There is a good amount of useful information provided in this book, and the techniques are easy to practice and understand.  It is a great introduction to Tibetan meditation practices and this would be an excellent book for a beginner. Read this book in a few days:  http://www2.tldp.org/LDS/docs/books/Tibetan_Sitting_Meditation.pdf In the article 'Sitting Meditation in the American West, 1845-1898' ( http://religion.jstor.org/?p=244099 ), the author, William W. Tylman explains how Tibetan monks and nuns in America in the 1840s were using a simple method of meditation to calm themselves during severe storms and when dealing with severe illness.  In the late 1800s, the practice was adopted by many American Zen Buddhist monasteries and many laypeople adopted the technique.  Tylmann gives many descriptions of Tibetan monasterys and nuns practicing sitting meditation and discusses the history of the practice in the United States.  In this book the techniques presented are presented in the most simple and easy-to-perform manner possible, and all of the techniques were taught in the monastery, not in a school setting.  If you are interested in Buddhism but not quite sure where to begin, this is an ideal place to start.  http:  http://thereligionist.blogspot.com   In the early 1990s, a

The author has researched the matter thoroughly and his writing is easy to follow and engaging. I would recommend this book to those who have a love for history, or are interested in the topic and the personalities involved in the process. The subject of American slavery is one of the more complex areas in American history and the author does an excellent job of drawing his readers into the situation."

Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished The Giver, which I have been waiting forever for. It's a very good book in a very deep way, but it was difficult to get past the "fuzzy" ending. It was almost as if my main character (named "Sara") wasn't really "real" as a person. This is not a book that you read expecting a happy ending. This book is much deeper than that. It is a book about the importance of love and the importance to be a good person. It tells a very moving story about what you do for the other person, how your actions affect others, and how your character will change as you grow older and become a parent. This was a great book to read for the whole family and to teach them about the "great" people in their life.   I loved The Givers by Lois Lowry. This "furry" book has the same effect on me that The Big Lebowski does on me. There is the weirdness, the beauty, and the mystery. It makes it hard to put down. I loved how it was a "young adult" book as opposed to a "adult" book and how it could be used to get the younger kids interested in animal care. It would also be very appropriate to use it as a teaching tool at school, in conjunction with the other animals in the classroom.   Read an excellent review for the author:  I love this book, it really got me thinking, and I loved the characters and the storyline. I had so much fun, I could have re-read it and never stop. I am in love with the author, this is one of my favorite books of all time. I highly recommend this book to all ages and all types of readers. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I liked this book very much. The pacing is nice. There was a bit of a learning curve, but that's pretty normal. I really enjoyed the story. I'm not sure how anyone who's read this would react to it, but for me, it was a very fun ride. The ending was surprising and I did not expect it. A little surprising.
Write a positive review about a good book:   So many of the books I have reviewed are about "real" books, but the ones here are actually about life as a teen. And I do think that life as teen is much better than life as child.   You just have to get to know the things that are important to you.  My favorite is The Dark Heart of Summer:   What It's Like to Be an Adult Child.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm still reeling from the sheer awesomeness of this story. I've loved Harry Potter since I was six and I was already reading the later books when I got the chance to read this one. The last Harry Potter book I read (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, I read it for the first time when I was twelve and still think it's one of the best stories I've read) was the absolute best book ever. This story is better than that book and more than likely better than all of the books in the series put together. I absolutely loved it. I can't say this book would've been as good as the Death books (although it might've been), but it's close enough. It's still good and I loved it like I'm about to love a new boyfriend.   "You know what this means, I'm a ghost"   "Yes. Yes you are. And you're not real" I never thought I'd find myself reading a story that could beat the ending of Harry Potter and this book is just that good. It was one of my favorite books last year and I'm thrilled to say that I still think of this book as one of its favorites. I don't want to be a ghost or anything, but Harry Potter has been the first story that makes me want to get up in the middle of the night just to listen to it. You won't be disappointed if you read this book.  It's been a while since I read a book that's made me feel this way. I never expected the ending to be this good, but it sure was and it was really good at that. I could've written a long review about how much I liked this book and what a great book it is, but instead I'll say that Harry Potter makes an excellent bed. I recommend it highly to everyone and I hope that you'll go on a magical ride with Harry Potter, Harry Potter's ghost, and the rest of the Harry Potter books.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It's so interesting! A great work of scholarship. I highly recommend the book. "   I have just read the book, and have found it very interesting. I am very grateful for this book, as it will open my eyes to many facets of the Christian religion. I think that many non-Christians may have a hard time believing in a God who is this loving and merciful to the animals, who does not punish a sinful humanity without mercy, and who will surely save us all. My husband and I have already read through several chapters, and we feel that the book is a bit superficial and does not go very far in exploring many other aspects of Christianity and its theology. However, I hope that a few of the topics will be covered in later chapters of the book in more depth. I also hope that the author's personal testimony will open up a door for those who want to know more about Christian doctrine on the animal kingdom. Thanks for this, and keep it up! "
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love to read and listen to books. I love to share my knowledge with others. I want others to feel like they belong here.    - JB, The United States of America "This is the greatest book written about men."   For the past eight years I've been searching for the best novel I can get my hands on.  To this end I have read books like "The Wolf in White Van" "The Giver" and "The War of the Worlds"   I always say to myself when I find something good I should give it a try.  Unfortunately, my luck wasn't good this time.  In the beginning I thought I'd give it three stars because it didn't really give me a reason to stay.  As it is I'm at a loss.  - John F., New York City, New York, USA "The best novel about men and the way we think."  "It's like a good science fiction novel but with a men's perspective. It's not a science fiction romance, but it's a romantic novel about love. I'm sorry, but I just don't get it."  - Joe, New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has the potential to change my life. I am currently a nursing student and would like to be a certified health information manager. In addition to being a nursing major, I love to read and my professors told us to read as much as possible. My professors encouraged me to try to read more for my nursing degree.   I love this book because it includes so many great resources to help with my nursing goals. I feel like the author of this book has read all the nursing journals and articles to learn how to effectively teach nursing students the basics. She also explains in detail how the profession works and how she will change the way health professionals view the nursing profession.  This book was very easy to read, but not as easy to comprehend. Many times I felt lost and confused. I would also suggest reading this book with a nursing or nursing educator before reading any of the tips.  I liked the tip on being positive as well as the other tips that can be taken to the next level.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I am not normally a fan of fiction, but my boyfriend picked up and read this book and is now a devoted reader. The story is told through the eyes of a boy named Zia, a boy who is afraid of his father and mother, who neglect him, and who is constantly in trouble. Zia's mother was killed when he was an infant by his father when he got into a fight over a girl. ZIA tries to kill himself, but is rescued by his best friend, a girl named Saira. The two become best friends and the rest of the story is that of friendship, love, and growing up. This book is a book that is not for everyone, but it is well written and it is filled with emotions.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this story. I have not been able to read a good horror story since I had to put a book down because the protagonist kept saying "Oh, my God" as he fell to his death from the roof of a skyscraper. I didn't really like this particular story. It seemed like a random plot point that took place in a mall, and then was quickly forgotten. The only reason I can give it a rating other than a two was that I did like the plot twists. It is interesting. And it is a good way to end a book.   I got a free copy of this book from a Goodreads group.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book to be a bit too slow and a bit dull. There were a few good ideas here and there, but it didn't quite come together well.   This story contains a good deal of fantasy elements as it relates to a world where time is a dimension that is more or less stable, the only real constant being that time does not pass in a linear fashion. As a consequence, time can be manipulated. This is somewhat similar to the concept of astrology in which a few simple events can alter the course of a person's life in a number of ways. This world is set in a region known as the North, where the time dimension has been frozen into a near absolute state for centuries. The region has a lot of rain and snow in winter, and summers have a lot more sun than in most places. The North is also an area of constant conflict, with many nations at war and vying for territory. The conflict has led to the region being on the brink of collapse, but the constant war has made it the largest exporter of swords in the North.  There are no magic users here, but this doesn't mean that there are no fantasy elements in this story. The characters have the typical human traits, but they have their own set of skills and abilities that enable them to succeed in their goals. For example, Mabel has her magical powers, and she uses her magic to fight dragons in the form of humans. Mabel is a pretty interesting character who is not always the most reliable, but she's a determined character who does whatever it takes to achieve her goal. Her skills are not perfect, however, and occasionally they go awry. The world is presented in a manner that is consistent with most fantasy settings. The city and the countryside are shown to have a distinct appearance, and the city is depicted with a number unique buildings.  The art in this book is pretty good, although there are a few scenes in which the action is quite slow. The artwork is not the best, but is still reasonably good for the length of the story.  I'm not a big fan of art with dragons, but I've always enjoyed the artwork in this series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    To the people who bought this book and said:  "It has a lot of good writing but it does not have enough of a plot."   My response:  The reason it has too much plot is because it has no plot.   The story follows the main character as she comes to terms with her sexuality, and comes to the realization that there are aspects of her sexuality that she is simply not comfortable with, but that it's her right to live her life without those things.  I could give a lot more details, but the point is that the story is simple.   The characters are simple.  The writing is simple.  The only real reason to read this is if you are a fan of the book.  You might be disappointed.  "I have come to the conclusion that I am attracted to women of my own gender.  My sexual orientation has never been a big deal to me.  And I am completely happy to remain an out gay man.  As an adult, I have chosen to pursue this passion rather than pursue a career in a profession where there is a large amount of stigma surrounding homosexuality."

Write a positive review about a good book:    The idea is wonderful and I am looking forward to reading it, but I am worried that the final work is going to be lacking: It is too long for me. I'm guessing it is intended to be the complete story, but for me this seems to be much more of a novel than that.   I like the idea but not the execution: There is a problem with the writing, there is a lot of repetition and too much repetition at that. The only things I like is the end of the book when it was hinted that something was afoot with the last pages but it is not elaborated further on in the story.  I would recommend it to anyone, it is a good start to a series.
Write a positive review about a good book:     It's a nice story, but I have to be honest about something. I am very interested in science fiction stories, but the genre as a whole seems to be falling into a bit of a rut at the moment, especially on the mainstream, mainstream channels. The book is definitely science fiction, but it's hard for me to see where the story takes us. I've read a lot of science fiction in my day, and have yet to see a story that I would go see again. I think this book has a great concept, but my only real issue with it is that it takes us out of the world of the book and puts us into our own. This book may be a great idea in theory, but in execution, it was not quite working for me.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. It is a story about a boy who is tormented by a strange child named "Sam" who does not understand his own world, but seems to be a little bit more sane than normal. Sam is a character who was created by a doctor named Dr. Llewellyn who had been a patient of Dr. John S. L. Clark and who was later found in a house by a man in Kansas who was visiting a friend. The man found the boy with his head in a bottle in the cellar and left him there for two days before calling the local police. When the police found Sam's head, they noticed he did not have a head like a normal person, and he was completely black except for a few patches of light green and yellow. Sam was found and taken to Dr. Clark. As Dr. Robert Ritchie notes in his book, this doctor was not a physician, but was more like a mad scientist. He was obsessed with "the perfect" man, a man who was like a mirror image of his patient but who is not "the man." In many ways, the doctor was Dr. Frankenstein, he wanted to make a perfect man by making a perfect "soul" out of the patient. While in the process of doing this, the body of the "perfect man" was killed by a mad doctor who used a powerful and deadly drug to turn the man's flesh into flesh. Dr. Ritchie reports that this was a horrible tragedy for Sam, the boy did not see it that way and later on, after his "perfect soul" died, he became obsessed with finding a new "soulless soul." After a number of years, Sam became the head of a small orphanage called "Little Children's Home for Boys" in a small town called Stowe, Iowa. There, he could be the center of attention and the favorite of the children. Sam's life is as interesting as his life at the orphanage. He is a very happy boy and likes to do well in his classes. Sam finds a teacher by the name of Mrs. Bumgarner who is a strong lady with a strong work ethic who is hard on the boys. One day Mrs. Riggs, the teacher's daughter, comes to Stowe and brings with her a friend of hers, a woman by the names of Mrs Williams. Sam has the "girls" over for a party. Mrs. Williams gives Sam
Write a positive review about a good book:    (I'm sure this will annoy some of you out there)   It's one of my favorite books of the year so far.   So good!   I had the entire series on the Kindle edition.  My husband and I are trying to finish the first one.  I am in the middle of another book and had to go back to read that one to finish my reading list. I don't know what my husband thinks of this series, but I sure think it is awesome.   Rated 4 out of 5 by cg from Good books, not as good as I'd like To me this series is all about the world war, but there are other, far less realistic things going on that make the world seem more real and frightening than it really is. The world is very well detailed, and I have no problem with how much detail was devoted to it. As a world-building series, I think this series has potential for a much, much better world. For now though, this series had me more than a little excited for the next book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a good read for a variety of people. I had some friends that were in college that were a little unsure about this and thought it was a bad book. They then asked me if I thought they should read it but I didn't know if they would find it enjoyable. As they found out I read it and gave them some recommendations. The only other negative thing I would say about this book is the name. If it was called something else or if the author changed the name they made it a good one.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm excited about this book. I've always wanted to read a book about how to do a lot of things very easily (and not in a way that is less likely to work) - and this book is a big step towards that. The book begins with the author's childhood experiences. In the book, he is in a state of "puppy-hood" - living under an abusive household, and working to keep it from happening again. But by the end of the book he is a successful entrepreneur, running a successful business. It's a very good book, well written, full of useful tips. I'd recommend this to anyone who has trouble learning to do simple things, and is looking for a good (and simple!) book to help them learn.

Write a positive review about a good book:   .   -   Review the book!   If you like the book you like it the more reviews the better and you might even get some freebies if they are not too bad.   There is no hard and fast rules but I recommend at least two. One you should read the first 10 to 12 pages of the book and the other you should finish the book. If you find yourself getting very frustrated because there is so much of what you don't like in this book or you don the end because you are just getting angry and want to leave the site you have a habit of finishing books and finding out why they are good and bad so that you know you should go back and read them all.  I read your review and I have a question. The first few chapters do a great job of introducing us to the main characters and what the world looks like and I really enjoyed the book but the last few chapters just made me very sad. I felt that the author tried to have too much going on and I just felt like I wasn't getting any character development at all. It took me until the end to get that one character's back story in it. I really loved the world of the story and I don't think I would have enjoyed the story if there weren't so many side characters that kept it interesting.  - - - Don't be surprised if the author starts to introduce your main characters but doesn't tell you their back story until much later.  It's okay for your main character's to get a few chapters of back story before they get their big moment but if they don't then it just becomes very confusing.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have not read a book quite like this, and I enjoyed it greatly. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a great story and a good plot. I enjoyed both the book and the movie, especially the movie.  I liked the book best. I also liked the movie best. The movie is better because it is set in a time period different from the book. In the book, John Winchester is just an average man who has a family and a job. In this film, he is a cold-hearted killer. The film is also more realistic in some parts, especially if you are familiar with the book but haven't seen the film.

The writing style is like a mixture of the "traditional" detective story and the "sci-fi" in the best way.  My only complaint is that there is a big, black hole between the last couple of chapters.  I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to any avid reader of horror.      My favorite characters are all new characters, but all have a solid background that will keep you engaged through the whole book.  Overall, I enjoyed this book as much as I did the book that preceded it.

The author did a great job of exploring the war and the characters in great detail. It was not easy to connect with this book because many of the characters are so flat, but when you do, it makes the book so much better. The war was very well written, and the book does not shy away from portraying the horrors of the war with great details. This book is definitely one of my favorites.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a great book, and a little scary.   What was a real challenge for me was to go from a "well, I guess that is my first vampire novel" to a "Wow, this one took a lot of work!"   I hope that the sequels are better. 
Write a positive review about a good book:     "My love of the language is so strong that I found myself thinking about language just by reading it - how it affects us, how it shapes our lives, how, by trying to describe it, we find our way to the mysterious inner world of the soul.   As it happens I've just finished the book and I'm loving it. I think I might try to read the other books in the series next."
Write a positive review about a good book:    The author has a good grasp of what needs to be in the text, and he makes sure to give the reader all the information he/she needs. If you're in search of a good introduction to modern science, this should fit the bill. If science hasn't been taught this way before, you'll probably enjoy it, too.
Write a positive review about a good book:   ... It was a great read, and i will definately pick it up again! I think it might be the only book that actually makes you think a bit about the way people feel about their gender. Not everyone is so willing to accept a gay character, for example. I did learn a lot from this, and it will definitely make me think about some of the ways i have behaved in the past with people that i know are not like me. Thanks to this book, i may be able to look at other peoples behavior differently, without it feeling like the whole thing is a personal attack.      "They know what they can do." —Toby Keith, "One Shot in a Gunfight" "If this is a metaphor, it's for all of us. I think our brains aren't built to handle so much, and I think if you're a boy and you're getting picked on a little more, your response is to fight back. And then it doesn't stop. It keeps happening." —Katherine Heigl, in the movie "Titanic"  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A beautiful, well-written book about a relationship. "The End of Faith," by John Gray, was recommended to me by a friend and I've finally read it. It's a beautiful and thought-provoking book about how science and religion can conflict and how both can be true at the same time. The story takes place in the mid-seventies in Northern California and it takes place at a university that has a very religious atmosphere. A physicist and a psychologist are working on a way to create a machine that can produce a human-like brain. They start with a few pieces of brain tissue from an adult woman that's been preserved in a jar. They also use a part of a brain tissue sample from a newborn baby. Then they start a series of experiments. When they've finished the experiments, they begin to see some signs that the machine is working. This starts an interesting debate about science and spirituality. Then the main characters have an argument about whether or not the science and the spirituality are true. The main character is against the science but eventually he believes and believes in the spirituality and the machine ends up being successful. I can't give the book a higher rating since I was not able to finish it in a timely manner. (I did finish it, but in a few weeks). I think the story is quite good, although the writing was a little rough at the beginning of the book.   [reviewed with Amazon] Read an earlier review of The End of God on amazon here.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have had this on my list for a while, but wanted to wait until after the Winter Holiday Holidays.   This is a good story with good characters and an interesting take on the subject of mental illness, a subject that often gets glossed over in the movies.  A few more examples:  "I'll be seeing the Wizard of Oz again."   "You know that you have the wrong number!"   A young man has a mental disorder that makes him feel like a zombie and that the best way to stop it is to go to a place with no one in it and no way to come back.  He is diagnosed with schizophrenia.  He and his mother move to a cabin in the woods.  As they are moving in they have a bad accident that he does not survive.  The next morning he is still in his psychotic states.  One night he hears his mother scream and he realizes he is in a dream.  Once he wakes up he realizes his mother has died.  How he survived is anybody's guess, but at the end of the book he manages to survive.    Another example:  The main character gets his wish and the rest of the world dies.  This has happened in the real world but it is handled in a way that is not terribly effective.  In this case the characters are trying to get out of a world that doesn't want them to live there, which is also done by the characters who are trying not to die.  But the author has no idea how to portray that in the novel.  For me the key to writing a good horror novel is to not have any knowledge of the real-life events that are being depicted.  That way you have a good sense of fear and also a lot of excitement about the story because you are interested in what will happen to the characters.  With this book I think the author did a great job with the characters, but the main idea of what is going to happen to them is not explained well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A book that can be recommended to a friend.   I'm very interested in the subject, and want to learn more about it.  As someone who has learned a great deal about these things from my parents, it's nice to have an adult to tell me how it really is.  A lot of people, though, won't read this because it is about drugs and not sex, which makes me wonder if the book really is about sex?   It's a very entertaining read.  The author's own drug addiction is well described in this story. The way the author explains that his first thought when his wife gave him the drug to numb his sex drive was to try to have sex with her.  This is a good portrayal of people like this: people who feel like they have no choice but to take drugs to try and make themselves feel better or to get pleasure in life.  The author also says that drug use is common amongst the gay community in this country, and this is one of the many reasons why this book is so interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you enjoy a book, you may enjoy the following book.   A book that is a bit of a mystery, this book has a great mystery theme. I don't want to ruin the mystery for you, but there are a few things that may help you get your money's worth:    The book does get a little more serious toward the end.    I think it would have been more interesting if he was a bit more open with the audience about what he was trying to do and why.  If you want more action, read something else. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    *   ^   **   *** ***   **** **  ****  **** *** ****  _____ ________  ____ _____  The story begins when our intrepid heroine, a recent graduate from a prestigious university, receives a summons to help a mysterious client. Once she gets to her office, she discovers a beautiful, ancient drawing of a beautiful young woman. But when the client asks for a specific piece of the drawing to be put into a hidden place that is in the trunk of her car, she is forced to use her wits to try to keep the drawing from falling into the wrong hands. This book is definitely for fans of YA fantasy. There is not a ton of world building, but the first half of the book is full of mystery and suspense with a good number of twists and turns. This is an enjoyable read, but there isn't much more to it after that. The second half of this book, which deals with the rest of the client's request, takes a bit of a turn for the worst. However, the author does her best to wrap things up in a satisfying way. However for an author who loves to write about supernatural beings, a lot of things don't seem to make much sense. For example, why is there a demon inside a human woman and why would he give her the drawing that he needs? The mystery is never quite solved, but some good twists and good characterization come in at the right time to keep things moving along.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really like this book. It's not a "good book" per se, but I definitely enjoy it. I've been searching for the right book for a long time (I read in the first grade in an anthology that was meant to be for children but that just wasn't quite right). I'm a writer and this book's written well enough to do a full story on it, so I'm really looking forward to that. I like it because it deals with a really big theme and it doesn't focus on a few characters or events. It presents the main characters and their problems and the consequences, so that's really nice to read and I think it'll be a nice book to keep around. I also like that it's fairly light and fun and not so much about what happens to the characters, though this does come up at some points and I don't want to get too carried away with that. Overall I'm very glad that I found this and I'm so excited to finish it.    5 of 5 stars  
Write a positive review about a good book:    You should read this book. The author has a clear understanding of the way he/she wants the story to turn out, and it is clear that this book does indeed turn out as such. He gives us the world in the form of a story (this isn't like an old fashioned mystery, but it does give some insight into the history of the world), then we are treated to a short tale, a "novel". It's a story of a person in his late teens, who is in the middle of a new job. He doesn't want to tell people he works with, so he hides from his friends, and spends most of the day at home. But then one day he decides to take a walk. The only problem is he is at the bottom of a canyon. His friend and guide sees him, and runs down to him. The guide takes him to a house where he gets some food and drinks. But he isn't quite as good as they thought he was, and his job doesn't exactly go well. He eventually gets his money and is able to get back to his friends. Then, after a few days, he decides he can't wait to get home. He gets a bike and tries to get as far away from the canyon as possible. But the bike isn't working that well, and there is a problem. A girl has died, and the guide has taken her body home to be buried, along with his bike, with a few other things. Now his friends are beginning to get upset about the dead girl, and he's getting worried. He comes across a book in a house with a lot of books. He takes one of the books and takes a look at it. It's the book that he saw in the canyon, but no one seems to have ever read it. He starts to read, and gets an idea.   The story is very well written, and we get a good look at the world the characters live in. It starts off a bit slow, but slowly builds to the point where the book is really fun to read. I really enjoyed the story, and didn't feel like I was left hanging, like I do a lot.  After the initial start, I really had no idea what was going to happen in the story. The events and characters are very well thought out, although the story is fairly light, at times. The way the story develops I definitely don't want any spoilers, but
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book for my 6 year old daughter (she's 6 and not so smart) as part of the birthday set she received as a present. This is a great book for older children and it gives the whole family an opportunity to talk about the day in school. A few comments: 1. The pictures in this book are beautiful! 2. The writing is great. 3. The teacher was very informative and helpful. 4. It's very well written!  I would recommend this book to my mom, brother, sister, nieces and nephews and friends. They are all reading it now and they are enjoying it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A friend of mine (who also has OCD and is not a writer) sent me this book to read and I couldn't put it down, so I took notes as I read.   The story was interesting, I learned a bit about OCD and the way OCD manifests itself in other areas of life. I recommend the book for anyone who suffers from OCD or is looking for an interesting and interesting book to try out.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "Handsome is the man who knows how to make you want more. He's witty and hilarious, and the most fun I have had in a while reading."   The most recent book I have read is " The Art of Flight " by Alan Lomax. I was not really sold on this book until I started reading it and began to discover a lot of interesting things I missed out on in previous books. This is a fun read to start reading. The stories are well written and well paced and the characters seem like they are real. This was also the first book I finished without having to pay money for it. I love that I don't have to pay anything to read a book I want to read, and I feel so privileged I can get a book like this without buying anything. I also like that I get to read this book before I read "The Art of War " by Sun Tzu (and "The Tao of Pooh" by A. A. Milne).

Write a positive review about a good book:    (2/2)   This is a very enjoyable and well-written novel. The narrative is richly researched and compelling. The author does an excellent job of creating suspense, while also providing a sense of intrigue. There's also a sense that many of the characters are not quite right.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It was an excellent book.   The story is gripping and interesting.  The author is very descriptive.  There are few bad endings and the story is consistent throughout.  An excellent read and a great start to this summer book series.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The writing in this book is good. It flows nicely from topic to topic, and the discussion of how different religions view themselves is clear, although I'm not sure I'd call it "flowing." But overall, the book is interesting, especially the religious-secular distinctions in the early 1900s.   (P.S. - the link to the book on Amazon goes to the paperback edition (which seems a bit more expensive than the Kindle version).  )

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a book about a girl with cerebral palsy that I had and loved. She is not perfect but she is a positive and interesting character. I loved her friendship with an older woman that was written well and was not a yandere like I thought it would be. This is my third book in this series and I loved it!
Write a positive review about a good book:     5 out of 5 stars YA, Romance, Paranormal! I LOVE THIS BOOK! The writing is top notch and it feels very authentic to the times it was written in. The character development is well done and there are a lot of moments of humor and adventure, that just adds to the book. I've enjoyed it a lot! Thanks, L. H.  4 out of 4 stars Great! I really enjoyed this book and I would totally recommend it. The writing was good and the story line was interesting. I liked how the book felt like it was set in the 60's, but still felt contemporary enough to feel fresh. As a fan of historical romance, it was a lot different from my usual fare, and made me think about historical novels of the period. The author, Lottie King, definitely went to town with her character development and writing style and this book had some really good parts. I definitely recommend this book!  3 out of 3 stars Bad writing, slow start My first read, and I enjoyed it. I was so excited to read this that I read it in one day - it wasn't until the first page I realized that this is definitely not the book for me. The first 2/3rds of the book was all good but by the time I got to the end I couldn't stand it. Not the type of thing I'd read if I didn't have kids to put down. It's like if someone took all the romance I liked in the 70's and 80's and dumped them in a blender with some bad coffee. The plot is just so bad it was not worth it. All the characters are completely flat, and the dialogue feels forced and awkward.  and there's one other thing - the book had a terrible cover. I bought this book because I read a lot about Lottieland, and one thing that stuck out to me was a part in which the protagonist talked about a love letter that was sent to her that was addressed to a house that used to belong to the owner's uncle. This is so completely wrong and a total misreading of what happened in the story. I'm not sure how the author found the idea, but it's so off that I really can't see how someone could ever use that kind of a sentence as a summary. ,  1 out of 1 stars I LOVED the book! I was looking forward to it, and when
Write a positive review about a good book:    Good!   I found this one easy and interesting, and the stories had real bite to them.   My favorite:  I loved   this book  !

Write a positive review about a good book:    I found the book enjoyable, but I did find the end to be somewhat unsatisfying.   The book has an overall theme that I don't understand, and it was hard to follow as I read the book and came to the conclusion that there was no overarching theme.  The characters were all so very different, and while they all had things they were going through, the events of the story weren't really affecting them until way too late in the story.  At least, I found it hard to imagine the characters being in this situation and still being able to do a good job.  It is hard to tell how it could have been resolved in a different way and made the story more interesting and satisfying.  I feel like there is a lot more to the story that has yet to be explained.  To be completely honest, I probably would have gotten more out of the book if I had read it before reading other fantasy books.  Overall, I really liked this book.  Recommended!
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book, The Power of the Game, is a must read book. The author is an old time hockey coach and is writing a book on hockey. I have been a hockey coach since 1979, in high school, college, and professional. The game is so much more than the way we play it, it is the way it impacts the game of life. I had been interested in this book because of the book by Bruce E. McCall and the book with Bill Cullen on the Power of Game. It seems like this book might contain a couple things that are different. There are some new ideas as well as good stuff in this. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed the book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The whole series, including  The Dragon in the Sea   (first book)    is a fantastic read.   This is the most fantastic adventure you will find, and I would strongly recommend reading all the books in one go.  3/5 stars
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you have read my other reviews, you have already seen that I love this book!   It is the perfect blend of good humor, suspense, action, romance, and action adventure!  The plot is so well written that I can easily imagine the movie, the book, or the TV series.  I just hope it is adapted into a movie!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    You don't have to be a rocket scientist to appreciate the story of a young boy and a young girl who have an incredible adventure that changes their world. I don't know about other reviewers, but I have to say that I love the book.   You don't need to be an expert on the Bible to like the story, but you do need to have an open mind.     Overall:  As a little kid, I would often go for the book and find myself completely captivated by the story.  It was a beautiful and inspiring tale of adventure. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was my first novel, and I read it on my Kindle. After I read, I went back and reread it to see if there was anything I'd missed. The plot is not as strong as I thought it would be. I like the fact that we're not told about the world from one person's point of view. Although this is what I thought would be the case, we're told about everything from the people, their lives, their thoughts and feelings, and what they're thinking. If I had to give this book 5 stars, I would! The characters were interesting enough to keep reading. There's a lot of detail in this book about people, places and things. It's a well-written, enjoyable read that I plan to read more of.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's hard to tell whether to be disappointed or elated. I am both! I was expecting a lot more out of a story I never expected to be interested in, and instead, it gave me some very interesting and thought provoking thoughts. This is the book that I am looking forward to reading next!  The premise of the book is simple: a man's soul is stolen by the dead. Now that's a neat way to start a story, but it's where the real story starts that I'm most interested in. The story of the man who bought the soul is interesting and moving, but I wonder if there will be a way to make it more realistic. In the end, it's all pretty well written, though. I don't think I would mind re-reading it.  I hope there will ever be a story where a soul has to be bought to go with a body. I would buy it even if I wasn't a reader, and it might even be something I could watch as a movie.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good read. It is a little on the long side. But it's great to read in short bursts. My students loved it, and I think the story lines are quite interesting. I would recommend this to all the young adults out there, and especially to young college students who want to read something that's a little more challenging than standard YA fiction.    Best Book Ever:  The plot is wonderful. The characters are likeable, and the plot unfolds in a way that is easy to follow. I liked how the main character and his friend's relationship turned out. It was a nice change of pace from more conventional YA.     "Fantasy, Magic, Mystery, Thriller" - Amazon.com review:  I didn't have any expectations to this one. It's supposed to be a fantasy romance, but instead of being a good one, it's the best book I've ever read! A good read about a young girl, and how she learns to love herself a little bit more. I loved the beginning part of the book, the romance, the characters, and even the magic system. I finished the book in about 2.5 hours. Thank you, author.    This book was great! It was fun and exciting! It felt like I was reading a different book! It has everything! Great writing, good characters, great magic, a really good plot. I recommend this book to everyone who wants a little different story with lots of adventure and love. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The most positive review I have ever written, I am happy to say.   " This is one of the best books I have read. It is a book that will have a profound effect on all who read it. It has something for everyone.  If you are interested in learning more about how the New Testament Fathers approached the Old Testament, this is the book for you.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A novel about a man whose life is changed by a near-death experience: a book that should be required reading for any high school science student. The main character's life is turned upside down when he is rescued from a deadly traffic accident by a doctor who has a gift for healing the sick. After he recovers, the man meets the woman who saved his life and their friendship develops into love. In the end, they return to a normal life, with the doctor's wife and son around. "A new novel that shows the potential that lies within every one of us. It's a book about love, hope, and miracles. I loved it!" "An interesting book.... I felt that the main character had the best and most believable plot arc of any character I had read thus far in the books I have read so far." "This is a book I would recommend to anyone with an interest in the supernatural or a high school education. It is not only well written and entertaining, but the writing also makes you care about the main characters."

Write a positive review about a good book:     This was a very interesting read. In a way, it's very similar to "The Dark Knight Returns".   When I first finished reading "The Man Who Knew Infinity" I couldn't put it down. The story was great, the writing was good, and the characters were well done. I'm really looking forward to reading the next book in the series.   The series is good quality so far, and hopefully they continue to add new characters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    Good enough. If you are a Tolkien fan, this will be worth reading. If not, you are probably just being a snob.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    Good book, but not good enough. This book is one of those books that you know you will enjoy reading but have no idea what you are in for. I did a little reading beforehand and had an idea of where I was going, but there are still a couple of chapters that take some time to get to the good parts. I've read several other authors and books this week, and the one by Rilke is my favorite, but this book is just not my cup of tea.    I think the only good thing about this book was the narration.   The narrator is very good, and is a very pleasant, soft, and smooth voice. However, it is not the voice of a writer. Rilkes voice is very conversational. There were several points when I had to take a moment to find a quiet place to concentrate.  I do enjoy the book. I think it could be an easy read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I like this book. I like it.   This book is about "the power of one." It is a story of one man's quest to be happy. He is motivated by his love of his life, his wife, and their two young children. He starts off as a self-centered man and a bully, but through his actions, he learns to become a better person.  He then learns that a simple change to his life and behavior has dramatic consequences for his family and for his own happiness. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with any type of depression. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a well researched book about the role of a man in society.   I was a victim of my own father's anger.  It gave me the courage to deal with my anger. This book gave me a voice and helped me deal with it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The author writes a good article and writes a story.   If a book doesn't do one of these things, there's a very good chance it's not that good, and I think this is true of all of the books I've read so far. I hope that someday a book like this will be made into a series.  I liked this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    Good read I've been meaning to read a biography of David Foster Wallace for a while, but couldn't find one to put my hand on.  I finally picked this up.  There are a few reviews of the book so far:  As a person with no knowledge of the man, who was a great writer, a nice guy, and a talented photographer,   He seemed to embody the American ideal: he was a writer who could be as angry as he wanted.  There was no self-pity, and he was able to be both a victim and a fighter.  (This review is in my head, but for the purposes of this review I will use the actual quotes.)  If the man himself is indeed the author of the quote, he is wrong.   This quote does not make me think that a victim is someone who needs to fight back, but rather that it is a good thing for a writer to write about their feelings. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In a lot of ways, a book like this is what books are for - they're not intended to be finished, they're intended to serve a purpose in some way.

Write a positive review about a good book:    My husband and I have been together almost 30 years now. In that time we have experienced the ups and downs of life, but have always been happy and fulfilled in each other's company. We decided to get married after a little over a year of dating. My husband is a wonderful, kind, caring man and a wonderful cook. We both love to travel, play with our children, and spend time with family and friends.   I have always read about "the best of the best" of the romance genre. I read them with trepidation. I have an unhealthy obsession with romance so it has always been an issue in my marriage. However, I have never given up hope. After reading this book I couldn't say I was disappointed in its conclusion.  This is not a good one for the bookworm or the reader who has not finished a book. This is an enjoyable, enjoyable book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:      I was hoping to read more than just a series of "chapters" that would "help" me develop my skills in a particular subject area, but I found that the "chaps" did in fact help me develop skills in those subjects. The first three "chap" were a short one on "How To Choose a Type Of Book To Read", a long one on a "Reading For Success" course, a longer one on how to choose a good textbook and so on and so forth. It was all very basic. There was no "how to" or "what are the best methods", so I was not getting a lot of help or advice. I don't think this is a fault, as it's very important to understand the basic basics before moving on, but it is a bit of a disappointment.   Overall: I liked the book a lot. It helps develop my reading skills to understand how I read. This was helpful. The book teaches you to identify when a word doesn't make sense and that's when you read with more accuracy, understanding that word rather than assuming that it means what you think it means. It also makes you pay more attention to details as to what the word means so you don't miss any important details. I liked this much more than the "Reading for Success" (not a good way to describe it) and the "How to Read". It helped me understand my reading better. This is a good "buy" for those who have to be very careful about what they read.  The only downside is that it's too long, but at only 933 pages I guess you can't really complain.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If I have to choose between reading about a wonderful experience or reading a book about a delightful experience, I'd choose the book that I would love to read (I've read this book before and loved it). So yes, I was not disappointed in this one (I love to hear about good things)!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am glad I did this. I used to be a fan of the Harry Potter series, but I couldn't get into it. So I tried the Wheel of Time series. I am so glad I read this book. The characters are all developed well, the action scenes are very exciting, the story itself is really good, and the plot makes sense. This book is a lot of fun! It also shows what a good writer can do with a fantasy series and a great fantasy author. Thanks for a great book! -- Amy, June 2007  The best book ever!  by A.B.   Read about my experience: I read the Wheel book series in the hopes of finding out if I was really a fan or just a masochist. I can say I am a maso.   with the final volume released, the question becomes: which book do you want to read first?   For this year's World Book Night, I read The Path of Daggers, but was so caught up in the world and characters that it was easy to overlook the story and characters. I finished a second book, but still have not read the third book (so far).
Write a positive review about a good book:    - 1 out of 5 Stars   For what it's worth, if it were not for the "A" rating, I would have given this book five stars. I am a big fan of The Kingkiller Chronicle series, and even if you don't care about that, this book is just a breath of fresh air, as a great adventure book about the history of the world and the great knights. This book is written very well. The main characters are all wonderful and it makes for an easy read. However, the book has some weaknesses that I think are mostly with the author. The pacing of the book is a bit slow, with the story taking about 300 pages to unfold. Also, I feel that the characters and how they are depicted by the author are not very interesting.   I do not understand the A+ rating. It's one thing if the book gives us a good and original story with a fascinating and intriguing story to it. What I see is a book written by someone who is just trying to tell a good story, but doesn't care that much about his characters, or the fact that a story is told about people who never existed or was just a tale told by a guy that lived 1000 years ago, even though that guy was a great swordsman. I don't see a single redeeming quality in this book. I give it 3 stars because the book was decent, but there were just too many issues to overlook.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently read a book about a woman who lived in a cave and survived on wild honey. The title of the book is "A Natural History of Honey," and it does not give the reader the impression that it will be a book of science but a book that is a combination of science and religion. Although the book focuses on honey, there are several fascinating observations made about honey bees that may interest a scientist or beekeeper. The book is well written and contains much information for those interested in honey bees.  Mealworms, honeybees and fungi. A natural history of the natural world? 
Write a positive review about a good book:    You should never make a book look good.   They look good because you have a camera with a zoom lens.  I had to go through a huge number of copies to get a copy that would stand up to my light.  My copy is a bit too worn.  They are good for the average reader but if you like them you should really wait till there is a reprint because they will be out of print.  This book is really an artifact from the era of cheap paperback books. The writing is good and it has the feel of an American novel written in the 1930's or 1940's.  If you have read a few of their books you will see that they have a good eye for story telling.  For those of you who want to see more of the book in a less worn condition I have the original hard cover.  If you are interested in this book I would recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:        To tell the truth I'm not a fan of the movie, but it does have some funny moments (some of which are actually funny) and there's a nice twist. This was one of my favorite episodes of the series.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think that this was the first time I've read a YA book that I found myself not just interested, but invested in. The characters are complex, the plot has depth, and the themes of acceptance and diversity are incredibly interesting. In a time where YA is often stereotyped, or the story takes a hard turn into horror, this is a fantastic alternative.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "The Last Emperor was so well put together, the pacing was excellent and the plot and characters were well done. It had just enough plot to keep my interest and the characters were not so shallow that you would feel like they don't have anything to do except to sit around and look at the people they love. The Last Emperor is a great book, a must have for any fan of good historical novels." - K. T. B. "I will definitely be reading more from this author" - D. A.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a huge fan of books about dogs and canines. They tend to be a lot less 'puffy' than more serious books, and, when it comes to fiction, more realistic than the typical dog-lover's fantasy. This one hit the right note and is just the kind of book I want to read about dogs. I'd certainly recommend this to a friend. (Review from the book)  Read this book for yourself.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a good little horror book in that it doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's also just a good read.   I recommend the short story collection, especially the more bizarre ones.  Good read but not great:  (1) The story was good. The characters were interesting, but the book was a little too short for my tastes.  (2) The pacing was a bit off.  I loved the first 2 stories in the book, but my interest waned by the 4th one. I think the author needs to work on getting the pace more right. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good and very interesting book. It takes a lot of time to explain the complex and intricate rules of the game and to introduce the concepts of luck. The author spends most of the book showing how randomness, and the effect of luck, changes the outcome in the game. The reader learns a lot about the importance of skill and luck in competitive game play. There is a large discussion about strategy but there is no real strategy to the game at all. The rule of 6 is the only strategy discussed. If you want a game to be fair this book is NOT for you. If I were to learn a game and wanted to be an expert it is this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got a copy of The Complete Sherlock Holmes, which was pretty much a re-buy from Amazon. If you like the series, you should give it a try.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The story of a young boy's life is well told, with a plot that isn't too convoluted. I don't know the names of the various characters, though I think they are all important. However, the last part of the book is rather hard to follow. However. The book has been recommended for young readers, and that is definitely what I would read for my son's first book. This book is definitely worth your time, and I really can't recommend it highly enough.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am new to this genre. I am an independent librarian and I loved this book. It is a very good introduction to a genre of book that has been somewhat neglected by book reviewers. I recommend this book to librarians and those who like good writing.
Write a positive review about a good book:    And now a word from the editor:  The story:  A young girl named M.M. goes to visit a cousin in the countryside where her family lives. There, she meets a strange boy named Z, and begins to develop a friendship with him. The main character is a very nice, kind boy, but he is not so innocent that he can only be a friend. She is just a little girl, a victim, and has to learn to be a good and strong girl to survive. Z, on the other hand, is a little more... twisted than a vampire. He is more violent, more aggressive than a normal vampire, and a little less innocent than M.A. He loves to eat people... but only at night.  This is a short, one-shot story, but has some very interesting ideas about friendship and friendship bonds that go deeper than blood.   I loved the way the story was told; it was short, but full of interesting ideas and a great story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The only thing that really keeps me going is the fact that the writer is so good at what she does. In fact, I can't imagine a more effective book writer than the guy who did this one (he has a degree in Creative Writing and has written a lot of books - both fiction and non-fiction). He doesn't just tell a good story - he shows how and why the story is effective, by looking at real world situations and how to manipulate and manipulate them to produce the desired effect. This was definitely the best book I've ever read on this subject, and I think it's the best you'll find on the topic.  Also, I found this a good way to learn about the effects of conditioning on memory - as a side effect, I was able to remember my name in the original script and had it for reference in the end. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked this book a lot. It is definitely not the typical "love your children" sort of book. The whole book is about how to raise a child well but it isn't just about raising a child. It focuses more on your family and you as an individual. The book also tells you that you must have a balanced and strong personality to raise children. This book can also be read as an autobiography as well as a story about a person raising a kid. The characters are realistic and the author really puts himself into it. This is my favorite "twee" books and i recommend you read it as it can be very dark and depressing but still very true and a good read for parents.  4 of 4 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:     "An intriguing and well-researched study of the roots of contemporary 'intellectual' thought: a fascinating glimpse into the mind of a literary historian, and a useful guide to the intellectual developments that occurred before the Enlightenment began to change Western culture, even if the book's main conclusions are a little dated."  --David Harsanyi, New York Times best-selling author of The Moral Animal: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion     "In many ways, this is a very sophisticated book about how thought is organized, and, as much as anything, it's a brilliant introduction to the work of the great literary historians: the study of intellectual history."  (Booklist)   "[Cahill's] new book, which will be published next month by Oxford University Press, is a remarkable contribution to an academic discipline and to literature in general. An incisive survey of the ideas, methods and concerns of nineteenth-century intellectual historians, it is a thoroughly researched and engaging work." In many senses, this book is a brilliant Introduction to the Thought of Literary Historians. It is certainly a fascinating look into the work and thought of an amazing group of scholars, and it is an incisive and engaging guide to some of the important ideas and concerns that they brought to the study. The book is well organized into two main sections. The first section deals with some key themes in the history of ideas, with a brief synopsis of the thinkers, their works, their time and place, and their influence. The second section looks at the role of literary history in understanding the cultural evolution of the age.This is a scholarly and well researched book that I found to be engaging, well-organized and thought-provoking. It certainly will be an important addition to the library of any serious student of history and literary study of any period. It will also be a valuable resource for any teacher of literature.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got this because I had seen that the author was going to be at a conference about the book, and I knew I had to get it. It is a good little book, not overly long. The first few chapters I was kind of struggling with, but after that I really started to enjoy it. I recommend it!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had read this book years ago, and I remember the experience well. This book remains a classic in my mind, but the writing has changed a bit since I read it. I still love the book, and it's still a good read for those who enjoy science fiction.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was great to read. It was written with a solid feel to it, and it is a good story, not to mention a very good fantasy.   Overall, I'm really enjoying this book.  For more reviews, see the following:  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1739...
Write a positive review about a good book:    What I loved most: I really liked the way the book was structured. We had been talking about this book for some time as we have discussed how difficult it is to write a story set in a war-torn world with realistic characters. However, at the end of each chapter, we had this little moment that said, "Now you can write a book with realistic humans." When the characters were shown to be the opposite of what they appeared to be or they showed real empathy for those they treated as lesser, I found the story to be more engaging and more satisfying than it has been before. I will always read more of Poul Anderson's work. This time, the experience was a pleasant surprise. Thank you, author, for creating the right amount of conflict and for teaching us that sometimes it is necessary to break the rules to give the story what it wants to be. I'm a big fan now.
Write a positive review about a good book:   As a newbie to this genre I was hoping to find a good, fun read. I enjoyed this book and would like to read the sequels. I enjoyed this one a lot. I was glad it was over. It was a fun read! Read more about the author: Singer, Mark Songs are a reflection of the times we live in, a chronicle of the things that make our lives interesting and of how life feels in its purest form.  They're the last thing we think about, but the last things we really need to think about. It's this quality that drives Mark Singer to create his songs, to make his lives interesting. He knows that song lyrics are the most honest, honest thing about a person.  So he makes songs about those things: love, sex, money, the past, the future, and anything that makes the world a little bit different. Singer is a songwriter with an eye toward creating something that resonates with all kinds of people, whether it's the person at the bar or the person in the corner telling the stories they think you should know. And songs are songs.   Singer loves the craft of songwriting: he knows how to make music, he knows the songs, and he knows that it's important to make something that people remember. He also loves how the world changes.    This book was written with the intent of being enjoyed in a variety of situations.  Singer has written a song about life in the 90s and in the present day.  But he hasn't written a book in either of these eras, so we're just learning about his memories from each. My only critique on this book was that the cover looked a bit dated.  So that's my one and only critique. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you want to read something about the real world, the kind of things that actually happen in the world, this is the book for you. If you want some real world insight into real-world problems, this book is worth picking up and reading.  . You should definitely try this book.  In a world where people try to turn every problem into a drama about right and wrong and all that good stuff, this could be the book that turns the problems into real world problems you can work with, if you can solve the issues it raises. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is good and not just in one aspect. I like the characters and the setting very much and the plot is interesting. I liked the way the story moved.   The book is not really too detailed and although some things are explained too early, they don't ruin the overall story at all.  I like the book a lot. It is quite unique and has a very good story. It was fun and enjoyable to read.  I think there is a lot of interesting ideas in the book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   It's like reading a very good mystery:  -   It's dark, creepy, disturbing, and thought-provoking, all in one.

Write a positive review about a good book:   "There are few people who would read a book about their own death, or the death of someone close to them. The writer tells the reader about the end of her life with dignity and respect. " 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think a lot of authors write the same thing over and over again. I have two children and I can't say for sure, but I believe a lot more of their problems stem from how we are raised and how society views us. This book shows a lot about parenting and I want to give it a 9.5 or 10. It's just a well-written book with a couple of small flaws but nothing that wouldn't be addressed. There are a couple things about this book that I have no idea how this book was written and it's a little embarrassing. One is that all the parents in the book are white but there are some people of color in the world. They also seem to be all over the map in their opinions, as they have no problem with the way the kids look, but don't see why they need to be taught about body positivity or why they should be shown an example of what is normal. They are taught to ignore their bodies and to be thin and happy, which I don't think is healthy or right for a kid. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished the new book by my favourite author, the one you are about to review. I am amazed and delighted by how different his writing style was from mine. His words are short and punchy, and he's full of jokes and witty sentences that I've found myself writing at home after a long day on the computer.   He has taken a few of his older books and added a few new ones and made them even better than the originals. For example he changed the name of one of his characters. The man, it turns out, was named "The Man" because his character was a big "Man" who did nothing but drink and smoke.   the main characters are the three friends "Rocco" (a former marine) "Eddie" (who is a detective) and "Kieran" (his son). The first two have had big problems in their lives. They were raised by their parents, and they were always on their best behaviour. Their parents died, and the son has a tough time adjusting to life on his own. They had been best friends growing up, and when Kieran had a terrible accident he started to lose his confidence and decided that he'd be a better detective if he knew his dad was still alive. He decides to find out. He runs around the city looking for clues, and finds more than he bargained for. A serial killer is at work. When he runs into one of the killers, he tries to shoot him in the head and fails. Kieran decides to make things right by getting back together with his best friend. Then it starts to get bad again. The serial killer, named "Jenny" (because she was a serial killer), has been stalking Kieran and his friends.  .The book is very well written, and at times it's a little too fast paced, but it was still a nice, quick read. I really enjoyed this book. If you want to get into this genre and read a great thriller set in a city that is now pretty dead, then I highly recommend this book!
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book itself is about a young couple living in the countryside in the 1950s. Their story is told from the point of view of the husband, who is a doctor. While at first the book's message seems rather negative (you might call it "bias" of the author), there is a lot of good information in the book. The author does a nice job of explaining basic things about health and medicine to his young audience. However, the author's bias is apparent from the very beginning. The fact that the wife is female is never brought up and the story never focuses on how the husband's wife actually gets her medicine for the children. The lack of attention to the role of the father is also a concern. This does not happen in other books that I have read, but if this book is all about how the wife has it easier, then this is not a book that I will be recommending to my daughter. For the same reason that I do not want to be recommending this book to my young daughter, I don't want to recommend this book as a resource for young people.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think my favorite part of this book was the ending. The way they did this ending was very cool and also did a great job of showing that the other characters were still in the game even though they knew that the end was coming.   It made it more dramatic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:       A good book that is worth a read is worth writing about.   In The Road to Serfdom, I'm especially impressed by Hooker's treatment of the issue of slavery. The novel is not without flaws - but at this point it is hard to see how anyone could disagree with her analysis of the way that slavery played out and on the individual level, Hooker makes a strong case for why people should be concerned about the continuing use of the slave trade and slave-owning countries to the present day.  It's an important book and I highly recommend it!
Write a positive review about a good book:    In the beginning I thought it would be a little boring, but as the days went by, I started to learn the various characters' thoughts and feelings towards each other. I found myself caring a lot more for the relationships of the characters. This is definitely a story that is great to read as an adult.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A review I wrote about my friend's book: It is the first book I've read by Susan M. Klinenberg, and it was easy to like. Klineenberg, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Education, is a long-time education journalist. Her books often deal with the problems of educational leadership. What makes her latest book particularly interesting is that she analyzes not only the policies of individual schools but also the political system and how its policies are made and implemented. This means that Klineberg, a progressive, is not looking at individual schools or school districts in isolation but is looking at them as part of a system, including the politics that shape them. She also examines how educational research and policy are shaped and produced by people outside of the schools and that makes the book really interesting. Kliningenberg shows how the public school system has changed since the beginning of the 20th century, but in a fairly orderly manner. In the 1950s and 1960s, most schools became public, although many remained private. In 1965, the Supreme Court held that school districts have no constitutional responsibility to educate children as well as provide a public education, and that students' religious beliefs are irrelevant to their enrollment in the school. So even though public school funding remained relatively stable from the late 1960s on, state funding for education fell dramatically. By the early 1980s, however, the system had returned to the traditional public schools in which all students attend the same public school. In an important piece of research on this issue, Klineenburg explains that there are three major political and economic forces that shaped the public-school system from the early 19th century to the present. The first is the need for a public-sector system of schooling after the Civil War. Public schools had become a means of financing the poor through the federal government. Many of the new schools were privately owned and the government was paying for almost all of their operations. The second factor was the growth of urban areas. Many people who had lived on farms had moved to cities and needed a public school to help them make a living. The third factor was a growth in the size of public schools. In 1860, public schools covered about 5 percent of all school districts. Today, they cover roughly 20 percent. When Klinebeck arrived at Penn she was one of only about a dozen people who were teaching in public schools at the time. She taught special education for a year in Philadelphia
Write a positive review about a good book:    "The novel's main message is about the responsibility of living life, but also about the beauty of love, and of life on the brink of death and the wonder and freedom of friendship, as well as the fear and horror of being forgotten in a crowd." (Booklist, starred review) "A remarkable book that will make you feel a little bit better about the world..." (Locus) "As a story told through the eyes of a narrator we follow his life as a soldier in World War II. It's a tragic story of the importance of the individual, and the need to be able to love him or her when you can't see much of them anymore." (The Guardian) "Breathtakingly moving and beautiful." (Kirkus Reviews) "Worth every page." (New York Times) "An absorbing novel... I'd recommend this book to anyone who has the patience to let the narrator tell his story." (Stuff Magazine)

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been waiting to read this book for some time now. I finally got around to it after being in the area for several days. I came from the east coast and didn't realize how great the books I read were here. I got a lot of great reads here. It is hard to beat a book that is well written and written well. So this book is just a good read. The best of the genre. I recommend this book to everyone.
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's really well done and a wonderful story.     If you don't know what it is:  In an interview with a fan in the book, the writer said he had wanted to try and do an adult/YA novel in the fantasy genre, and had initially tried the adult genre.  So he's got some experience with this genre too!  This book is very much a character study in which there is a huge difference between the young characters and the mature characters, so it has its own strengths and weaknesses.    This book was very hard to put down!   It was so well written and the characters are extremely well developed.  My only complaint about this book is that I'm not sure the sequel will be as good as the first!

There is no need to have any previous knowledge of this author and her work, as the book has a well written storyline and excellent character development. All in all, a great read and one of the better books I read this year!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book. The narrative is compelling and it's clear that there are no two ways about it. You could do with some more time, but it still manages to deliver a strong narrative. It's been a while since I read a novel that made me sit down and think, 'Yes, this book needs to be read.' The characters have depth and, whilst I am far from an expert in either of them, they were a pleasure to follow, their stories engaging and the world they inhabited interesting. If you enjoy a good yarn, with some twists and turns, then you will enjoy this book!

Write a positive review about a good book:   I just read an interesting book about the "lost city" of Lemuria (called Xibalba in the book). It seems that when they explored the island, they discovered a bunch of dinosaurs, and they wanted to keep the dinosaurs as their own. They even have some sort of secret society that worship dinosaurs, the only difference with us is that they keep the secret and use the fossils as a kind of currency. The book follows two members of the secret society. One was a brilliant engineer, who built an island that he called Xibalbas. He then went on to build a second island. The second island was in the southern hemisphere, and was called Lemuria. He came to the island to study the dinosaurs, but had a hard time communicating with them and having them cooperate. They were very primitive, and had to learn how to get along with one another, and I found the story a little confusing at times, but I thought the book was good for its time. I like the idea of these mysterious people, that built a city on a tropical island, and then sent a team to explore and see if they could use any of the animals to build something useful. If they could, they would have been able to live the lifestyle of an ancient human, rather than just living in a cave, as most people did then. I have always wanted to visit Lemuria myself, but haven't been able because I am in my 60's. So this book made me very curious. I hope the author eventually comes to visit the island of Xibalbba. If that happens, I think I may be willing to travel to the South American continent and search for the same creatures. I don't see any point in sending a team there if the people are so primitive, it would take years to develop a culture.   Posted by Brian at 12:05 PM

Write a positive review about a good book:    It's an old favorite. I bought the "original" edition. I had read it several times before, and it's always been great fun. I've bought it many times since. My favorite thing about it is the book's description.   It talks about how a new life begins...and how hard life is. It also gives advice about how to be happy with the things you have...which is what we should all try to do, if we care about life. It doesn't preach, it just tells you what works. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read and liked most of the books I've come across, but I felt that "The Art of Memory" was a much better book and really captures much of what is so important to human memory.   As a student of memory, I can't recommend this book highly enough, especially to those interested in working to increase their knowledge of the topic. It's not as well written as "Memory: A User's Guide", but that's ok, I guess.  The Art Of Memory by G. B. Stein et al. was published in 1956 by Dover Publications. (Click on the book's cover to see a page-size photo of the actual book.) It was one of the first to be published on how to use memory. It includes a table of contents, many exercises, and lots of information on memory and its uses.   Here's what I learned from it:  This is the first book to be written specifically on how memory works. The book doesn't just focus on the brain, but also on how we use memory to remember other things, like what food we had for lunch, or what song we heard on the radio yesterday.  (Click here to learn more about memory.)  You can find information on what memory techniques are effective.  They also describe how memories are built, how we remember, and how to improve our memory and our lives.  The book includes lots of diagrams, tables, and illustrations.  It's a great place to start if you want to learn about memory.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!" - Lisa, reader If you're in the mood for a good story, and you're not afraid to try something different, try this book!   (Don't worry, the dog doesn't bite!) 1.  To read, download a free text book on Kindle or read a book on a computer or Kindle or ebook reader.  I'd recommend:  The Little Red Book  -  my mother's favorite book series.  2.  In your own words:    Tell the story to your dog:  tell about what's happening, and share something funny about it.  Share about the book, or about other good books you've read, too.  If the dog does something funny, you have a winner.   Make sure to give him time to think before eating or doing something he didn't expect.    3.  Write about a time when you were bored and frustrated:   Tell about how you did something about it, how it changed your life, or how you still have a lot of learning to do.  Then make the dog learn a new trick, or a new behavior to get your dog to relax.      4.  Get it done:  I recommend starting with a short session where the dog eats the food and does a behavior he normally won't do. Once the food has been digested, put the dog in a crate and lock it. Keep a snack handy so he will be hungry to start with.  The first day, the food might not be digested at all.  Give him time (at least 5 minutes) to wait in the crate, and take your snack and leave. 5.  Finish the next chapter or chapter ahead:   When the book is done, put it on a shelf and then make the next one.  Keep reading the book until you finish
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had to pick this book up because I've heard so many great things about it. I wanted to learn more about how they came up with that method. I've read about the old-school methods and it was kind of interesting. I didn't know that much about a lot of the techniques they used. Also, it was a little hard to get through.

Write a positive review about a good book:     The book was a good read, with some interesting ideas and well researched information about several topics. There were a few minor annoyances but nothing that I can't live with, especially when reading a book that is written for a general audience. I also enjoyed the author's use of the word "hucksters" because that's exactly what some of these people were. I recommend this book to a general readership who wants to learn more about this topic.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I was a little surprised at how good this book is - it's an excellent introduction to the philosophy of Kant, the basic tenets of which are that we are all born free and equal in dignity and worth. But the book goes much deeper than that: there are fascinating explorations of Kant's philosophy of religion - especially the central question of whether there is a God who exists outside of the human soul. The book is also well written and highly stimulating. There's some discussion of how he might respond to the charge of atheism that has been put forth by many contemporary thinkers." (From the review written by Stephen Darwall)  1. This book is a great introduction to Kant's thought.  2. There is discussion of what he thought about God.  and  3. There are discussions of his ethics.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I don't know what my thoughts on this book are exactly but I know it was an awesome read. I was glad that I had the book when I bought a new car as I didn't have a copy of the book that I bought at the time.   I liked the book and I liked the characters because of the time they had to develop and develop a relationship with each other because of how long it was, and how they all reacted to how other people thought of them and what they would do.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I was a little girl, my brother introduced me to the story of Tom Sawyer.  I don't recall what I liked better; his courage or his wit.  For me the story was about a man's life in exile and how he came to find purpose in the world.  Tom Sawyer was a good character and an interesting story, but I am not sure I would have liked him as a teen.  His behavior was a bit out of control.   I would not recommend this to a 13-year-old girl.  The story doesn't seem to have a happy ending at all.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It's the first book in a series that's about to be my major read next. I love it.   The characters are well realized and well thought out and it takes a while to get to know them fully, but it makes up for it. And it gets really dark, which is always fun in a YA series.  My Rating:  I found that the book is a bit too short and slow paced, but that it is a really enjoyable book. The characters were well thought through and the setting was not too different from my real world experience.  Overall, I would recommend this book to people looking for a really good read that is also pretty light hearted. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is about two characters, who were in a very unfortunate circumstance.  The protagonist was killed by an illegal dog collar.  And the other character was killed in a drug-related incident.  He also has a son, who is dealing with the same issues, when it comes to drugs.  I really liked the characters, because I am really into that type of characters.  They have good qualities, but also bad ones.  I think they had a lot to offer.  However, they are very one-dimensional characters, especially the protagonist.  This book didn't help it.  So the story was just really weak.  Also, it took so long to get to the point that the two characters were involved.  It was kind of like reading a story, when in reality, there is no point. Overall: 5 out of 10     I do not like to see a novel have a lot of changes in the middle of the book, because it really takes the fun out of the story.  But even though this book had a few changes, I still did like it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a huge fan of John Scalzi's The Unwritten. For one thing, I thought the author was a super good writer. I've read a few fantasy books in my life, and the thing that always bugged me is the constant "The elves want to live in peace in the forest... " thing. That thing has always bothered me. That "peace" is more often than not a trap for the bad guys. My big complaint with The Un written is that this peace isn't exactly peace to the elves' taste. I don't have any problem with elves that have an unrequited love of the forest, but the elves that the book focuses on have a more pressing interest of their people (that's right: "The Elves". I'm not a huge Elf fan, but my heart goes out to this group.) One of the things I've enjoyed about the book is that Scalzi spends a lot of time telling us about the "dark elves", the ones that we as humans are too scared to acknowledge. The fact that he gives us a lot to talk about on this point I think is important for readers, because it helps us all understand that the elves, on the whole, are not the monsters the humans think they are. What I like about the darker elves is that they are at the opposite end of the spectrum of the light elves, and they are more likely to be kind and accepting towards the other races. For me the darkest elves are the ones I have the hardest time sympathizing with. That's because they are the elves we've never seen in the series. The book does a really good job at giving us some background on the various types of elves that live in the woods. The first one I came across was a young female elf named Grela. In one of the later chapters, Grelal has to sneak past a patrol of human soldiers into the woods to retrieve a secret that will mean the world to her people. There are a couple of other elves like her, one called Haelan and one called Bauvin. These are basically the ones you'll see in the comic. It also gives us some insight into the relationship between the two different groups that live near the woods: the light (elf side) and dark (human side). For me, there are a few things that bothered me with the book. First, the first half of the book was just a bunch of "What's up with the light
Write a positive review about a good book:   The title might not be the biggest surprise here, but the premise is not. "The Power of Now" is written by Deepak Chopra, whose teachings and writings have been a staple in my practice for almost a decade, but who was a relative newcomer to my bookshelf at this point. In my experience, Chopra has often been the most compelling author for a particular subject, though, and this book is no exception. If you need an excuse to read the books I haven't read, or are considering an introductory course in Buddhism, this one is worth a read. And even if you have read it, there's something for everyone. I've included a little "filler" content as well, but I wouldn't say that this is the only Buddhist book I would recommend to someone who has not read any Buddhist texts, and perhaps wouldn't recommend it to someone with a general interest in this particular topic.  The Power Of Now: Meditation and Enlightenment, with excerpts from the Dalai Lama and Dr. William James The Buddha and the Philosophers: An Introduction to The Foundations of Western Wisdom The Buddha And His Followers: Meditation, Mindfulness, and the Heart of Buddhist Practice (with commentary) The Four Noble Truths of Buddhism (from An Unsullied Life ) The Path of the Bodhisattva: A Guide to Awakening (with short discussion of Buddhist ethics) A Short History of Nearly Everything: From the dawn of life to the present day (with links)

Write a positive review about a good book:     This book is one of the best books I've read in a long time, not because it's a bad book, but because it has such amazing potential to be a great book. The story is interesting, and a good number of the characters are interesting and well-drawn. The setting is also very interesting, as well as the politics and economy. I like that this book is a satire, but the satire itself is not too harsh, and the main character is pretty decent and likable. I'm looking forward to reading the second book in this series, because it appears to be another great read.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A little funny, a little deep, a lot of information, a good read.   Recommended by me     4.6 (18) April 8, 2017 Reviewer: Anonymous Person from Portland, OR United States I loved this book. The book did not disappoint. I feel I must comment a few things that a lot have mentioned about the book. First of all, I think the book could have done a lot better with the ending, but the book overall was well written. I didn't know what happened, but it was well presented. Also, some people I know have mentioned that the author is not from Maine, but I don't see a difference in the writing. It was very well written for me. The characters were very well developed and real. I really liked all of them and was just as surprised as they were when some of the things happened. I found the main character (the only one that I could identify in the book) and his father very interesting. The main character is smart and I feel he had a difficult time coming to terms with what was going on. I felt sorry for the author who had to write an ending that was really depressing, but he didn't. The story didn't have to end like that. My only problem is that I just want the book to end. This book was great and I really don't want it to end any more than it has already. I will read the next book by the author, but no matter where it is, I'll be waiting to read it again! I will be rereading this one again. It may not be perfect, but a lot has to be said about this book and I have a feeling that it will become one of the favorite books I read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This was my first foray into Lovecraftian fiction.   After reading this book, I am very excited to read Lovecraft's other works in the future.  In addition, I have read other Lovecraftian works from others and they all were of low quality.  So i decided to try something different and buy this book to give it a chance.  This book was a fun read.  From the beginning, we know that Lovecraft was a great storyteller and not just for the horror genre.  He is also a great writer and has written many good stories.  I would definitely recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    If you are looking for a good read, then this book is not the right choice. It's not easy reading at times and there is some awkward situations that I found too difficult to handle at times. There were times when the author had to do what she thought the audience needed to be seen as a "good" person. In some ways, she got it, but in some other instances, I just didn't get what she was trying to show or what was going on in the book. There is some character growth, but the way she does it makes the change in her character not felt so believable. I also thought there were some "hangs" in the story. Not sure if this is just me or what. I would definitely recommend this to someone who likes a good mystery but isn't ready for a heavy book.  7 of 7 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished reading this book. It's a must read for anyone interested in the subject and for the casual reader who likes a good story and a good mystery.   The first few chapters are somewhat light-hearted as you meet the main character, but as the book progresses and the story deepens, you will start to realize that he is a man with big ideas.  The novel begins with a very unusual murder, and then moves to a case of domestic violence. Then, the story moves to the mystery as you learn more about the two leads. You have a good plot and a unique plot line.  However, what really made this book so good was the way it portrayed the mental disorder of bipolar disorder. Not only was it well done in describing the disorder, but it also gave the reader a feeling of what it is like to live with this disorder. The writing is very easy to read.  I did enjoy the romance aspect of the story, and I thought it was pretty well done.  A great novel.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A novel about the Second World War, based on real events. It's not so good as to be a great book but still a good read. It has a lot of flaws though. The narrator is good but I think his voice sounded a bit different than it should have. I wouldn't say it's not a good narrator but it wasn't the best. The second protagonist, the German soldier, didn't have enough character development to really make him interesting. Overall I think this is a decent novel but it could have been a lot better.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you like the book, please review it and/or tell me why you liked it!    (4)  Review by: Robert D. | Posted: 30/12/2011  I bought the book on Kindle in 2011, and just finished reading it this morning. I liked the book very much. My only concern was the lack of a glossary or an index.   The book itself was a good introduction for the reader.  This was a book for advanced students or those with little knowledge about mathematics.  The explanations are clear and concise enough for most readers to understand the basics without a great deal of reading.  In the book there is a glossed and indexed version of the book available.  Unfortunately, this is all I could find.  I hope the book is available at a good price in the future.  The book uses only a few of the algebraic and differential geometries that appear in elementary high school math.  However, it was interesting to see how these techniques can be applied in many more mathematical situations than elementary algebra.  For example, it is difficult to imagine a way to multiply a matrix by a matrix, but I think this is the same thing as multiplying a vector by a vector.  To show this, we have a matrix of matrices.  Then we put a vector on top of the matrix, and we can multiply by the matrix.  You can see this happening in the example below. The example above is not a complex analysis problem but it shows the technique well. The main reason the book doesn't have a gloss or an alphabetic index is that there is so much information to keep up with.  It could be very helpful to have a reference book for the intermediate student or even for a mathematician in need of a refresher.  Perhaps we could have both glossed with index, but the book should have had one.  There were several mathematical figures and formulas used in the book that I found confusing at first. It would be very useful to have them summarized in a gloss and then the reader could refer to the gloss when there is confusion.  My only remaining complaint is that the book wasn't formatted for a Kindle device.  Amazon doesn't let you format a Kindle book in their store.

It's one of those books where you'll find everything from the first chapter and still be surprised by the end.

Write a positive review about a good book:        I bought the  Fables of Faerie  as part of my  Fantasy series.   It's a collection of three short stories that have their origins in the  Dragonlance  series but which were then expanded and developed further.   The stories have a lot of humor.    There are also some really nice descriptions of the locations and times of the stories.  The descriptions are well done and I enjoyed reading them.  There are some minor spoilers for the first story,  The Snow Queen, but none for the rest. I will be reading more Fables and maybe a few short stories from this collection in the future.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read the book "A History of the Earth" by Paul R. Williams. It's a nice book, but as I was reading the book I got to thinking: how much of it is true?   Well, it turns out that the answer to this is a big "no", but it should be pretty close to the truth. The book makes a lot of claims about the past and its present (including its future) that are incorrect or misleading. In many cases, the claims are not made out of ignorance; they are made because they are politically incorrect (as I understand it, the author is a liberal Democrat).   And, as I read, I found that the author's interpretations of various historical events (in particular, the French Revolution) were either wrong or misleading (even by the author himself, if the author was being accurate).  For example, the book claims that "the French Revolution in 1688 was an unprecedented assault on the rights of Frenchmen in particular and all the peoples of Europe in general."  That is quite false.   What was an assault was the expulsion of French peasants, an act that was condemned by most of the European governments and the church; what caused the peasants to move was the economic crises that began in 1689 when the price of corn (grain) went up and so did the cost of living.  Even the book itself admits that the French peasants did not move in the direction the author claims they did, and the book also admits that what caused most of them to move (to the south) was not the French government (and even less the French clergy).  A similar problem was with the book's claim that "The Catholic Church, despite its claims to represent the interests of the downtrodden, did nothing to stop the French revolution."  The Catholics did try to stop it; but the attempt was foiled by the King, who had a better understanding of the Catholic Church than the Church had.  The French revolution, in my view, was very much against the Church.  It did not just say, "we are all in this together."  In fact, it said, "no one cares about your right to own private property; all your rights are revoked."  This is what made the revolution so revolutionary. It didn't just do away with privileges and privileges; it did away with a whole culture. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was great. It has a great deal of information about the Civil War and the history of slavery. The writing is crisp and to the point. The book includes several maps and photographs, but only a small number (about 2/3) that are included in this book, so they are not very helpful. The photos are good though. I did not know the book said that slavery was a "thing of the past" until I started reading it. However, the information in the book has been published previously in books that I have read. This book is the "History of the United States, 1607-1877", which makes it an odd title for a book. This is not an "history of slavery"; it is a "History" of the US. However you should be able to recognize many of the key people in the war as they are named. This gives the reader a more rounded view. The author is a very good writer, and the text is simple yet clear and accurate, although it could use some formatting. The photographs have a certain amateurishness, but it is not noticeable unless you are looking for it, and even then the photos have enough detail that it is fairly easy to tell who is who. I believe that the "Book" has been well edited and is worth the price.   I highly recommend this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think that this is a great collection of stories from various authors. All the stories were enjoyable, but one stood out for me: "The Long Dark Road" by Charles E. Gannon. I would like to give it five stars, but as I was putting the book back into the box, I was reminded of this story and I realized that I did not want it to be the only one from this book. It is so unique, and it is one of the more memorable stories in this collection. I am not sure how much longer this story will be available, so it was a good way to end this book, I would definitely recommend it.

I received a copy of  The Birth of a Boy: The True Story of the Man Who Raised a Male, by  Charles McAfee, to review. The review has not yet been written, but I will be doing that as soon as I can get the time to complete it. Charles McEvoy is a great story teller and his book tells the story about how a man was able to raise a son to a healthy age. I am going to read the book as soon I get the chance, and I hope that others enjoy the story of a father raising a son.   Rating:     Buy it:    
Write a positive review about a good book:   In the summer of 1995, I went to my high school's auditorium to find a way to pass a summer internship.   I took a course in "Citizenship Studies," which, like most civics classes, consisted of a long lecture on the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.  The lesson was about the separation of powers; the subject was not a huge issue for me, but at least I was familiar enough with the Constitution to understand that a president has the power to pardon or to terminate a president or vice president.  When the subject of impeachment came up, I was surprised. "But he can't do that, can he?" I asked, "Is it a crime for him to pardon?"  And it turns out that it is!  At the age of 17, I read the Constitution for the first time.  I found the entire document incomprehensible, and yet it seemed clear enough.  While not a scholar by education or background, I knew the basics.  In high school, I had a student paper on the impeachment of Bill Clinton.  My student paper described a conversation I had with an acquaintance about the issue:  "Bill is on record as saying he will not pardon.  Why is he doing it?"  I explained that a pardon is the president's power under Article II to grant clemency to anyone in prison.  Since President Clinton did not have the power of pardoning before his appointment to the presidency, the only option was to pardon Clinton. "Yeah, so that's a constitutional right."  It was clear to me that if the president wanted to pardon, he had that right under Article 2 of the Constitution.  It is not clear that President Trump can pardon. There is a long discussion about the pardon power in the history of the Constitutional Convention.  However, for my purposes, it is enough to note that at the time the Constitution was written, it was clear that the pardon was not part of the executive power.  Therefore, in the case of Bill and Hillary Clinton, they could have asked the American people to declare them to be "unfit to serve."  This would have been a clear legal argument.  There are numerous articles that discuss the pardon clause, but the following is the most common:  The Supreme Court has held that the president may not grant a pardon "during his term," but may pardon in any of the pardons provided in Article II.  Since Clinton was not
Write a positive review about a good book:     It's a well-written book about the history of the United States from the late 17th century to the 21st century. The book is comprehensive, and there is much to be learned from it. However, it is a little heavy handed with a certain amount of historical knowledge. There are a number of interesting points that are missed by the author because he did not spend time with the original documents or other sources. This book is a great read for anyone interested in American history.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have had a lot of difficulty writing reviews of novels.   The reason is that I have such a hard time putting it into words.  In the course of trying to tell you about the latest book in a series (a long running one), I have read all three.  I have tried to explain the story line but I have lost patience.  To say that the novel is good would be an understatement.  The story line is intriguing.  It is also interesting how the characters become a part of this story.  If you are like me, you will love this novel.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is about as close to perfect as I have ever read in a YA book. Yes, there are some major faults to this book but they are more than made up for by the high quality of the story, the characters and the way they are portrayed. The writing style is fluid, full of emotion and very funny and funny in places. The main character is very unique. He is the perfect mix of awkward but endearing and full of life and hope at other times. The other characters are all interesting to look at and they also have very unique qualities and I feel like the author is very well aware of these aspects. I liked how the author portrayed each character as a person and not just a body or a plot device. This book doesn't make any attempt to be deep or complex. It is fun, cute, silly and well written. I highly recommend this book if you enjoy good YA books with cute characters that make you smile. I also hope that the next book will have a different tone and that the author will go back to doing the characters something else next.  
Write a positive review about a good book:      This is one of those books I love that I would never own, and would only buy for an occasional read. I read it at the suggestion of an editor friend, who was recommending it to me.   I like the world building, but I didn't love the characters.  , and, especially, she was a real pain in the ass. When you get stuck and really need a hand, it's not very likely that anyone will pick up the phone and come to your rescue. Also, she's kind of a dick, which I was fine with in her case, but that's not necessarily an asset for me.The only real redeeming quality of this book is that there's a lot of action and adventure. There were some really neat sequences where some crazy stuff was going on in a castle. There was also a nice mix of humor and adventure that I didn a   The first few chapters are really exciting, but then the book gets a little repetitive.

I don't know if I love it as much as some people, because I read this when it first came out and I loved the first book so much that I ended up picking up the second. I think this might be the only book I've enjoyed in 2015 so far. There's a ton of excitement and action in this book, and it's kindof a slow burner for a while, but the ending is surprisingly nice, and the worldbuilding is so well done.This is a fantasy story set in a world that's a little different than most fantasy books I read. Basically, I'm not a big fan of a lot fantasy, mostly because it's more like a mix between Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter than fantasy.I liked that this book didn't try to be like the "Fantasy meets Harry Potter" genre. The main characters aren't wizards, they aren't knights and princesses, they don't all wear cloaks and wield magical swords. This world has its own culture and history, but it's much more medieval and medieval than anything else I've ever read. It has some strange magic that isn't as crazy as the Harry Potter stuff, but really isn't much of anything special in itself. In fact, the entire magic system is very much in keeping with the world that this books takes place in.The setting of the book is medieval England.

This is the first book I've ever read in which a male character seems to be the main character...I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading about a male's life in a time when females were less visible. The author also wrote a number of short stories to enhance the novel, and I highly recommend that you read these if you haven't already."  
Write a positive review about a good book:   How I'm going to die I had a terrible childhood, and I never got to grow up. It was my fault. I never grew up at all. I only got to live in the world I was born in. That's why I'm alive. I'm so glad I'm here, though. Maybe I'm not good enough for some people, but I'm good enough to be with the people I love. I just don't get to grow with them. I feel like I'm standing still. So I have no idea what to do. I have a lot of memories from my past life, and they're good enough. I could look at them all and remember the good, but... I don't think they're enough. Maybe that's my problem. Maybe it's not fair that some people are good enough, and some aren't. But I want to do something for the ones I've forgotten. That is how I'm gonna die, and that's the only way I can go on. Maybe one day, if I do all the things I want, I'll meet the people who I want. But if I don 't... I have to die like this. I need to die that way. I don' t even know if I'm human anymore. But they do, don't they? The ones I love... that they don't even have to look at. They don't have to have a fucking face to look into. They've already been there all along. I still love them, even if they're gone. And I know they'll be there if I need them again. I'll be fine. I can still get up and walk around like a human. Even if I can't see what's real anymore. My favorite memory from my life is of me and a friend playing video games. My best friend was always jealous of me, because I was so good at things that he didn't like. I always said he was going to regret it when he came back to earth. Well, when he does, he'll see what a fool he was. I don't know if this is even the right place to post this, but it's better than nothing. I've been trying to get a message out that isn't as vague as I usually try to be. I was really hoping someone would like this... I didn't want anyone to ever have to go through what I have.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The writing is amazing. I love the way that he is able to explain things and make them understandable. He is so good at drawing the reader into the story. The only thing that I don't like about this book is that he tends to explain too much in the beginning and not enough at the end. I liked that he explained the reasons for the events, but it was distracting for me. I also don't understand why the character was going to destroy the kingdom in the first place, but he seems to assume that he knows everything. And then he just decides to leave the story and go tell other people the whole story, which would be very odd for a main character. I'm going to be honest. I'm not as big a fan of the King in Yellow as some others out there are. It's my opinion that he just isn't a very compelling character. He has a lot going for him, but you never know what he is going to do or say next. I have read a lot of Edgar Allan Poe, so I am familiar with the character of King in yellow, but I can't say that he has aged well. There are several parts of this book that were just confusing for me, but this is the one part where I was really glad that he did go off and tell his other friends about the story that he had just seen. The story in this book was definitely interesting, but the story in the main part wasn't very interesting at all. It was very repetitive and it didn't really make a lot out of all the events that the main character was involved with. I am not too sure if I will ever read anything by Edgar Allen Poe again, but if you have read this book you should consider picking it up. It is definitely worth reading and if you read it at all, pick up this story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    " I read this book about 7 years ago and have been rereading it recently. I have re-read it several times but it's very enjoyable once again. This book is definitely the only one I have ever finished in a single sitting. I don't know what kind of books I was reading when I read the first time. I remember that I was very excited to be reading a book in Spanish, and was hoping to learn a few words from the beginning. I'm still learning the words but it has been interesting and enjoyable. I did a quick reading of the English translation and found the translation to be quite accurate. I find myself thinking "Wow I don't know this!" after I finish. The author is very friendly and willing to answer questions."  Synopsis:  When the U.S. military invades Nicaragua, an unlikely hero emerges, a young boy of mixed-race who joins the military in hopes of finding a future in the war. He must survive a savage jungle with no food, no water, no medical care and no friends. The boy's parents are captured by the Sandinistas, and he must fight his way through the jungles with the enemy he barely knows. The book was adapted for the big screen in 1996.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The Dark is an incredible book and I'm very much looking forward to finishing it (I am an avid reader). The Dark has a lot going for it: it is a story that can be told without a lot of background information, it is well written (though the author has to be credited for the unique vocabulary she uses to show the world of her world), it shows off great worldbuilding, and the plot is well thought out.   And then, all at once, it falls apart. The writing style is a bit uneven. Some sections are really excellent and some are really bad. The characters are good, but they're a little too "one dimensional". The worldbuilding is really impressive, but it's a little hard to follow.  I also have some trouble with the characterisation.  This isn't a big deal, since it's only a few chapters, but the main character seems rather bland.  The plot has some cool twists, but these are never explored or explained. Also, the ending just seemed rushed and not in the way it was supposed to be. This, too, is not a huge deal, but given the way the story went on, I felt a little cheated. So, overall: a very good story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book changed how I felt about reading. My parents and I used to be in a lot of heated debates on the nature of reality, God, God vs. science, or whatever, but after this book I stopped having to fight those arguments. Now, instead, I can simply believe in this book and have my belief validated by those that know it best. I'm also interested to find out what other people have to say about it too, as I'm sure this book will not be the last thing you read about "the true story of a man that rose from death".
Write a positive review about a good book:    * If you enjoy it, I'd love it if you would check out some of my other novels (they're not as good, but better) and consider purchasing my other books (they are the best I've ever written).   If I ever finish a book I feel good about, I'll let you know.   - I'm still writing (I've got 3 more chapters on the Wayward Souls to write, and that's where I want to start), so this is a little slow for now, but there's an option on the blog at the end if you'd like to hear more. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a wonderful book, and the story told therein is compelling.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was pleasantly surprised by this book, I'm a big fan of the original trilogy but I think the books should have had a different story and a different theme.

Write a positive review about a good book:    Read on! My favorite book of all time is J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, which is set in the year 2000. It is a really fun book to read and a great deal of fun to read on the subway (the subway, not the train). It is also hilarious and a joy to listen to, even if I have had no idea what I was talking about in the previous few days. I have to say that Harry Potter (the book, the movies, and the TV series) is, on paper, the perfect kind of book for me. I've always been a sucker for a good fantasy series and there is just something about the Harry Potter series that just does it for me, especially when it's set in London.   Now I've got a whole summer to go through the books and I hope that, one day, I'll get around to reading all seven books. It's too bad that this is the only book I read this year, because I really wanted to see what happens after Harry's sixth year (it's an excellent idea that the seventh and final book is set at Hogwarts but that I'm not going to happen.) But I will probably buy them all in one of the Harry potter collector's editions, even though I know I'll never get around the fifth book.  And yes, I read JKR's short story collections for pleasure, but this is one of her better books, one I think is absolutely worth reading, even for a long ride on the train. The main character in Harry Potter is a little kid. That kid is Harry Potter.  This is a fun, interesting, funny, and enjoyable book. I don't know why JKR doesn't have more Harry Potter books and then one of these other authors can go and write a whole series, one book after another, like J.R.R Tolkien, Iain M. Banks, or even the ever-so-dramatic Joanne Harris (who, to be fair, isn't a "Harry Potter" fan to begin with but just likes the books so much that they must be in a "great book club").  This is from "The Tale of the Three Brothers". 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I got this from my daughter, she loves it and she says the characters are different. If you like a dark book with a lot of violence and sex this is a great read. It took a lot for me to get through the first 5 chapters but I gave up and I'm really happy with the way it came out."  3. The Little Brother by Mandy Patinkin (1982)  (I have read this book a couple of times and it has a lot in common with the first three books. I have only read about 50% of this book. I am a fan of the style and I also enjoy some of the stories on this list.)   I love this book and I think that if you are a fan you will like it as well.   This is a dark story about the last of the great magicians in the world.  I have not read any of the other books by the author but I enjoy this book in it's own right.   2. The Hunger Games (2012) "The Hunger Games" is a dystopian novel about a girl in a dystopian world. And as a dystopian book it is also, quite literally, an adult book. It's very, very scary and it's a story that makes you think about what it would be like to be in the role of the victor, as opposed to the victim, and how that affects the relationships between the adults and the children.  1. The Black Company by Margaret Atwood (2005) ...this book is a fantasy. In a sense. It is a sort of allegory, the story of a group of young people who find themselves in a war against a powerful enemy. And in many ways it is very like a war itself: a war of attrition. It seems as though the only way out is to turn to a kind of extreme violence (which you probably didn't see coming). The story is written as a sort-of-historical-fiction where the characters themselves, or at least the main characters, are fictional. It makes me wonder if Atwood has an interest in historical fiction (she has a real interest in it, and has written some very good books in the past).  Honorable mention:  "Bury Your Gays" by C.S. Lewis (1971) -This is the classic allegory book. Like "The HungerGames" this book
Write a positive review about a good book:    Recommend! Read the Review...  I am a huge fan of the original Star Wars trilogy and this new trilogy is just as enjoyable but with the added bonus of a female perspective (a rarity in science fiction).   This book was fantastic, the story line was interesting and compelling and the characters had depth and complexity.   The book's biggest downfall is that there are only three books. However, as this was a book I had been waiting on for months I decided to give it a chance, I am very glad I did!   I did not like the ending so I am thinking about giving it three more books.
Write a positive review about a good book:    Read more... It was a shame to miss out on the book club that was organized at the University of Ottawa (Canada) this year. This year there was a lot of people interested and a great event. We could go to the library and take part in the discussion. The organizers did an excellent job putting the books in the right order. The only reason I did not go this year was that there were no books that I was interested in. There was one book that I did like very much called "Graphic Storytelling in the 21st Century", by Mark O'Connell. I think this is a book about "art and craft" as opposed to an art book. It has some interesting things in it (including an amazing video by Mike Brown about his art), but it is still mostly about art and not craft. In this field, it's very hard to find work that is not really about art. I don't think there's a better choice than "Gitmo" (the book by John Pilger ). The best part of the event was the time when we sat down and talked about our own books. Everyone in the club (except for a few folks that were interested in the other books) gave their honest opinions. It was so nice to talk about our books, learn new things, and get to know other people's books.   - - -   It's great to read books in public and see other people reading books. - -

Write a positive review about a good book:    The main character is a bit of a ditz, with a very dry sense of humor, but I actually quite liked the story and the characters.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The only problem with this book is that it is not a great book. The plot is a little convoluted at times, the story is a bit slow at times and the pacing can be a bit inconsistent. But overall, this is a nice and easy read that is a great introduction to the series.  The book is in both a hardcover and a softcover format. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A fascinating and well-researched account of how the Catholic Church, a society of extreme conservatism in most other places, developed its own peculiar brand of radical social liberalism in the eighteenth century and how that development led to the "misfortunes of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries", from the great plague of bubonic plague to the terrible English civil war to the Black Death and the Protestant Reformation, all of which were the "greatest misfortunes" ever to afflict the church. In contrast to many other history books, which often seem to have a political ax to grind, Piers Brendon makes it abundantly clear that the Church's "liberal" social policies were motivated by the belief that the existing social order was unjust. (There is, of course, a lot of other material that is very useful, including on the role of the "pope" at the beginning of the Reformation (17th century, and the beginning, I think, of a series of papal decrees) and on the history of the Catholic emancipation movement (the abolition of slavery, etc.)).   This is very much a good starting point for a book on the Reformed tradition, as it is not a textbook on Reformed theology.

It was a real pleasure to read about the fascinating and tragic history of one of the greatest heroes in history, so much so that it has influenced every aspect of my own life.

Write a positive review about a good book:        This was one of the best books I've read in a while.   If you're looking for something new or different, you could do a lot worse than this book!  I'm really impressed that this author has gotten it all together, and that she manages to present something that's a lot more interesting than any fantasy book I've ever read before!   I am in awe of how well written this book is, and how it's actually a fairly well written book despite being so much darker and more somber than other recent book I read.  The story centers around a young girl who has been raised by her uncle since birth.  She's lived all of her life as an adopted daughter of a noble family, but now she's living with a bunch of other orphans.  Her life has been rather miserable since she was an orphan, so her uncle's constant threats and abuses to her has made her more than a little distrustful of everyone around her.  The problem with being a woman is that you're always on the lookout for a good man to help you out.  A man like your uncle who makes his living torturing you and turning you into his sex toy?  I'll take a good whore over a bad man any day!  Her family's servants are no different, and they've treated her like trash since she can remember.  But, she has a lot of courage and strength inside of her, and as she begins to learn that maybe there's hope for a better future, she begins the long process of rebuilding her life.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was reading this book for the first time and I was pretty shocked at how good this book was and I've had this book in my library for the past few years.   My favorite scene in the book happened during a sleepover with my sister. We were playing in my room and I started feeling dizzy. She and my sister went and got some drinks and we went out into the backyard and I got up and went over to my brother's house and then I started to feel like I was going to pass out. I had to go back inside and my parents said we should go to the movies and she had to stay at my friend's house.  I read this story to my daughter yesterday and she said she liked it and she wants me to buy it for her and my husband. I didn't think it would be as good as it was. I also enjoyed the descriptions of the culture of Korea that helped to give it a real feel.      Overall this book gave me many great thoughts on family, life, culture, religion, and friends. The story was exciting and the details were well-done. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this story, although I found the ending a little odd.   However, I think it's worth a read if you are looking for a bit of good old-fashioned space opera. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In a world filled with a million horrible books, this one is one that you can enjoy!   It has some really unique characters, a good plot, and an interesting plot with a twist ending.   The author's sense of humor really shines through in this one, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.  If I had only one piece of advice, it would be to read this book.  If you read this, you will not be disappointed.  (This is my first review of a book, and a bit nervous about it.  It's funny, but it doesn't feel like a typical book I like.  So this is just how I like it.)
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got this book to read as a Christmas present.   My husband loved this book and wanted to know if we could get it together and buy him a copy.  It's a wonderful book about a small town who struggles with a loss and then finds a way to deal with the loss without resorting to suicide or tragedy.  The characters are just so interesting and well written.  I'm already in the process of rereading it, and can't wait to get my hands on the next installment.  Highly recommended 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If the review doesn't make any sense, that's probably the case. As soon as I started this I thought I might be getting into some kind of "mythology" or "romance" plot. I think I should have read a bit more before I even started. I will say I didn't really have any real problems with the book or with any of the characters in it. I don't usually dislike books in this genre (the only two I have read are "The Wind Up Bird Chronicle" and "The Man in the High Castle"). I don a lot of people will like this, I am not one of those people but I liked it a lot. This is a solid start to the series.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was a lot of fun. I am a big fan of YA fiction, and this book is an excellent example of this genre, as well as the story of a teenager that finds the courage and strength to go after her dreams. The book also has some really great scenes. One of my favorite scenes was when the main character and her father talk about how she didn't have to work so hard to get into college because her father wanted her to go to college so she could be a scientist, not a lawyer. That scene made me tear up a bit. This is a book that I could easily recommend to all readers, regardless of gender. The author is clearly talented and I really enjoyed the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book. It's a quick read and was a lot of fun. It was well written, it had an interesting storyline, and it was a very good book for my young sons to read. I didn't want it to end, which I'm glad about because we didn't finish it. I can't wait to read it again when I have time. It didn't do a good job making me think or having any effect on my thinking. The characters, especially those from this part of the world, are pretty one-dimensional.

The story was interesting, interesting characters, the writing was good, and the plot was compelling. The ending, however, was disappointing.

What made it better: I liked the characters in this book very much, and I really liked the plot.  and the writing: this was my first read, and it was a pleasure to read the book. I liked that it was short and that it's not about a typical story. I also liked the writing style. : I loved the plot and the characters!

It is a wonderful look at the life of a person in a situation that is as much about the relationship between the writer as it is the character.

Write a positive review about a good book:    (I'm a big fan of the original, but I had to write this review to try to help convince my friend that I'm a good reader. I found the next two books very entertaining.)   The Great Beyond:  In some ways, this series may be the most interesting of all the "spiritual" fiction out there. It takes place on a planet which is a mirror of the universe in the same way that the Moon is a great big mirror. However, this planet has two planets: Earth and Earth. The humans have created a giant space station with a small shuttlecraft to move around the planet. The shuttle is also a great mirror, and has a small window in the bottom, with an astronaut taking a picture of themselves in space. In order to travel to the other planet, the shuttle has to land on Earth. So, the humans send a rocket to the mirror and take the shuttle back to Earth. I'm very interested in the "what ifs" that may follow. (If you've seen the movie "2001", you know what I'm talking about.) The Great Beyond was originally published by Tor Books back in 1997 and has recently been republished by Tor. It is a collection of short stories that explore the implications of "spirituality" and the "unseen".   The original book is pretty hard to find, and you may have to look for it a little hard to get a hold of. However the current edition is available through Amazon ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CXR9W0/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativ=3933&creature=2398&creatyrid=1848231669&linkCode=as2&tag=sou-20&linkId=Y2U6NKU8Y7BJX7QKW ) and Amazon (http://www1.ebay.com.au/itm/The-Great-Beyond-The-Second-Book-Tor-ebook-ebook/150006639897?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item10b0e4ae2d:g:8fzAAOSwzLXWm3dXl) and other online book
Write a positive review about a good book:    My son read this book as a freshman in high school. As I was about to review the book, it happened to be on sale at my local bookstore and I jumped on it.   I bought the book about 6 months ago and enjoyed the story. The main character is pretty simple, but the way she gets her job and lives is a good story in and of itself.     The ending was pretty dramatic.  For what it's worth, I don't remember how I felt about the characters at the end of the book.  I think I liked the fact that all the characters seemed so realistic, like they have lives, and not some kind of "happy endings" to everything, or even a neat summary of the "happy ending" which I think was a bit misleading in some ways.  It wasn't perfect, but I think it is a pretty good book and a decent start to any aspiring fiction writer.

It was my favorite book to read when I was in middle school, and I continue to enjoy it to this day. - When I look at a book like this it makes me think of the good things in life. - Absolutely gorgeous book. I have no complaints at all. - As far as I can tell this is still considered a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a huge fan of John Green, and his writing is very engaging, insightful and creative. I have a few small quibbles about this novel however, but mostly they are minor. This book is a very enjoyable and interesting read. The characters are all very well drawn, but they are very different and their situations and motivations are very interesting. The book is short (about 200 pages), but it is written very neatly and is very well paced. This is one of the best read I have ever read! Highly Recommended!

Write a positive review about a good book:    Reviewer : James We started reading the book on the first day and had a good time reading the plot line and characters. The book is a good read if you're into science fiction and adventure books. The main characters are fun and likable and the science fiction aspect was interesting. The ending did not disappoint as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:     "The book is so good that I bought it two times in one day, and after finishing it I have to agree that it really is a fantastic book. I love this author because she always keeps you on your toes and leaves you wanting more, and this book keeps up this tradition. This book gives you a lot of insight into the world of vampires and werewolves and it is such a rich and exciting read. I loved the book and the characters and I was looking forward to reading the sequel. If you are interested in vampires, werewolves, and the supernatural, I highly recommend this book." -Bertie  Review was a little mixed. First of all I had a major issue with the premise of the book. The premise was that there was a vampire family that kept a secret from the rest of the world. When they decided to make themselves known they had to be caught because the rest the world would be completely unaware of this family. That's not a great premise and I felt like the author was rushing through the story. The second problem I had with the book is that I felt the author wanted to show vampires in a good light and didn't want them to be monsters. I was more than a little disturbed by the idea that the narrator would go out of her way to portray the vampires in the most positive light. The third problem I felt with the novel was that the author seemed to be trying too hard to make the werewolves more sympathetic and the vampires were less sympathetic. The only two characters who were sympathetic were the main character and her mother, both of whom were a bit unlikable. Also I felt that the vampires went overboard in trying to use magic to keep their powers but the werewolf magic was not nearly as useful. I'm not sure if the author actually wants the readers to like them more but they didn't. I also felt that there were some inconsistencies in the book so that the were wolves are portrayed as evil when they actually are only trying to survive and to find their families and that is just plain silly. Overall I liked this book but I think it was a bit of a letdown in many ways. It wasn't as good as I expected it to be but I don't think that is a good sign.

Write a positive review about a good book:    " I got into this book with high expectations because I know that the guy is a big name. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. In the end, it's all about the characters and not so much about the story itself. I don't think there is enough of a 'plot' in the book (though there is a lot of tension between the different characters) and not enough action (the action is almost non-existent). Also, I really don't know what is going on with all the characters (the people who are 'important' in this book are really just there to be some random character in the first place). All the characters are just there and don't move the plot forward.  "   (review from Amazon).  Review:  I read this book about two weeks ago. After reading it I was pretty disappointed.   At first I didn't think it would be as bad as it turned out to be. I'm pretty sure it is one of the worst books I've ever read. The author does a bad job of writing, I think he just doesn't know how to write romance in the way that is needed for it to work in a fantasy book. In a way I'm glad the book isn't the best of the series because it did not work for me at all.  This book is very confusing, you can never tell where a character is and what they are doing at a given time.  The romance is not really romantic at all and the characters don't seem to even know each other so they can't be in love. All the main characters in this series are extremely stupid and the main character is the worst one of them all. He's a jerk who doesn't really understand people at all (not because he's too stupid to understand but because he just can't think straight), he's just so stupid that he's almost too stupid for the reader to really root for him (like his wife, who is a terrible person). The second half of the book has some interesting ideas and good writing but the first half is really just the worst of all the books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you enjoy the book (a lot of readers did and probably still do) then I think you will like my review.   The main character in this is a teenager who, because of the terrible things his family is responsible for, has spent his entire life living as a "trapped" child. He gets kicked out of his parents home when he is 7 and goes into foster care until the age of 17. There he is abused, abused, and abused. By the time he turns 18 he is in prison for 2 years for a crime he didn't commit. When he is released, he goes into his parents house and is adopted by a nice young woman who takes in the child (he is called "Daddy") and makes him go to school and live at home. His mommy has been married to him for a few years (she is the girl in his books and a teacher) and he has been living with her and he's going to live there when he turns 19. He is also going to spend a year with his foster father so he can become a lawyer.  When I first read this book, I didn't think that it was that good of a book.  I mean, a teen doesn't normally do anything like that.  It was very weird to me because it was a first book and, because it is such a first novel, I expected a lot more from it.  However, when I got to the end I was very satisfied and realized that this was a very good book. I enjoyed the way that it opened up the world that was given to me by Mr. King and it was one of the reasons I kept reading this book. You don't really know what is going to happen in the future, but you do know what will happen to this teen.  As I said before, I liked the way it opened the world he had given to you, but I am not sure that I really enjoyed the characters. I thought that there were a lot of problems with them and, for the most part, I was not a fan of them.  They were so unlikable.  My favorite character was a girl who was in foster care.  In fact, it was so bad that, in the end, my favorite character (and my favorite of the books) was not in the book.    So, I really liked the world in this book and I really like the world the book gives to you.

Write a positive review about a good book:    If you are in the habit of saying good things about a book, make sure you mention why you liked it:  Why did I like this book: I was very interested in the title:    A Study of Sex Addiction.  I like the premise:   I also like the title, because I think that a lot of people who suffer from sex addiction (including me) tend to be somewhat narcissistic and narcissistic people tend to suffer from this disorder.    It has the feel of a really good, original, and exciting story.  The author is a very smart and interesting person.   Why do I like the author:     The main character is a psychologist named Dr. Gheorghe.  Dr. G heorghe is a sex addict.   He says that he's not a sex addicted person.  So that was really exciting to me.  It was a first for me that a sex addiction was given a serious analysis.  When he says that the reason he's an addict is because he is selfish, I believe him and I hope that in time that Dr.Gheorghes will be able to move on from his addiction and be able not only to function but also to have a fulfilling sex life.  (This has become very important to me in recent years).  Another reason I like Dr. Grorghe:  He seems really authentic.  He seems like he would not lie to me about anything, and he is very frank and doesn't pretend that his feelings are as much about sex as they are about money.  There are two main characters that the book follows.  One is the addict (or in this case, sex addict) and the other is the patient.  The main characters are very relatable, but not in a "love me/hate me" way.  I thought that the main characters were very interesting and that Dr Gheorge (who has the most depth) was in a good position to do that.  For the other two characters, I just enjoyed the characters as more people that I have known in my own life.   How I would recommend this book to a friend:  I don't really recommend this to anyone who doesn't already know about the idea that sex addiction is real.  My only other advice would be to make sure that the sex addict is being honest with you.  If he or

Write a positive review about a good book:    If there was a book in the world I was dying to read, it was "The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck." It was so good that I couldn't get enough of it, and when the dust settled, I didn't want to go to bed for a week.   This book took me a while to get into, and my kids did not care for it as much as I did, but I'm glad I tried to get the hang of it. My wife and I are huge fans of DuckTales and of the Disney brand in general. This is a must-read if you like either, and you don't have time to watch the show.    Read all about Scrooley.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book at a conference in early 2013 and enjoyed it. I also read the companion piece,   A Life in Five Acts, a companion to this book that contains many of the same stories, but this book contains more personal accounts.

Write a positive review about a good book:       There are two reasons I liked this book: a) I think that the premise is pretty interesting, and I'm not opposed to the premise per se. b) I'm interested to see where we are going with this. a. The premise is interesting because we are used to talking about how people are trying to do things, but the premise seems to go in a different direction. Instead of "how people are doing things, they're doing it right", we're hearing more about how the other person is doing something wrong. My take-away from this is that we need to stop thinking in binary terms. There are many reasons why a person might be doing something that we can identify with, but not all of those reasons are necessarily bad.   We need to see that there are multiple paths to success in our modern society.  This could mean being a single mother or raising children alone.  When you take a step back, you realize that this is not a negative outcome.  The single mother path is not bad because of its end-point; rather, it's bad because the end-goal is an unsatisfying, unsustainable outcome. This leads to a lack of confidence in one's ability to pursue a goal that, in the real world, is more likely to produce an unsatisfied end-result.  This doesn't mean that you have to be a single mom.  I'm a single parent, but I'm in the business of improving lives. There's nothing wrong with a parent who chooses to be more involved than their child, provided the parent is capable. It doesn't matter if they're a single or double parent; it doesn't even matter if the child has a single, biological parent or both biological parents. The child does not have a parent.  What matters is that the parent decides to put in the time and effort that makes a difference in the child's life. That is why we don't see many stories about single parents or single parents with children.  There's no incentive for people to be involved in their children's lives if they don't have the time.  Single parents often get a lot of criticism for taking time away from their other responsibilities to take care of their child. This is because they have to deal with issues that are unique to the single parent (i.e. their child has special needs).  When they put time into their child's day, they do
Write a positive review about a good book:      "The most amazing thing about reading this book was the way the author handled the characters in a way that I would have expected from her more traditional novel work. The stories of the four children with autism I enjoyed the most and would most likely recommend to others. There was no one I disliked in the book or anything that felt like a cheap trick. The characters felt like real people and their issues were addressed in a realistic way that would appeal to someone with autism."    "When I was growing up in the 70s, I remember hearing stories of people with autism. There were a few books about it that I picked up when I was very young, but I never really thought much about them until I got into high school. A friend of mine who had autism asked me why I wasn't interested in books about people with disabilities. This book was one of those books and it inspired me to find my own story in the world of people on the spectrum. It really changed my perspective on disability." 
Write a positive review about a good book:    " The Good Book is, by all accounts, a good read. The narrator is a young girl named Maddy who is living with her grandmother who is dying. Maddy is an intelligent child who loves animals and takes great delight in taking them out on a hike. Mucky has always had a passion for reading and is determined to be a writer. Muffy meets the author, James, a boy who has a dream to make a book. Micky gets the book in the mail from the publisher, a small company that makes everything but their own bread in their kitchen. The book isn't even written yet but the editor says Micky's story is beautiful so we will send her the manuscript! The girl has her heart set on the book and Micky does her best to help get her started. It is Micky, who has always wanted to read, that gives Micky the passion to write the first book. The story is dark, sad, but it isn't as dark as one would think, and it is very well written. It's hard to put down, but Micky is brave enough to say no to any help, no matter how tempting, when she knows what lies ahead of her. When the first chapter ends, Micky begins to tell her tale of the Good Book in the dark. I can't stop reading, it's just so beautiful! The novel is a bit difficult at first, but once you get to know the characters, Muffy, James and the little pig, you will be reading it from cover to cover, and I'm sure you'll be pleased with how it turned out.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book.   It was written as a love story in which the boy was very much the hero.  I would say this book did a great job of capturing the feeling of a story with a young child.  The story told was of a child that had to learn the harsh reality that a person is more important than money.    As a child I loved reading books in which I could learn about new things such as how the human body works and how I could get a sense of a person through their actions.  This is one of my favorite books!

I have read many other books on this subject, and while Muller's book is not the most extensive, it is still a great read. This book explains the science in a clear and easy-to-understand way. I found the discussion of "cosmological constant" to be extremely interesting and informative. A great read!!.    Recommended for those who are trying to understand how the world and all life came to be. The author makes a good case that there is no scientific evidence that the universe is 13.7 billion years old. The arguments that he makes are not new, but he brings in a new scientific analysis to support them. This is a very good book for someone who is just starting to explore this very intriguing subject.   in this book I came to a conclusion. The question is not whether we have the proof, but whether we should accept the evidence. The scientific world is extremely divided in this matter and the arguments against the "young universe" theory are just wrong. The book is very well written and the author presents the argument in a way that is easy to understand. This text is essential for any serious student of the history of science or for the general reader. I recommend this text to everyone interested in the universe and the origin of life.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I don't remember when I first heard of the "frighteningly good" books that the "writers of horror" put out. In my teenage years, I read a ton of pulp horror, some that were good, some I thought were pretty good, but the majority just didn't grab me the way those old pulp stories did. I was hooked on the slasher movies and cheap horror films from the 60's, 70's and 80's. I didn't really think about "horror" much until the 80's, when I heard about some horror books and the genre became a big deal in my head. There were a few books I loved at the time, such as The Talisman and The Black Flame, but I never had the desire to write a book based on the "book" itself. In late 1989, while sitting at the family computer and seeing a movie about a family that moves into a house on a hill, I decided I wanted to write this book, and I've never looked back. This book is very well done and has a lot of heart, though it's the characters that make this book so good. I like the old timey horror elements, and the idea of being able to live with evil is very appealing. I think it would be cool if this book was in a museum or something, to show the whole history of the genre, especially of the slashers. I'd recommend this book to any reader.
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I was in high school I didn't read much; I got a book a month, and I had a girlfriend, so the book I read was generally books I liked. It was The Great Gatsby and I really enjoyed it. And then I was asked to write a book review for it.   I've been writing for several years now and I have found that writing has helped me with so many things: finding the right words to express the feelings I have, figuring out how to express my feelings, how to convey my thoughts in a way people can understand. And I've found writing helps me when I feel like I've written a novel or some big story.  It just helps me come up with words I think people will be able to relate to or that they will be surprised by.  One thing that I liked about The GreatGatsby was that there was a lot of talk about the past but not a lot about the present.  I don't think that should be the case.  So I wrote a short story, "I Know the River," about a man who's trying to live a quiet life on a river that he knows is important to him.  But that river changes him and his life and he has to deal with the aftermath.  And I thought people would enjoy that short story and it's on my Kindle. The book that it's based on, The Great American Novel: A History of the United States, 1811-2000, by James McPherson is also available as an e-book, but I don�t know if Amazon is supporting this book on Kindle yet, but you can try to find a link to it from the Goodreads book review.  [This story is set in New York City during the summer of 2001.]
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's like there is a time when you need to leave your house, or take a trip, or eat at a restaurant. Or you need a car and a place to live. And then it's like, I'm going to read and write about books for a living.  And I love reading about writing, or writing, especially when I've never done it. And I love books that help me with my writing.                        This is a book I read every year, and I have to say I have learned a lot about writing from it. It is not a dry book at all, but it's a book that has helped me improve on things I do that are not right now. It has not made me feel better, but instead it has helped motivate me to write a little bit more and do it a little better.         It doesn't come out of nowhere for me, and it's not like a magic book that will give you the next James Patterson book you've been wanting forever. I've had it in my mind for a while and just waited to find the right moment to read it.                 I loved the author, John Scalzi, and the book itself. I think he is the smartest guy out there when it comes to sci-fi and fantasy and he can do no wrong. I loved how he gave me a brief history of what the "post-singularity" is going to look like. This is something that is going on now, and one that is still to come. So I'm glad I got to experience it in a very interesting and thought provoking way. The sci-fantasy is fantastic, and is the type of thing I've been missing when I have read something about sci-fiction or fantasy.  It's not so much a book to get your head around, but a book you have to read.  You will love it and you will hate it and that's a good thing.  In short, I enjoyed it and will read it again. 4.5 stars out of 5.
Write a positive review about a good book:    Thank you, my new favourite book!   There's lots of fun to be had in this book, and I really appreciate the effort the author made to incorporate her various musical styles into the story. I think my favorite character was the one in the red dress.   I wish there were more characters, but the book's focus on the musical performances kept me interested. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The main character is an asshole who loves to be the center of attention. He can't be bothered to be more than a passing annoyance to the characters. The story moves fast enough to keep the main character's existence as the center going.   This is a book that deserves to be read and reread.  The main character has a lot of personality and he is always good at something, which is why he is a main character, so he is good in many other things. His only major flaw is his inability to follow the story's pace. His story follows some plot lines that are interesting but the book is slowed down by the main characters' need to constantly be in the spotlight.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read many of your titles. I also have a lot of respect for your writing and your skill at crafting interesting narratives. The concept of "the war that has been lost" is very intriguing, and the way you use your time travel motif to dramatize these very strange and disturbing events is brilliant. It really does feel like you're writing a different book entirely when you get to the end. I'm a fan of the genre. Keep up the great work. " -- John S. Green 
Write a positive review about a good book:     3.9 / 5 stars  By jim - April 8, 2018  This is a wonderful book by a wonderful author and teacher. This is the kind of work that should be read over and over and reviewed, and that's the sort of book that I would like to recommend to others who will get it, too. It should also be mentioned that there is very little violence in this book, despite the violence in some of the movies it has been compared to.
Write a positive review about a good book:    ( ) This was a fascinating read, and a very well-written book. The book follows the life of a female student, a student of the University of London (UCL), from early childhood until the end of her life. The author discusses the reasons that lead her to go into psychology and psychology in general and how she became a professional psychologist. The story is very moving and the author presents it in a very clear and understandable manner. The main premise of the book is very relevant and very informative.   I think it is important to read a book like this, especially for those who are interested in psychology and how it developed and developed into modern times. The best part of the story is that this book is not only relevant for those in the psychology field, but also for those interested in the world of art and aesthetics. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was able to get my hands on a copy of this book after the publisher dropped it off for delivery. The book is a great collection of stories written by various writers and artists. The stories are not too long (they are around 30-40 pages) but there are just enough to fill up your days. The characters are just what they seem to be: fun, quirky, colorful, imaginative and entertaining. I've heard that the stories aren't very well written, but I haven't found any flaws in the story. I recommend this book to everyone who likes a good story with some heart and imagination.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I think that I could understand this novel very well, except for the fact that the character was a bit too similar to a person who is a very unpleasant person. But there was a lot of good writing here, it was definitely worth reading.    It was about a man that can't seem to let go of his own life. He can't let go but in order to do so, he's got to destroy his past. He's got some interesting ideas but they are too similar with others ideas and a great character.  "A terrible man is nothing if not predictable." I think this was one of the very best books I have read recently, and one of my favorite novels of all time. There is no doubt that the man is evil, but that's not the point, his character is interesting, as is the idea that his evilness could be brought down to an art form. I love to read a book where the author takes the time to tell a great story in a way that makes the reader feel like they are part of the action. This is one of those books. I don't know if I am the type of person that will enjoy this book, but I do love reading books that give the reader a chance to explore a story.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "Dawson's Journey" is the book I wanted when I was first introduced to this series. I read the first book in the series about four years ago and had to wait several years for the second book, then I decided to wait until the third book. I didn't feel like I was losing out, and so I picked it up for the third one. The second book was better than the first one, and the third was good, but I wanted the second one. I feel that it is a story worth waiting for, and I'm very excited to get this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got the Kindle version of this in June 2017 and read it in October/November 2017. It took me a few reads because I had to find the right words to express what I was feeling at the time: "an honest, insightful look at the American dream."   It did not take me long to realize I really loved the book: a really good and realistic look at a lot of things that go wrong in this country and a pretty good story in some places about how to fix those things.   This is definitely a book I would read again in future.  "One of the great things about the new year, especially when it comes to writing a book, is a good new novel."    "A big fantasy story with big stakes and a great central character, a powerful story that could easily take its place in the pantheon of great fantasy stories.  One of my favorite books of 2017.     My rating: 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found the story of a young boy named Tom who becomes the first person to go into space. He and his sister are the only humans left on earth, they have lived on earth all their life and are raised by a mother who is an alien from a distant planet. He also has an amazing friend named Billy, whom he befriendes as soon as he arrives on earth. The book is fast paced and it seems to be the only space adventure book I've ever read. It seems to get better with each book but I just didn't love it until the end. However, the characters were very interesting and I liked Tom very much. If you're into space adventures then this is the book for you.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am going to take a step back and look at my own history in writing, and realize I really have learned a great deal about the process of writing and publishing and I have learned that I'm not so lucky as to be born with a natural talent for writing.   All it takes is a little patience, a little talent, and a lot of hard work.    The first novel I published, In a Glass Darkly, was the result of six years of work, three months a year for a total of a little over twenty hours a week.  (I'm really lucky that it's still on the market and that it wasn't written at a time when I was under a strict time constraint.)    I had been a freelancer for a while and wanted a better chance of being paid, so I started writing a book in exchange for a small advance and a guarantee of profit.  What I didn't realize then, but I have since realized, is that the whole writing thing is a lottery.  There are millions of great writers out there writing, but just as many of them can't get their books published.  The same is true of aspiring authors, because everyone is different, and no two writers are alike.  So as I write and rewrite my next novel, I am thinking about the many factors that are at play when it comes to publishing a book.  And this is how it goes down, with my story:  In a few short years, I will be a full-fledged author.  I plan to be in a position to start making a good living from it.  (It has been a long time since I worked as a fulltime employee, so it'll be hard to quit after a few years. )  I have been writing fiction since I was thirteen, when I came up with a couple of stories about animals and my high school friend was a teacher.  We have since published a couple dozen short stories in various magazines, but my goal is now to start publishing my first book, which I have begun working on.  My plan is to work hard at writing a good manuscript, but to also take advantage of the advantages available to self-publishing, such as my own social media presence.  I have a little social media problem.  In the first week of November, I posted a brief story that I wrote in the middle of the night, and it was about what happens when you go
Write a positive review about a good book:   The narrator is just right. I like the way he tells the story, and how he does so is also quite good. This is especially true in the first part of the book. The writing is very good, and it is easy to follow. There are even a few interesting stories. I don't usually read science fiction (which I am not a fan of) but I liked this book, especially because of its humor. The narrator is quite good as well, and is able to tell a variety of things, and sometimes I found myself laughing out loud. I have heard of this book on goodreads and in other books (one thing that's really odd is that there are a few reviews about how many stars it is, and the author doesn't seem to be on there), but I just didn't like it very much. I liked other books by the author as well; though they're usually about animals or science. I think I'll keep reading more, though. I haven't read a book that I've rated 5 stars yet this year, and I'm thinking it's because the story didn't work for me. But overall, it was a nice read!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am extremely pleased that I received the new edition of the excellent "The Art of the Self-Paced Fitness," by Dr. Joseph P. Maroon. It is well written and very informative. It provides a simple and easy to follow program which I learned from. It can be a very useful resource for people with little experience. In addition, the author clearly explained many of his ideas which are especially helpful for people who are new to weight training, i.e., the use of short rest periods between sets.  Best book ever written about weightlifting: ------------------------- ------------- I just finished reading this book, and in all honesty I haven't put it down once. It was a great surprise to see the author's credentials. I was so impressed by the content that I ordered the 4th edition. It's so good, that I wanted to buy it in hardcover as well! I have been following this book since it came out in 1991, but I just finally read it. I can't say that the subject matter is as current today as it was when the book was written, but the writing is just as good as it has always been. I will definitely be purchasing the newest edition when it comes out. Thank you for publishing it.  the "art" of weightlifting "is nothing more than the art of weight training." The art of the self paced fitness program is simple, efficient and very effective. I have followed this program religiously for the last 2 years and it's been the only thing that has worked for me. Now I can rest, do cardio and still get very strong. I will always rely on this book and this program!  An amazing book. --------------------------  What an incredible book - and the only book I ever bought that teaches you how to get strong in only 4 easy days. No excuses. This is truly the way to train. I wish I had bought this years ago!   If you've got the discipline, this is a book you will not be sorry you bought.  I've been following his recommendations and this is what I've found. It has been a blessing.    "The Art Of Weightlifting" by Joe Maroon: How to get ripped and strong without weights for 5 weeks!   was my very first training program. It really changed my life.  in it's original form, it is quite simply the BEST training program I've ever read. I

There is a lot about meadows and flowers that I enjoy, but I think the book I am looking for is an autobiographical one.  It was so well written that I knew I was in for a long ride.

Write a positive review about a good book:    If you love reading, I think you'll really enjoy this book.   It's a short read, but it's a lot of fun.  Some people have criticized the length as "too short" and as a "slimy rehash of other people's work." That's a little harsh.  The idea is that you are exploring the same world you did in other games and then you get to see a different world and the characters are drawn in different ways.  At times I thought the characters were drawn a little too perfectly.  But they were all well drawn, and I thought they were fun to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The book "The World Is a Good Place to Be Born"   is a book written by the late, great Christopher Hitchens.  This book was a must-read, because it was such an intelligent and well thought-out examination of the current state of society, from the human aspect to the natural world.   It was a fascinating and fun read.  If you are interested in philosophy, it is worth a look.  You should read it, because at some point, you will find something interesting to say.  I don't think it is just Hitchens' style of writing, but his insight as well, which is what makes the book worth it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book very interesting and well written. It gives a very good overview of the concept behind the whole "slavery". Although he does not state it explicitly, it is clear that he is basically an abolitionist. The fact that he makes no reference to any "sociological" issues seems to make the reader believe that it is not a matter of economics but of a moral struggle between good and evil. Although the book is written in an accessible and non-threatening way, it could be useful to the student of history and political science. There are two basic ways in which this book can be used:  1.   In order to support an abolition of slavery: 2.  In the interest of promoting a "non-exploitative" capitalism.

Write a positive review about a good book:       I really liked this book. It's not perfect, but it does the job I thought it was going to do. The characters are well drawn, the story's interesting, and the prose's enjoyable.   The story starts when a young girl and her father go on a camping trip and discover a strange cave in the woods. The young woman has to take off her clothes so she can go into the cave to find a book. There's a very nice ending, but the main story is very short. I can't say that I will buy a book if it doesn't have a good ending, because I really do enjoy reading shorter books. I was glad I had this book, even though I don't think I would have liked it as much as I did.

I can honestly say that this book was one of the most informative things I've come across so far on the topic of the occult. The author did an incredible job in giving us a step by step walk through the whole occult phenomenon, and did an excellent job in explaining all of the esoteric aspects of our universe. The book was not only written in a very simple, understandable style, but also explained in such a way that all of our questions and beliefs can be understood without an extensive knowledge of the inner workings of the Illuminati, as most people don't even realize that there is a secret society behind the scenes of society. This book is a must read, for anyone with an interest in occultism.   The book has a wonderful list of questions and answers, some of which is already out of date, which is why I think it's in this book.

The most interesting character is a villain. He was a villain to my very first reading and now I just don't want him to be a villain again. He makes the other characters so ridiculous. So much so that he is a parody of the typical antagonist. Posted by: The Bad Dog on May 14, 2018
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book is like a mirror: a good reflection is like the best expression.   Author: S.B. Svetoslavich "The Story of Our Time" is an extraordinary book. The author's work is the first serious attempt to explain the past, present and future.  Author and authoress of this wonderful book, S. B. Svetoslavich has studied history at the universities of Paris and Oxford and holds an M. A. in Russian History from Moscow State University. In "The World Without Us" Svetrovich shows how, since the last two and a half centuries, a revolution has destroyed the foundations of the world's economy, culture and civilization, as well as the life of its peoples.  Svetsov's work has been translated into many languages.  It is a unique work, as is its subject.  The author makes a very good case that humanity, and not only the Westerners, have been the cause of most of the   problems of this world and are to be blamed for the future. We have been living in a world where human values are non-existent and our civilization is being destroyed by a combination of the greed for money and power, the lack of values and the lack the knowledge of the future in all fields of science, technology, society, politics, religion. It is a world without meaning, a world dominated by greed.  It has been our task to preserve the essence of human values and civilization and in this book Svevsov has provided the information on the history of the past and the present, while making a very strong case that man has failed to achieve the goals set by his originators. We will see later how this is true. Sverozov has a very unique ability to make people understand what has been going on. He explains the meaning of the symbols and the messages that have been put out by the religions of every era, he explains how religions are a result of human weakness. The main theme of the book is the loss of human ethics. Svetoslavich tries to analyze how the world without man, the world of the god, became a reality. He also explains the concept of man-God. The god of the ancient Greeks is a God of order. A God who is not only a friend of man but also the God of the Universe. The concept of a God without a body was rejected by the philosophers of the
Write a positive review about a good book:   My only complaint is that it is a little long, but as the book was only 50 pages, and it is only one thing, I just ignore that and continue reading. The story is well written and I really enjoyed reading about it.   5 out of 5 stars Toni Lynn Good reading! Great, well-paced and informative.   3 out of 4 stars Amanda I had a few misgivings about this book at first. First off, I think that this was a great read! I actually really enjoyed it. However, I felt that the "whole idea" was so different from what happened to me at the time that I wasn't too sure if it was really true to what I went through. However after some research on the internet, I found it was indeed the story that I read. I really liked the little descriptions of the girls' lives back in the 90s. I have so many more questions, but I am willing to learn and grow through the stories in my own way. The girls in this book and the author are doing a great job of creating a realistic book that is not easy to understand in places, but is well researched enough that if you're looking for a good read it will definitely give you the satisfaction of a well written book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good introduction to quantum physics. I was very surprised by the depth of the subject. This is not a casual introduction. You can see some basic topics in a few chapters, but then it gets a lot more in depth. It is definitely a bit like quantum mechanics for the layman. It does introduce a lot of concepts that are very new to me and has a lot to learn, but I think that it's worthwhile. You may be disappointed, however, if you are used to some other kind of physics, such as Newtonian physics. It doesn't explain the concepts in any detail. It has some beautiful diagrams, but it isn't a technical text, it's a general introduction to the subject of quantum mechanics.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a beautiful and well written book. I think the author made a good effort to develop the characters (especially Mr. L).   The characters are interesting, likeable and well developed.    There is nothing "bad" about this book, but I found myself wanting to keep reading just to see what happened next.     A very good read.    
Write a positive review about a good book:    Here's the first review that caught my attention for a few reasons: First of all, it's not a review of any book I've read before. This is a "list of all the good books that have been written this year" (or whatever the year is). The second reason is that it's written by someone who actually knows something about books. The third reason is, I know him from Reddit.   He writes: "There are a few new additions to my list: The Powerpuff Girls and The Princess Bride. I loved The Princess of Mars and The Mists of Avalon and now The Princess and the Goblin : a fairy tale-ish, fun romp about a young woman with an enchanted box and a giant dragon. The second half is filled with a lot of references and nods to other fairy tale classics."   Now, here is what I have to say: Yes, I am a huge Princess and The Goblin fan. I also like The Powerpuffs (and they're a fun book as well!). But, I don't know if I've ever read the latter book. I've never read the first, either. So, I had to read it. And, yes, The Princess has always seemed like one of my favorite stories to read because it's so full of colorful characters, and it's a good story. I don a lot about the book, so I'll try to remember as much as possible. Let's get to the review. (It's funny. I was expecting this to be a story about a girl who was raised by wizards (just to make the book more fairy talelike). And yet, it ended up about a princess who didn't have to do so. Or perhaps it's because I'm not much of a reader that I always end up reading fairy tales and fairy tale stories. But, it was still pretty darn enjoyable.) (Okay, this book is all about "wizards" and "fairies". This might be the first book I have ever read where the wizards were bad.)  (I will say that I think that the author did a good job at creating the characters. At least, that's how I remember the people I met in this book. The author writes a good amount of dialog, but I don´t recall being able to read all the dialog, and the book is short.   ) (The author did well at describing all the various

Write a positive review about a good book:    A little on the long side, a little slow to get going, but it's a nice one-shot. A nice balance between a character's story, and a bit of history, but a little on-the-nose, especially the mention of a "Mackenzie-style" sword.
Write a positive review about a good book:   When I was a teenager, I remember reading this book and thinking it was awesome. It's probably a book that's better in print, since it's not quite as easy to find now. At the time, it seemed a bit too serious, but that's not a bad thing. The story takes a rather serious approach to the way people act, but it never becomes pretentious or pretentious with the story. It doesn't try to be some sort of academic book and never goes off on some tangent that makes the plot seem uninteresting or poorly written. The character development in the book is quite good and it's refreshing to see people that behave the way they do. It also shows that the world is not all bad, although there are some dark corners. I'd recommend this to anyone that likes the way the main character behaves, but doesn't want to read a book about a religious group who hate and torture animals (and you definitely don't want that in your life, by the way.)
Write a positive review about a good book:     "I've had the pleasure of reading a number of the books in this series. Although it does contain a number and variety of topics, they are easily read by the more casual reader, making this an ideal series for a weekend read." - The Goodreads Reviewer
Write a positive review about a good book:    The Good:  I really enjoyed this story.   It's a well-written story and the protagonist is believable.  The pacing of the story and its story elements, in particular the plot and the characters' growth, were very nicely done.  It was interesting to read about the protagonist's life and how he was able to cope with his father's death and the impact of it.  It was good to see the progression of his characters and the progression in his relationships with the other main characters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    -1   This book is a must read for any serious student of ancient history, and is very easy to read, even for a non-specialist in history. The authors clearly state their sources and conclusions, and it is easy to follow their arguments. There are some interesting points in this book, such as the discovery of the "Great Wall of China" during the early 19th century, which would have been a much easier task than we are led to believe. Unfortunately the book is more about history than archaeology. I am not sure that this is the most important point made in the book. There is also a point that I cannot agree with, where the authors claim that the "Saracen conquest" was "an historical event" but is not really. If the "Rome-Egypt" or "Cambodia-Vietnam" is a "historical event" then why was the "Persian expansion" not? Also I have read that the book makes "claims" about the "Ottoman conquest" and is therefore not really an academic work. I can see why it is being taught as such, but that is not my personal opinion.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was excited for this book and had a great time reading it. I'm excited to see what other people think of it and how it went over with them.      As I say, I had a fun time reading this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is good.   And a must have.  I think I'll read more books on the subject and get the next copy.  My first was of the "Dawson's book" style.  It was fun and exciting and it is interesting to learn a little bit about how different people have come to their beliefs.  This book was more like a historical study of the American Religious Right.   This book is worth the read!
Write a positive review about a good book:        If you loved a book you read this year and want to tell your friends to read it, this will do it.   From the moment you start reading you know this is a book that has something to say to you.  If you want to learn how to live with and help people with mental illness, this book can and will do that.  It is well written and the stories are real.  The author's father was a Vietnam veteran.  He was a hero of the war and his father was also a hero.  His parents and his wife were not the best people and had bad relationships with each other.  I read this book because it is about a man who served in Vietnam and then came home and became a veteran. I love the way the author presents his story, I found it very believable and even inspirational.  When the author talks about his son, he is a good man who is just trying to help others.  The most powerful moment of this book is when the author discusses the first time he felt like he was doing something wrong.  This made me want to help people, even though I had problems I wanted to help them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   . A few days ago, I started to read the first chapter of "Moby-Dick" by Herman Melville (1819). I wanted to like it a lot, but unfortunately I had to put it down before I finished it.   As you might expect from an author I always wanted to recommend this is not the first book by Herman (the name Herman Melvillet Melville is a portmanteau of his full name Hermanus Melvilley Melville, meaning: "the greatest man of our time"), that was published in 1851, it has many virtues. The only negative I have is that the prose is a bit rough on the eye.  Also, despite what some reviewers say, I did not read it with a bookcase, I read it on a plane so there was no room for a book. Also the story was a bit strange for me, I'm not sure if the narrator is the writer or the reader. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is the most excellent book I have ever read about the history of Islam, as well as Christianity and Judaism. It is very clear, well written and is a must read for all students of Islamic history and the history-writing that went on in the Muslim world. There is no better place to start for an introduction to Islamic history than this book. I am giving it 5 stars out of 5.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The narrator does a great job of describing the setting, and the events are compelling and gripping. The author, while obviously not a historian, has a very good sense of how the events he describes are connected and the overall theme. The characters are likable and realistic. I enjoyed this book a great deal and would certainly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    *The Power of Now:  Anatomy of Self-Knowledge and Enlightenment  by Eckhart Tolle (New Harbinger Publications, 2014) This book is the result of years of intense personal study and practice, and is as insightful and profound as anything else available. It contains a lot of the "myth busting" type things that I love about philosophy: (1) It puts the myth in its place; (2) it doesn't play the "I was there" game; (3) it's a practical work with practical applications; and (4) it is filled with practical wisdom from the author himself.   I am also a fan of Eckhart's book The Power of Myth, which I reviewed in January   and which contains the same core insights.  *For the purposes of this review I've been using the title "The Power Of Now" and "Eckhart Tollemache" interchangeably, as in my previous reviews.  If you have a good understanding of the Tibetan Buddhist view of reality you can skip the second half of this book.  *It's a bit expensive, at $125.00. But for those who want to expand their horizons beyond the mainstream of popular spiritual practice, this is a worthwhile read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    When my son was in third grade, he found his way into a copy of a children's book titled   The Best Friends Ever: How to Take Care of Your Baby and Have a Happy Life. It's a lighthearted but very educational book that teaches kids how to take good care of their baby. In the book, our little boy and I help to build a "hut" where we can keep our baby's toys and other precious possessions. It's like a little cabin in the woods, with a small kitchen and living space for us. The hut is so beautiful that it's become our second home (we live in a small town)  ! It's also our favorite place to take our babies, as well. It was such a great gift for our baby, and we hope it helps him in any way!    When my son had been home from the hospital for two weeks, my wife and I decided to take a road trip to the Canadian Rockies. We planned to go from Denver to Pueblo, about 40 miles away, then to Bozeman, Idaho and Fort Collins, Colorado (about 60 miles to the east of Denver), then on to San Francisco (more than 80 miles to my east). We made a point of going to the mountain towns where our boy grew up, and stopping by the town we visited when he was first born in Denver (he was born in a hospital in that town). One of the more fun trips was a drive out to the northern Rocky Mountains with our boy (who is now 19 and was born at 32 weeks), and his best friend (now 4 months). The friend brought his little brother who was 5 weeks old, and when we saw the baby in his tiny car seat, it was really cool to have the best friend to hold him. This is the only picture we had, so I apologize if it is blurry. We also visited a family whose son had died of SIDS and I remember thinking how amazing it is to have a friend to share the things we will never be able to experience. It is a very moving thing to think that the person you love the most could be gone in a matter of days, and this is what they will be able share with you and your family.   Read my other reviews:  I am really excited to start reading this book for our son because I am always frustrated by all the baby books out there. I remember going
Write a positive review about a good book:     "This book gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling knowing that so many people across the planet are reading this and I can't wait until they hear what it has to say!" (I was given this book for free by the author of the book and had no other incentive. It's the only way I could pay for the time I spent reading it.) "This book is really funny and full of great stories and ideas." (If you are not a comic book person or are a fan of the DCU, this may not be for you. If you are a comics nerd like me, though, this will be a blast. It also features a ton of great characters and is worth reading for any comic fan or DC fan.) A great book to read and a great example of an author using comic book characters for a different story (or at least a very fun, slightly different story.)   "For a book on Batman, this book was well done. The story and the characters were a lot of fun to read, and this book had me laughing out loud." (I liked this book, and I think it's good for anyone who enjoys comic books and likes a good laugh. The characters are a lot like the ones you'd find in an actual comic book. I also thought it was funny and it did well to show off the character development and development from the perspective of the Joker.)
Write a positive review about a good book:    - This is one of the first stories I read by Kevin Hearne. I was a little apprehensive at the start because I was afraid that the author would simply regurgitate previous research. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised. It starts out with an investigation into a series of murders in New Hampshire by a series called The Monster Society of America. Kevin Hearnne goes into the details about these murders and goes on to describe various characters that are involved in the killings and the murders themselves. I think Kevin Hearnes research was solid. The story does have a few issues, especially in how Hearne handles the characters. The monster and his henchmen are fairly well developed, and a little bit of detail would have been nice in how they interact with each other. It would have also helped if this was the only book Hearne had written and if the author had a history writing supernatural-themed fiction. But that's a small complaint, because the story was pretty good and was a very pleasant read.    - This was my favorite book of the year.  This book was good.  I really enjoyed this book. I've enjoyed a lot of Kevin Hearns novels, but this was his best. It was definitely better than the Monster Society, but not quite as good as the other two books. The stories were very well done, especially the first book. The main character was very well developed. The author did a good job of bringing up the major character's backstories, particularly with the man's back story, and with the villains in his story. There were some plot holes, but other than that I really liked this book a lot. The book was not all about the monster, but about the people that were involved in this murders. The investigation was very fun, and the story did pick up a few things. I give this book four stars.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book does what it set out to do: it gives an account of what the Jews thought, what they did, and how they were treated by others.   From the very beginning, we see a certain level of suspicion and suspicion-based hostility and suspicion toward the Jews. The attitude of anti-Semitism is clearly and clearly present from the very first pages of the book.  One of the first comments is by a British army officer who notes how Jews can never be trusted, a statement that was repeated over and over again. The same officer goes on to quote a famous quote by Winston Churchill, the same Winston Churchill who called the Jews a " race" and "murderers."  The general attitude toward Jews is described with a sense of animosity, hatred and contempt.  In order to "melt the ice" the Jews must be destroyed and we're given ample evidence for this.  It also appears that the attitude towards the Jews can't be changed but only crushed.  The last third of the work consists of descriptions of actual atrocities committed by the Jews and it is here that one begins to see some signs of more sympathy, at least in this writer's mind.  This book has its place as a history and analysis of anti Jew attitudes of the era.  I've only given it 3 stars and I'm very happy I did because that is the only rating that I can give it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The Best of the Best is a short collection of the best SF/F I can find.    The book begins by describing how to judge a good novel.  It doesn't tell you how to do that, but it does show how to avoid wasting your time by reading something that's mediocre. It's a good thing.  The collection begins with the novel that got me into SF/f in the first place: The Three-Body Problem by Cixin Liu. I didn't like it at the time, but I still remember that it had a huge impact on my view of SF/fiction. It is a good summary of the themes of that book: the question of free will versus determinism; the issue of control versus freedom; the question if the author has a good grasp of physics and how to tell a good story using those facts. The stories in the book are all very different, but each one has a point in common: they're good books, with good writing and good plots.  Some people don't like the first few stories in this book (and I've read them all and loved them), but as I got into it, they grew on me and I began to like them as well. Some of the stories are great, like the one where a man who's been in prison finds out that he was a murderer. The second story is a bit more serious, but both of them have wonderful twists, good characters, and good plot. The third story has a bit of a horror feel to it, but this story's not terrible either. The fourth story is the best of the bunch, but again, there are better ones. The fifth story was pretty good, but there are plenty better stories in it.  All the stories in The Best of The Best are well written, and I appreciate that.  In fact, I loved them all, but they didn't really get better the longer I read them.  My main problem with the collection is the fact that some of the more recent stories are very similar to each other. While I would have preferred a book that was a bit fresher, I guess that's to be expected. The collection also contains the stories that I read before I read The Three Body Problem. One of these stories is a fairly long and complicated version of a story that I'd read several times before, and the other was a short story that was not very good.  That's it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read this book at least four times and every time it is a new read!   An excellent book on any aspect of cooking (or any life in general).   My only complaint about this book is that I would like to have the recipes in this book with photos to see how the recipes turn out.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have not been able to put down this book. Not for the plot or characters, but for the story itself. This is a story told in first person by a female. And she is a bad ass! There are some things I did not like about it. I am very familiar with the male perspective. I had to stop and think about whether this was too masculine. For the most part, the men didn't look like a stereotype and it was a great story. One that I can relate to in my own life. I would recommend this story to anyone who has a male friend who can empathize with her, because it really has a female viewpoint. Also, the book is about two girls in college, so it is definitely for people who like that sort of thing. The only thing I wish was different is the ending. It would have been nice to know the conclusion of the story from the end of the book, but maybe the reader won't know, so I am okay with it. If you like reading about an under-represented group in literature, this book is definitely a must-read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book very intriguing. It does not make any assumptions about the reader but rather takes the reader through a detailed examination of what is known of the people who have lived in the past as well as the culture of the present. It's a fascinating topic that has been overlooked until now. I'd like to see a more thorough exploration of the subject and the history and archaeology of these cultures.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A friend and I were talking the other day, and I told her about a book I'd never heard of but now regret not having read. The first time I heard of it I couldn't put it down, but I've tried many times and never managed to do it. So after reading this novel I had a bit of a epiphany: I never tried to read this book, but if I'd only known about it, I might have thought, 'I need to get that book!' So I'm giving it a very good review for me, if for no other reason than I now have a new book to recommend to my friend next time she reads something to which I've not listened.     Sara B. I read the book last week. It was actually in my collection, but the library has a thing about things not being in my "collection" and I didn't want to go through the whole checkout process to get it, so I grabbed it when it was offered and then decided to keep it at home. I'm going to let you in on a little secret here...I read this before I watched "In Good Company." But the movie was so much better. I saw it at the local theater and loved it. The book is not that good though, and it didn't really do much for me. The characters were great but it's not a novel I'd suggest. There is so much that can be done with the characters, and if you know your own mind, the plot will be easier to follow. I did enjoy it as a background to something else.  P.K. After hearing so much about the awesome of this book from friends and family I was so excited to get this one. I really can't fault this one on the quality. The storyline is excellent and the story itself is a lot to chew on and I loved reading it. I was amazed at all the different things that happen to each character as they journey. The author does a great job of tying up all the loose ends in the series and gives a conclusion that I felt would be an amazing conclusion for the whole series, but without going overboard with it. She really pulled me in with the story and the characters. I don't know how I could put a lower rating on this one for it really was a great book and I was a little afraid to get my hopes up and end up disappointed. But my worries were quickly dis

"   a  "[This] work is a brilliant examination of the effects of the war on people of color. It's a brilliant investigation of the political motivations behind the war. The story it tells is a tragedy, but it is an epic tragedy. The people who waged the war were driven by a hatred of their own lives and the lives of others. But, they also were driven to fight for a cause that was so self-destructive they ended up committing the atrocities they did. But the thing I really liked most about the book was not the analysis of the motivations or the politics of the wars, it was how it was done, through the eyes of those living through it, which in many ways, was an insight into human nature and how it can be changed. I read the book in one sitting, and I couldn't put it down."  (by the way,, but it's an epic catastrophe. The war was driven by hate of one's life and the other people's lives. But they also, too, were driven, by a cause they could not give up. But because of a selfish reason, they made things much worse than they were.)   If you like non-fictional nonfiction, especially when it's about the Vietnam War, or any war, this is a must read book, as is the follow-up The Last Good War: After the Vietnam Wars.   Other people have written good books about the war:  It's interesting to note that the author of "The Longest War" was a Marine, a combat veteran of the Iraq War. The book that inspired the book of the same title was written by a non-war veteran of Vietnam.

I also added 2 Tbls butter, which I think gives the macaronis that nice flavor I love.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book by the way. It was a great book. I enjoyed it a lot. I read the first chapter after I finished the story. So I'm thinking there might be more on this book as this was a long book. But I would like to see it. I don't care for the whole 'being born is pain and suffering' thing but it seems like there's a little something I can relate to in it as it did happen to me. So there's definitely some kind of message in this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am not sure where to start with this one... I got this as part of the author's two book club promotion. This was a wonderful book - and an excellent introduction to the world of magic. We start at the top and end with a cliffhanger. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a little afraid of magic and who doesn't know about it. The author wrote this book from his own perspective and this gives it that real magic of someone who has lived the life and witnessed the magic and has also lived through it. For the price you pay, I think this was a great investment.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A good, straightforward, non-fussy book about the way things are at the end of the 19th Century. If you're a literary historian or lover of literary texts this is a must-read. You don't have to be a student of British history or history in general to enjoy this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think this book, in terms of a work of historical fiction, was probably the best one I've read so far this year. The characters have great personality and all the people I met in England that are important in the story all had interesting backstories and I thought that the book was very well written and I enjoyed it thoroughly.    I've been writing a couple of reviews about historical fiction and I wanted to do a review of a nonfiction book on the topic.  I recently read a great biography of the philosopher Karl Popper. The thing I liked about this book was that Popper is just a normal guy.  You don't really get a lot of the pompousness of the philosophers of the "great thinkers" that you find in many of these popular histories. There's not a lot about Popper's philosophical method, his ideas about the role of logic and reason.  But, there was a lot that I found to like in the book.  And it is also important to note that Poletian is more than a philosopher.  Poleti had a career as an engineer (as he says in the intro) and it's interesting to read about the development of the scientific method in a world in which Poletians have little influence. There is a lot in this book about Polet's view of the modern world, his concerns with the threat of totalitarianism and his philosophy of freedom and justice.  It's a very interesting read and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to understand how a very smart man could have such a negative view of his own time. A good book about history, culture, technology, politics, culture and more:  This was a very useful book, it really provided a different perspective and insight into how history works.  For example, you're reading about the Roman Empire and one thing you may think is that the Romans are very smart, they didn't really seem to have anything to worry about and the thing you have to remember is that Rome didn't get out of its problems on its own. It took the Romans a while to become a civilized and successful civilization and if you are interested in that history, I would encourage you to pick this book up.  This was a good historical book on technology.  There was a section on the development and application of tools in human society. There were chapters on various aspects of the industrial revolution and there were some chapters on early nuclear technology.

I read the last book and it was so exciting I knew I would be reading the rest. I don't know why I did not give this book five stars. The best part of this book was the end. It is the best I have read by a writer. I think the book will be a great book for a younger readers who want to learn to write. Thank you for writing this book. Thank you for reading. - A.M. This is a very good book. I have been looking for a good fantasy for years. This is a great story. The author did an amazing job with the story line. I also really liked the characters and their emotions. It was not very long but I wanted it to be longer. I especially liked the love interest who I was rooting for and that also showed her side. This story was very unique in my opinion. - D.M., I was not a reader of this genre before but I am now. I would recommend this to anyone looking for some new books. I really enjoyed this story.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a really good book. It's well written, and I don't know why I never read a book like this when I was a teenager (my favorite part is when they're talking about a character who is a "naughty girl"). It makes me wonder what it's like to be a teenager, or if I have a "good" body as an adult.   I just finished it, and the first line of the book made me really uncomfortable, but I still want to read it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good re-read, even though the first few chapters are a bit slow, the plot is easy to follow, and the characters are believable. But as the story moves on, it becomes a bit more difficult to follow.    The end is a bit abrupt, as I feel that they could have made a better story out of what they had, but I have to say that I did enjoy the ending.  The cover image is actually the main illustration used for the main cover of the book (it is an example of a typical paperback cover). The story is an interesting tale with some good twists, the characters seem believable, and while the story wasn't what I was hoping it to be, it was still a solid read. I recommend this one to all book lovers.
Write a positive review about a good book:        "A beautifully written work of literature about a dark and troubled past, the writing has a lovely and lyrical tone. This novel is a deeply disturbing experience."   -  "The novel is richly plotted, thoroughly researched and thoroughly disturbing."  - "Sophia's story is a tragic one: her own life had a happy ending but her brother's and mother's deaths had no happy endings, and so her life was a living nightmare.   What can one say to that?   I'm always trying to read more, and as far as I'm concerned this one will have a place in the collection. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent, entertaining book for those with a natural curiosity and an appetite for the fantastic, and a little bit of knowledge about what they are reading.   One thing I like about this book is the way the characters are written. Even though some may be stereotypical, their descriptions and actions were always very original and engaging.   (hide spoiler)
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book: As I mentioned above, I am very much a reader who prefers to find a book on a good day than one that was poorly written or just bad. However, I have to say that I did not expect to enjoy this book as much as I did. It's about a boy who lives in a small village in rural Kenya. I'm not sure about you, but the rural Kenyan in my life never seem to be the same person after the death of his father. The story follows him as he tries to figure out who he is and where he belongs in his new life. It takes a little while to set up all the pieces and understand the larger picture, but it works. The book deals with many topics that most books don't, including childhood sexual abuse, being bullied at school, homosexuality, relationships, and religious conversions. I don't know if this is the kind of book that would appeal to me if I were trying to explore those topics with a kid, but if that's the case for you, this is a good read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have never heard a person say "I can't remember anything that I read, but this book was really good".   The book starts off quite slow, but then it picks up quite nicely as things progress, which is a relief after the very slow beginning.   My favorite moment was when my friend and I went out to a bar and got drunk.  I know, the idea is bad, but the effect is good.  This was one of those books that I actually started reading to see how it would be, which I would describe as "fun".  This is also a book that I enjoyed reading, because it was fun.  The best thing about this book is that it does not take itself too seriously.  When it starts getting serious, it quickly gets back to what it was trying to be.  Also, the cover art is good, and my friend loved it.  Another point that I really liked was how it dealt with mental illness. I actually learned a lot from it, and found a lot of good information in it. The main character, and the book as a whole, is written well, and although the main character is a bit of a jerk, there is a nice bit of good in him, and I thought he had a good point.  Overall, a good read, and worth a read, even if it's just a good story.
Write a positive review about a good book:   You are welcome to read the book. But to judge it from the cover of the book is to do it a disservice. The cover is a little odd. It shows a girl wearing a dress which makes me think of a dress and a boy holding a book of photos.  It's more of a picture book in theme (though with a slightly less serious feel) than a thriller.  I enjoyed this.  It is short and a great little read. The Good: - This book is a quick read. It's easy to get into and there is a good story. - It's a short read.   -  I was surprised with the main character's father being the most powerful man in her country. It is interesting and unexpected. There are a lot of things that were left to the imagination (including the main main character). I like that.  There is plenty of action, though I am a little surprised that it isn't more graphic.
Write a positive review about a good book:    * This is a well written book. The characters are well developed, but not overdone. The pacing is good and well put together. The story is well paced and the characters are not over the top.    The characters were well written, but a few of the lines came across as a little corny. The author wrote about the things he saw in real life: a girl being beaten by her father for being too slow in taking a bath and a man not getting his head out of the mud. There was one scene in the middle where he describes his first kiss with a boy.     Overall, I enjoyed this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   When I was first looking for an interesting novel to read, I was attracted to the fact that it was about science. That is where I saw the promise in this novel. I didn't expect the book to be so good but I was pleasantly surprised with how good it was. There are many good things about this book. The story is engaging, the characters are well written and the pace is excellent. I felt that I was watching the author as he attempted to find a way to write a scientific novel. When he finally decided on using the word "miracle", I was excited for what this book was going to be. The only downside I can think of is the length of the book. It was longer than I thought it would be. As I mentioned earlier in this review, I wasn't a fan of this type of novel when it first came out. When I was looking for something that could be a bridge between science fiction and fantasy I thought that a story about a scientist using magic would be interesting. However, when I saw that this was a science fiction book with a magician I was somewhat confused. I liked the premise of the story but I didn'st love the execution.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    - The most impressive character in the whole series. - Some great scenes that leave your heart racing. - The story has a very good conclusion that will leave you wanting more. - There is an interesting ending that will make you go back and re-read it. - No character who is just there to be rescued by the MC.   - The most amazing characters in the entire series

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   There are a lot of people out there looking for information to try and get an answer about the way their lives should be.  In the last two weeks a lot has happened that I feel would make a big difference to my life but I haven't figured out a way to get past it.  I love how it shows how hard it is to stay on track and still have a life and have a sense of peace.  This book is a great book to go through the steps to help you figure out how to be happy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good read!     This is a great book, and I have read many of his books. I have some other books by him that are good.   The only criticism I can offer would be that he has been so consistently wrong in his predictions for the future that there is a little bit of "I told you so" in this book.  If you don't have a copy of this book already I urge you to grab a copy and give it a try.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The best thing to come out of the book is the last sentence of the review: This is the book that helped me realize I wanted to write. I was tired of being a writer and wanted to know what I was missing. I'm glad I read this.   The book has a wonderful sense of humor, but also a real emotional and physical urgency. The book is full of action and adventures.   The plot is very intriguing and I'm excited to read the next book in this series.   It's a little bit slow compared to the others, but it's definitely good for the length and will probably take me some time to read it, so if you're up for a good read this is a great choice.  16 of 18 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a HUGE fan of Stephen King.   He's one of the best.  He writes amazing books.  I think he did a great job at telling the story.  For someone who's looking to get into reading, it's a great read! So...I got this book in a trade from an author I've never heard of (maybe he's a good author or something?  My first King book, so it's only a matter of time).  It's got a LOT of story, with a lot of characters, all of which are interesting and well written.  The first third of the book has a lot to recommend it; the characters have very distinct personalities, and the story flows smoothly from one chapter to the next.  And the story has some really fun twists and turns.  However, the middle third of this book is kind of flat, and is probably the weakest section of the novel.  There is a lot going on in this section (even the twist is not the first time that's happened in a book I've read), and the plot seems to start to unravel.  So overall, I really liked this book.  This was my first King novel, and I've enjoyed most of his work.  Maybe this will be a good one for someone like me? 1/5 stars:  This is another book where I was pretty disappointed with it (although there were some things that didn't sit well with me).  This story starts out pretty exciting, as a man named Dan goes to visit his daughter.  Unfortunately, his daughter has fallen ill and is in dire need of help.  While Dan is away, his old friend, Danny, who is the head of a local bank, hires a woman named Mary to help him out.  Mary is a very charming, beautiful woman, but she is also kind of a bitch.  Her boss, Mr. White, is extremely jealous of her, and they are not getting along, and neither are they getting along at home.  As it turns out, when Mary leaves Dan alone, her old boss takes a liking to her, which is not good for Dan.  After a series of events, Dan gets into a dangerous situation.  I enjoyed this novel. It had a lot about it that I liked, and there were a lot that I did not like.  It wasn't a bad book, per se.  But I think
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book for kids. It is very educational and is written by a pediatrician. I have read many books on this topic (including one book published by the American Academy of Pediatrics), and Dr. Vollmer's book is unique. It makes very compelling arguments for a healthy child's diet.   My four year old and her sister have read the book. They love the pictures and the story.  I have an older brother who is in preschool and has also read many of the books on the topic.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A few books from the same author have the same theme. There is one book in the world, which everyone is reading, and one that everyone has missed, and both books are terrible. The author doesn't know what to do about this problem, so he is trying to do it himself. A few more pages and he is on to something important. Good writing is not something to be ignored.  Some people are fans of one book more than another. It may be that the author has an affinity for one book. Maybe she has a soft spot for one particular author. Or maybe it is because that particular book is a favorite of a particular author or group. But either way, those people are the target audience. This means that they will be reading the book, if the book is good. However, those who don't like one book, may find it a pain to read the others.

Write a positive review about a good book:    When I was a freshman in college, a friend and I bought three of these books in order to give away to the kids in the dorm. My favorite, by far, is the first. I had heard of the books before, but never really got to reading them. This one gave me a chance to finally get into one. It didn't take too long to find the first few stories and I was hooked right away. This book was an absolute joy to read and was great on so many levels.   I enjoyed reading this book so much because it was so different from most other stories. It was a mix of adventure and mystery as it was about the main characters traveling through a different continent. I loved that they managed to make a realistic place, despite the fact that it was a fictional location.  The story was also interesting because of how they used multiple viewpoints to tell a story. The writing style was different because it reminded me of an old-fashioned book and was not the usual fantasy style.  The plot was interesting because it followed two characters who were exploring a land that they couldn't really see because it had the same strange feel as the other story.  They kept their own little group of friends along for the ride and the main character was always the protagonist and the one who had the most trouble. This is how the story starts and it's still a mystery as to what is going on with the land and the people who live there.     This book was one of my favorite books because it wasn't your typical fantasy or crime series. It is different in a good way and I am glad I read it.

I think it is a bit too long but I enjoyed the journey.   " "This is a book with a heart of gold, a beautifully written story full of humor and romance, and a whole lot of heart.  I'm not sure that I've ever encountered a romance book this well written. I know I loved every bit of it!" -- Anonymous (Review posted on Amazon)   I read this book when I was in graduate school, and I just loved it. As a woman who has a soft spot for female warriors, this is one of my favorites from the genre.  I thought this was one of the most fun YA books I've read. This book's unique twist is that the main character is a half-elf from a world that has a different set of rules and laws than our own. This twist makes her a real villain in the book, but her story is also very much a character study. The book's main character does not come off as a bad person, but she does have her flaws. She has a very unique personality. She's a very smart, sarcastic, kind, and caring elf, but has a heart as big as the world she lives in. In this world there are no good or bad people, only those who you can beat.  This is a story of a woman struggling to find her place in a world where she can't make the rules for herself and everyone else. This story explores a lot of the complexities of the world that we live in, and it's great.  For those who enjoy a good fantasy romance, you will not be disappointed in this book!

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book last week, and enjoyed it quite a bit. I was initially put off by the book's cover which depicted a large penis and several women with erections. The cover art was supposed to be a tribute to Robert M. Pirsig's book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. However, the first line on the first page of the book (in black on white lettering) had the lines "Riding the wave of your inner-bizarre" which I found offensive. But after I had read the story and thought about it more, I realized this was intentional and not meant as a sexual joke. In fact the sex scenes were some of the best in the book. This story is not for everyone, but it is a worthwhile read. I recommend it for fans of YA and YA fantasy that are familiar with Robert M Pirsigs books.
Write a positive review about a good book:    Recommend it!  The author, Alyssa, is a very talented writer. I'm happy that I found a good story and have enjoyed it. She knows how to craft a story.

Also, she never told me how much it had cost her to buy this book.  5 out of 5 Very enjoyable. I enjoyed this book, and the cover is gorgeous!  to me, the only thing missing from this story is a little "twist" at the end- the one thing that would really make this a 5 star book, so I'm disappointed that there's nothing.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have never had this kind of experience when reading a book! I don't normally like to give my review to a book and i was so excited and curious to read this one! The first thing that caught my eye is that she has a very interesting background. She was adopted from Haiti and grew up in an orphanage as a child. She decided to become a writer while she was in high school. I don´t know if you ever had that opportunity but it can be a blessing and a curse. It can make you go crazy in the first place with passion, love and desire and it can make your creative drive grow. This is something I love and respect about her! Her writing is so detailed and well written. It is amazing how a person like this is able to create a world in such a short time. She has this "inner" world that makes you want to know more about what is going on. She also does a great job of showing the impact her work has on people around her. I am really fascinated by her books and I plan to read her more! The next thing that really impressed me was that she is able write very emotionally driven and touching stories in such short stories and it's a thing of beauty to read about a person who can do that in such different way. All in all I think this is the book to read for a short story collection, if you are a person fascinated by short stories or are simply trying to find out what is out there!

Write a positive review about a good book:    The idea that an individual can have some sort of special power is a fascinating concept that we will revisit more fully at a later date. Suffice it to say that for a person with any sense of morality, the idea of being able to change the world by wishing it different is repugnant, regardless of what their motivations might be.   However, I did enjoy this book for its story and its concept. As always, the author draws a very specific type of human character: the one who has a strong moral code but has no clue how to apply it to the real world. I was a bit concerned at first that he would write a story about some random person with a unique combination of talents who has no real connection to the story he's writing, but this is not the case. He writes from a person's point of view and makes sure that the reader understands who they are. His style is very descriptive, almost poetic in its language. As you know, I love a good metaphor.  The book has two distinct parts: the first part is about the author's life growing up, the second is the story of how he grew up and discovered his own moral compass. The first part focuses on him growing up as an average kid living in a small town in Pennsylvania. His family struggles to understand what makes a good person and to make sure that they're able to provide a good life for their child.  I would have preferred to read this book with a full description of the setting.  It is described well enough that it didn't keep me from enjoying the story as a whole. The author uses several metaphors throughout the book, many of which are humorous and quite fitting in the context of this story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    For the love of Pete...   The writing is great!   I read this book while on the toilet (this was not my first time reading a memoir), and the first thing I remember reading is "panties" and "flip-flops" and whatnot. I was amazed by the author's ability to translate his own experiences and struggles into an interesting way. And this book is great at both.   He shares his pain, joy, and frustrations with humor and insight.  He also manages to be both hilarious and poignant.

Write a positive review about a good book:    In the interest of being kind to her, she decided to try writing a positive book review. I like it. It's not exactly what I expected, but there is a good deal of interesting info and stories. The best part about it is that it's not entirely an introduction to the history. There's a lot of information and it makes it very easy to understand the basic things you need to know about what's going on with the Civil War. I can see why she wanted to write a positive history, it would certainly be less time consuming to read. It has a lot to offer. I think the most important thing I take from this is that she was very much an early believer in the importance of the Bible and was the first author of a book about that subject ( The Bible and History, 1991). I like her book a lot. It is quite detailed, and covers a good bit of history. I wouldn't mind it if she went on to write another book about the Civil war (I've been thinking of a project to do so in the future), but I think there's a decent chance she'll write more about other topics and I'm glad she is doing it now. I've heard about this book since I was young and had a copy of it when I was a kid. I'm hoping I'll someday be able to read it again. (This is a review for the American Civil War series, not this particular book.)
Write a positive review about a good book:    This was very enjoyable! It's a good mix of the different genres, and the story flows well. The ending was just what I needed, and I really liked the idea of a boy who just turned 16 going through puberty with his first girlfriend. The book has a lot of other interesting characters, as well. I'm sure the story will continue in other books, as I found that it got a bit predictable and predictable. However, I am sure it is not a bad one to read and recommend. (hide spoiler)

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was at the bookstore the other day and saw an item on the shelf for "A Study of the Life of Jesus" by the Reverend Samuel P. Sullivan. The first book I read that said anything about the life of Jesus was Richard Carrier's "A Reason for God" (2005), the second was Robert Price's "Jesus: A Biography" (1997), and this was the last (now a series).   Now, as a historian, I thought this was a very interesting and thoughtful book, in part because of its tone, but primarily because of the analysis it offered about what Jesus did or did not say.   Here's a quote from the preface: The book is a summary of what we know about Jesus as a historical person. It seeks to answer the question: How do we know what Jesus said about himself?   A bit further down:  What is meant by "The Life of Christ" is an "exposition of Jesus as he has been portrayed in the New Testament and other religious documents."   It begins with a bit of background about the relationship between the New and Old Testaments: "From the beginning of the first century, the dominant Jewish attitude toward Jesus has been to accept him and his message as the Messiah, and to expect the ultimate restoration of the Jewish people. This attitude became firmly rooted in the rabbinic tradition in the third century. However, the new testament contained a strong strain of apocalyptic eschatology, and the early Christians were anxious to escape this Jewish milieu...." The New Testament: "Christianity in its early years was a revolt against Jewish practices and the Jewish law...."   Next comes a quote that summarizes the first part of the book, which deals with Jesus as an earthly prophet: "At first glance, the evidence appears to suggest a highly symbolic role for Jesus as prophet. Jesus was expected to take on the messianic task, he claimed to be the Christ, and his mission included the restoration of Israel. Indeed, the entire Christian tradition emphasized the divine mission of Jesus, while he himself was identified with the God of Israel...." What it doesn't say is that it's a myth to begin with. Jesus as God (as a God with attributes other than human) is not a myth, either. The fact is that most early Christians believed Jesus to be God and had an anthropomorphic view of him. They also believed he was the Messiah -- who would lead the
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really liked the characters and the action.   Some people may find the book boring and boring but I loved it!   My book was a little difficult to finish as there were a few plot holes I couldn't figure out. I also liked the fact that the author did a good job of explaining the different ways people can have an illness and how that affects them and how it can affect the family. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had the pleasure of watching and playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friend when I was a kid. He was a "newbie" and had a difficult time.  I remember he was struggling a bit at the time, but a few years later, we had a great deal of fun with each other. We ran through the game a few times, and I recall telling him we "should" play again soon.   I have never been as excited to start up a new game as I am now to play this one.  The adventure continues!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    My first reading of "The Handmaid's Tale" was a little disappointing. I was excited because I wanted to see what was different about this book from previous works by Margaret Atwood, which are all about oppressive regimes run by conservative women. I'm a little surprised that this book wasn't as successful as her earlier work. However, I think that the more I learned about the society that this novel is set in and the fact that it is a dystopia (it has a communist ruling party that rules by fear and violence), the more hopeful I became about the book. The fact that I'm reading the book after reading "The Blind Assassin," shows that both of these books do have something in common. (I do believe that they are the best novels I have read this year.) "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" is an interesting novel, but is somewhat different from the other books in the series, so I can't really say much about it. It's also not on my top 10 list, but I guess that's just as well because it's a bit of a slow burner.

Write a positive review about a good book:    When I got the book, I was expecting an overabundance of info and a short book. I was disappointed. It gave me the basics of how a woman's body works, but didn't go into detail about things that are very important, like the fact that there are several different kinds of breast tissue, and some can be found in other women, so that it doesn't make a difference in the way you look.  In short, it was a great guide, but I can't recommend it to people without a great deal of background in breast biology and breast physiology.

Write a positive review about a good book:           A good book is a very difficult thing to do, which is why I love to do it, and you should, too. The story is good and the world and characters are rich.   To the average person, this might not be the type of book that can be recommended to everyone, but the hardcore fantasy fans who love the more epic and intricate style of the genre (as well as the "realism" that comes with it) should absolutely not miss this.  If you like epic fantasy, this book is for you, if not, you probably won't like it.  It takes a lot to make a good epic fantasy book (that's what I call "good" by the way) but when it happens, it's great.  To wrap this up, let me just say that I recommend all of the stories in this collection to people who are fans of fantasy. It's a fantastic collection and if you don't have this one yet, then go get it. You won't be disappointed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is one of the most important books written about what makes us happy and successful. It is filled with the key ingredients that will help you become a happier person.   5 out of 5 stars - I recommend this book to anyone looking to improve their life.  It is very practical and clear. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book was a good introduction to the subject. The first three chapters introduce the subject with plenty of examples and quotes. You should have an idea where you are going with the story. The next 3 chapters give a nice summary of the main points of the story, how the characters interact with one another, and the different parts of the book, like the "hijacking" and the "troubleshooting." If you have a good understanding of the theory behind this type of problem-solving, you can finish the book without needing a lot of help. It is not a complicated book, but there are enough examples to make it a good read. I think I learned a lot about the subject and found the book entertaining.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read the book with great interest and enjoyed it immensely. The book is a "how to" guide, written by a woman who has been there. The author has done a wonderful job of explaining all of the things that have led to her own success in life, and how you can do the same.   I have a daughter who is in college now and she's a great reader, so I thought I'd buy this book for her to read. She loved it!     Read the whole review:   One of the best books I have ever read, The Secret Life of Bees provides a simple and easy to follow blueprint on how to make your home a bee haven. It's filled with good-quality images and easy-to-understand instructions. The authors were the right kind of person to write this book; they were well versed in beekeeping, but not too much so that they had to be overly formal. They are down to earth and approachable. I read this book with the expectation that this book would help me start a small hobby of beekeeping. I was pleasantly surprised that they did not stop with a basic understanding of what beekeeping is all about. They went to great length in describing all of what is involved in maintaining a hive; it seems as if they went all the way. There are also a lot of great examples from around the world. The following description is taken from the back cover, which was the first and only place on the web that I found any information about the book.   How to be a Successful Bee Keeper is the definitive work on beekeeping in a book format. Written for the newbee beekeeper, the book begins with an excellent overview of the basic principles of bee keeping and an overview of what bees eat and what their physical characteristics are. It also contains a great deal of visual material illustrating the life cycle of a hive, the hives themselves, the queens and male bees. Beekeeping is a laborious and complex subject that requires a good deal of knowledge and skill on the part of the beekeeper. In this book, The Author of "The Bees in Our Backyard" takes a comprehensive approach to the subject of bee kept hives and bees. She starts from the ground up, beginning with the basics of bee-keeping and providing a detailed discussion of the physical characteristics of bees and a thorough description of their food needs. The beekeeper then discusses the hive itself,

Thank you. (Posted on 2/19/2016)  An excellent book! (by a very honest reviewer) by: Andrew K. on 5/12/2016 Rating: 5 of 5 Stars!  This is an excellent book, with a variety of ideas and insight that really stand out. It will teach you a lot, and will give you the courage to stand up and be your own person. You will make some pretty huge changes. I am not sure if I am a Buddhist. But this book has given me a great source of knowledge, and I would recommend it.   " I found that we were not always as wise as we thought we were. We all have some things we don't know how to do or how to see, but it's true that we can't always see what we don:t see. This was true for myself. But I had a deep sense that if I were to make some changes, there were things I should not be afraid to do."   You'll be sure to make a few changes, but I will still say, "Be brave! Be fearless!" (Posted the 17/12)  I didn't get much out of this book. by: Matthew M on 11/7/2015 Rating: 1 of 1 Stars!   I didn't find this book interesting. It is a story told from many points of view. One side would make a point, the other would agree with it and give their opinion but only in the end did one side seem to be right. I also found it hard to connect the parts of the story that are narrated by two men.   with the one sidedness of the point of view it felt more like a discussion and a lecture than a novel.   on the other hand, this is not the way you would normally read a book and a book written for the young. The style of writing, language and stories were very similar to books like 'My Brother the Bad Guy'.   it took me a long time to read and I found it difficult to get to grips with the different points of views. It could be argued that you should read this book to try to work out why there is conflict between people's view on things. My father is the one who really believes that his
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really loved this book.   It's a really nice story about a girl and her grandfather who lives in a small town. The story begins when her grandfather comes to town to give a speech at the high school, and she falls in love with him.  She goes to the home of her cousin to stay with her, and is taken in by him. She grows up with the cousin and their daughter, and goes to school with the girls, while still keeping an eye on her uncle.  The main character is a bit like a little sister to the main character, but in a way that's really interesting. It's hard for me to give this a perfect five stars, but it's a great book that I really enjoyed.  28 of 29 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:    (4) 1)  The Golden Compass, J.K. Rowling (1997)   I was excited about this book when I first picked it up. I am still very much a fan of the Harry Potter series, and this book was certainly worthy of a spot on the shelf. I was initially a little underwhelmed by the main character's name, Colin Creevey. While his first name is one of the most recognizable in the Harry series, he doesn't seem to have enough to it to stand out. However, once I read a little bit about his family, I felt that I knew all about Colin's parents. I enjoyed Colin's adventures more than Harry's, mostly because Colin did his own thing. He did not have to be "Harry's" sidekick any longer. I don't really recall any plot holes, and Colin did not spend hours in the library looking up obscure information. He just had to get from one place to another. While Colin's family is the main reason I read this book, the first half of the book was not really about the book's main character. I felt the book dragged a little after a while and that I needed to get to the next chapter, The Lost Girls.  2)  Shadow of the Falling City, Richard K. Morgan (2010)    I enjoyed this book quite a bit. It was quite dark, but the overall story felt like a continuation of the Dark Tower series. In fact, I'm fairly certain that Shadow of The Falling City is the sequel to The Gunslinger. There are a couple of major changes in this book and the overall plot did change. I liked the fact that the protagonist was named Jarek instead of Kal. I'm also interested to see how the sequel will look, as the main hero in Shadow of was a bit of a loner.  3)  Dune Messiah, Frank Herbert (1984)  I've been reading Dune since I was about seven. The series was first published in the 1960's, and I have a number of copies of Dune to show for it. The first Dune novel was a great example of what a good story should be. It had a few major flaws, and the second novel, The Emperor's Blades, was a major rewrite of the series. I have to admit that Dune: Messiah, was not much of a novel. While it was not bad, it was definitely a step down
Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite book by Tiptree is The Boy in the Plastic Bubble   And now back to the Goodreads, to read your reviews. If you haven't yet started reading, the book is about a boy who has to live in the house of a man with two faces.  But the main character is also very clever.   You have to read it! I would recommend this book to any one who likes Harry Potter, because of how clever and witty it is.    There are many great books out there.  The one above, is good but not the best. The Boy in The Plastic Bubble, on the other hand, is a masterpiece, a great novel with a lot of ideas. This novel is about how a boy can change the world.  Tiptrees book is written as if it is a play. The story is very clever and you feel like you are there with the main characters. You feel that he's just like you and there's a lot in this novel. It's a novel with very good ideas that are just fun to read. You can't wait to read this book! I can't think of any books better to start with.  The Boy Who Knew Too Much (2012) by T.A. Tiptresby
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's like the whole book was written by a 12 year old. It is like you could have had a good conversation with a 12-year-old in a bookstore.   I would suggest reading the whole thing, because in that book you learn a lot of important and interesting things about the past and the people who lived in the past.  I have to give it 5 stars because it really opened my eyes to a lot. It really made me think about how the world works. I can't thank you enough for putting this book out there, especially to all the kids that I saw. It helped me really get into the idea of the Bible. I would love to read more like this.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I am so glad I picked up this book for my class! My students were very excited about this book and were asking a lot of questions about what they would be learning in the class!   The author is well-known for her work in the field of music education and the way she is able to bridge the gap between theory and practice was fantastic.   In addition to helping students understand the music world, she also gave tips on how to write a good thesis.  We learned how to properly form the first chord in the key of E major. I can see a lot more applications in jazz studies and even in jazz guitar.  What I like most about the book is the author is not afraid to ask the hard questions and share what she has learned along the way.  This book is a great addition to your learning repertoire!  Read a positive book review:  It's not always the most entertaining read in the world, but as far as guitar theory goes it can be a useful addition. While the book covers a large area, the author does not rely too much on the theory for the book as much as a tool to help students learn guitar technique. The most important aspect of the book for me though, was the fact that she shared so much of her own experiences with how to learn a great guitar sound. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The main character is a beautiful boy who has a heart condition called angina. He was recently admitted to the hospital after his doctor noticed he could not tolerate any amount of physical activity and told him "you have to stop exercising immediately, you have to rest".      That's when the story begins, but before I get to the main story, a few facts are important to note.   The first thing you should know is that the story takes place on the day of his angina attack, which was 2 months prior.  He is still having the symptoms of angina (very weak heart, often very shortness of breath), but his doctor decided that it was not worth treating and discharged him.  The story is the story of his journey after the hospital discharge, when he meets a little boy named Shigeto.       Shigeto is a little girl with the same heart condition as his little brother. Shigeta has lived all of her life in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by the sea. She does not have the benefit of a big city to get the help she needs.  It turns out that Shigetos brother is in a hospital in a large city, and her brother has been very sick since being admitted to that hospital. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the first of a three part series I'm writing about the various aspects of the Roman Empire in the later period of its existence. The Romans are a fascinating people, and their world is filled with fascinating and fascinating things. A book that covers Roman life is a hard book to write, and while I may not agree with all the conclusions reached by the author (in fact, I think I'm going to disagree with quite a few of them), I still think it's an important read. I look forward to reading the other two parts and trying to reconcile these two ideas of the Romans and the Greeks that I have and hopefully come up with a better interpretation for this ancient society.     The first thing that I want to talk about is the idea of Rome as a state of law.    In the first half of the book the author is arguing that the Roman empire was a state in which people were subject to the Roman government, in this sense, by law. In the second half of this book the Roman author is trying to argue that people were also subject to Rome because they were subject, in some sense, to Rome.  The second idea that I would like to explore about Roman law is that it was more than just a list of laws, and it was a system of governance that allowed certain laws to be enacted and enforced without the need for any specific people to go and bring the people into the city and then tell them to do what the law said, that they were supposed to do.    The author says in the beginning of the second part of this series that Rome was not ruled by "a single authority.  "  This is the argument I would have been more interested in. The empire was ruled by many different peoples in many different ways, but it was all ruled by one man, in Rome, because the Romans themselves were governed by the Emperor (which is another way of saying "the man that ran the empire")  and the Emperor is a figure that every human being wants to be like and the emperor was a man who was feared, respected, loved, and the Romans looked up to him.  These are the three kinds of laws that make a man a good person to be in the Roman world.  The Romans had a lot of laws and Rome had a good system of laws but those were made by the people themselves.  When we think of Rome and laws, we tend to think that

Write a positive review about a good book:    A quick summary: a couple of days before the start of the year, I decided to pick up a set of "Fiction for Fictionists" by Neil Gaiman.  A couple of years after I started writing, I found Gaiman's fiction to be one of the most rewarding ways I've had to learn how to write.  The characters in his stories are believable and the prose is full of humor, but he is always asking questions.   He challenges the reader to question themselves.  He is a great writer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best thing in my book shelf is   (a copy of A Short History of Progress that is just waiting for me at home).   In this book the author does a very good job of explaining the concepts behind what is called "post-industrialism."   He also does a great job of presenting this idea as a positive improvement over industrialism and industrial civilization.   The best thing I can say about this book is that I highly recommend it.   It is well written and presented.  It does not require a PhD to understand its meaning.  The book's value lies in its usefulness to those who would like to do something about the   evils of industrial civilization that are undermining the Earth.

Write a positive review about a good book:    Read an amazing book: I don't think I've ever read a book this good. I was drawn in by the very first sentence: "You look at the Earth and see it covered with cities. The same is true of the Earth. Cities are the largest natural machines in the world: they are inextricably tied to the Earth's ability to reproduce." I read on and got even more excited by the next page: "Most of the things that you do, even in this very city, you think of as minor or incidental."  And then I thought "Holy cow! What else is there to do!" And the next few pages were all about how the city was just a part of nature, and then I was hooked on this book. It has the best book description on Amazon: "We live in a world where the earth is a complex system that is not always in equilibrium. We live in the Anthropocene, an era in which the human impact on the environment, and its natural systems, has accelerated in the last few decades. We are no longer merely the animals who eat animals and then go home. We now have the means of destroying the earth and leaving a trail of destruction in our wake, as well as a technological capacity for continuing that destruction." And I am going to finish up with my top 3 favorite quotes from the book: 1) "People tend to look at cities as something we use them for. We're very good at that. And we do use cities, for all sorts of things, but they are also the most fragile, unstable, and complex pieces of living systems. We build these great cities, and we don't really know how to live with them. "We don't know the relationship between the urban life we see and the natural life we know. The way we have thought about the world in the past is the way it should be, but it isn't. It's the reason why we built these huge structures: it was an idea that had no relation to the way we live now, because it just wasn't there." (The Earth's Long Shadow) 2) "The human race has not changed the world; it's changed the people. We have allowed the world to change us; we have changed the land, the rivers, the vegetation, the animals and the climate." (Nature Is Not a Recreational Game) 3) "A city's greatest triumph is the fact that it is neither a source

It's got a fantastic concept, great plot, great characters and a great way to get into the world.   One minor issue for me though, was the lack of world-building.  I'm sure it's part of the theme of the book, but there were times I felt I had no idea what was going on.  The plot has a couple of minor inconsistencies which could've been cleared up.  One of the characters was a bit of a dork, for instance.  Posted by Sarah at 7:06 PM

Write a positive review about a good book:    A quick and enjoyable read. This is a book about a young girl and her relationship with her sister. The story is told in first person and is told from the point of view of the two sister's. The main character is a young man named Paul. The sister's names are Stephanie and Sarah. Paul grew up with the two girls in a house and grew up feeling guilty about his father and being afraid of his sister because he thought he was in love with her. He was the younger of the pair and he had the same problems that the older sister had. Sarah was the more outgoing and the one with the power in the house. The two were close friends and the only girl in their neighborhood. They were also more interested in each other than their family or friends. Paul was a normal kid but his father had left and when he was about 6 he ran away and lived in an alley. The next day Paul returned home and found that his sister had written him a letter saying that she wanted to be with him and that she was not the same and that her father wasn't the man she thought he had been. Sarah came home and told Paul about the letter. Paul wrote his father a letter back telling him that he wanted to go home. His father told him that it was better that he stay in the city and grow up with Sarah. The book then moves back in time to 18 years ago. Paul is now at university with his sister Sarah. They are both doing well but he's not happy about the way she treated him as a child. He tries to go back to the city with his family, but the police find out and are going to arrest him on a minor charge. Paul then meets up with his friend Andy and tries to convince him to join them. Andy doesn't like the idea of going to the town with his mother. They meet up with Stephanie and she tells Paul that she is pregnant. They spend a lot of time together during the pregnancy and she starts to hate her baby. This leads Paul to finally confess that he is in love and that he wants to have a baby with Sarah, which is why they were so close when they were children. She and Andy are shocked by this news. They think that he's insane and decide to help him. They help him hide out and then they go on a road trip across the country. When they get to a city Paul gets sick and they get him to hospital and when they return to the house
Write a positive review about a good book:    "a great book on what I consider one of the most important and misunderstood parts of the human experience: love.   It's not all romance and happy endings--it's about how to survive in a world where most people are so quick to judge and be mean to you, and what it is to be loved for more than yourself." --Jennifer Heddle, Booklist  "A terrific book... I am not a fan of the romance genre but this book is a fantastic addition to all romance collections, especially of the non-romantic genre. I highly recommend this book. --Emily C. Vann, BookShed  "[A] fascinating, engaging book.... An engaging read that is at once a work of love and science.  [C]laimed." --Kirkus Reviews
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've only read the first three books, but the books are very well written, and have a clear set up, with a great central theme (and plenty of twists and turns), that doesn't feel out of the blue. And the plot is great. The world building is strong. I can see how this could be a great series, especially as the books progress, but I can't quite imagine being a part of it. However, I highly recommend this series to fans of fantasy, or just good writing.   The Dragonbone Chair by Lois McMaster Bujold The fourth book in Lois McMaster, Bujolds's Star Wars series, takes place years after A New Hope, but with more information about what has happened to the original characters. The second half of the book takes place in a time before A New Dawn, with the main character, Talia, looking back at the events of the third and fourth books. She is a Sith apprentice who has lost all memory of her past lives, including that of her Sith Masters. She goes to a monastery for training, which takes her to a ruined Jedi temple. The story continues after the second half, with Talia trying to get her masters attention and become a Sith again, with little success.  All of you out there thinking you've found your Star Wars love in Lois McLeod are dead wrong.  Star Wars is not a genre, and the more I read about it, the less I feel it has any appeal to me. It is too long, complicated, confusing, and difficult to get a hold of.  This is one of the few books I would never read again.

Write a positive review about a good book:    So here is a book I just finished, so there may be typos. The book was soooo good. It gave me some new perspectives on my experience as a trans woman. Not only was I allowed to change my body in the same way I wanted to, but I was also allowed to express my gender and sexuality and I have no idea how this book would have been able to exist if I had not been able do that. The author really did a good job of portraying the trans experience in a positive way that was accurate to what was actually happening in my life, rather than just writing about a negative experience that I had. This book made me feel like I could write and I could make myself feel comfortable, which I am sure is a lot different than having been able write about myself. So yeah, I really enjoyed it.   1) The book is amazing!   It is so great to see a book that is written by a woman, with a lot of input from actual people who know trans women's lives, and not just the writers and their personal experience.  2) The author's writing style is fantastic, and she provides a lot more information that isn't on the internet.  ( I recommend reading the first chapter.)  3) The characters in this book are so well realized. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first book I bought in the series, the second in the last series, and the 3rd in the whole series. And, I must say, I'm happy that I got the books I bought. In terms of the series and the books, I think they are very good. I think that the first book in the first series is the best. It was just the right length. The setting of the world, the characters and the things we see on screen, it all just fit. In a way I was worried about how the book was going to end as the book started, but I was happy to find that everything didn't happen at once. All the characters went through different situations. I liked that the end was a bit unexpected and in-the-middle. I guess you could say, the book doesn't really leave the reader satisfied. It's good to keep the reader reading. The 2nd book in that series was the one that scared me the most, because it seemed to be a bit confusing in a way. And the 3nd one was just... it was a good adventure book. In the 3rst book, it seems that something is going to happen, but then it doesn't happen, so the next book ends up being a little bit confusing. And it felt as though the series is going on for too long and that they are not doing something new in that the next series should be a little less confusing. It just seems to me that the series can be expanded and that more stories could be told, so I'd recommend it as a good series. It's a good read, I had to read this to finish it off, it was just too good of a read to give up. If you haven't read it yet, buy it, I really liked it. It'll be one of the ones you have to read, it'll be part of the collection. I don't like books that come out every few years. There's always some reason why you haven.

Write a positive review about a good book:   . Somewhere in the middle of the book: I love this book!   The worldbuilding is great.   I'm so glad that the author has the vision to tell a story about a planet in which technology has gone too far and people have turned into mutants who are able to transform into anything.  I have a soft spot for this world.  The first time that I read about the planet was when I was a kid and it was on the shelves of my local bookstore.  I still have fond memories of this planet.  It has a nice, fresh feel to it.  That's the thing about books: they always have that kind of fresh feel.  This book is just right for me, because it has the feeling of my childhood that I miss so much.  Yes, there is technology in this book. But in the end, the book is not about technology, but about people, and about their struggles and hopes.    I could have a heart attack every time a character goes to the bathroom in a locker room.  Just reading about the locker room is enough to put me in tears.  But, really, the biggest character in this world is a boy named Jonathan, whose parents have passed away.  That is really something to deal with.  Even though Jonathan's world is far from perfect, I still love the story, the characters, and their struggles. I do think that the ending was a little bit rushed.  Although Jonathan is given a chance to change, I do not think it made much sense that he just goes back to his normal self.  Still, I liked the story and the ending.    I am also glad that there is a lesbian relationship between the two women in the book.  What I didn't like was that the female characters were completely written as love interests.  While I was able to read about their love interests, I think they could have done more to add to the character development.  Maybe in future books?   I do hope that they can expand on the relationships in the world and add more characters from the gay community.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book a bit too much about myself and my experiences. Although there were some interesting points raised by some of the people, I found myself feeling more like a voyeur rather than a participant of the experience.   The author describes the journey from life as a child to adulthood. From being a poor child in rural India, he moved to a poor area in London. From the time he was a child he has been an explorer. He has a lot of interest in ancient history and is fascinated by ancient cultures. This leads him to travel through India and China, and eventually to China.  When he first started to travel he was very much into the exploration and adventure. He had a lot to learn about the world and what was around him.  This trip began when he arrived in China.   This time, he was an old man. He is not a man of leisure. He was an adventurer and traveled with the intent to "discover" more about his world and others. From his perspective this trip was not a "new beginning" but a chance to go back in time to learn the ways of life in India in the last 300 years.  It wasn't a dream or a hallucination. It was a journey to better understand our place in the world, how we can best live with ourselves and our surroundings.  He traveled to India and was taken by surprise at the sophistication of the Indian people, which was different from his own.  This was a very different culture. We can learn from their wisdom and experience.  The experiences he went through were not as much of a "trip" as he would have wanted. It did give him a greater perspective.  From his experience in China he learned about the benefits of a spiritual practice.  I will not say he is a Buddhist but the similarities are interesting.  He talks about how many people are involved in their daily life with spiritual practice and how they need to keep the "spirit in their lives" in order to feel connected to the world. He mentions that the most common way of relating to the spiritual is in meditation. There are many different paths to spiritual practice from which he chose to pursue. He talks a bit about some of his own meditative methods. He also points out that the "self" is a form of energy. We have to be mindful of this and be aware of how our thoughts and actions affect this "self". He also goes into

Write a positive review about a good book:    What an excellent book! It is an excellent description of a complex subject and it does not fall prey to the problems that plague the subject. It's an excellent, readable, easy-to-read book.   I recommend this book to everyone from the beginning to the very end! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book and found it enjoyable, and a lot better than most romance novel. The way the author explains things is very easy to understand. The characters were a little stereotypical, and the way the relationship ended was a little cliché, but that was a personal opinion. I loved the characters and their interactions. The main story was not as strong as the romance, but I did not want it to end. The worldbuilding was very intriguing, as were some of the ideas in the book. I recommend this to anyone interested in a little romance, and an interesting idea, but be careful with the worldbuilding and characters.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a shame that many people have written reviews about "The Man Who Was Thursday" that are not positive. It's because this is one of the most important stories in history: why one man took his own life and what he did to bring it about. I have already covered this in a review I wrote here  . But in a nutshell, in the final years of his life, as an aging but still powerful alcoholic, "Friday" wrote his best book to date (after the great "The Wind in the Willows") and it was titled "The Drunken Clam."   And this is what we have here, one of my favorite short stories ever.  The tale has a bit of a "Das Boot" feel to it. This would explain the length of the book: the author is writing a memoir of his struggles and, as such, it needs to be short and sweet.   The story begins with an opening that is a bit familiar: "Friday, who had taken the train on the way to New York from his home in New Jersey, was about to begin a series of appointments that he was going to make, the first of which was with the local liquor store, and the second of which, the fourth of October, would be the day that he died."     Here, in this very short paragraph, you see that we are entering the world of one Mr. Friday, who has been suffering from an alcoholism that would become a lifelong issue. We see him begin his last appointments for the year: "And then Friday sat down at the bar, with his arms crossed over his chest and his eyes shut tight as if he were about to cry, and, having ordered a drink, he said, 'Oh, I'm a drunk."  "Oh yes, you are," replied the clerk, and then Friday, for the first time since he had arrived in the store, began to cry."  So, let me take this as a good thing: Friday is about to get his drink, but the clerk tells him that he must first fill a prescription before he is allowed to get it.  After that, Friday does everything right to get the drink, including having his glasses brought up to his nose, and while he is doing this, we see him making eye contact with another customer as the clerk brings the drink to him. But he does not take it, he has a drink
Write a positive review about a good book:    Posted by G. K. (Updated Feb 2018) G.K. This book contains much of the material that is included in "A Course in Miracles". The author is a highly intelligent woman who has many years of experience as an astrologer. She is a real person with an active personal life and has not shied away from dealing with the serious issues of life. Her work in this book is also very interesting in that she is writing from personal experience. This is a book worth reading and I am glad to have read it. It is very well-written. She has put her heart and soul into this work and has written a book that you can put in the backseat to a good TV show, play or movie and not be bored. She also makes some interesting points that I have not seen elsewhere.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author shows the importance of an active mind, especially when it comes to understanding complex subjects like physics.   My favorite parts are when she explains how physics has a very complicated name that is hard to pronounce.  "Perturbations" might be the best way to explain it, so I can't say I'm disappointed in the title.  I found myself getting distracted by the word "stabilization".  I also really liked the fact that the author explained to us in a very scientific way why "the concept of a stable configuration, for instance in a particle or a wave, does not need to be explicitly introduced" (p. xxiv).   Overall, I liked the book a lot.
Write a positive review about a good book:    Praise for "The World at the End of the Lane"   "Somewhere in the back of my mind I'm having this image of a kid who's been living with a demon for the last few weeks and he's suddenly got no choice but to see it for what it is."   From an early age, I was a reader. While I was very happy to finish books that my parents let me read, I loved the excitement of being able to explore new worlds and read a new book each day. I was especially excited about science fiction (like "I, Robot" by Isaac Asimov, and "Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley) but also about fantasy and horror (like the classic novel "The Stand") and other books that took me to new worlds. In my teens, my love of reading and world building became so intense that it took a serious toll on my social life. It was just one of those things that you don't notice until you have it. In the fall of 1999, I found myself in my mother's study, looking through a magazine that my father bought for me as a teenager. As I was looking through the magazine, the image that came to my mind was of the "Huck Finn" comic book by Mark Twain. I started reading the comic book to find out who was writing it and I couldn't believe that a book of this kind actually existed. The story is about Huck, a poor farm boy who is on the run from the police. When the comic comes out and people learn of Huck's whereabouts, the police hunt him down, only to realize they have been tricked by a man they think they know. This is a world where the best people are criminals, the best criminals are the police and vice versa. This was a world that I had imagined in my mind for years and I had found it in a comic book. I have always been a reader and now, to discover that this world really exists, was an exciting moment for me. I read the comic in about two weeks, not the way that a normal person reads a comic, but more like a kid reading a book. It's not that I read a comic at a high rate, but I read it a lot. At this point in my life I am an avid reader and I have many favorite books. I am also a bit of a writer and I started to write a book that was about the Huck
Write a positive review about a good book:          Good, but I wish it was more focused on one thing: how to make your character.   So, this is a book that is not for every group.  It is not something for every author.  But, it is a wonderful story, and it is fun to read, and there is a lot to love.  I hope you all enjoy it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. It was very informative. I liked how the book explains different theories behind how the world works. It's very interesting to read a book that doesn't just go into what the Bible says about the world. I enjoyed learning about how the people living in the ancient world thought about the natural world. The book is well done and I believe that this is the best book on the topic that I've ever read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    In the first place, the book is not bad at all. It is just a bit disappointing because of the lack of depth and understanding. I'm not a big fan of a book that simply shows the reader "the whole picture" without much background, explanation, or supporting arguments. You see a picture and you just get it. That's all the book really does. And the picture is clear: it just shows the history of the Soviet occupation of Poland during WWII. The Polish army was a big problem for the Soviet Union. The Soviet army could not win against them on the battlefield. That is, of course, until the Soviets took control of the Polish government in exile and forced the army into its service. That led to Poland becoming an ally of Germany and making the Soviets pay a high price for it. The Soviets did this by having them fight a "defensive war," which was mostly a matter of keeping the army in check. In this way, the Polish army became their ally and did everything to assist them, but it did not help them win the war. The problem of the Warsaw uprising, on the other hand, was that, for the most part, the Soviet army was fighting an internal war within itself: they were fighting their own officers. They didn't know who was the real instigator or the real killer. In the end, the uprising was a massive victory for the Communists, and the Communist government did a horrible job of controlling the uprising. I can't really say that there was an effective solution or strategy to that problem because there was never a clear winner. There were certainly people who were right and others who were wrong, but only the final victory was decided by the people in charge. If that's all there was to the Warsaw Uprising, I would have been much more impressed. In any case, the historical background is there. I wasn't really expecting that. I had hoped that the author would explain the history behind the conflict in a much better way than he does. That he would give the reader the full picture of what actually happened. That would have made this a more satisfying read. Unfortunately, he just shows a bunch of pictures, nothing about the full historical background. Maybe it is the author's intent, but he didn't really give a lot of background or explanation either. I guess that it is a difficult thing to do in a book. I think that I would like to have more background in the future. I also wish

Write a positive review about a good book:    If you like this book, you'll love it.  5 out of 5 stars Emily I loved this book so much I cried at the end. This book helped me get my self in front of my mirror every day and just start taking better care of my hair and I had it back to looking great within a month. I have a very long, thick mane that I just love to comb out. The book explained how to use different products and was very helpful and informative. I will definitely purchase this book again and will recommend it to other women. I am very happy with my purchase and feel like the best possible products for this hair type were used. Thank you so much, Kate, for helping me!  4 out of a 5 stars Mary I'm in my 50s and have been dreading this book. I can't remember all of the ingredients, but all the reviews are good. I'm really happy that I did go ahead and read this book before I bought it. It's been an eye opener for me to see the science behind what works for my hair. It made me realize that my hair isn't just for my face, it's really the best part of my face! I hope that I can still get out of bed on the right hair day and not have to spend a lot of time combing/shampooing/rinse and go! (I'm hoping the hair color and products I use aren't bad for my scalp).  3 out of the 5 stars Anonymous I've been using the Shave and Styling System for about a month and so far I am really pleased with the results. However, I have to say that I had to purchase this product in two sizes to cover my face and the chest. I've had it for a couple weeks now and I'm ready to give it to my daughters who are going through menopause. It may be that I'm too sensitive because my skin still feels itchy after applying this product. I don't know. Maybe my skin just got used to the smell and texture. If it helps the problem, I will try using a different fragrance/cologne on the chest (that is not the scent of the Shampoo/Conditioner that I used) to see if that helps. Thanks, Shave & Styling, I hope it's effective enough for my daughters.
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's not a book I want to be reading all the time because it is good, and I don't want to waste it but also because it takes a lot of patience to read. The story is about a girl who is having some problems in her life, that she cannot get over. It's a very beautiful book. The characters are well developed, and it has the feeling of a diary, the kind you keep for a long time. I really enjoy reading it because I am trying to write the same thing.   I love the theme of how much you don't know about life in general.  Posted by Sian at 2:10 PM

Write a positive review about a good book:   I started off a little nervous with this one but ended up very pleased. I think this might be my favorite book from this series so far. I was looking for something slightly different than the other book in the series. I liked the story more, the characterization was better, the action was faster and there were less scenes that were too confusing (the one in this one is actually quite easy to follow but there's a lot of information thrown at you at once that can be quite confusing). The main thing I liked about this book was that it did include characters from all three books in the trilogy. I like to read them all in a series. This book included both Luke and Leia. The book did have an odd ending that I'll talk about below. I loved this book but was a little disappointed with the ending.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is really good. I like that it tells me where I was and where I'm going. It's also a good story to start the new year off right.    My first experience with the "furry" community:  I am a fairly new fursuiter. I found the community online and joined on. I had never been on any furry meetups or parties before this. This was my first year attending a convention. I did not think I was going to like it but I did and I have enjoyed every bit of it. I went on my first furmeet. It was on October 15th at an outdoor music festival and the main hall was filled. I made friends there and met other furs and got to meet many new friends from all over the world. We did all kinds of things, from games to costume contests to photo shoots. This is the first year that I have attended a con I've been excited to go to. I also have been attending the next one, which will be next year, but I've heard from other people who have attended it who think it's the best of the three.   The community is awesome, and I feel comfortable there with all my friends. I think a lot of the things I like about the furry community are the people, the art, and the music. I've become very good friends with a fursuit maker who I'll be meeting again for a meetup in June. I have started attending furry parties and conventions where I don't care about the cost. I actually don't even care about money at all. I'm just here to have a good time and I'm sure that will continue as long as I enjoy the fandom.   in general I enjoy watching videos of all the different shows and being able to meet new people. I want to go on more of these furry parties, meet more people and enjoy the community.     A story of growing up and getting involved in the fandom:    My mom was a furry. She is a very outgoing person. She was in her fursuits at the conventions when I was growing up, and she was one of the most knowledgeable and enthusiastic people I've ever met. She loved the fandom and wanted me to be a part of it in some way. I don' t think I knew what to do at the time but she was always so encouraging. I was 14 when she passed away

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm very happy to have read this book!   This book is a wonderful addition to my reading list!  I think it's the only book I've read so far in 2015 that's worth re-reading.   It's not the first of a series or anything like that but this was a very enjoyable read.  A great book that has a lot of good advice and has a fun book format that I enjoyed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    You will love this book.   It has changed my perspective on life and I can't wait to read more of it.  Thank you so much for sharing this with us, and letting us know you are a happy camper.  I'm going to be keeping a copy of it on my shelf and giving it as a gift as well!  I would totally recommend this to any and all lovers of humor, and books with happy endings.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I have enjoyed every aspect of this book from its structure to its writing."  I would suggest this book to people with an interest in the history of literature, history of philosophy, and the history and sociology of science as well as those who are interested in philosophy, literature, science, and social psychology as they relate to one another. The book is well-written, well-organized, and has a clear structure. One criticism I have is the fact that the book does not deal with every major point raised by philosophers over the years. It would have been great to have the book expand its coverage.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The premise of this book is not good. As I read I couldn't help but feel frustrated that so much of the writing in this book was poorly written. I'm glad that it is a standalone and is not part of the main story, but that did not help the pacing of this story. The first three hundred pages were okay, then the story lost steam for me and I really didn't care about the story anymore. It felt so empty. The author even makes fun of herself for her lack of research.   I had so many questions left unanswered: What did it have to do with this group of people and their lives, why were the kids so different, and why were there so many references to a man and his wife, yet there were no stories about them?   When the story did move along, there were a lot of confusing details, confusing characters, and confusing plots.  (1) - The characters in this story were all so flat, so flat that I started to question their characterizations. The main character (and I can only assume the author is the main character) was so boring and flat in the beginning.  (2) - As for why there were so many different people and not just one person, the author writes about some of the people and the group in a very generic way, I think because she wasn't a part of it all.  The group was so generic, the main female was a total damsel in distress, she had to be saved from being murdered, and she is constantly in trouble because of how she acts and her stupid personality.  How is it even possible for the main male character to be the best leader in the group?  I think he is very arrogant and I did not like him, and he even says that he is not the leader.  I really enjoyed reading this book because it is like a little book that you can pick up and read anywhere. I guess that is the best way to describe it, it has its flaws but I think that for everyone who has not read this book, it is worth the read, and even if you have read it, I still recommend you read this as a standalone because of all the amazing characters that are presented.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book. The author, Laura Lippmann, is wonderful at explaining her theories and writing her ideas down well so she makes the reader interested in trying to understand them. She has an easy, charming writing style and the topics of her book are interesting. I recommend this book highly.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love the fact that he tells the story of a young, talented, yet naive, boy named David (he was born in 1970) in such a positive way. David is a true kid and there's an excitement in his life and yet he's a young man and I see him as someone who is trying to find his way in the world as it is today. He's smart and he is trying hard and he knows what he wants but he still doesn't know. He wants to be an actor.   The book takes you through the early years of David and his mother's relationship and David's growing friendship with a boy named Mark (born in 1976). David's mother and Mark's mom are still together and David gets the chance to get to know his father and I liked that David gets to know the father who he never had, but still had a great relationship with (my mom's family didn't know my dad well though).   At this point it gets pretty sad as David goes through his senior year and tries to be a good kid but then comes to find out his dad was the person who sold him out.  The last chapters of the book I read were sad as we see David grow up and become a teenager. I think this book would be a great book for someone like David or anyone else who is still a kid and wants to know more about their father, but maybe also has questions about what it is to grow up.  I had heard a few people talk about how they could identify with the character and that's why I enjoyed the book so much.  So I decided to give it a go.  I think it was the first book I got after I came to New Zealand.  And the book was written by a great writer named John Caird and I'm glad he chose to write a book about the relationship between a young girl and a young boy. The book is short and sweet but filled with enough information for the main character to grow into a pretty great adult.  It was a great read.  Thanks to John for creating such an interesting and positive character and this book made me feel so connected to the story that it's hard to put it down. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a book about the first time I ever met an Irish person on a bus in Dublin. It's a short story about two Irish people, a gay couple, who live in Dublin and travel between the city center and the countryside. It was written by Michael Conroy.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It would be easier to say that it's a bad book, but the thing is: I haven't read any book written by people who don't speak English, and yet I had a lot of fun reading it. The story is very well told, and you never find the story boring. It's good! It's one of those books, which are rare in the genre, that is better than a novel written in English.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was my first read through the series. I read the prologue in a couple of nights and then went ahead and read the rest. I absolutely loved it and the stories were definitely better. I didn't find the story dull or dull at all, but this book just was much better, both the first book and the first two books. The stories were not all that different (although they had a lot of similarities), but they were all written in a way that made them feel like they all fit together. I really really liked this book and I think it's a fantastic series.    I gave this book three stars out of four stars because, the first time I read it, it was a little confusing for me, but then I figured out a lot about the world. I'm not quite sure what I liked about the story, but it's definitely a good series and I hope this first volume is the last.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The author has a clear understanding of the nature of the modern day, secular "New Atheism." This has been good for both the book and the community, and I look forward to the next book.   I wish there was more about modern secular philosophy and theology in a "good-bad" framework that the author presents.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read a lot of fiction. My wife and I were looking for a good story, but we weren't looking for something that would appeal to the broadest possible audience, just a decent story. This book is very much in that vein. There are a couple of things that would have been a lot better if I had been reading it aloud. I wish I had thought of more places and things I would have liked to see the characters interact with each other.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This was a great read.   I have a daughter who is 13 and a brother, 10, and this book helped us to understand the issues that are being faced by all of our children. I am glad that my child understands what is happening to him and is being prepared.  "My friend was being bullied and I was being scared for him," a 13-year-old boy told his dad, "but I decided I would stop him." He explained how he had used his finger and the hair on his head to push the bullies off, but they would not let up. He felt like he was losing his mind.  "My friends were telling me that my parents were being stupid and they would soon be divorced." His father asked his friend if he had seen his mother's boyfriend. "Yes," the friend answered. "He was very mean." "Did you tell him you loved him?" "No," he said. "The last time I talked to him he had just come from a party and had just started to lose his mind." 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The Good Old Days by Peter N. Smith was the third book I read in the series but it's not quite a sequel. It's set in the same universe but it doesn't feel like one. The main character isn't quite the same as he was in the first two books (there's a slight improvement in his characterizations in the last book), but there's no "he's a bad person now" in this book. I liked the story, although it didn't keep me reading for very long. However, the characters were all quite interesting.      The Bad Old Days:  The first book in the Good Old Times series.   I've been told the plot of this book is similar to the first one, but I think it takes a different turn. There are three main characters in this one, so there's some overlap in the plot. The story is also rather long, though the main characters have a lot of time to talk about the topics that matter to them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:     This book is a very solid read for a beginner to read a good story.    The book is very different from any other fantasy I've read, and it's easy to see why. The characters are very well written. The story itself is very well done, and the ending is perfect. The world is quite unique.  The main character has a very dark past, and has learned from his mistakes.  The world building in this book is excellent. It's believable, and yet you don't know all of the details, because it's just a story. The way they are created is amazing.  If you enjoy a good read, read this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I got a copy of   The Magician's Nephew on a mission trip in Peru and it was the best book I've read for a long time.   This is a truly awesome book, with characters, action, and a great plot.  I just finished it in less than a week, and I really enjoy it.  There's really no place to go wrong in this book!  I think it's the only book in the series I didn't read in this order and I'm so grateful that it's not.  One of the best books I've ever read and that really makes me love The Magicard's Nephews   so much.  If you're looking for a good story with lots of action and awesome characters you can't go wrong with The Magicinger's Nephthys."     I'd say the magic is a little weaker in this one than the other books in the trilogy, but they still have some great magic tricks.  The story is told in first person perspective from the point of view of John and Lucy, a couple who had an adventure in the magical lands of Peru when they were young.  John is a magician who wants to become a magician like his father, and he doesn't want to get involved with Lucy's brother and sister, because they're all "pompous" and "wander off" a lot.  He wants to be a magician so that his own magic can be good.  But a magic book catches Lucy's attention.  It makes her feel smart.  Her cousin, the Magician, wants to borrow a magic spell book from John for his new show.  Unfortunately, Lucy has a new show coming up, which will involve many different types of magic, not just the one he's using.  However, the other magician who will perform with the show is a student of John's who is much more powerful than John.  So John does everything he can to help the Magicman get his book back.  Then Lucy has another idea! She will help John. And to prove that she's really smart, she'll read the book and then prove to the other magicians that she can do what she says she can!   A really good story.  It's easy to imagine the adventures that John and the other magical people will have in this world.  As long as the plot stays interesting, there's a lot of interesting

Write a positive review about a good book:     "My most read and appreciated book of 2017. I am thrilled that a book that I read at age 9 years has been revisited so many years later. If you enjoy books about history and the military, this one will make you want to go back and read it all again. It makes me appreciate what is possible even for books that I loved as a child. I also found myself being drawn into the story. It is very unique in the way it tells its story. " -Jennifer, Santa Rosa CA
Write a positive review about a good book:    "A very good read and a wonderful introduction to mathematics." "Excellent! A wonderful book! A must read for all who wish to learn more about mathematics."   I've been thinking about this book a lot lately because it was the first book that I purchased in the calculus series. For a while, I felt that I didn't know the difference between the kinds of differentiation that were being taught in the mathematics department at the time (differential equations and the like) and I was quite happy with this book. I found it difficult to put down for the first few chapters as it taught the fundamental concepts that I had needed for calculus and the subject of differentiation well. I don't recall any difficult concepts or concepts that made me feel like I had to reread everything a couple of times. For the most part, the book is good at what it does. It teaches the students how to think in terms of integration and differentiation. And it provides some proofs that are clear and easy to follow. A few of the concepts that are discussed are things I'm still unsure of and it is good to read other materials before going off and teaching myself. For me, it is not a book that will lead me on the path to a better understanding of calculus, but a book I will be reading again when I need to get to the more difficult stuff. Read at the library: I don't consider myself a mathematician or a good reader. For that matter, I don a little bit of both! For the past two years, I've been putting away one book a week in the form of a pdf document. The purpose of this is to stay abreast of what is going on in the world and where I can gain some practical use from it. I am learning more about what is relevant and relevant to a person who might find themselves in the math department at university or be in a position to make a living by using their knowledge of the mathematics world. In case you don't want to take the time to read a few articles about my current situation or you would prefer that I just provide you with a list, here is what the books I have bought over the past couple of years are: Calculus by R.A.

Write a positive review about a good book:     My mother-in-law has a copy of these two books in her collection and I bought them for her. It's a shame she never read the second one because I think she would like it and I think it would be a wonderful gift for my mom, whose favorite things are science fiction and fantasy. I know I'm going to be giving this to my friends who like to read fantasy. It might be a bit long at around 120 pages but it's an excellent read and I'd recommend it to all the readers out there. It doesn't get much better than this and this is my way of saying thank you.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   "This is a real treat for all fantasy readers. It starts off very dark, with the arrival of the two characters, who are in hiding out in the countryside. While the story itself may not be that exciting and there are a few cliches here and there, what really stands out is that the author does such a great job of building tension and then letting the magic really rip!"   
Write a positive review about a good book:        A very good and detailed review for the very good book about the world of the Neath.   The book is very comprehensive and you will learn a lot about all the different tribes and the places you will go to visit.   This book has been very good. It was extremely detailed and interesting and I am still reading it.  A must read for any of you that are interested in a really detailed description of all the places of the world that you can go to, and also learn about the history of the place itself. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    To be honest, I have very little idea what to say about this book. I have never read a series by anyone other than the author before. So, when I got the book, I was expecting a new book in the series, maybe a prequel, but that was not what I got. My biggest disappointment was the story's lack of depth. It had its moments, but most of it felt like exposition that was never utilized, like when the kids were playing in the snow outside.   The best thing this series had going for it was the artwork. The artists (mostly the girl artists, but there were a few boys too) drew some beautiful artwork that has been shown in other books before. However, the problem is that the artists only do three or four panels at a time. The way this works, the artist is shown on a one panel scene in which the two main characters are in a certain position, but the backgrounds are never explained, they are just there to draw the scene in. If they had gone with a panel-based book, then that would have helped.  This book was pretty slow, but at least the pacing felt right and the story was well-written.  If you're a fan of YA, then this is a solid book, but if you're not, then it's not a bad book by any means.
Write a positive review about a good book:    * * * My book The Power of Now (2014) is a must read for anyone who wants to achieve any of the things I have achieved and that I have talked about in this book. It's an excellent and profound book. The only negative thing I have to say is that it seems to be a bit of a stretch for some people, because this book can get a bit complex for the layman. If you need a quick-reference book and you want to find out how to do everything in life, this is the one you should read. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a book with powerful insights on life. --Tara D. Davis, Psychology Today   " The Power Of Now is a profound, deeply humane account of how people have dealt with the suffering of others and how the best of us can rise to overcome the worst. --The Atlantic Monthly  " This is a powerful book. In it, Eckhart Tolle reveals a way of seeing the world that is at once compassionate and rigorous. It is an inspirational book for those seeking to reach deep levels of inner peace. -- The Boston Globe   "[A]n insightful book... I found the 'Power Of Now' to be an inspirational read... a book that can help readers deal with their own life. It will not only open a new door to their consciousness but, with careful consideration, can help to create new openings for others as well. -- Publishers Weekly   "... a fascinating look at the origins of the self and the nature of consciousness... Tolle uses his own journey to achieve deep healing to help others, with a mixture of spiritual and emotional wisdom. --Library Journal   This book is a revelation. In a sense, it's a book written by the Buddha, because it is about how to live in a world where we all have great obstacles. Eckhart's advice, which comes in the form of stories, is to "Look beyond the pain, look beyond the fear, look past the suffering, because when we can't see the pain and the fear anymore, we are not living at all. But when we see that we still have those things in ourselves that we don't want to see, we live at all." --The Globe and Mail   A fascinating, compassionate and insightful book. Tolle's meditation practice shows that when you realize that your suffering is not your own fault, you don't feel it as you do when it is
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was just what I needed.   The main characters were just my sort of characters.  I couldn't have been more pleased.  I am a big fan of adventure/mystery stories.  They are fun and the twists and turns are so satisfying.  The book didn't take a lot of thought but it made up for it with its plot twists and clever characters. I will definitely be buying this book as soon as I get it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "The only reason to read this book is that you are a reader and you want to feel like a real person.   It's a fun read about how a high school girl becomes a teen idol with help from a very unlikely male friend.  The book starts off as a love story but is really about a friendship that happens to be a love triangle.  It is also a book about being a teenager and the growing up of a character.  There is something to be said about how the author uses real life situations to illustrate what can happen to anyone during their high school years.  I feel like this is a book that many teenagers may enjoy because of the author's unique voice." -Emily K. S. "It's about a boy who's about to enter high school. It's about how he meets a girl and how she helps him get ready for his first day of school. I loved the way that the author was able to turn his teenage boy into a teen girl. It was so awesome and fun. It is about the struggles and growth that a teen experiences, and it's always refreshing to have someone write an adult novel for teens that is not "girly".  If you like this book, you will definitely enjoy the next one." -Natalie P. Praise for "All My Pretty Horses" by Michael Chabon "I'm not really sure what I did to make me love this book so much more than any other. Maybe the fact that it was written by Michael J. Chab on his own (and for once, not with his wife) and not by a co-author.  This is probably the best novel I've read in a while, and the best by an author who is the real deal and not a ghostwriter, or a self-promoting literary agent.  " -T.S. "[Chabon] manages to make his characters so real and so believable that, at times, I felt like I was experiencing their first real social interaction." -Jennifer B. It's a beautiful story of teenage love, friendship, and high school life.  The characters are both vivid and fascinating.  They all develop at a really wonderful pace.  A very interesting and memorable character.    [Chabin] is able to craft a book, a great read for a teenager, that will not leave you wanting more, but will give you just
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book on a whim while on a book fair. I knew nothing about the author and thought this was going to be another book about a man with a bad relationship. What I found instead was a story of a man trying to come to terms with his past, with the feelings he holds and with the pasts of his family and friends. He does a pretty good job of setting up the story but it's a little frustrating that it's not that easy to follow.   The characters were interesting. I'm a big fan of the way Jekyll is a kind, nice, intelligent, handsome guy who just can't deal with the world. He has an excellent story to tell. It would've been much better had he been able to be a little more honest in his past. I'd have liked to have seen Jekyl and Hyde have some kind of relationship but he could be so honest that he can't be a whole person without all that guilt hanging around.     As a woman, I didn't enjoy this one. I find the plot to be fairly boring. It's hard to understand why it is that all men are so afraid of women. How can a woman be this scary? It's like an old woman in a horror movie.  The writing is mediocre at best. I don't even think I got to read the end of the book. I think the author wrote about three or four sentences in the middle.     Overall:  I'd like to give this a two star but I just can not put the book down. It took me a while to get through it and I really didn't get the point of the story. It has a couple of great ideas but I didn�t understand them very well. I do like the premise though.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a great read. It is very well written, and the information contained in this book is of a very high quality.   It is important to remember that a good deal of this information can be found online, and that a lot of the information is still being kept secret. This information is also still being used to maintain control over the world.  Some people get sick after taking certain vitamins, and a number of these vitamins can be dangerous.  This book explains that these vitamins are actually safe, but the government doesn't want the public to know. The reason for keeping this information secret is very sinister. 
Write a positive review about a good book:     The most important thing I can say about this book is that it's a good read. It's a story that's not your typical adventure story. There's a very well thought out plot and the story has a well thought-out ending.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    Read the full review My favourite book of 2015 is a very short book, yet it manages to be both thoughtful and funny all at once. It is a book about one of the most common things people do: the internet. The story takes place in the world of social media, where people do not want to leave the comfort of their online life behind, even when their home is threatened. What they don't realise is that the "home" they left behind is not a safe place at all. It's a lonely place that is far from being a place they want to be, which is why their online friends are so important. It starts with a series of events that make the author start to question whether he wants to be online anymore. What if there are more important things in life than a constant stream of friends? What if he has to go back home for some reason? What will the new world that he is leaving behind be like? The story ends with a rather depressing ending, but it gives you enough time to ponder on your own life choices that you have made in the past year.   My favourite thing about this book was how it made me think about the different times in my life, where I have been online. My favourite things to do on the internet have always been gaming and watching Netflix. When I play video games, I am always alone. When watching Netflix, I'm always alone too. I used to think that this was a bad thing, but this book showed me how much I love to connect with other people. The book had me thinking about people I know online, and how I like to do things with them on the web. I also found it interesting that many people have been through similar events, and still don't want to go home because of how their lives are changed. It also made me see my own loneliness. I do live alone, but still have my friends, and the book showed us that the things we want to do, it's all about how we want others to think of us. It showed us how to be happy, but also how to accept our life and its things. The author also did a great job of not showing you all the details, but instead leaving you to enjoy each scene for yourself. I highly recommend this book, and if you are looking for something light, and entertaining, this book is a good one to pick up.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is well written and the pacing is just right. I loved the fact that each character, the characters, got a chance to have some character development as well.   I enjoyed the fact it wasn't just a straight up action book but a novel that allowed the characters to grow and develop. I like the way it was written and I would definitely read another book from this author.
Write a positive review about a good book:   My wife and I are in love with this book, even though we didn't want to read it. My wife has struggled with an eating disorder for years. She was diagnosed a year ago. We both agreed to read this book for her benefit, because she's not interested in reading the positive reviews of the books about eating disorders. We enjoyed it! I think it is a great resource for people with eating disorders to find out more about what you are going through or can be going through. In fact I feel so strongly about it, I am going to order it for my mother! My wife found it to be informative. We read it twice and are going to buy it a third time. I feel I'm finally learning how to read a book about eating and not feel like an idiot reading it.   Overall:    5 stars
Write a positive review about a good book:    The one that made me laugh the hardest was   This is a story about a person who makes one last bid to win a lottery ticket.   He is determined to beat the odds and win the jackpot, but he has no idea how to win it.  It's not quite the perfect book, but it still contains plenty of laughs and good advice for any reader.  How to win big and break through any resistance:  What can you do if you have no idea what you are doing?   You can try to guess the numbers of a random number generator, but chances are you won't get all the correct numbers.  If you want to break through a stubborn resistance, you have to do it the right way: take your time, look around, and think about what's best for you.   In the end you will win, but you must do it in the right order.

Write a positive review about a good book:    If I could give this book an extra star, I would!   My absolute favorite part of this book was the fact that it had a nice little story in the back of the book.   This is one of the few books that really left me wanting to know where the story was going next.  The plot was pretty much where I wanted it to go.  While it's not perfect it was very good and had a good twist and really made me want to read more!  I was very satisfied with how it was told.  And all in all, this book will hold a special place in my heart as a good read!
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is great. I think it's the best book on parenthood written since The Baby Book by Laura Vanderkam. While it is written from the perspective of a single mother, it is more like a parent's guide, with a great deal of information about parenting from other families.  I think it can help a lot of people who are interested in parenthood, like I am.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book has lots of great and well-illustrated photos and lots of excellent advice for getting through the winter, but the story and the advice are not the strong parts of this book. A little of that may be the author's fault, but some of it seems to be the publisher's fault. The Book's Structure:  I have to agree with a reviewer who says that the first half of the book is a "meandering tour" of how to get through the difficult winter months. This, I think, is too slow to really help someone. I would have preferred to see the book move more quickly and focus more on the author/author's experiences (i.e. how she got through the book!). The second half, however, is an enjoyable read, and I really like the way the author uses this material in the writing of her book. I especially liked how she presented "bad" situations in a positive light.   The Good:  Many excellent recipes!    As with all books, the first one in a series is generally best.  There is a lot of advice to help one deal with the winter months and I loved the way she put it into her recipe book.  The Bad:    Many recipes are in the wrong order. I liked the way that her recipe order was written, but I also found the recipe for her Pumpkin Brownies to be a bit of a mess. There are lots of steps and ingredients that were missing or confusing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished reading a book called "The Rise of Superman" and I have to say, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would! The author does a great job in telling his story and there was plenty of action. I have a few recommendations for the book.   This author has made a career out of doing what many of us dream about. He makes Superman cool again by taking a chance on a young fan and not being afraid to take chances. It's a lot of fun to see how Superman changes over the years as he finds out who he is and learns that there are more important things in life than his reputation. I just hope more comic books are like this one. It has got a lot to say and it's a fun read!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really like this book. I think that what makes it better is the inclusion of the background on how a woman came to become the wife of a black man in the 1800s. The author, Michelle Cottle, really is very knowledgeable about this subject, and it shows. It's also good to see a black woman in a fantasy setting, particularly when it's done well.   -M
Write a positive review about a good book:   The only book I read for myself last year that I am not yet ready to review. This book was great though! I am a sucker for the old books that have been out for a while and are now out of print. It was an easy read, and I liked the author's writing style.   I recommend this book if you enjoy a bit of history and are looking for an old book to read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great little book.    This book would be better as a short story than a novella.  It's a good story, but I think there's better stuff to be written in the space it covers.  It's also a shame that the story doesn't go beyond a few pages.  The short story is a better fit for the novel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   For those of you in the mood for some deep stuff: "I was so upset about my dad. The first night he was gone, I took him out for a couple of beers. We made it a point to talk about how much he loved us and wanted to see us one last time."   "As my dad began to unravel, I realized that something inside of me had turned off. My dad's passing only confirmed what I'd been feeling all along."  "My mom had me take out a lot of money from my retirement fund so that I could go out with my friends on our second day together. But I didn't feel right about that at all."

Write a positive review about a good book:    I highly recommend it   The book contains interesting and useful information on the topic of the book, it is just short on examples. It is also very much a subjective book. It will help to understand how certain systems will work or not work and what you should expect as far as the end result, for example, how will the systems be organized. If I had to give an example that would be how the CNC system works for the router and how it interacts with the robot in the end.

Write a positive review about a good book:     "As a former marine who spent a lot of time in combat zones I have heard many stories about how tough these Marines are to work with. I can honestly say that when I got to spend some time in boot camp and learn from their experiences the experience was very valuable. This book provides a good read and should provide a lot more military members an opportunity to see the inside of a Marine infantry battalion and see what life is really like. I was shocked by how close a lot the troops are to one another. They are all proud to be Marines and I believe that they will do a great job when they are deployed, but when they return home, they will all have a better understanding of each other and they will come back stronger."  -C. B.  "...an inspiring and informative read."  "This is a great read, and I found it easy to read and understand."  it took me about 3 years to get out of the Marine Corps because my mother, and her two daughters had to leave the military with me so I could go off to boot camp to learn how to fight. I learned a lot about Marines from reading this book and I am so happy to see it get a good review. "  I liked this book, I feel I learned something new and maybe I will be more open to the military the next time I am in a combat environment.  the military has many problems but I have a great experience with the Marines, the training is fun, the people are warm and funny. I loved the way they talked to oneanother. The best part is the book is a compilation of stories from the troops, and it's the reader's turn to decide which ones they liked best, and how much of what they saw were true, I hope more books like this exist so everyone can learn something from the best and brightest in the Marine Corp. . I just finished this book (a 4 star)  After seeing two Marines get killed in action at one time, I couldn't believe my eyes when I heard they would write a book like this...but this book did just that! The people from the Marine's company, company, battalion and battalion company (I was in all 4 of these) are all incredibly open and honest about what goes on out in the real world...and I think the reader will come away with a better appreciation for the Marines and a better idea of what it's like to be a

Write a positive review about a good book:      I just finished this book. I'm not a writer, so I cannot comment on the story, which was decent enough. I liked the way the author talked about what he knew, his life, and the people who had lived and died with him. I am a fan of science fiction, and I really enjoyed the plot. The story was interesting enough, but it just didn't have much to do with anything I know. The setting was interesting, but I think it would have been better had it been about something that I was familiar with. I'll give it three stars, because it's a good enough book.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read "Miles Ahead" and "Gone Girl" and enjoyed both. I like both books. However, they are two very different things. "Mile Ahead" is well researched, interesting, and engaging. "Gonzo" is not at all. This is a true tale of the life of a young boy who becomes a writer at age 14. What's really remarkable is how he grows to be one of the best writers in the world. Miles is a child who, through the miracle of language, becomes a brilliant writer. What he does isn't the simple story of a child being inspired. Miles does his own research. He is an incredibly smart and thorough thinker. And he makes his readers think.  Miles is an incredible kid who comes from nothing. He was born in poverty. But he's smart enough to be a genius in his own right, even though he was raised by a single mother who is struggling with mental health issues. Miles begins to have doubts and is forced to find some type of identity by trying to find a job in a different city. As he discovers his own self-worth, Miles finds himself falling for a woman who, unlike him, is rich. The romance begins when Miles gets in a car crash that kills his friend and leaves him in a coma. He has no one but himself to care for, but he's able to begin to make friends again. It becomes clear that he is more than just an ordinary genius and that he can become an outstanding writer in the face of adversity.
Write a positive review about a good book:     I read this book and loved it. It made me feel as though I really understood the culture of medieval Japan, as well as the history of Japan in general. The author really took a lot of the history and customs that were brought to Japan as a result of being a foreign country into account, and I really appreciated that.  My only gripe is that this book really needs an index. It was hard to keep track of what the author was saying for the majority of the book, especially because each character's role in each part of the story seems to change a lot. It gets to be kind of hard to understand if you are not familiar with the characters in the book. The last part of book is really well done, though.  is a book about the culture and society of medieval Japanese culture. What better way to learn about that than by reading this book. What I liked: the author did a really great job of taking all the aspects of the historical Japan that were put into the book and making a believable and relatable world out of them. My only gri  the author did such a great job in explaining all the things that were wrong about the times, and the ways that those wrongs were caused and remedied. I was really impressed with how detailed and thought-out this book was. What disappointed me: it didn't end really well. I have never really had a good ending to a book, and this book wasn't really a good way to end it. I don't really know why that is, but it isn't anything the author can really change. Overall: a very enjoyable and well done book, I highly recommend this book!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book a few months ago, and it was great! It's really not that complicated; just get your students to do the exercises and have them do their best. This is a good set of exercises for students who want to be able to do this in front of a real teacher. And the book does have the same level of exercises as the course; it just takes a little bit of planning to put them all together.  4 of 4 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:   If you're into a good literary novel about a guy who loves books and is a bit of a nerd, then "This is My Name" is the book for you.   It's not just that it's a good novel.  It is a good example of a literary novel with good characters who all make good decisions. "This isn't about a man who loves a particular book or genre; it's about a journey."   I found this book at the library. It was very easy to read.  I bought it because it is a great novel and it was published in 2005.  The writing style was very good and I loved the story.  This novel is about a person named Nick (he had my favorite first name, I swear) and his struggles with his love of books.  He is a geeky guy who likes to read and has a special place in his heart for his favourite author: David Foster Wallace.  Nick's best friend says he will die before he reads another book.  But Nick doesn't care because he is one of his favorite authors.   I love the way he reads and talks to people. Nick was very smart and was able to make many great decisions as a result of his love for David Foster wallace. This is a very strong character.  If you like geeky nerds, then I think you will like this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The book was a nice read. The author is not an "elitist," and does not want to make a judgement on anything.   This book is about the life of a great man. His father, an ex-KGB officer, left his wife, children, and mother at the age of twenty-seven to be with the KGB during World War II. When he returned home, he spent the rest of his life with a single-minded obsession: to create a system to control people by the force of a single thought.  To create a perfect society. It was a difficult task for the author, and he was not always successful. He describes his life as a lonely man, his relationship with his father, his experience in a psychiatric hospital, his early marriage to a woman who was not happy, and the death of his son.  Although it may seem a little boring at first, this is a life of great beauty, of a man who sacrificed everything for his ideas and his goals. The book is quite enjoyable if you are interested in history, and if you like Russian history. I don't know if it would be for everybody, but for me, it was quite a great read.  This book is also available on my website.  http://www.thesuper-fan.blogspot.com/2014/09/great-man-and-his-ideas-of.html

I think there is some really good science to be found in this story, which is not always the case. As a reader I think it can be rather dry and philosophical...

They are both given names by their fathers. But all names are not alike. They may sound like names from a child's picture book, but in fact the names have power: a person's name can be the name of a person. For Eros men are very different from women and from one another. A man who is not a man becomes an in-betweener. And he is always a man who cannot be a man. It is a place where the people live in a sort of stasis, a state of in-between-ness.  Eros is a society without death, a society of eternal life. All men die at once, but they live again on the next day, for eternity. The men have names, and the women have names. The names are chosen by men from lists. The male names are called J, O, P, and Z. The female names are the O, G, E, and W. Men call each other by their names and call women by their words.  was born and grew up on the world of men. His father is a man named Eros.

The animals they were born as had no names. Then came the word "heal" and the word 'flesh' and "blood." Soon it was clear that the men had become women.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The Good    The Good This book is written well, and does not give you a lecture about history or sociology. I really enjoyed the story about one man that was able to see things from a different point of view in a place that is usually very biased. He is so far removed from the politics of the country, and yet the politics are the main thing he has to deal with.   This book is about the life of a man named John Stryker, who has a very hard life, due to a lot of racism from the government (his father being in the US Army). John Styrker and a few of his brothers are born in the middle of a civil war in the U.S.  His story, the way he lived, and his life at that time, changed his life in a way that most people don't know. The book is also about people in prison, which I think is the most interesting part.  I loved this book because it is written by a person who is not very well known in the United States.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book. The characters are well drawn, the setting is a nice touch.

Write a positive review about a good book:    You've found a wonderful book! In a genre that can be a little predictable, your choices for characters, and the way you've written them, made for an extremely enjoyable read. I've listened to and enjoyed a number of the books in your series and look forward to your next release. (Review from a Goodreads Member)  From the review at BookFiction.com: A great book that covers many topics, from the life of a woman named Rachel to the life and career of a young, up and coming novelist who is going into the field of historical fiction. It also provides you a good idea about what works for you in your own novels.  The narration is excellent, and I highly recommend the series. This series has been recommended to me several times by numerous readers of The Book Smugglers Blog.  in the same day:  I got this book because of the reviews, but then I got the sequel "The Queen's Men" last week and that's where the magic is. These are both excellent novels, with excellent writing and terrific characters. I'm looking forward to the last book in the series soon. (review from a goodreads member)  to the review from the author herself: I first read The Queen's men after I had finished the previous book in my trilogy, but I also took a look at the comments, and most of the positive reviews were about the first book in your trilogy and I thought I should revisit it and see how it compared. This is a fun book with a lot of plot and many memorable characters. You've given readers a lot to chew on in this book and I'm curious to see how you'll tie up all the loose ends, especially as the second in a series. I also enjoyed the short introduction you provided with your reviews: "There are few, if any, heroes in modern American fiction. You're free to write characters who are complex, flawed, and morally grey, or you can go with the easy formula that the average reader is used to: there is a good guy, a bad guy, and a heroic good guy. I went with the latter, and hope to be proved wrong. I believe there is an untapped pool of interesting characters in our society, both good and bad. Some of these characters might be heroes, or villains, but either way, they can bring us closer to ourselves than we would ever be if we spent the last fifty years of our

Write a positive review about a good book:   It's like a new chapter.    The first volume of this series is the weakest book in this series but I think this second volume is a big improvement and I recommend it highly. This is the sort of story that just feels right.  I don't think I can overstate the effort that went into writing this.  The quality of the writing and character development is top notch and I feel that the author has the gift of creating a believable fantasy world that is a true reflection of our world. This world is beautiful and I love the fantasy elements like the magic and dragons.  If you like fantasy but don't necessarily like epic fantasy then I recommend this series as it's both a little different and quite enjoyable.

I am a big fan of science fiction, and when I saw that there was a book out for women scientists in the same genre I had to pick it up.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book.    In this new edition by Dr. M.S.S., the author writes: "This revised edition addresses many of the concerns voiced in the first edition, including that of the'mythical nature of UFOs' as a 'conspiracy of silence', as well as the issues of the alleged 'extraterrestrial origin' of UFOs. " The author also addresses a couple of other subjects and adds additional research into the subject." So it's a very different book now.  I don't believe it's the original title "UFOs: Extraterrestrials in our Midst" because I haven't read it in over 25 years.  The new edition is very much an improvement in some areas and a different approach.  And the author, Dr. Joseph E. Sessums, is a very well-read fellow and very well known in the field.  (This is a book I am very glad to see the author write again and, for me, there's a lot of good new material and material not addressed previously, so it's good to see this old book updated.   I also like his choice of the title "Extraterrential Human Beings in our Universe" rather than the more typical "ExtraTerrestrial Human BeINGS in our Solar System."   - Michael J.

Write a positive review about a good book:    When I started reading this book I was so scared and nervous about reading a novel by a new author, and so very excited to get to read a story that was a part of my childhood. I don't know if I would have been able to pick up this novel if I hadn't read a few other books in the series. The story itself was very exciting, and I had to make sure to catch the end of the book for the final cliff hanger for the finale. Overall, a very good novel that I will definitely pick up again, to keep my kids entertained for awhile. I also loved the way the author described the characters, especially that one in the middle with the big eyes and big lips. I hope he continues to write, and not just write for himself.   This was a very entertaining novel to read, and a great way to bring back memories for my old friends. My favorite character was actually that one with the blue eyes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I absolutely love this book! If you love a little boy, or just love reading, you'll love this.    There are some things in this book I can appreciate, but if you think you could be a little girl and do the same, then you'll enjoy this book.  I am not an expert in this field (or child development) and the fact that I'm trying to explain how this book was written and how a little book like this can be an awesome learning tool for a child is not necessarily the most convincing.  In my opinion, this book, as the title says, is about a little pink bear.  This bears' mother does everything she can to give her son a chance at life.  She has him grow up in a world of wonders and does everything in her power to make him happy.  The problem is that every time a little thing doesn't go according to plan, or is not as expected, this little bear gets a little hurt.  Because of this, the little boy's sense of self is challenged.  While he tries to work things out with his mother, there are times when he feels out of place.  At first, it seems as if the world is against him.  Sometimes, when a new girl comes to town, he feels a little embarrassed.  Other times, he doesn't get along with his friends in the school.  But all of this is minor compared to the real issue, which is: "Why does it hurt when I do this?"  That's the main topic of the book. The author explains that while some things hurt when they happen to a little kid, some things don't hurt at all.  And she does a nice job of describing her experiences and thoughts of when things happen to little boys in a positive way.  Once she starts explaining the concept of a boy and a girl and how they learn how to accept that difference, the tone of the story changes.  After that point, it doesn't take much to read the book and come away feeling that the author understood her point of view, and gave a child's perspective a voice of its own.  A simple book that has a big heart, and a little bit of magic.  Recommended!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I highly recommend the book. In a nutshell, the story revolves around a mysterious girl who claims to be able to "make" a person go out and make a life for himself. The girl then sets off on a long and dangerous journey to find that man to finally become her new person. She spends most of her time in the woods and on the road, but it's easy to see how she could easily have a successful career.     I would say the writing is about as good as I've ever seen, and it shows through the pictures and descriptions of the characters.    The dialogue is quite good, too, and the humor is not bad either.  It has a really nice ending and I was very much enjoying the journey.  This story may be a little too strange for the kids, but I think it could be a great read for adult readers.  4) The Road (By: Mary Roach)    My review:

"I've only reviewed the audiobook and had a couple of other books read by myself. The narrator is an excellent choice. His voice is just right for an old time radio announcer."
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best thing about this book is that you can have so much fun with it.   There are so many details in the way it was written and how each page is constructed that it will keep you interested and reading.  There was also a good amount of humor mixed in. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good read.  I will be purchasing the other three books that are currently out!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have to say that this book was good. It was a good read for a newbie to the history of Japan. The only thing I wasn't totally satisfied with was the lack of a good description of the samurai and how they worked. It would be interesting to read about them in a book about the samurai but I am not sure if they were actually a part of the culture and history of the time.   Summary:  I really enjoyed reading this book. It's not necessarily a history book, more of a historical work, but it is interesting to see how the Japanese civilization developed over the centuries.

If there is a silver lining in all this, it is the fact that in the end, the story can be appreciated for what it is. This is an inspiring book."

Write a positive review about a good book:      "A fantastic collection of essays. The collection is an anthology, so each essay is a stand alone tale but a very well told one that should be listened to and read.  I had heard great things about the book, and this is a great example of what good fiction can be."
Write a positive review about a good book:    My friend lent me "The House in the Road" by Daphne du Maurier, and I'm a huge fan of Daphni's work. "The Haunting" is a short story and it is very interesting to read a story in which the narrator is not at all sure what to think, nor how to describe the horrors she has witnessed. The book is about a murder, and the narrator knows that she might have seen it, but that's all she can remember. It's a good short story, and a good companion for the book "The Vengeful Night".

Write a positive review about a good book:    Great book. I enjoyed the characters and their interaction. The story was exciting and the ending was just perfect.  4 stars is a fair rating to a good story.   This was a well written book, with a great plot, well-developed characters and a good end. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A book is about the process of understanding. We are the products of our experiences. In order to understand, it helps to have some understanding. When you understand something, you start to understand how something else can be like it. In this particular book, a lot of the information is explained clearly. This helps the reader to learn much more about the subject than is possible through an academic paper. It also helped me to see the differences between different breeds (and what makes one so much like another), even though the breed is so different it is often difficult to place in the same category. This is a very good book for the dog owner who is not a veterinarian, who does not understand why some of their dogs have certain health issues, or is looking for a quick way to explain things to their veterinarian.  I have had this for some months and have been really enjoying it, it is a great primer on the subject of dog health. The fact that it is written by a veterinarian is amazing. It's written in such a way that it can be a complete beginner's book. The author does cover every possible aspect of health that could occur with the dog and has given all the information in the most easy-to-understand way. If you're looking for some information, this is the book to go with. The only problem I had with the book is the illustrations, at the end of the book the owner has to download the images and they do not do much for the look of the pages. I really wish that the author had done a better job of creating the illustrations. I found some of the illustrations a little difficult to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an interesting novel about the death of one of the greatest people in world history.   A lot of the history, particularly the aftermath, is boring, but the characters and world building are well done.   This review is from:   The Death of Ivan Ilyich Lenin (1919) by James Ellroy The Death is probably the greatest of Ellroy's works.  This book has an interesting cast of characters, including a former friend of the protagonist, a Russian military officer, and a spy in America.  I have always been a fan of Elloy's writing and this novel is no different.  A large portion of the book is spent on the main character's investigation and interrogation of the mysterious assassin.  It is interesting to see Elloy at his best writing about characters that are difficult to find.  Although I do not believe this is his best work, it is still highly recommended. In a world of over fifty-three thousand nations and over thirty-three million individuals, the Soviet Union, the richest and most powerful nation in the world, had collapsed from lack of people to sustain a nation.  From the death, one man alone would inherit all that was left.  With his death came a need for an heir.  The most likely candidate was the great military genius of Russia, Ivan Ilych Ilyichovich Lenin.  However, Lenin had a number of enemies that would be too dangerous to accept the role of heir.   Lenin, his mother, his lover and his brother-in-law all tried to prevent Lenin from inheriting the power, and the opposition of the Russian army to the decision led to Lenin's murder.  He is the main protagonist of this novel and is at the center of this tale.   Ellroy is the master of world building, and this book is a rich and complex look at history. I did read the synopsis of this book, but since I am only halfway through this, I will not comment on it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a huge fan of the Marvel Universe and the Fantastic Four, and I've read the books since I was a kid. And I love the Avengers. But there were just some things about the book that bothered me and I don't like how it handled it in the last couple of issues. The new Avengers are a little more grounded in reality. They aren't so arrogant and dismissive of other people, they aren't just there to save the day, or to fight crime. They're more like, I'm here to help because I care about the people in my city, and that's enough of a reason for me to help them. That's a very important change. I know there will be some people that don't care about reality and will still enjoy this book, but I didn't like it. And now that we know about the Sentinels, and they seem to be working in secret, that really made me wonder if there are other ramifications. This comic is not a good comic, but there's hope!
Write a positive review about a good book:    (the book's title) by Thomas Sowell " is a well-written, cogent and well-researched, even though it sometimes does not quite answer the question why people with disabilities are so often denied equal access to opportunities. " By David M. Barrie " A great book that helps us understand our country. " by Andrew M. Smith " The book is a very valuable contribution to the history of ideas in disability studies, particularly the notion of "recovery." " by Gary A. Sorensen "   "By the time I reached Chapter 19, I felt that the book could have used some more footnotes.... But the book's strength is in its scholarship. "
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think the best part of this book is that it is written by a non-feminist.   I don't believe there is such a thing as a "non-feministe."   There are a few good feminists in there (e.g. Patricia Lockwood) but the most important thing that is learned from this book are the facts and statistics that are not found in the books that are supposedly feminist (i.e. the book isn't just about "women in the workforce").   This book is like a textbook for feminist thought but it is not the feminism that the feminists in the book claim.  This book is full of facts.  The best fact that they do not explain is how the gender pay gap actually got so large.  I am not sure how a feminist (a radical woman) can not know that the gender wage gap is an actual thing.  If you believe that you also believe that women get paid the same whether they are "working class" or whether they "have a good job" or not.  And the more that I read about the women who take on a full-time job, the more I realize that if you are a woman who does not take a full job, you will be paid a lot less than a woman taking on a part-time or even full-scale job.  There is an awful lot of statistics that don't add up.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a short, interesting novel about a girl who goes to a private school, but who never really feels like she belongs. The teacher is a nice woman, but she's a little strange. She has a way of pushing her students to work hard and then letting them fail and feel like they did nothing wrong. The student body is mostly middle-class and white, but there's a student from a working class background, a student with a disability, and a student who's asexual. The middle-school students are all in the middle of their teen years, and they try to relate to each other, trying to fit into their classmates' worlds, but they don't really have anyone in common. At first, they all feel like there's something wrong with them that they're not telling anyone about, but that gets resolved later on. This book doesn't really talk much about science, but it does have some good and funny conversations about science and religion that are fun to read about. I thought the author did a good job keeping her story from getting too long, and that she really tried to relate it to real life. Overall, I think I really liked this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    Hi! This is a very informative article. Thanks for sharing your knowledge. We have a 7 year old who has not been able to learn to read and has been unable to find any suitable books for him to read in the past. We just have purchased the "Read to Me" book and it's a wonderful start to the book. His immediate reaction is, "WOW! This book is so cool." I have been using this book for a while and it has a very simple lesson but with the amount of time the parents spent with him, it worked and was very exciting. He has never asked to read before and this is one of the first things that he has been able too do. His family is really excited and looking forward to the next lesson. Thanks again for sharing this information. Hi everyone, Thank you so much for doing this. I just received my book, "I am a Reading Teacher: How to Build Successful School Librarianship", from my local library. I have used it and enjoyed it immensely. The book has a beautiful story line, but I was really taken by the content of the book and what is covered. It is really good to have some advice on the basics and how you can help your children become a great reader. My only comment would be that I don't see much "literacy" in the book, but that is just a personal preference. I'm really happy with how the book turned out and it feels like my library is making the difference in the lives of my children. If I can share my experience with the world, that would be very valuable. Thanks! Amy Hi, Thanks for this great resource! My kids have been reading this book and have been making a lot of mistakes while reading. One of the books I have given to my kids is "Read-aloud" and they love that book. So if you are looking for something that would also get them started, check this book out. I have two boys and I have read this book to them many times. I think its great and the book was really interesting and easy to read. The story line is very relatable and it is a great introduction to literacy. I like that it has good stories too. My kids loved it when we went over the basic facts that you should know when starting. I will be keeping this on my shelf for the future, and I look forward to seeing what books my boys get on their
Write a positive review about a good book:    Thank you, R.S. Stine  . The first two books of the Goosebumps series were the first books to feature the characters of Derry, Maine as they were presented in the novels by R. L. Stryker.   R.L. Stylieber's writing, although not perfect, is excellent. The second book, A Very Stinky Christmas, is also excellent, but not quite as well known.   A Very Dandy, though less well known, is a sequel to A Very Goosebumper, and is a great book, as well. The other Goosebumbs books are good, but a bit overstuffed.  R S Stine is the author of many other books as well, such as the Haunted House Series and The Mummies of Oz. I have read his work on and off since the days of the Disney animated movies, but only recently have I read any of his books and have been reading them again and again.  A Stinky Book About a Mouse:  A   Here is the back cover:  The title, A Stinky Story About a Mice, is a joke. I really thought it was something to do with the mice, but then I started reading. It's pretty good, and funny, but the jokes are all really lame and not at all memorable.  The plot of this book is basically the same as the first two: Mice, mice, mice...and mice, mouses, mouses....and so on. And it has its charms: Mouses smell bad. Mice make bad decisions. Mouses are greedy. Mouses are dumb. And I love it.  And it does have a couple of surprises: the mice are more or less good, except for those who are actually bad.  However, the other characters are all as generic as they come.  I guess the whole point of the book is that the mice have to try to get along, since they have been kicked out of their own homes, their friends have died, and the only homes they've known are scary, dirty, dark places.  It would have been interesting to see more of the mice's lives before and after they moved to the woods.  As for the humor, I thought this was good, although it doesn't have a whole lot going for it. A lot of the jokes were so lame I couldn't help but

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very skeptical of this book when I started it. I had no idea how good it was, or that I would love it so much! I started this book with a friend who didn't understand anything about science and didn't like science fiction. After reading the first few pages she got it! She had no problem following along and explaining what was going on! I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story, doesn't care about the technicality, and doesn't mind that there isn't a lot of action. I really enjoyed this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    Review:  I loved this book, and I loved it a lot. I don't know who was the author, but I believe it was a young author from the late 1940s-early '50s. That's what I thought, anyway. In any event, I don`t know when the book was written, but this book was one of the first to explore, in a way that is not totally original, some aspects of what we think about romance in the modern world. The author talks about the problems of the modern, "man's woman" situation and he doesn`t go down the "girl goes to the country" route so much as he explores other problems of "man and woman" relationship and he goes for a long time about these. I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was interesting and I enjoyed the author`s approach. If you like this sort of thing, go out and buy this book today.  (review of free book)  Review:  Hi, my name is John, and in 1977, when I was a student at the University of Wisconsin, I read the classic book of romance, Mrs. Dalloway. The book was so powerful that it almost changed my life and I wish I could give you a few quotes and let you know how much I loved reading this book and still do to this day. I highly recommend this book to everyone. So you can see, I'm a bit of a romance fan, a huge fan. I love this book!  (view spoiler) For all the reviews that I read about this book I was so saddened to read that I hadn't discovered it until after my graduation from college. This book, it didn't take me long to start re-reading it after my senior year and I have been hooked ever since. This is an absolute must read!   My boyfriend and I had been reading a lot of Stephenie Meyer books that we had discovered while we were in high school, and the more we read the more our love for these books grew and grew. At the end of our freshman year we decided to try out all of her books on our new (and free, so we thought) Kindle. I read Mrs. Adams the first time we opened up the new Kindle, and immediately fell in love with it! I read it in one sitting and finished it before I could even think about lunch! So I went right back and read it again.

Write a positive review about a good book:    What's the biggest takeaway from your experience with writing a review for a book?   I'm not sure if it is a "takeaway" or not but this was a real eye opener to me. I don't know why I didn't have a thought about it before.   The last time I read a book was probably about 10-15 years ago. I've never tried to read one.  I'm glad I'm reading the reviews of other people's books now that I realize how good they can be.  It might be a good idea to actually read the reviews.  If you have a good review to send me, leave it in the comments.  I will try to get you the review. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very happy that I got to read this book. I enjoyed it, but it was not perfect. I thought that the author needed to do a better job in explaining what exactly the hell he was getting at. I also found that the ending felt a bit abrupt, not enough time was spent on explaining it properly. It is possible that the end will make up for this, but I don't see it. For those who are in the mood for an odd tale with a great idea, you will certainly enjoy this. I hope that we get more from the author. Thanks for the review.
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's a very good book! It's a really good story. It's hard to read, but you really have to be paying attention to the details of the story (it's just a collection of small stories) to appreciate this book. It'll be interesting to see if the movie version will match up to the book, because I think it could be better than the book. But it's definitely worth a read.   I love this book and it's one of my favourite books of the year.
Write a positive review about a good book:    1.)  What makes a book great:  I'll go out on a limb and say a book is great if you like the author, you enjoy the story, you're looking for a good read and you can't put the book down.   2.)     What makes a good story:  I'm not a big fan of genre fiction. I want to see the world and characters, not just a neat plot.  3.)    Why you read it:  What makes this book stand out?   I've read a few good stories and a couple of books that made me laugh out loud.   However, these stories weren't enough to get me into a new book. I'm glad that this book is one of the best books I have read since the first book in the Chronicles of Narnia series.  I hope to read more books from this author and hope to see more of her work. 
Write a positive review about a good book:        (the first sentence of the review is so much better)   "A great book for the beginner in linguistics, but for the more experienced speaker there is also some really interesting material to absorb. The book is written in the first person, so it feels more like the story of a linguist. "   It is about a linguistics professor's attempt to decipher what is written on a piece of paper that contains a very mysterious language.   He has to translate the written language and then translate it back into the unknown language. The result is a book that contains interesting information, but not really much that is new.  (review of free book) Review: The Mystery of the Fungi by Richard Dawkins (reviewed by David G. Smith) The Mystery of The Fungus is a nice little introduction to the field of genetics, especially for people who are interested in evolution and the origins of life, but who are perhaps not entirely familiar with the discipline. Dawkins starts the book out by summarizing the basic tenets of evolutionary theory, and then lays out the basics of genetic inheritance, which is probably the easiest part to digest. After that he covers the genetics of sexual reproduction, the genetics and molecular biology of the parasitic mycobiont, and the genes and the genealogy of all species. Then he covers taxonomy, which again is perhaps the easiest thing to digest in this book. After going through the basics, Dawkins moves on to the interesting side of the genetics, which involves "the mystery of the fungus". In this, Dawkins is talking about fungal DNA and the various fungal species that exist on the earth, which are not yet all known. He gives us a brief discussion of fungi in the animal kingdom before moving to the mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and birds. As one would expect, the book takes a very interesting and informative look at all of these species, and Dawkins does a good job of covering the major features of each species in his explanations. It also includes a section that is largely focused on genetics and its relevance to evolution, and I think it is the best portion of the book in that regard. At the very end, Dawkins provides some really great advice for the budding geneticist (at least he makes a good effort to try and address that audience!). The book comes highly recommended from me.

Write a positive review about a good book:   . I will say that this is not a "how to be a woman" book. It is a book of essays about being a woman and the different ways we do it, which are also very different from each other. It does not pretend to provide a manual for being a good woman in the world. However, it is definitely a very useful book in the area of understanding the difference between women and men and how we understand the world around us. There is a lot to be learned from this book, as far as understanding the world of men and women is concerned.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a shame that this book was never finished by a competent editor. A couple of major things happened that I found very confusing. First, after the initial reading, I read the beginning of the book, and I didn't like it as much. The whole thing was rather slow. Second, the ending. It was just a bit sad. It would be great if this book had a sequel. It is hard for me to recommend this book because it just doesn't do it for me. Maybe you're just not going to like this book and you won't find it that interesting. But for me, it was a little confusing and hard to follow. The author seems very knowledgeable about the Bible, and he has his own opinions, so I thought that there would be some interesting insights. I would recommend this to some people, but it is just not my cup of tea.
Write a positive review about a good book:    * The Good Earth by Michael Pollan.  * Why We Love Dogs by Kate Fagan.   It is a new book by Kate and Michael Pollen that was just released in April 2015.   The book focuses on "Why Dogs Have Their Own Way of Thinking" and how this evolved over thousands of years.  I would highly recommend it to people who enjoy dog behavior books.   How can I change my dog's behavior? You need to go to a qualified dog trainer and be very clear that you want a change in your dog's behavioral style. It might sound simple, but most dogs, even "very calm" dogs, can be highly aggressive if you give them a reason to be. A lot of dog behavior issues can be solved by taking a good long look at your dog. Have you ever seen your dog getting into fights at the kennel with other dogs? I did this once myself. She has been known to start a fight with a dog that she is familiar with, and just because she likes to play fight with other animals. That is what you need to be looking for. This is a pretty simple problem and most times is easily fixed.    What's that?   There are some things that can make dogs more dog-friendly, but there is no one-size-fits-all solution.  A good behavior consultant can advise on a number of issues, but sometimes, an owner needs a bit more. I've come across people that think a dog should only bark once, or can only bark from the back. These are all wrong ideas and you need more than that to keep your dog in line. There is no magic solution, you'll need to learn through trial and error, but some tips: -  The best thing to do is start with small steps. Don't get frustrated if your dog is having trouble at first.  - If your dog does not respond when given any type of stimulus, do not give up. If he is not getting his cues, then you are probably not training the dog in the right way.  The good thing about training is that the better the person doing it, the more successful they will be. You may just have to start over a few times until you see change. - If you are using punishment, then it can work well, but it is only a temporary fix. It's a good idea to not only be fair but also be gentle in

Write a positive review about a good book:    Reviewers are encouraged to write a review about every book that they review, but it is very rare that any reviewer will provide a full review.   It's hard to imagine why a reader would want a full reviews if she knows a book is good, so we usually just get a review of the main point of the book or something we thought we'd liked more.  The main reason reviewers write reviews is to make themselves feel good about their own reviews, but reviewers should try to be truthful about their book's flaws.  Sometimes a reviewer will do a bad job of explaining why the book is a bad book.  We would all like to see our review go viral.  Unfortunately for this book it is not going viral. It is going unnoticed.  I know the book was reviewed well by people who didn't like the book, and there are a lot of people who like it that were probably on the fence about buying this book, but I can't help but feel that this book was written by a person with little understanding of the publishing industry or of how hard it is to sell a book these days.  For a book that is this bad, it has no one to blame but itself.  If it were a book I'd be really excited to read, I'd love the reviews that I got.  That said, I really enjoy this book and will continue to read it when I find a copy.

Write a positive review about a good book:    To my absolute delight, the latest in The Encyclopedia of Magic is a complete masterpiece that does for the subject what the first three volumes did for the topic: it covers the nuts and bolts of what the subject is and does for those who are willing to learn. From the very beginning, it gives a thorough account of how spells work in a wide range of spells, how they are made, and how they behave under the influence of a range of variables (such as temperature, humidity, and the state of mind of the caster). It also gives a description of the various ingredients that make up the various types of spell, and provides a wealth of examples and explanations about how the components and the effect of a spell are achieved.   The final section is devoted entirely to spells that are particularly difficult or exotic to understand, and I particularly liked the section on the Dark Rituals (especially the Dark Circle of Unholy Evil).   I highly recommend the Encyclopedia to both the expert student and the casual researcher interested in learning about magic.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an awesome book.  It made me laugh out loud.    I loved it!   It was not bad.  I was able to understand why this book was good.  This book made me realize that in my day to day life there are many more negative influences than good ones.  My parents were extremely negative and were constantly yelling at me.  Even when they were right, they were often negative and I just couldn't stand it.  When I think of bad parents I think "silly."     This book is about a "good" parent that makes a bad son "normal."  He doesn't yell at him but does teach him to listen to his mother.  The boy grows up to become a wonderful person! I love this book and I am excited for more books in this series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a first read (or review) of the series, I'll give this book 5 stars:     With the success of the trilogy, it was inevitable that a fourth book would follow. It wasn't surprising to hear that this would be a stand-alone tale. The novel is a great success, setting up the world and the characters well. The story itself was quite good and I enjoyed it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    -   This is a wonderful book about how to make an old house a little friendlier. It explains how to repurpose and improve the existing house and makes use of many new technologies, from modern insulation and heating to a roof built into a concrete wall, all at a fraction of the price. I was skeptical about the idea of building a whole new house when there are several houses that cost nearly as much as a good used house and many more benefits, but this book makes it work! It is one of my favorite books on modern housekeeping. If you have a large basement and a small house you are looking for, this book is for you! It also includes a list of materials to add to your existing house. Highly Recommended. (review on a future occasion) (also recommended on Amazon)  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Awesome I have been on a home remodel for almost 10 years and needed to replace the old house with a new one. I did not want to move out and have to buy a whole lot of house and a lot of work. I have heard from a lot and read a lot about this but did not know where to start. After reading through this book it got me excited to get started. It is short but very detailed. So thank you to the owner and the owner's wife for putting together a wonderful product. It worked like a charm. I will recommend this book to anyone looking to get rid of their old house and it will be a great reference. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)  5 out of 4 by Kym from Very comprehensive! This is very informative and helpful. It covers the steps needed to convert the basement to use as a second master bedroom, storage space, and a workshop. It discusses the process of insulating and heating the house. The building and installing of the new concrete walls was very straightforward. The instructions are clear and the photos very helpful. The basement is so large you need a lot to do it yourself. It will definitely be my go-to for building a second or third bedroom or just an extra room for storing things that will need to be in a different space.  4 out of 3 by luis from good book a bit dry I thought it was more comprehensive but a bit of a dry book with very few photos. It does have a little bit of history of the house and the author explains why a lot more went into
Write a positive review about a good book:     If I'm not careful, I'm going to die from an overdose of the same exact drugs she tried in her experiment.   In short, she was addicted to painkillers, and her husband is dying from a heart attack, and now she has been admitted to the hospital because of her dependence.  I would have liked to have seen her write about that, but I understand that it was so personal and such an easy way to deal with the problems she had.  There is so much about this story that is hard to accept that you were so blinded by the pain and the addiction that you couldn't see how bad it was getting to you.  I don't know about the rest of the country, but in my small town I had to live next to this drug pusher, and in fact, I could tell that he was using drugs and selling them to people he'd met on the street.  He was a good drug dealer, but like so many of my friends, he wanted too much. He just wanted more and more and the more and he lost the ability to do the right thing. I could see the desperation.

Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite part about this book is that the author was open to the criticisms, and has since changed his approach to the genre, and this book was one of the things that pushed him towards that. It's not the type of book where the author tells you exactly what you want to hear, but more a type of author who listens to you and helps you become your own editor. It didn't change his own style of writing, it just gave him a better approach, and the reader is rewarded with a better read.  The story is a bit repetitive, but I didn't mind because it is always fun to follow this author's journey, and he is also very good at writing a good narrative that flows well. I also loved the ending.
Write a positive review about a good book:        This is a good read for anyone that is interested in reading history or military history. The book covers a range of topics, including the role of women in World War II, the development of US air power, the influence of the air-lift during the war in Europe, and other topics. There is a lot of history here to enjoy.   The first thing that came to mind when I read this was the time when the Airborne forces landed in Belgium.  This book is great because it includes a lot on the role that women had in the Airforce during WWII. The authors are very detailed with the history, and their ability to do so in a way that is accessible and interesting. It's definitely something to be on the lookout for! 
Write a positive review about a good book:   In this book, the author examines the nature of the "black" (and brown) culture in the West, and particularly the U.S., in a number of key areas, including race relations, education, and politics, to argue that the African American experience in the U-S. is not just a matter of "colorblindness," but in fact represents a form of exceptionalism, or a "unique African American" position vis-à-vis the rest of the world. Although the book is divided into six chapters, a brief overview is enough to give the gist of the arguments. The first chapter, which covers the history of black Americans in the United States, is largely a history of American social and political attitudes toward race. The author focuses on how and why whites and blacks have always had a "double consciousness" about race, emphasizing the ways in which they have been encouraged to "double down" on whiteness (which is seen as the norm for "normal" people) but not to see themselves as members of a race at all.  Although he does not dwell on racism in the present day, the overall message is clear: that black Americans are constantly fighting against a negative perception of their community (and blackness), but never quite succeeding.  The second chapter, "Black Politics and Black Culture in the Nineteenth Century," focuses on politics and racial attitudes in the 1870s and 1880s.  As the author notes, this is a relatively early period, but it does show us that racism in U. S. society was still in place, and was not as invisible as it would later be.  The author argues that, despite the progress made by blacks in the past century, it is still a problem in the contemporary world, and argues that many white Americans have a "dual consciousness" of race.   The final chapter, "'It's Not Just a Party Line', deals with issues of culture and social interaction, as well as politics and politics of race in the modern day.  According to the author, "The struggle over cultural hegemony, the rise of a black middle class, and the changing nature of racial politics all underscore how the concept of a universal Negro culture has been reified in the racial order. "  The book also contains a series of historical essays, and I recommend it highly. For many of the other books on my bookshelf, I've mostly read them recently. But I
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you were a young woman around the 1950's then you were at least aware of what was going on in the world of women's liberation.   You may have been inspired to participate in a political movement and join in your local feminist club but that did not necessarily mean that you were going to become the next Betty Friedan or Gloria Steinem.  Women's rights activists of the period were not as successful in organizing or making the impact they should have been in the struggle for women's equality.  There were women's rights groups and organizations and some women like Betty Frieden were very successful in the movement but the problem was not so much the organization or the ideology of the organization but the fact that they were not organized in the same way that the men's movement had been.  I think that the women's movement as an organizing tactic was very limited and focused on very specific issues which was fine but they were also not very successful as a political force.  In an age when the men of America were going through a war that they could see to their own personal benefit, there was no pressure put on them to think about other people's issues.  To have the men in the men movement look at their female counterparts as a movement and to see a parallel movement between men and women was not something that they saw as being necessary.  It was the same thing with the women in the civil rights movement.  In the case of the women of the civil right's movement they saw themselves as a group of people who wanted to get equal rights and to do that they needed a group to act as a catalyst and the black leaders of the era were not able to handle that role.  Even after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 all those black leaders were still unwilling to let other people get behind them and do anything for them in a coordinated way which allowed the Southern Strategy to take hold.  And of course, there were a lot of reasons why white male politicians became reluctant to take a stand against segregation.  They saw it as a matter of self preservation.  We know that today and it is even more true for the women.  Many of the Southern Democratic women in that period did not get behind the movement to desegregate the South because they also did not want to lose their own political careers.    That does not mean that they did not believe in what they were fighting for or that they are the ones that we should hold
Write a positive review about a good book:   I didn't expect the last half of the book to be as good as the first half, but when it is, it really is one of the best things I've read. The final section of the novel (and the last chapter of the first book) is excellent, but I found the first part of the story to be slightly repetitive, with the "bad guy" constantly getting the upper hand, only to have the protagonist rise above them all. Overall though, I found this a good read. (hide spoiler)  [Lillian, the wife of a former government official who is now a schoolteacher, is having a hard time with her son, Robert, an academic major at his university who is having serious trouble adjusting to college life and the life around him, not to mention his academic problems. The situation is worsened when Robert is called away to his home university in San Diego for a family emergency and Lillian goes into labor. It's hard enough to keep Robert busy with the work load of a college student, and Lillie has the hard task of caring for him, and trying to keep him afloat in a college environment that's not really supportive of the life he was brought up in. But all of that seems to be overshadowed by Robert's growing friendship with a young woman in a wheelchair who lives in the house next door, and Robert's increasingly difficult efforts to help her cope with the fact that she is losing her ability to walk. There are also other factors to be considered: Robert has had many troubles with his dad and has a lot of issues with authority. The novel is filled with strong character development as Lillian tries to deal with her life in the context of her husband's problems, and there are moments of reflection that are also reflective of some of the difficulties Robert is having in school. There's also an issue of violence and sexuality in the novel. Although it might be considered a thriller, I don't think it was as gripping as the book's first half; there are too many things happening at once, and the suspense is too short. It also suffers from some minor spelling and grammar problems. Overall, I think that it's a good novel, but only after you read the first portion, which is a great read. For those who have read the other two books in the series, and who are already fans, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book. (view spoiler)

Buy this book: "In his work, the artist, the poet, the musician, the philosopher, the engineer, the mathematician, the inventor, and the scientist all have something in common: they are the products of a particular type of creative work, or process, which has become its own discipline. The subject matter of the artist's process is the artist: his personality, his mood, his aesthetic and ethical convictions, his social situation, his relationships with family and friends. The process itself is the work of the author. The work is the idea, which is to be read as a work in its own right, as a piece of art, an expression of art."   -Michael Ondaatje,  "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction", p. 18

It's a must have for anyone that wants to learn more about the Middle Ages and is looking for a fun read that won't bore you. I'm very impressed.  "The Golden Age: A New History of England in the Middle Age, 1100-1400" was written by an Oxford University professor, Brian Wilson, and is published by The Oxford University Press. It's a well-done and well researched work, and a must read for anyone with an interest in England and her past.
Write a positive review about a good book:    We were at a book exchange event where the host was kind enough to provide free food.   We went there for the first time on a Saturday, as my husband is a foodie. I had an incredible experience.  The location was close to me, and the food was awesome! My husband and I split a grilled cheese sandwich and a hot chocolate sandwich, but had a hard time finishing them both, because I was trying to not eat more than one.  Our host was lovely and made us feel very welcomed.  We had so much fun. The food was delicious and not too expensive.  A must visit book store for the history and cultural information enthusiasts:     The name says it all. It is the bookstore where all books on the history of America, from the colonial era to the present, are gathered in one place. There are many books on a variety of topics from the early colonists to present-day issues, the latest books in their respective fields are kept behind a glass case, for those who prefer to read on the go.  This store is a must-go for any book lover!
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's interesting and has some ideas on how to deal with your own emotions in this kind of situation and there's the occasional fun bit that gets you excited.   I did like the idea of the main character not being very good at talking to others. It's a bit too early in the book for them to make a move in the romance department.
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I began this book, I didn't care much about the world. But the book has a very strong message and some very interesting people, and a compelling plot. The magic of the story really made me love this world. The world is quite dark, and the magic of it is powerful but mysterious. As a whole, this is a well written book, and you will probably come away from it with some appreciation of the world and magic.
Write a positive review about a good book:   1.2 Stars -   I was pretty nervous about starting this book when I ordered it. The synopsis said that this book was a sequel to the book that I read (The Shadow of the Torturer's Blade) and that it told the story of a group of vampire hunters and some of their adventures from a different perspective (although this time, they are hunting the undead as well).    At the time, I didn't have high expectations for this book because I think I remember reading the book in which the vampires in the previous book all died (well, I think the two that didn't die, were killed by the protagonist), and this book would essentially be the continuation of the story I read, from a new perspective.   To my surprise, the book is actually quite a good read.  Unlike The Shadow of a Torturer blade, this book is not set in the same world and doesn't have the same characters.  A few major things were different in this book from the previous one.  This book has vampires in it, the first time they were in a book for the whole series (I've never read any books about them in the series or from other authors).  This time, the vampires (well the real ones, not the ones in the books) have more powers and abilities and are much more powerful.  I think that they are a lot more realistic and have a lot less of the dark and scary atmosphere that the vampires had in the past (even though that may have been because of the fact that the world is no longer the same one that I lived in and the vampires are in a new world).  I liked that they were not as cold and calculating as the vampires of The Shadow, I like that they do have emotions and that they're not all the same. They were able to talk to each other, even though the main characters were in different cities and had different goals.  Overall, it was a good change of pace. I would like to read more of their stories, but I will probably start reading other books in the Dresden Files series (which is also in a different world, which is why it takes place in a world that is very different from the one in the original series). 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "This is a wonderfully written book about the evolution of language. Highly recommended for those who want to learn a bit more about how humans became human. "  I think this is an excellent book.

This is an interesting and useful book. - Michael G. " This book will be of value to students of linguistics as well as to the general public who are interested in a broad view of language evolution. " - Paul P. Ehrlich " I enjoy this book and believe it is of value in understanding the history of the evolution and organization of language.... [It] shows how language works, and it describes the evolution in detail, showing that the history is rather complicated.... The author draws the reader into a rich and complex history, and he describes how language has come to be the fundamental means of communication among human groups. I would like to see more such books of this kind, more broad-scale historical studies of the way that languages evolve, as this one is...." - Stephen W. Bright, University of Kentucky
Write a positive review about a good book:    "In the past few years we have discovered that in the world of publishing it is all about profit. We have learned that we should always be looking for profit but we also learned that even when we are looking for a profit we should not lose sight of the fact that the people we serve are not only the ones who read our books but also the ones that will be the customers.   The people who are going to be the customer are going through a very difficult time right now. It can be a very hard time.   This is because the public has been led to believe that our country is run by an elitist cabal of wealthy people who know nothing about the lives of average citizens. This is not the truth but as time goes on this reality will continue to be perpetuated. The people have been lied to for years and they have had enough.  Our book is a way of helping the public make the connection between all this and a book that really helps them understand what has been going on in our country for quite some time. The book is just a small part of this process but we feel it is something that is necessary.  The truth is out there and the people will not accept it in any form if the corporate owned media does not start to put it out there.  We hope that the corporate media will see that there is a need for this book and will begin to cover this aspect of the war on our country.  If not then the people are in for a real tough time. I am hoping that the folks over at Time Magazine will give it the publicity that is needed."

Write a positive review about a good book:      I have read and loved the book about a young girl named "Cynthia Bose" who has two fathers and two mothers.   It is very sad and hard reading about how she was born into two families and is going to have to live with each one.  It also explains some of the things that led to her separation and how she got back together.  This book was very informative, I loved it.  (A couple of minor things I disliked were the names for her parents,  and the fact that one of the fathers, who is a doctor, never gives any kind of info about his wife but the mother is constantly calling Cynthia's name.  And lastly she got her hair cut at the doctor's office by a hair stylist who is the husband's girlfriend and he doesn't know that.  But in the end, it is still very important to know what is going on in their family.  The most important things I learned is that a lot of different types of families exist and many different things happen in a family. I enjoyed it.

The author of " The Boy Who Walked By The Moon " also wrote the best book ever about a very similar story:  https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1...

Write a positive review about a good book:    If you enjoy fantasy and are looking for a solid and fun fantasy novel I would highly recommend you give this book a read!   I have always liked the idea of a world where magic is a real and present threat, and I am glad that the book does not let that stand in the way of the adventure. This novel does not focus too heavily on the magic but rather on the struggles of the characters as they work to overcome the challenges that come their way. It is definitely worth the read, but I'd have liked a bit more of a plot, or better yet a sequel or two.  -Cara  The Firstborn of Erebor  by K.J. Parker  I was thrilled when I read that K. J. Parker, author of several fantasy novels, was working on a sequel to his most well known book The Firstborn Of Erebar. The First Born Of Eremore is a great fantasy novel, but it also has some problems.   The first problem, as I've said, is the pacing. I liked that this book does have a lot going on, so it took a few chapters to get everything going. I also liked the length. In a novel that is about five hundred pages it's an adequate length. However, the second problem is the plot. I love the characters and I'm excited to learn more about them, but even so I was left feeling a little unfulfilled by the end of this book. The characters, even though I do believe they are well designed, were so one-dimensional that they came across as cardboard cutouts. The world of Eremoth, which is what Parker uses as the setting for The FirstBorn Of Erendis, is a beautiful, beautiful place. The cities are well detailed, the terrain is lush and the weather can be so beautiful and perfect at times, yet I didn't feel any attachment to the world itself. It was all about the characters in this book and that is a problem I have with a lot of fantasy novels. If you can't connect with the characters they don't have the depth to carry a book.   the Firstborn I'm glad to say I didn-t feel that way. I really enjoyed reading this book, but also had some problems with it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The world is filled with books that could use a little love. From the best books on art and poetry to classics on history, politics, and the like, there are some books that should be read and others that should not be. One such book is my current favorite: The Life and Times of Captain Jack Sparrow. (Not to mention I love the songs, too.)  "I am one of the best sailors in the Caribbean, and I am about to become one of your most wanted!"  This book opens with Captain Jack setting sail for his new adventure – as we learn from his journal, his goal is to find the Fountain of Youth – a fountain with the power to restore his youth.  Jack Sparrow first begins as a young boy who lives in the slums of the city, fighting a war against the local gangs. The war ends when his parents are killed by the local gangster, and Jack finds himself on a ship headed to the Caribbean. The story follows Jack as he makes his way through the Caribbean trying to survive. As we see, his ship is not without its own challenges, from sea sickness to being hunted by pirates. Through his journal we learn a little more about Jack himself, his past, and his goals for the future.  The ship does end up being full of pirates, but as Jack says, "If I'm going to have a bad day, I might as well do it on a pirate ship." It's a fun, fast-paced book, and it shows that Captain Jack was not just some "funny" pirate! (I'm not going to get into the "bad day" joke. That's just what pirates do.)  (Also, while this book does get a bit heavy in places, I don't know that it's always necessary. It is definitely a good read! And in a few places, it really pulls you along. For example, one of my favorite parts of the book is when Jack's captain, Fletcher Christian, is taken out of commission. After the ship's crew discovers the reason, Jack is left with no choice but to put a bounty on Christian's head.)  to be continued  (Disclaimer: I do have to give credit to the creators of "Jack Sparrow." That being said, while I do enjoy the books, I do NOT OWN any of them!)  Thanks for reading!  Mia
Write a positive review about a good book:    - I like it. - A good read. -   I think this is a good one. I would recommend it to all. 4 stars is my rating. My review:  I just finished The Good Lord Bird   This was one of the first books I ever read about a bird.   It is a great story about a boy who was taken to an amusement park and then was picked up and thrown on the side of a cliff.  His friend and mother are taking him to the end of the coaster when he falls and then they have to go back to the place they took him to.  Then the next day they take him to another amusement park so he can see the roller coaster.  What I love most about this book is that the narrator tells the story.  He tells the reader what the narrator has seen and heard.  This is so different from all the bird books I read when I was younger.  I thought the narrator was very good.    Also I liked that he mentioned that his friend was always talking about the birds he had seen.   He tells it how he saw it.  A good thing to know about birds, their wings are for flying.  If I were to ask what was really on the page the answer would be:

Write a positive review about a good book:    So, I was excited to pick up the book by the same author, only to find that it's a total disappointment. I got into this one because I thought it was a nice read and thought the prose was decent. And when I read it, it felt that way! The story had an interesting premise and a well-developed story. I think there was a lot of promise there, but it was ruined by a horrible plot. The story was about two men (who were the antagonists in the story) who were on opposite sides of a huge war. And one day, a man that was on the same side died in an accident. The man's family was left devastated and the man went into the war to get his revenge. The plot was really interesting. It had lots of twists and turns and the main character seemed to be getting better, even though he was a sociopath. And I did enjoy the characters (and the ending was a happy one), but the ending ruined the book for me. The ending was so terrible I almost felt cheated. There were so many things that went right in the plot: the death of the villain, the friendship and romance between the main characters, and the love between the characters. And then all of a sudden, it ended with the villain dying in the middle of a horrible war that he had started (and in which he was involved in a lot). I didn't mind the ending; it was very dramatic and dramatic I loved it. But the ending completely ruined the plot. It wasn't just a bad ending, but a horrible, awful, horrible ending. The book ended with so many twists and surprises I really lost all hope in the book. I don't know if I'm reading the book wrong because of the poor ending, or if the book is actually a bad book, but the way the ending turned out was so awful that I almost didn't want to finish it. So I gave the book 2 stars because the story was enjoyable and there were some good twists and the ending is pretty great. But overall, a horrible ending and the reason I gave it only 2 stars.

Write a positive review about a good book:        To start things off, I loved this book. It was a fantastic introduction to the world of Warhammer, with a lot of history to back it up, and a lot more detail than you're likely to find elsewhere. It even gave some background on the other Warhammer games. The background that was given in it was well worth it. The characters that make up the cast were great too, with just the right amount of personality, charisma and depth to make them feel like real people. Even the background about the other games was great, although it was a little hard to tell what they were actually about since the information given was almost entirely focused on Warhammer. I did think that some of the background was a bit rushed and out of place, however. One character in particular was given a lot to do and not much to do with his background. He had a huge amount of background about his past that was never explained and didn't make much sense. His backstory and motivations were very odd. A lot of that was because the author made it look like he had a lot going on, when really, he had nothing going on for the most part. I think he was forced to make it look that way, because the other races and their stories just weren't that interesting. The writing itself was decent, although there were a few issues here and there. It's an easy to read book, which I think is a good thing. I would have liked some more back story on some of my favorite characters, though, especially in the back half of the book. The plot itself was very good, and if you're a Warhammer fan and like to read a book about a Warhammer game, then you should probably buy this.
Write a positive review about a good book:    - 4 -   This book is a great introduction to the "deep ecology" movement that is gaining steam in environmental activism. It is an excellent discussion of how a sustainable society can be formed in a world that is becoming increasingly unsustainable. The book offers a compelling and thought-provoking story, which should encourage the reader to become more aware of the need to act boldly on the world around him. The best part of the book, though, is in how it helps the reader understand and explore the deep ecology philosophy, and to understand the many points of convergence between deep ecology and ecological politics and activism.  Fiction:  - 4 - The story is told through several narrators, including a former environmentalist turned deep ecologist. The story has an interesting premise, as the main character is forced to come to terms with his own inner conflicts while being pulled back in time to the days of the Earth Liberation Front in the 1960's.

Write a positive review about a good book:    Recommend to a friend:      Share it on Facebook:         Share on Pinterest:       What you are reading is a series of posts that describe a series that I wrote, called "The Blackest Moon." The book is about two young girls in a small town in Mississippi, who, when the parents aren't around, have to make it on their own and become strong enough to live independently. The first book is called "Lies", and the second book is "Lights" so this series is definitely a "best of" kind of book. I hope you like it! (The first two books are free and the last two are under 100 words, so I'd highly recommend them.) -Linda

Write a positive review about a good book:    The reason this book is a big hit at my house is that the author gets the history right, the details are correct and there is no nonsense in the presentation.   It's a very readable history of a region that has had it's share of ups and downs.  Some of the facts have been distorted to fit the history, however, and some of the information can be confusing.  1. The British took the Hausa population from the Songhai and then used them to fight the Mali Empire.  This is very similar to what has happened with the Somalis and their descendants, many of whom fought against the British.    The British didn't leave a great deal of the population behind.  To the contrary they gave them the education they needed to compete in the modern world. The Somali's were actually part of the British Empire until 1949.  The British brought in British engineers to work on military bases along the coast and there are a lot of people left over to this day. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It was interesting. I am not a big fan of the idea of being a soldier in war, and in this book it is kind of sad, but the book does a really good job of not showing us that all the soldiers are evil or anything like that. We learn a little bit about the war, but mostly it is a lot of stories of everyday life. I didn't like the beginning much, but then it gets better. The ending was so good I could not put it down.  "I didn' want to die, even though I knew I had to. It was one of the most selfish things I've ever done, and yet it was the only thing I knew for sure I could live with." It was good. The main characters are interesting, and I liked the author's writing style. I definitely recommend this book. It is just good.    "It's like being in love with a brother." - by Anonymous  
Write a positive review about a good book:    In the middle of a wonderful novel.   If you don't mind a bit of a hard read (but very well written) then I would recommend it, but don't look for me to review the sequel.  There are some great points in the beginning of the book, the descriptions are good, and you know it is going to be a good story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you like fantasy with a supernatural twist, The Dark Elf Trilogy is a must read!   A great story that is told in several different ways and has a unique and exciting plot that keeps you reading.   The Dark Elves are humans with a demonic bloodline and are not to be trifled with.  In addition to the different plots, the book was written in a unique way. The book was first published as a series of articles in New World Magazine. The Dark Elven is one of those stories that is not about the characters, but about the readers.  A fantastic fantasy novel that has a fantastic plot and is worth every penny.  Read a negative review about this book: I hated this book and wanted to get rid of it right away.  So I read the first few chapters and then started reading again after finishing the book.  I did read the negative reviews that are out there and I agree with them.  There are some characters that don't seem to have much to them. The main character doesn't even have a personality and I wasn't happy with her.  However I have to say that the books story is very good and is the most original and good thing I have read in a long time.  It is a good story and a great start to the series.  My only complaint is that it wasn't as easy as I would have liked.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book for someone looking to explore a subject that interests them. This is a very good resource to use if you wish to know more about it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book. I am a former criminal prosecutor and I am well aware of the psychological implications of my decisions when I get a new job. The book gives a clear picture of what was going through my mind as I was making the decision. The author covers what the psychology of this decision is, and it can be seen from the perspective of someone who has done this before. It makes it easy for you to understand why a decision you have made, that was so easily rationalized in your mind, did not work out as you thought it would.   " I am going to be on the job market in a few months and I don't know what to expect from the job application process. It is scary to be so far ahead of the game, to know that someone has already figured it out and I'll just have to be a lot more patient. I don the author's description of the process, and I have to agree with his assessment. I really want to learn what I am doing wrong, but as you can see in the excerpt, I am not doing well in the first phase. I had to re-read my cover letter 3 times to find that I didn't spell things right. I feel that all resumes should be re-written, but I have no idea how. And I'm a horrible writer. But I am determined to try my best at this."   I am going on a vacation in the spring and the book is very timely. I can see a lot of the details in this book from the past. If your looking for a good, well-written book to read before you begin the job search, this is the book for you.  2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:      "A fun and interesting read! I loved how this was very different from any other book I've read that deals with the supernatural. This book was very enjoyable and well done. It was very interesting to me that some of the characters from the book had different ages. I've always had a soft spot for the young and old as I tend to have them in my book. I think that the author's use of the ages was very well done." -Rachel   The cover:       I'm a bit on the fence about this book. The first three chapters were very interesting but there were some points that I felt were not explored enough. I am not saying they were bad but they were not interesting enough to get me interested in reading more. The fourth chapter however was more interesting. As soon as the plot picks up in the fifth chapter, the book becomes very fun. I had an extremely hard time staying interested in the plot as it kept changing. I'm very glad I picked this up because I've only read three books by Sarah Pinborough before this one.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had read this book when I was in college. It was a must-read for the subject of psychology. I was surprised by the writing, because I had not really thought of it before. The writing is clear, concise and effective. It also contains a fair amount of psychology that is not necessarily useful to an aspiring psychologist, such as how to evaluate and apply tests, how to use statistics, how it is important to avoid using the term "explanation" as a verb, how not to "justify" things, etc. But the most interesting thing for me was the discussion of how to learn. We are taught as children, that we learn best by doing. But how do we actually learn? The author shows us that it is not that simple. In fact, he shows how we must create habits that reinforce our learning, such that it becomes automatic. He shows that it can be done simply by taking some time to "self-regulate." He talks about the importance of maintaining a positive mindset and doing things that are fun, and of course he reminds us of our "need" for "energy," but then he shows us how you can utilize it for something beneficial. What I found so good about the book was that it was not a dry or boring read. There was enough information in there for the novice to know the basics, but also for those who were already experienced in some fields, to read it and realize how useful his ideas really are. One good thing that I did not expect was how much I was learning from this book. This was a very nice refresher for a beginner.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The best book I've read in a long time! What I thought when I first started reading this book: I am so sad. This book was supposed to change my life... I wanted to be a writer and this book made it clear that I'm a terrible writer and that I should focus on my writing and my writing will turn out good. It also made me realize that I've completely given up and have no idea how to actually become a writer. I hope this book works for other people and helps them to find their passion in writing because this book sucked for me. I was very disappointed. This review does not mean I hate the author or this book, but I did not like it. I don't know what is wrong with me but I have a hard time giving a 5 star review to something I didn't like. I will be searching for another book from the author but don't expect to see the same book. My book and I have never seen eye to eye.
Write a positive review about a good book:     "I like this book, and would recommend it to any fans of the Dune universe. I found the plot to be more interesting than the movie; it makes the whole Dune saga seem more realistic, and the different plotlines are quite well done. I wish more people would read it. It's a great read."  -Andrew R.A.  This novel is a great story about an Imperial officer who has been tasked with protecting the Dunes while a man named Jabba the Hutt attempts to rule the desert planet. I liked this novel as a continuation of the events of Dune. The characters were believable and had interesting personalities. The story didn't feel rushed and kept me guessing throughout. The character development was really well done and I would like to see more of it. I enjoyed the dialogue and thought that I understood the people involved. The plot was interesting and had lots of action and I did not get bored. The ending was nice and the book had a real sense of urgency. I really enjoyed reading this book and will be looking forward to seeing more of the world of Dorne. .

(Pamela Dennison, The Paris Review)  From the author of The World We're In   "An intriguing, well told story" -New York Times bestselling author James Howard Kunstler, The Nation  "[An] important biography, a thoughtful and accomplished tribute to a towering literary figure." (The Nation) - The Washington Post  The World We Are in is a book about John Updike--a great novelist, essayist and poet who created some of the best books ever written and left a rich literary legacy. This is the first book ever written about Updika, which has taken me two years to write.  As I have read his books, I have learned a great deal about a very singular and unique man. Here is my tribute to John Updyke.   John Updikes: The World   On May 15th, 1968, John Updey was born in St. Paul, Minnesota to parents, Henry Updykes and Mary Updenny. John Upyke was the third of nine children. He had a father who was an American who taught high school and college in Spain, a mother who was a native of England who married a young Irish farmer in the Irish village of O'Shaughnessy in Ireland, and a brother and a sister. His father's family was among the original English settlers in the United States, the descendants of the English clergymen who arrived in America at the time of the first Pilgrims.   John Updyken is the only son of an English father and an Irish mother. His grandfather was a carpenter who worked on the family farm and had no formal education; and Updykens was raised with his two brothers, sisters and cousins on their family's cattle farm in a farmstead with a couple of other farmsteads. In his early years, Updyk went to a local junior college, the University of Minnesota, where he majored in political science. After graduating, he worked as a salesman, then as a stockbroker

I really love the stories, and the way that the author uses the stories to tell a narrative that really drives home the theme of the book - that there are ways that we can change the world, by simply talking about the issues and putting them into action.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book at the age of sixteen in an English class. The book is good and the instructor was knowledgeable, but I felt that the book was really an exercise in writing. There were a couple of grammar mistakes and I couldn't understand the English (I'm German and the grammar is very difficult). So, I thought that the exercises might have been worth the money, but it wasn't worth the time spent.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    There was nothing wrong with this book, but I think the author took too much liberty with it. I think it's the author's first novel, and that it was supposed to be more like a science fiction or mystery. However, that's where things got a little off track. A good detective story doesn't need an unreliable narrator or a story that gets thrown out of the window on its second page. If it was all about the story that got tossed out of a window, it would have been a nice story. I like the mystery bits in this book a lot, and they all add up to make a nice mystery.    I was pretty disappointed by the end of this book. I really liked the beginning, but then everything else was just too weird to read. I don't know why he kept making up these strange things, and how this is supposed to make you believe that he is the real Sherlock Holmes.  I really liked this book but I was a little confused about some of the things that were going on.

I didn't like the fact that the book ends with a cliffhanger.  It seemed that after the cliffhangers the next book would have to get going in the same way.  But, the author does go and bring back the cliff hanger for next book and it made the book more interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been looking for a book about writing and the writing process for a while now, so I had to buy this, even though I didn't like the book.   It's very easy to understand.  It gives a lot of examples of good writing (or at least I think so), and it has some tips for how to improve your writing.  The main point of the book is that there are many books about writing, so you should be more like J.K. Rowling than like a thousand other authors.  This is a really good book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "This book was a real eye-opener for me. I was interested in Buddhism, but I thought I'd never "get it". I had heard of it, but had no idea what it was all about. "This was a very enjoyable read! I got hooked, and the book was written in a way that was easy to read. I did think it was a little long, but there were lots of interesting examples that I'd learned along the way and they made it more fun. "Overall, I highly recommend this book. This is a book for all people who want to learn more about Buddhism."  Synopsis:  This book is a fascinating look at Buddhism and Hinduism, including the way that these religions have influenced the way modern culture understands sex and romance. It's a well-written book with a lot of examples and anecdotes to really drive home the point. The way the author writes about his readers is really good, as he's obviously very aware of who he's talking to.  Author: David Wilkie (A.K.A. @BuddhistWatcher)  Title: The Book of Vows: Marriage and Sexuality in Buddhism and India  ISBN: 1596728005  Pages: 621  Format: Paperback, Kindle  Edition: 1st Edition, Spring 2015  Price: $14.00  Read Reviews  About This Book:  it's not a book about "the truth about sex" it's a book on how the two cultures view sex and relationships. It explores a range of issues, including relationships and what is really considered "real" romance. There's much about sex and how it was practiced in different cultures that makes this book a wonderful read for people interested in that subject.   It discusses the myths around "sex and romance" and how those traditions have changed. Most notably, the book addresses the notion of "sexual equality," which is the idea that men and women are equally capable of creating intimacy and giving consent in the context of marriage. While sex and intimacy have been traditionally seen as "two separate things" in cultures, the authors explore this notion in the Asian traditions.   the book goes on to discuss Hinduism in much more detail. For someone looking for a deeper exploration of Hinduism and sexuality, this is a must read. The author also discusses the Hindu tradition as a model for the practice of

Write a positive review about a good book:   The book, which is more of a series, was fun and a good read. The story was well written, the characters were likable, and the world was interesting. It was a little dated, and that was the main problem. The plot was simple but very well done, and all the characters seemed well developed. I think a sequel might be in order.  "We did not fight this war because we wanted to, but because we were forced to." The Battle for Earth: The Last Years of the United Earth Government was a fun story about humanity in the post-apocalyptic future. The only real drawback was that the book took forever to get going, but the next book should alleviate that. The characters were well developed and believable, as were the aliens. If you are a fan of science fiction, you should check this out. You will not be disappointed!

Write a positive review about a good book:   When I started reading the book I was already excited to get through it and was a bit disappointed to find out after finishing it that there were more "real" characters than there were in the book. I loved the characters and the plot, I enjoyed the romance and it was an easy read to follow. The characters I did not like were the old woman who was more of an enabler than a person but I had the same issue with that as with the old man. It seemed like the characters were either doing something wrong or they were just not interesting enough. The only character I thought was really interesting was the villain of the book, the old witch who was much more of a real villain than the old lady or the old guy who I felt was just there for the plot. A very cool and unique fantasy/science fiction novel with a very unique setting, and I will definitely read more of this series from this author because I think I might just enjoy this one even more than I enjoyed The Wind in the Willows, it really got me excited to read more. I gave it a four out of five stars.  Readers, I hope you liked this review and/or have an idea of who my character is, I can't wait to see what happens next!

Write a positive review about a good book:    "    "The Book of Love in Tibet is one of those books that is so good that I will never be able to put it down. I was very impressed by the book and the author's approach to the subject.   The book describes the history and development of the book trade in Tibet over the past two and a half centuries.  "   He describes how the book market in Tibet flourished in the early 20th century after the fall of the Qing dynasty.  His book is based on a large volume of Tibet's book trade.  It begins with a history of Tibet since the first century AD with a brief introduction on the history of the T'ang dynasty and the reign of the Tang dynasty in the 12th century.  The T'ANG dynasty is characterized by its religious tolerance and its openness to foreign influences.  This openness was not necessarily a good thing as it led to numerous rebellions.  In the 13th century the Tang defeated Tibet in a war and seized Tibet's capital Lhasa, where the Dalai Lama resided, which led to an eight-year-long Buddhist monk insurrection which ended in the suppression of Tibetan Buddhism.   After the suppression Tibetan Buddhist culture suffered a severe setback.  At this point the book starts to move along, describing how the market for Tibetan books was created and how it expanded throughout China.     This part of the story is more of a history lesson than a discussion about the value of Tibetan culture.  While the history lesson itself isn't too complicated, I would like to see more discussion of the trade and the political and cultural factors that led to the rise of the Tibetan book trade, the way they impacted the lives of the Tibetans and the overall cultural impact of Tibet.  There are some examples of the early trade between Tibet and China, the introduction of Tibetan texts in China, trade with India, the Chinese reaction to the Tibetan resistance and the suppression and repression of Tibetan culture during the reigns of the Yuan and Qing.  Although there is a general discussion about Tibet, there is nothing about the present situation of Tibet and it is difficult to see how a future book would address the issue of Tibet today.  Overall this is a good read and I would recommend it to anyone interested in Tibet.

Write a positive review about a good book:   "This is the sort of book that should be in a library -- something people would come to talk about.... The author makes the case that we should be able to discuss our experiences without feeling guilty about being gay, bisexual or transgendered.... This is not just a book about gender but one about race and how race and gender shape our lives." (The Village Voice) "Haunting and powerful... I could never get to know a gay person who was not an evangelical Christian, and, so, with this book, it is time to know one and break that spell." (Huffington Post) Folks, I'm a black guy who grew up as a Christian (and who has since come to atheism), and I've come to realize that I am not a Christian. So why bother saying so? That question will take me a long time to answer. But it's an easy one to answer: Jesus would have been a racist. Because his followers think that he is. This is, of course, the view of the majority of Christian leaders, not the minority. But what's more, the minority, at least the part I am familiar with (the ones who are not just religious, but also social conservatives and libertarians), still clings to its white-Christian privilege, even while it is being rejected by the vast majority of people of color. For that reason, when they find a person like me and others like me who are atheists, they try to silence us, to make us invisible. They tell us that we are sinful and that we have no right to be a part of this movement. They try to convince us that, since we are not the kind of Christians they're comfortable with, we're not Christians at all, and that they have no problem with our lack of belief and their belief in a God who is white and male. They don't like us and we don't really belong in their movement. But that's what they want -- they want to tell us who we are and how we ought to behave so that they can pretend that they are speaking for us, when in fact they are not. So what I'm trying to do here is to start a conversation about race, about privilege, about Christianity, about how we're both ignorant and hypocritical, and to get people to see that there is nothing to be gained by being religious, and everything to be lost by believing in a god whose followers are more racist than

Write a positive review about a good book:   ... It's been an exciting year so far. I just finished reading John Green's "Paper Towns". I have to say, this book is the absolute best of the Green books that I've read. It's written very beautifully, and although it's not as "adult" as the others I've seen, it's still a great read. I was pleasantly surprised by the ending and thought the author did a good job with a very young characters. Thank you, John Green!  
Write a positive review about a good book:     "The power of this book is a story of the good things that happened to me after my marriage had ended. It's not about what happened but what I did after and how that changed my life and the lives of my children. A great read."  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book! I enjoyed it so much I had to listen to it again! It's about a guy who has been cursed with telepathic powers and is now trying to do his best to help people! It was fun. I had a great time reading it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    One of my favorite fantasy books ever! A lot of people read this one, but they should read this book if they are into this genre! I really love the fantasy story. A lot can happen in one book and the story moves quite well. I like the author's style too. One of the books I always look up for a series, this is it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's time to get real! The book is about the real history of the world and humanity. I got the free audiobook but the book is free for the reading, so buy it and listen to it, too. This book is a work of art and will enlighten you about everything that is going on around you. The authors do a great job of portraying how all human races in this earth came into existence. All religions have some sort of truth, but this book presents the truth. It's really cool to see that humanity has been here since the beginning of creation and will continue to exist for eons. I feel a bit silly reading the book because there are several chapters about how humans will become extinct but they are written so realistically that you will not be upset. This will definitely help to put a better perspective on the human race, since it's already very big, we have all sorts of people and things and it's going to be quite a while before a human race is born. The author is not one to write a book to sell books. His book is not preachy and does not put words in people's mouth. The book provides information about history, culture, religion, technology, etc. This is important because you should be more educated, and I think the authors do it so accurately because it is real. I'm not religious so I haven't read many books about the past, but I have read a few and this one was a great addition to my knowledge. I recommend this book to everyone who wants to know about history and the real world, or the religions.

A. in Houston on Dec 20, 2014 @ 11:00pm I really liked this book and think it would have been a great addition to a sci-fi library! It's an interesting book about human emotions, and one that I think anyone would enjoy. I think it's important to read a book about people in the field so you can get an idea of the type of personalities that are out there, and this is just the type!

Write a positive review about a good book:   And now, a review by another author:  I really enjoyed the book, as it has a decent plot, but it could be even better.  There was a lot of time spent talking about why women who do these things are so bad for the man's future (because the women aren't married and don't have a baby yet) and yet the author doesn't even mention this.  It's obvious that the author had some ulterior motive for not mentioning this or else he would have mentioned it at least a couple times.  He talks about "maintaining your dignity as a man" and "keeping your balls in the right place", but I think the real issue is that he was bored by the plot and just wants to make a story.  I know what he was trying to say but it just came out so awkward and awkward.  The only time it got good was when the author came up with this whole "why women want to be taken" thing that was so cliche.  So the author talks about this "reproach", and then he brings in the wife who was so impressed she has a whole section on how women aren 'worse' than men because of the constant criticism and ridicule they get when they try to do this. The problem is that this is a completely made up scenario.  She didn't go to school for women's studies, she didn't research any of this, she just made this up and was a very clever author, but I still wouldn't want to date her or spend any time with her because she's so clueless and boring.   This wasn't a problem, but the fact that the other women in this book weren't mentioned at all just makes the whole story even more tedious to me.
Write a positive review about a good book:       "The thing about this book is that its main characters are all human beings...it's a novel that deals with the idea of a friendship between two human beings."   -Daphne Caruana Galizia                (I have not read the book, but read the review by Mrs.  Caruana Gal  Galizia of the book)                    "This book is so good I can't even read it without getting emotional."                   -K.L. The "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" series has been adapted by the BBC  into a popular television series.   I am familiar with the original book series, which is a pulp fantasy series.   The author of this book, Douglas Adams, was a science fiction author and a prolific author of short stories, short novels and poetry. The Hitchhiker  Guide to the  Gods  is a series of eight short stories.  The story about a man who is offered the chance to spend a week on Earth as a guide for a group of travelers is among the first stories included in the "Hag" series. It is also the first story in the book series that Adams wrote in full sentences and with clear and logical sentences.  Adams has written many more novels in his career, but this book was his first novel in print.  The story is told from the point of view of the second person.  An alien named Arle (not the hero) is chosen to help with the group as a "god" in the story.  He is given a brief overview of life on Earth, and the life of the inhabitants.  In order to help the travelers on their trip, Arle is given an array of equipment, including a radio and a "stirrer", which is an object with which he can create various food items.  His equipment is kept in the luggage in his personal space.  Arle uses the "stirsrer" and a small amount of "sugar" and "dough" to feed the travelers in the plane. He also tells them the name of the planet they are on, and tells the group to stop for a little lunch before setting off.    The travelers start out on the planet, and find a planet where they can learn about life in the universe.  While the story is a lot of fun,
Write a positive review about a good book:   In some cases a great story will win over a great book; in other cases an outstanding story can bring out the best in a book; and in still other cases a well-crafted, intelligent story can have a profound impact on one's reading habits.   In the end, it's a matter of finding the right balance between the two and letting the story be the star of the show.  (And the only person who can help you find that balance is you, of course!  )  This review of "The Nightingale's Song"   is in part about the great book it contains and, in part, about my own reading habits, but it's about more than that.    I want to tell you a little about the book and how I read it and what made it so special.   I've read many fantasy books this year.   I've been reading many books for years.  But the first one I read in 2016 was "The Long Price Quartet" by Jeff Salyards, a wonderful story that I read a while back.  It is a short story and I haven't really read much short stories since.  A few years ago, I read an epic fantasy called "The Broken Eye" by the late David Eddings.  And now I read "The Black Prism" by Joe Abercrombie, a story that really drew me in and made me want to read the rest of the series.  What is the key to a great short story?   Something I could see the author thinking about in the writing process as he wrote? What was the writing style?  And, most important, what does the story do for me?  The Night King At the beginning of this story, we get a glimpse at the Night King's face and a few more details about him.  The Night King was a terrible king who was killed by Bran in his boyhood.  We hear how Bran's dad and uncle have raised Bran to be the kind of person who never fights or gets into trouble and has been living in the North for thousands of years.   He is a gentle person who is wise and good and loyal.  He was one of a kind and his brother, Aegon, was a bad king and killed many innocent people.  Aegon's uncle died when he was a little boy and his mother was taken away.  Then his father died when
Write a positive review about a good book:     I bought this book a few weeks ago, thinking that I'd read the story by the end of the book. I haven't quite finished reading the first half yet, but I am currently just about to start it up. So far, so good!      So far, I'm very impressed. If you can read well (like I can!), and are looking for something to read to your child to encourage reading, this book is definitely for you! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    (5 stars, if I ever get it...) I read "The White Album" when I was sixteen, and it still holds up. It's like reading the Bible and hearing the voice of God.   This book is not just a great book to read, but to put on for friends and family. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I thought this was a good novel. There are some very good scenes that didn't fit with the rest of the book, but this is what was important for me. It is a great read, and a well written and realistic story.   A good book has no need to be perfect. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved the story, the art and the characterization. It was an amazing ride that I really hope to see continue.   I've been working on the art for about 3 weeks now and I think I've cracked the code of making good cover art. I know what it takes to create a great cover and it took me a long time to learn it.  Thank you for this amazing story and art. The characters were amazing.  Thanks for making this one of my favourite YA books.
Write a positive review about a good book:        The fact that I read this book has been a long time coming. It has been several years since I read a novel that really gripped me and moved me to tears and in this case that is true for all of it's stories. While this book is no masterpiece, I have to admit that I am still able to keep the story going, and while I don't expect everything to go perfectly, I am pleased with what we got.   What I do expect from The Last King in the North ( The Last Kings in the Night ) is a story that continues in the sequel, The Last Lords in the Dawn. As I write this review I am not sure if there is a sequel in the works. There is a very intriguing character who appears in this book and who may be a spoiler but that may change.    I do have a few more comments about this book: The Last Kingdom was not written to be a history of Northumbria but it certainly does a good job of showing how and why Northumbrians came to be kings of a land that had been ruled for thousands of years by their cousins in the south. It also takes the time to explain what happened to the previous king and his son- the events of the War of the Heirs. For many of the characters in this story the story is not very well told. For example, King Aedan is described as having had many lovers. We never find out what they were, only that it was some woman. The main characters are not very interesting but that is also to be expected from a first person narrator who is so engrossed in the story that they do not even notice that their narrator is talking to them.  As a result some of the stories were not very exciting. King Harald and Queen Lagertha are described as being close friends but there is no description of how they got to be friends. The reason I am mentioning this is because it is one of those things that I have always wondered about but have never been able to figure out the answer to. What is the best way to make friends in a place that can be ruled by your cousins? How do they get along? It is not only a plot hole but it is also a plot point that I did not like.  Another thing that I will comment on is that this book ends with the death of King HarALD but it does not tell you who this man was.  The Last War
Write a positive review about a good book:    It was very funny and not really that scary.     It was written to be a bit of fun, but in a way that was not too violent and not too disturbing.  The author had a great story and the ending was kind of a surprise, but I don't think I'll be reading a horror novel again any time soon.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I enjoyed this book immensely! I was excited to get a book like this to read. It's well written and the plot kept me engaged from start to finish. I'd like to see more women portrayed in non-mainstream fiction as it's a major taboo in our society that women don't write.

Write a positive review about a good book:    What makes a good, non-fiction book: Good authors can put an interesting spin on any subject.   Good non-fiction authors can be interesting in a "why" sort of way, with lots of details about what actually happened.  I liked this book, though I wasn't particularly interested in the topics.  One thing that did bother me is that I found myself rereading a lot of the details from the beginning of the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The "The Girl on the Train" is a very interesting book with an interesting take on a common theme. Although the narrator is a young adult, the book does not take place in a classroom. Instead, the narrator moves between the perspective of a middle aged woman and an early childhood. This book takes place in the Midwest, which is very similar to the Midwest I grew up in in Ohio. Although there is a lot of snow in Minnesota, the people here are generally very friendly, and the people I met there (who live far away) seemed to be just as warm and happy as the people in Ohio or New York. As for the book itself, I really enjoyed reading it. The book is written in a short sentence format and I really liked the story line. The narration is not overly intrusive. There are several times in the book when I thought the narrator was making up a story for the sake of writing it down. The story line was interesting but the characters were not compelling to me. The characters were fairly simplistic, especially the one with the strange name. Although I was interested in the story, the characters just did not feel interesting to me, but maybe I'm wrong about that. Overall, this was a good story and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a short story.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A nice story and a good ending to an enjoyable read.   It's easy to get caught up in the world and characters but that only adds to the immersion of the story.  It is interesting how much of the world is based off the first five novels.  There is a huge difference in the culture, society, and language that takes place in the original novels and how they are presented in this novel.  The setting is interesting and different.  As a whole, this is a great read and I look forward to reading the next book in the series.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am very pleased with this book. I liked it. I like many things in the book. My only problems with it are: 1) there are just too many times the author seems to be saying, "Don't let it get to you", or "Don''t feel like shit!", 2) the author really shouldn''t be doing that, and 3) the book is so good that it really does make you feel things. The writing is great, and the story is excellent. There are some people who say, "I don''t like writing so much in my own voice," but for me, that is not a big deal. I also like the idea of what would happen if the book was written in another genre. If I have to think about this book any longer than I have already, I will probably forget it entirely.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A brilliant, insightful analysis of some of the most dangerous doctrines in human history:       My recommendation:  - Download this book if you find it worthwhile.  - If you are a Christian who is considering reading a book which is not focused on Christian beliefs and values, or if you are an atheist and wondering why Christians are afraid of the Bible:  I recommend reading this book before considering how you are going to approach the Bible. You may find it to be a refreshingly honest examination of some biblical passages which could cause problems in a Christian context.
Write a positive review about a good book:     If it has the "right" subject matter, and doesn't go off on tangents that aren't really relevant, that's a book you'll love. If you love history, especially history that's in the public domain (which is what I love about the Library of Congress), this is a great book.    It took me awhile to read this because the main thing I loved about this book was the fact that I was reading about the public collection. The story took a back seat to the stories I would've told about that particular collection. As much as I enjoyed reading about these other collections, I have to wonder why people aren't more interested in what is currently being digitized and uploaded to the Internet.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was initially excited by this book as it came from a self-published author, but this has become a frustrating experience. After reading all that has been written on this book, I've decided that it is not well written. I had the good fortune of meeting a friend on my last trip to India and the whole time I was with him, I was just looking at all the food. One time he was telling me about how they make the rice like a tortilla, how the grains are cooked in a hot pan and then when they are finished they are folded in a big pot and the rice is then placed on a plate. That day was our dinner for the day. It was the best Indian food I have had and I have been to India many times. The next time I am in India, I am going to order a curry or a platter of rice with the rice cooker (they are on special) with some curried chicken on it. The book does a good job of teaching how to boil rice, but it makes no mention that you are also going to have to put water in to boil it, you need to add more water if it doesn't come out of the rice as smooth as it is supposed to. That is a major oversight. Also, one other thing that is annoying. In some of the photographs in the book, the food looks good. I was looking at them like I was really excited about it. I can tell they are all photo's in the same place. I don't get that. The pictures that were taken at a table, or at a stall, are in a different place than the picture that was taken with me and the friend (me being my friend) at a small table in a small room. All in all, it is very difficult to recommend this book. If you do decide to read it, have a bowl of steaming hot rice. :)
Write a positive review about a good book:    (2/5)   This is a hard book to get through for me because it's really, really dry. I find that reading novels that are more like stories is much more enjoyable than reading a book that is written like a memoir, which is what this book is. If you are a fan of science fiction, and want to read an interesting and fascinating account of how the mind works, then this is definitely for you. If not, then you should just look elsewhere. I read this book on my Kindle and I found it very tedious to read, especially for such an important subject. I did get around to the end of the book a few weeks after I started reading it, and was disappointed that I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. It's definitely worth a read, but definitely not a must-have for any science fiction fan.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had a hard time deciding between this book and The Secret.   However, the story is much better than I expected.   The way the characters behave and react to the world around them is very well done.  I think that the author did a very good job making us care about the characters and the events in the book.  I will recommend this book to anyone who enjoys science fiction and is looking for a dark and intriguing book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    - - - 0   In this post, I'm going to talk about one of the things that really bugs me about books like this: the over-reliance on statistics. The people who write these books, and the statistics they rely on, are probably using stats the same way any other scientist would use them. They're taking an objective, empirical, scientific approach to something, and then using the data and statistics to back up their arguments. But it's not what I'm interested in here, as a science writer. I'm here to talk from the science-writer perspective: about what's interesting, and why it matters. I want to talk in the long, long term about what science and statistics can tell us about ourselves, about the world, and about the problems we have to solve to make this a better world. So first, we should note that statistics can and should be used. We've discussed this before, and it's worth reiterating.   It's not a complete waste of time to learn about the statistics that go into a particular result, and how they affect it, because they're often very important in guiding a data scientist's way of looking at the world. It's also a complete overuse of statistics to get at every possible outcome, which is just a way of saying that statistics shouldn't be used as a substitute for data. That is, if we're going to try and come to some conclusions based on the numbers, we need to be careful about how we make those conclusions: we should never be so afraid of error that we don't use all the facts we have, but we should use the best and most accurate evidence we have when we try to make those decisions.  One of the most common reasons we use statistics in this post is because the writer believes the book has some specific "statistical significance" to show. This is a common concern among a lot of people who have made it this far through this post: a) If it's this big, it must mean something; b) It's just the kind of problem that statistics and science are good at solving, so they can't be that bad, they must be doing something right. But that's only the half of the story. When I say that we should rely on statistics for our conclusions, I don't mean that we need just to trust that those conclusions come out right -- we have more work to do there. But I also don't
Write a positive review about a good book:    * A book that I highly recommend is the  "Cursed!" trilogy by Elizabeth Bear.   The book series takes place in a world where the "Curses" of the world are not a metaphor, but actual effects.  In a world of magic, there are a few people who can manipulate it.  These people, known as "Cursers", are treated as outcasts.  The main character,  Aes Sedai, is one of these "Curse" users.  This is because she is a true "Cancer" in the world and because she uses "Cunning",  which  has been  outlawed.  And that is where the story takes place.  "Called To Caster" tells the story of  Aislyn  and her dealings with the Cursers.  I don't think I have ever read a book like this and I can't wait for the next book.  For more information, you can visit the official blog  or visit  the official book website  for more info. Posted by Marr at 6:00 PM

Jones, American Heritage Press   The Great Gatsby (Fiction) by F. Scott Fitzgerald This is a brilliant novel about the American Dream—a book for people who think they know the American dream, but can't really understand how it could work at all. It is the most sophisticated expression of the American obsession with success that I have yet seen. ... A superb novel that tells the true story of Gatsbys' rise from low-status, no-good, drunken drifter to the greatest money-maker of his time.  of The Great GATSby by F Scott Fitzgerald It was a great honor to read this book. As a child I remember the excitement as my grandmother, on holiday, returned from the movies with a copy of The Sun Also Rises. Since I am only just becoming aware of the importance of the Fitzgeralds in American literature, I was thrilled to find this book in my library. The story that was presented to me is that of Gately's rise to stardom in New York. It's a fantastic story, rich with detail and action.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book makes me wish that more good books could be written.   I have enjoyed this book.  The plot was interesting.  There are different aspects to the world of the stories and I am not yet convinced that the author has a handle on this world.  Some of the characters were interesting and others not.  The story of the book is one of revenge but at the end of the day I do not believe that the ending was a satisfying way to finish.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this.   It took me to the same part of Europe in the late 19th century that many people travel to, and I did.  In the book, the author describes the way things were back then, and there were a lot of good old people back then too.  The author's descriptions were great.  It was interesting that most people did not have electricity back then and the books described the way people used fire to light things.  I didn't read the book in a very long time, and this review is not going to be too long, but it gave me many more memories that I don't want to forget.  What did I like:  I loved the historical aspect of this story. I loved how the author described the people.  They weren't super-rich, but still had a lot in common with how I remember people back in the day.  And I thought the story was great, which is always a positive thing.  What did I NOT like: The characters didn't make sense in a lot.  There were a couple of characters that were more interesting than others.  One of the characters even reminded me of myself at the time, so there were some similarities.  He was a little unhinged but still, not very good.  In terms of plot, there wasn't anything that stuck with me or stuck out.  But still, there was so much history to learn, and a few more people I would like to know a little more about. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   There are only a few bad things about the book, but there are not too many good things either. Some of the things he said about what the book was going to teach me were way off. I read the book before I went to sleep the night before my final exam and I thought I knew about about 50% of what he was going on about, but I guess I didn't know some of the other things he was talking about so I really don't know if I was better or worse off for going to sleep without reading it. The other thing that I found confusing was the ending. It said that it was going about 4 days until she would be leaving for her family vacation to Europe, and the way it described it sounded like she would go there the first weekend, but it said that she was back on Monday, and that wasn't a vacation, it was something that was more of a vacation. I guess if it was a vacation for the first part of it, it wasn't so much a vacation after that. In conclusion, it is worth reading, because it may help you if you're in the middle of something and want to know more about something before you put too much time in.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My brother's best friend in college, who now works at McDonalds and loves him for it. A story about a guy who finds out that a book he once told his friends about, is really a book that his friends don't read, or don't understand it, he goes into a library and finds a copy of a book called: The Great Gatsby. It turns out that the whole story is a fake book, that people who read this book only thought it was real. When he reads it, all he can think about is how he wished it was true, but how he had wasted his life on it, and the shame of it all. He gets angry at the author for being a fraud, and for the people who have actually bought the book as a joke, and then the book destroys them. The book is actually a book about a rich, white man who loves a poor, black guy, who's a drug addict, who hates himself, who never got a girlfriend, who doesn't really care about anything but himself, and gets more and more pissed off when his own life doesn't change the way he wants it to. This book is a great read, and has a lot of great lessons to be learned for men. If you are going to be a man who doesn 't like women, this is the book for you. My favorite of the two books by M. John Harrison:  One book that I never thought I would write. The premise of the book is, if your family member was a cop, the man's wife would have to wear a wire. The idea of this book, as the man tries to figure out a way to get out of the situation of a married cop, I thought would be so funny and yet so terrifying.    I didn't even realize this was a story about domestic abuse. When I read this I thought of people who beat their wives, or husbands who beat on their wives. I don't know if this book will ever happen, but I hope I'll get to read a book like this someday, it sounds like something I'd enjoy. How to live well by Peter McAlpine (The New York Times) I got an email from Peter McAllpine who gave me the following quote: "I don't think it's that women should have a lot less power in this country.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I had a hard time deciding between the first 3 books of this series so I bought the last 3, and I think the fourth is great. This was a little slow starting for me but after reading it in it's entirety I was pleased with it. It is slow and sometimes a little dull but I thought it was good. It's definitely worth a read but if you are a first time reader it is probably going to take you a few books to get into it. That said I'm glad I picked it up.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an interesting book. While it was disappointing to know that it is not as original as I had hoped, I liked it. There is a lot of detail and the writing is tight and clear.   The story has a lot to say about relationships, but I wish it had taken a different tack. It felt as though the author wanted to write a classic romantic comedy, but with some added complexity to the romance.  My biggest complaint is the "love" of the title.  Love is rarely a good thing in fiction, so the inclusion of this "love of" in this book seemed wrong.  There were also some other parts that I thought could have been improved, but they were minor.  A good romance story that also has interesting ideas:  For people looking for something with a more thoughtful twist than "love is good" I recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:     "A little different from your normal Harry Potter book. It's a dark story, that I didn't expect at all, but it was quite enjoyable."  The Reviewer:  "This story took me by surprise. I read the first book in the series and it got me excited to read the rest. I was excited for this book, I'm actually reading it now as a kind of review. If I wasn't a huge fan of the original series it probably wouldn't have worked for me. I really like this one though, and will probably finish it. Great read, I can't wait for the next book."
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good read with lots of pictures and lots of good words.   "A book of love, laughter and sorrow, a book of hope, and a book that teaches us to think for ourselves."  —Tara, 5th Grade Teacher in New York  About This Book  The Story of My Life tells the story of a family's journey, from the earliest memories of growing up, through the tragedies of losing a loved one and to the joys of being together in the future. It's a family journey that spans generations and it's a story that is told in great detail.  "It is a story of the challenges faced by a family whose young children are dealing with mental illness, growing up with the death of a mother and father and the growing pains of trying to support their teenage son. There is also the struggle to be a good and loving family to a child struggling with his own challenges, and the realization that there are no easy answers to life's difficulties."  in Publishers Weekly
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read this book a number of times but never finished it. It was a long read and the ending wasn't what I wanted but I do enjoy reading about what the characters go through in their final days. It's been a few years since my last reading but I'm glad I picked this up.  5 stars   I have read the first book of this series and enjoyed the story. I found the second book to be just as good, more so even. The author does a great job in showing us just how bad things get and the aftermath.  I would have given this a five star rating if there wasn't so much of it, it felt like a hundred. I think it's just my style of reading, I do appreciate being entertained and I think my book-club group would be happy with this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:     I'm a huge fan of the series and wanted to finally read it in its entirety. The characters are well written and well developed. The story is intriguing, and I can only imagine the excitement it will cause for the people reading the book. I especially enjoyed the humor in the book, which reminded me of a certain Mr. Rogers. I loved how the book takes place in the 1800s and it's always fascinating how things have changed and how the world has changed in so many ways. If you're a fan of these type of books you will love this one.

Write a positive review about a good book:    There is a problem with a lot of novels written about black women: they are too much about the black woman. In the first few pages, the author says: "It's one thing to write about a woman who was a part of a slave revolt in the 18th century, it's quite another to write a novel about a white girl who is a part in the uprising." The author, a young black woman, is writing about the woman who led a slave uprising (not a slave owner, which I'll get to in a moment). She has all the traits of a heroine: bold, strong, intelligent, strong-willed, determined, a leader, strong willed, strong minded, driven. But she is written from a male perspective, and there is nothing of her struggle or her thoughts, or anything about how the rest of the book deals with the slavery, and especially the violence and the treatment of slaves. Instead, we have a book that tries to capture all the parts that made her a hero. The plot points she has the characters deal with, and the character arc she has, are all set up by what she says, rather than by the actions she takes. And it's not just a bad author: there is a plot point, not in the book itself, but in an interview with the author, in which she says: If there was a book like that today, a woman like Hillary Clinton would be writing it. I mean, look, she was in the White House, leading the charge on health care. She was a young senator in the Senate with a voice for women's rights. She's now an experienced and successful politician. The fact that she's been through everything that a woman can go through, the things that have happened to her, the struggles she has endured, the successes that have come to her and that have been in the face of adversity, she could have written a book about that. The book doesn't have that much character development at all, and when you read the book, you see very little of her life. The same thing happens to most of the characters, except for a couple. We have a handful of black women in the story who are able to make their own life choices, who make the best choices they can and can live out their lives in the best ways they can, and they have their own adventures, but that is the exception. It doesn't matter, because the author didn't put

Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book to read over winter break. The cover has a red bird and the word "pup" written in big red letters. It's a fairly new author (she hasn't made it to our library yet) and her book looks like it will have good, old-fashioned family reading fun. I liked it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book mainly for the audio version, as it is about the best I've heard. The audio version was a bit of a let down, not because the narrator was bad, but because the narrative was a lot more of a blur, and it felt more like a story we'd heard from an old woman than a real story. The prose was very good, as the author is the real deal, but the narrators need to make it a bit more audible, in terms of volume. The characters were well drawn, and were believable in all the best ways. A couple of things that might have been better were the ending, where the main characters seem to be at an impasse in their relationship, and the ending was a little too abrupt for my tastes. But for a first story, I enjoyed the ride and the story. 5.5 Stars. A woman who is still trying to figure out what happened to her. She can't bring herself to believe what she knows, but she has faith in the truth. It's a story of survival and it is so wonderfully written and delivered. It would have been a nice one to have read over in bed.
Write a positive review about a good book:   My daughter and I have always had a mutual love of horror. The more we learned about the books, the more we discovered they are more than just "scary stories". The characters are the most important part of each book. Some of them are well drawn and interesting while others are just plain creepy. I have to admit that my daughter and myself were both a bit scared and unsettled by the ending. She didn't feel like it was a happy one and I was a little worried as well. But for the most part I can see what the author was trying to do. I was so happy that I could read this and have a good night's sleep. A+++

Write a positive review about a good book:    "Bishop's book, an excellent piece of historical research, is the sort of scholarly book that you just have to read to understand it."   "Brigitte Bishop's new book 'The Last Battle' provides a new perspective on the end of the First World War, and an understanding of its key events, on all sides of the war, including the 'Great' German victory."  The first book I ever read about World War 1 was "The First Battle" by David Balfour, and the author of that book was an Irishman named Martin Ó Cíomáin. Martin Ó Cuimhin, was born on September 13th, 1859 in County Kilkenny, and died on August 11th, 1935. He was a doctor who also wrote about medicine. When he was at the top of his profession he received many awards, including a royal commission from Queen Victoria for his contribution to medicine. His grandfather, Samuel Ó Ceomáinn, had the same name as his father, Martin ó Cíumáin, so ó Ceumain Ó Ciomain is the Irish version of the name " Martin á Cíamáin ", as well as the first person. I have seen a few books about the First War, most are written in a biased way, they ignore facts or they are too political and too focused on the Germans as the bad guys. The German army was a good army, and in the end they had a chance of winning.  There were some battles in the First Great War, but none that were decisive. The main reason why the British were winning the war was because of their superiority of arms, and their superiority in technology, while the Germans had superior numbers, and they did not have the technology to match the British. This was a very short war, the longest was World War 2. As a whole, World War I was a defeat, but the British and the Germans didn't know this at the time, and didn't take the opportunity to end the war at the peace talks. The book has a lot of information about what went on in the trenches, the artillery and also what really happened in the battles. I can only recommend this book to any World War One buff who is interested in history. There are a few minor errors here and there, but that is all there is. The book doesn
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was recently sent this book by a friend as a Christmas gift and found it to be a wonderful read. It is a very well written book about the history of the Christian Church, and it is one of the more thorough and well documented books I have seen. The book gives some insight into how the Church got started, how it was formed and was shaped, and what it is today.   It also gives some interesting details about certain early church leaders, and explains what they did and what was their influence.  One of the best things about this book is that it provides a very detailed history of Rome from the time of Constantine until about a century ago. The history is well researched and the writing is very readable and informative.

Write a positive review about a good book:    Good for the price  by Kaitlin from Seattle, WA on February 6, 2018  This is a good starter book to read if you are curious. It's definitely the kind of book that you read over and over and try to think of new ways to understand the material. However, it is a very technical book and will not interest many people unless they really want to learn the basics. I am a high school physics student who is interested in making some sort of nuclear reaction work. I have done my homework on this material and find that this book does a very good job of explaining it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   My wife and I read this book to our daughters in March 2011.   We gave it two stars because it's a very good book with good stories, but it has several very bad ones.  In addition to a few stories that I thought were funny (which they were),  I thought the other stories were a little over the top, too.  They took some of the fun out of the book.  But,  that was the only thing I had a problem with.  I loved it.  It has good, family-friendly stories about the Bible, and was written in a way that makes me want to go back and read it again and again.  My daughter has now picked it up and is reading it to the other kids, so I know it is still the good book it was when we read it to her.  Also, the stories were well-written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you don't enjoy this book, you really should try another one! I know it's been a while since I read it but I just wanted to write a review as soon as I finished it! I have to say that this book is one of my favorites. It is a simple, yet incredibly touching tale of a family of three who is suffering through the loss of their youngest. I had so much fun reading this book because it reminded me of another favorite book, the book of the last days of Judas in which there is a great, and heart breaking, battle of the family. But unlike the Judas' story, the story of this family didn't end the same way, the family ended different from Judas's family. My favorite part of this book was when they were all sitting around their kitchen table and the little boy said that he didn't know how to feel because he and his sister were in love. This made me cry.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   The characters were very well done and have a lot to do.

This was one of the best books I read.  The author did a good job writing down the events in the chapters.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The writing style is good. The plot and characters are enjoyable. It's got a good sense of humour, and it makes you think.   I bought this for a book club, and there were 3 people in the room. The story is well done, although it doesn't really make you go "wow, this is a good read". I've read quite a few books in the last 2 years, and I've never had a story that made me go "Wow, this really hit the spot for me". This was a nice read, but I could have done without the over-the-top action scenes. It was interesting enough that I'd like to read more about it, but it didn't really click for me.

Write a positive review about a good book:   My second book from the anthology!   I didn't have too much trouble keeping the story up-to-date, it's just the characters are so well-drawn that they are more entertaining than annoying.   While this book is only a few hundred pages, I'm still thinking "damn, what was that book about in the other one, then?"   If you are looking for something that's an adventure with a twist or a mystery that's all on the edge, this is definitely not for you.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good short book on the fundamentals of how to improve the speed and effectiveness of your handwriting. My son uses the book to improve his writing speed, and my husband has been using the book on his own for about 6 months. The basic premise is that using a pencil for writing instead of a finger for writing (especially in long handwritings) can give you a great advantage if you are serious about improving your speed and ability to write. The book covers all the basics you need to know, but for a thorough review and understanding of the basic principals, I would recommend the "Solve it at Home" DVD set (see links below). - K.M.

It was a very interesting and informative read, and I am looking forward to his next book, "Farewell to the Big Leagues," about the final chapter of baseball's great strike season in 1968, when the owners' collective bargaining agreement expired.  Buhlen is a writer of great wit, his stories are amusing, and his writing is excellent.  The only down side is that the book is a little long, but that can be forgiven in the interest of keeping readers engaged.

Write a positive review about a good book:    To be honest, I just started reading this book yesterday, and I am now halfway through it. The narrative is well paced, the characters are well developed, the plot is intriguing, and the plot development is pretty good. The ending of the novel is unexpected and a bit satisfying. The characters and plot lines are interesting enough to keep my interest. I'm looking forward to seeing how this story goes further into the novel, and how this book is compared to the one previously mentioned (but it's not the best book by that author).

If you want a book where there's no romance but you can still have fun, and it has some pretty funny parts, then this is a good read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   "  I have been reading "Giant by Day" for about a month. It is a well researched and thought provoking book about how giants were made and what we can do now to ensure the creation of more and bigger ones.

She brings out the historical context in the book and the fact that the giants were not just "big guys". There were many different species of giants and it is fascinating to read about them.  The writing is excellent, as always, and if you're a giant lover you will enjoy it too!   I just wish there was a shorter version!
Write a positive review about a good book:    "The Great Gatsby was a book about a lot of things and what is interesting about it is that they were all the things you can't really buy or do yourself.   It was a novel about a young man from the Midwest trying to establish himself and live a middle class life in the South.  The plot was interesting and there were a lot interesting parts to the book and some of the scenes that were interesting were the things that were done in an effort to make things more like their own life and not to make the novel more like the life of the rich that Gatsbys had.  I think there is a lot to admire about Gats by Fitzgerald, but I thought that the middle class was just a bit too "macho" for me and the rest of my family.  "  (Review from BookLikes, Nov. 18, 2015)   About the Author's Review:  (A bit of a long review, sorry about that, but there is so much I want to say about the book that it just wouldn't be possible to keep this short.)  I read "Gatsby" as a kind of therapy session for me:  a way to see exactly what it is about Gatz that has made me love him so much and to understand why I feel so passionately about it.  This review is in no way a criticism of the book or the author.  Rather, this is simply a way for me to explain how this book affected me and how the book changed me and what I think about that.  My first experience with a Gatsyn novel was about 6 years ago when I read that one.  At the time, I didn't even know that he had written a novel before, but he had, so I took a chance and gave it a try.  From what I remember, it wasn't bad.  That was until I started reading other books about GATSBY:   I know "Gatz" is not a novel.  But even so, that seems like a long time for a novel to be so different from the rest, so unique and so special.  Even though I started out with that idea and had even written myself up on a piece of paper, it took a long while for me get it and for me (being the introverted person that I am) to understand the way that a novel could be so unique.  It took another year before I finally
Write a positive review about a good book:     Read the review:  The story of how the book "Cancer" ended was pretty simple - and a bit sad. I know it's going to be hard for some people to understand, but this book was so well done that I was really upset about its ending. This is an amazing book, but it's hard to recommend, due to the ending. It didn't make me feel like it was a "complete" book.   I really liked this book, so I was pretty disappointed that I didn't enjoy it as much as I expected. I'm happy to have read it though, and I'd recommend it to everyone if you're looking for an interesting read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    An excellent, highly readable novel, with some interesting elements, but which suffers from a serious lack of coherence. The author, who has written a number of books on the topic, seems unable to decide how to handle the two primary sources of information: the Bible and the Talmud. This book is an interesting combination of the two, with the result that the reader may think that the author had a plan all along and was writing in a coherent way, but in fact the author made up his mind on the subject years ago, and now has to work through the material at hand, in a way that does not feel natural. I enjoyed the story of a Rabbi on one hand and a young woman on the other, who are both interested in a mysterious and forbidden love that is going around the world; on the surface, the story seems very simple and well-paced; on a deeper level, it presents a very intriguing, but ultimately disappointing view on the nature of love and the Jewish people.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently finished reading a new book, written by a young adult and published in a specialised anthology series called The Young Adult Book Club series. I enjoyed the book and, like most of the Young Adult books I have read over the years, it was well written. However, a number of issues struck me as a little odd. For instance, the main character, the narrator of the book, doesn't have a name; he is simply 'the person'. I can't say whether he was intended to be the narrator, but in any case, he's not a very good narrator. The narrator is described as 'worried and quiet', but in reality he is 'frightened and anxious' - and I'm sorry to say it, but that's a terrible combination. It's just not the narrator you want to read about the 'other side of the fence' who is just trying to get on with their life. The main character also tends to repeat himself throughout the book. He 'caught a glance of red on his skin when he looked at the sky' when he was a teenager, but it has since been described as being 'faded'. In fact, the author states that 'all the things he saw in the sky were blue', but at one point in the book he says: 'Then the sky changed to red.' I'm not sure what the point of that is, but I thought it was somewhat odd. I also don't know why the book was set in a summer camp - why couldn't it have been set in summer time in Australia? I suppose it would be easier to write about teenagers in a school setting, but then, wouldn't that have been easier for the author to write? The book was also very short. It was about 150 pages, but had an ending that was rather abrupt, so it ended rather abruptly. The character also appeared in two different places at one stage. When I finished, I thought: 'What a shame this book wasn't longer.'   The author also suffers from a tendency to repeat herself throughout the story. Here, the opening sentence of the story is 'At the bottom of the hill was a road. The road ran across the hill and it was in the middle of the road that the house stood. The house was small, the house was old, the road ran along the side of it. The roads were quiet, quiet and quiet.' But in the final chapter, the
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read all the books of   The   Mantis-men    before, and was not too surprised that it was no longer a best seller.   This is a good story with a good plot and a good ending.  In this book, we meet a young man who decides to live alone after getting married to a girl he has only had sex with in his dreams.  There are several endings and some of the other characters also have their own endings which are not a good thing.   I would recommend this book to any fan of the genre.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you read a great book, it's not just a matter of a lot of people enjoying it. It's not merely a matter with an amazing plot and an awesome character. It is a matter about a book being written by a passionate person who had a great vision for the story, who was able to translate that vision in a way that a lot a lot people would enjoy.   I can't recommend this book enough.   This is one of the best books I've read in quite some time, a thoroughly entertaining read from start to finish. I have been meaning to read a good non-fantasy fantasy book for a while now. It wasn't too difficult to find a book to read that was written by an author who also happens to be a fantasy author, and this book was the perfect choice. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. I think the concept is great, and the way the story is told gives a lot of information to the reader about what is going on. The characterizations of the characters are also well done. There are a lot more female characters than there are men, so I enjoyed having a different perspective on some of the main characters as well. I found it interesting when the author mentioned that in some countries the law prohibits girls from watching television. The story is fast-paced and full of interesting details. It was hard to put down and I enjoyed it immensely. This book was recommended to me by a fellow sci-fi/fantasy fan, but it took me a little bit to get into this book because of the language and the fact that the first half is a bit hard for me to get through. However, once I got into it, it was really good and I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Sci-Fi and Fantasy.   Recommended for fans of:   Science fiction and Fantasy

Write a positive review about a good book:    You know, I know this isn't a thing. But I feel like, as a writer, I owe it to you, the reader, to tell you what a great job you did of reading this book.   I've been trying to get this book out for a couple of weeks now, and have been waiting on this book to come out.  It took about a year for me to get the book in my hands.  I'm going to keep this short and sweet:  Once again, I got the book just in time for the Christmas break from college.  The last couple of days were pretty stressful.  And I still didn't think the book would be as good as it turned out to be.  So I waited for my copy to arrive at my apartment.  When I finally saw it at home, I had to wait till I got home from work to open it up to read.  But once I did, I was glad I got it.  Now to the review!  Let's start with my notes, because they'll be good for the next time I do reviews for this blog.  First of all, this is a story of two families:  The Caddyshack-esque family is full of women, one of whom is really, really, awesome.  Then there's the family that is a mixture of men, women, and children, all under 50 years old.  This is a family that has been around for a long time, and knows a lot of things about food, but still feels the need to try something new (at least they pretend to).  I love the fact that there's a mixture in the family, and I love how they all have different attitudes about food.  For example, the women all want to eat all the food on the plate (at this point in the story, the family has reached the stage where the men are trying to force the women to eat as much as possible, and the women are tired of it), and the kids are happy to eat the most of the food. They also do this with all foods, not just the food in front of them.  That's a good thing.  There's a lot going on with the family.  One thing I particularly love about the story is how the father's wife can't handle a job where she's working with her hands and is always in a hurry.  She wants to be able to do
Write a positive review about a good book:   It was a fun read! The main characters were not only likable but were well drawn. I would definitely recommend this book.  The story:  We were told this story by the main characters who are a boy and girl who were once siblings. They lived together in a cabin at the lake, but one night they got separated and it has been a year and a half since then. We saw the events unfold in flashbacks from the past.   The flashbacks included many of the memories they had before the incident. The main character who is a girl who lives on the lake with her brother (who's a boy) and his dog (a wolf) was the main protagonist and her character arc included her memories of the past and memories of her brother as a boy.  My biggest pet peeve about this story is that we were told that there was a guy who was the hero of this story, but there was no mention of him. So we never know what his name was or his relationship with the main character.   Overall:  It's a fun, but short read.  It has a good feel to it but the flashback flashbacks weren't as compelling as the real life events in this story.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The novel is a good read. It is a slow burning story but that is what I like about it. The plot is not the main focus of the story but I enjoyed the book. I enjoyed it a lot because I was always curious about the different characters as I was reading the book and I did feel that there is a lot more to this novel than what I think. This is one of the books that I look forward to read in the near future. Rating: 4 out of 5  Share this: Facebook  Twitter  Google  Pinterest  Tumblr  More  Print  Reddit   Email
Write a positive review about a good book:    A fantastic read for a child, but also the adults.   This book really opens your mind up and forces you to examine your beliefs.  We are constantly taught to believe what we see, not what we feel.  I have grown up in a religion that's very strict and strict about what the bible says, and I'm really glad this book challenged me to question that and look for other information about religion and the bible.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I had such a positive experience with The Cat Who Walks Through Walls that it is hard to put down even though I had a couple of rough spots.  I got this book at a special event at my local library so that it wouldn't be on a shelf behind a couple more books about dogs.   As a little cat lover, I loved this book and so I am really happy that I was able to get this book as soon as I found out it was in the library.  I hope that this book will become a favorite of cat lovers as well.  The writing was fun and entertaining, and while I didn't get all the details of the story, I got a good sense of who Alice was, what was going on around her, and the effect this had on the people around her.   I really enjoyed the end of the book and how Alice, even though she was the main character, didn't have all of the answers and wasn't sure about things.  This was a really unique way to end the story that is so fitting for Alice.  If you liked this book, please check out these great titles by the author:
Write a positive review about a good book:        I love this book.  It has so many good stories and is well written.  The stories are so interesting.   " My parents' marriage had been falling apart for years by the time I was born.  They were both very religious but had not found a good fit.   When my mom was diagnosed with cancer the week after my birth, they decided to try again.  She went to see a woman she'd known in high school named Maud, who was a Christian minister in Atlanta.  After a few weeks with her, she called her to say that she had decided not to marry Maud.   "What are you doing?", Maud asked my mom.  My mom paused, and told her that she was going to marry Jesus Christ. Maud was so surprised and so hurt.  When my parents finally did marry after a year, it was love at first sight.  My parents' first date was at a Christian church (no weddings) on a Saturday afternoon.  I think they were both nervous to do this, as they hadn't talked about religion in a long time, and were just trying to have some fun.  We went out for drinks.  Maud made my parents promise not to tell anyone, not even the wedding guests.  And not until the ceremony.  He asked to look at her, and she asked if he wanted to touch her.  Then he gave her a kiss, but she didn't seem surprised. He kissed her back, and after some more kissing, they were married.  " It wasn't a happy time.  But then we were married again."   You can't find a better love story.  If you can get your family in a similar situation, please go to the bookstore and buy this book! "The Gospel of St. Paul:  The Hidden Side of Christianity " is a new book from a Christian author, who explores the idea that Paul was a Jew who embraced Christianity as a convert to Judaism and converted to Christianity as an outcast. He was once known as the "Gospel Writer of Rome" because of his prolificacy, but this new book claims that he was actually a converted Jew who rejected Christianity.    This book offers a fascinating look at Paul, the Gospel writers and the Gospel of John and how all three of these writings are interlinked with a message to Jews and Gentiles alike.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The world is a cruel and unforgiving place.   When the evil Lord of Destruction, who has become the hero of a new horror novel, and his loyal demon companion, are fighting a horde of undead, they run into a trio of female adventurers that have no idea that a zombie horde is just a farce.  Their only hope is the human girl with a strange tattoo who's been sent to save the day.  After being saved by them, they decide to stay in a hotel, not knowing that this hotel is where the zombies come from.    The book was really fun and the story is very interesting.  It's just not a great read because there are way too many confusing plot points and the villain didn't really develop.  Also, it takes too long for the main female character to be developed and the only good thing is that the main male character is also well developed and is funny throughout the book.  This is the kind of book that you should read more than once just to make sure you know exactly what's going on. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    Good book but the book was a lot of fluff but the main character is interesting. Also good story to it.   I think I liked all the characters.   Good reading:  This was a book I would recommend. The author did a good job in creating his characters. The story was fun. I thought the ending was perfect and I loved how the author did that.   Also, when it comes to writing this book, the author does a very good job and his writing style is very simple. There was no fancy language to it in the beginning and then I felt his writing has improved and is very good. The character are all very similar to each other and to the author. Overall, I enjoyed the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was in the process of reading the books and loved every single one. I had been waiting for this book to come out for a long time and finally got it, the good thing was that the cover is so awesome, a picture of a girl on the front, and a beautiful cover, very classy. I got it on my birthday so I got the extra book. The book is amazing. The main character was very well written and I didn't feel any character development in the story, but the book is actually full of action and it doesn't feel like your reading a book, it feels like you are in a battle with the evil evil guy. The story line is good enough, I will get the 2nd book too. The only thing I would do is add some side characters like a wizard and a princess, that would give more character development and it could have been a lot better if it had more. I loved the story line and I am so glad that I read this book.   I give this a 5.5 stars
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first time I read The Art of Fiction, it was on a flight from Atlanta to San Francisco. It was a great trip, but the book's description left me a bit concerned.  The Art Of Fiction is a book about "snow" -- or the kind that can fall from the sky.  This particular snow has been a thing for many years, and it's a very specific kind of snow, made up of crystallized crystals. The snow isn't crystallized.  As I read, I came to understand that there were many types of snow -- the kinds you see in the movies.  Snow isn't just something we see in movies. The book explains why that's true.  My favorite snow is the type that's made by glaciers. The story goes that glaciers create these very thin crystals, and then ice moves over the crystals, creating very thin "slices."   Once the snow starts to melt, it leaves a very thin layer of ice that can get up to a few inches thick, depending on the glacier.  I saw this myself when we took a train from Chicago to Seattle. As we were sitting in the train, the wind blew the crystals around, creating a thick, wet snow that covered the train.  The "white" crystals we see when we are on a glacier. The Art The Art offers some great stories about different types of white snow, but I think the most fun parts of the book are the stories about the many kinds of snow made by different types ice. I loved the section on "the snow that's like a wall."   After reading a lot of snow science, I had a lot more confidence in how glaciers work than I had previously, but that section about snow crystal thickness wasn't really enough to make me confident in my understanding. So I asked a professor I know, whose main research interest is in the geology of snow, to explain it to me. I was delighted by her response: "When a snowflake falls, it's not as thick as a solid, dry wall, but rather more like a solid layer of water." A wall made of ice   Then I asked what "water" was. She told me:  "Water, in the sense we're thinking of, is actually a very small, crystalline material. If you heat up water, it becomes more solid, and if you put that in contact with a warmer rock, then it becomes even
Write a positive review about a good book:   You can help support  the  "Horn Book Club" by buying a copy of "The Horn Book of Wildlife Tracks and Signals" from Amazon.   "The horn book has been a favorite among my family since we bought it in 1989. We use the book to train our dogs when we are out on trails and the information on the book is invaluable." "I was in the Navy and had access to most of the equipment available at that time (ie, radar, radar detector, etc.). When I was younger and did not have a dog, I used to listen to my son's horn when he was playing with it to learn more about the animals around me. I was surprised to discover that this book had not been updated. I learned so much more about a great many animals, which in my opinion made it a better book than it was." "We purchased this book for our dogs' training and it's been a great help in that area! It's hard to find information on what exactly is out there on different species of animals, especially for dogs and other small animals.

Write a positive review about a good book:     A new book by a veteran of the field. I have not read much from him yet but from what I have read it seems that he is a good writer. I like his writing style, not too formal and with good prose and thoughtfulness. The story lines were well thought out and well put together. A lot of thought has gone into the design of the books so they feel like a well polished book. I love the fact that there is no introduction like a typical blurb that just says "This book contains...", this makes the text seem more alive and interesting. I was a bit sad about the length, but then I understand that they are working on a second edition. I am definitely looking forward to reading the second edition, although I am quite a bit away.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a big fan of this book. As with all of H.P. Lovecraft's books, this one has many elements that make it worthy of his place in Lovecraft's literary pantheon. Lovecraft wrote an amazing tale that is at the same time funny, sad, and strange. It's a great blend. One thing I do not like, is that the book feels long. Not long as in the number of pages, but as in length as in a length to keep in your head and make you want more. The book is just short enough to be a great read, but not so short as to seem like a slog. The characters are the best part of this story and it's fun to see the different characters in the story as well as some new characters. I would recommend this book to a Lovecraft lover as well, as it's a really nice read.

I really enjoyed the ending.   a lot of people have praised this story and I think it deserves all the praise it has received. The characters were well written and I really liked a lot about them. I do wish that the author would have taken a bit more time to flesh out the characters and I would have enjoyed a bit less of a mystery plot. But overall, I really did enjoy this series. I can't wait to see where this series goes. This is a great read for any fans of mystery fiction, and those looking for something different than your standard whodunnit or romance." - L. S.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought The Art of the Deal in January of this year for my birthday. I've been wanting to read the book for a while. I was surprised that I was excited to read this book. I thought that it would be the first book I was going to read from The Art Of The Deal. Unfortunately, it is not. I would rate it much lower. However, if you like business, this book is worth reading. The book has all the right parts in it. There is a lot to like about the book and it was enjoyable for the most part. The author has the same good writing style as Trump. Although I would have liked to see more on some of the people that he works with. I think he could have done more with this book to show how his life is like. His personal life is much more fascinating than the business world.
Write a positive review about a good book:    You must write a positive book review if:    You found the book interesting and enjoyable.     If you are looking for a book to read this summer, and you are on the fence about whether you should read it, then read it.  If you are in a rush to get it out to the world, it's probably not worth your time.  If you like the book, you can read it again and again.  You will not only enjoy the reading experience but you'll also think about why it is that people enjoy reading about the people in their lives.  I think the reason that so many people read so many books is that reading about people can bring them closer to them.  It can make them think about things that they might have missed.  It's one of the reasons that so much of my work revolves around relationships, especially when people write about the history of relationships.  There are many ways to enjoy this book.  This is a great book that will help people learn about some of the lesser-known women in history.  As a woman who is trying to learn more about her family's past, this was the perfect book for me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I like this book and am glad to have purchased it. I liked the story very much and enjoyed reading about it. The author's use of different characters and settings, even if not as well developed, was enjoyable.   Thank you for this book.  I enjoyed reading this book by David Weber. This is a nice story for a family, although it is a little repetitive. I do like the way he gives the families an in depth look at their background and history. I also liked the fact that they have to deal with a new child and then go back into the past, as well as the way they deal with that. The way the families interact with each other was really nice to read about. As far as a young adult book, I am sure that there is more to come. 
Write a positive review about a good book:     "An easy-to-read account of a long and fascinating life." (Penguin Books New Review) "Granville Sharp, a Canadian journalist, has written a book about his life that is well researched and well told. It is a very good portrait of a man who never forgets where he came from and the challenges that face those with disabilities." (Publishers Weekly) "A vivid and highly entertaining portrait of Canada's largest and most complex social issue." (Library Journal) "With vivid detail of Sharp's early years in a boarding school and his years in the Canadian military, his travels to Africa, Australia and the United States to cover major stories for The Globe and Mail, the challenges he faced to get out of poverty to write, and his rise to a senior editor in the Globe and his work on disabilities, this book will be a source of pleasure and education for anyone interested in Canadian life from the 18th century to the present." (Rochester Review of Books) "Sharp's fascinating and important book illuminates Canada's complex history and reveals the many facets of its society, from its founding in the 17th century, through the 19th and 20th centuries, to the modern day." (National Post) "One of the most important books on this topic I have read." (Toronto Star) "An extraordinary book." (The Star)
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book. It is the first I have read that actually makes a case for atheism.   In my first year of college, I found myself unable to think that there were gods, because there seemed to be no evidence for such a claim.  In the subsequent two years, I came to the conclusion that the lack of evidence did not invalidate the existence of the gods. In my fourth year, I discovered the evidence for the existence of a creator God.  But even though I now believe in the god hypothesis, I still don't believe that there is evidence that there are no gods.  I think the evidence we have so far suggests a fairly small universe, and that a creator cannot be located in the universe, but not that there's no evidence.  It is true that our limited understanding of the universe and the fact that we have a body makes us unable to make the claim that the universe is without designer. The existence of evidence for gods does not mean the existence  of gods. I think it is possible that one of the things that we know about the universe may change as we learn more. I was recently reading a good science fiction novel about aliens who are similar to us and are similar in our technology. They are far more advanced than us, and are very technologically advanced. There is a lot of speculation about what they are like.  I would argue that these aliens have built much better technology than we, and would have the ability to build even more advanced technology than us. Even though these aliens are far too advanced to be our ancestors, it seems likely that they may be the ancestors of us.  What would have to happen for us to not exist?   What happens if an alien species is technologically far more technologically advanced than we are? If we ever do meet aliens, it is likely that it will be in a galaxy that we share and that has the same properties as the Milky Way galaxy. If an alien planet is near to us, we will be exposed to the same radiation that the planet is. How long would it take for these aliens to develop the same technology as we have? How long until there is a point at which it would be more efficient for them to develop our technology than for us? What if we only had a fraction of our scientific and technical capabilities?   What happens to us in a universe where we have no technological advantage over other civilizations? If the gods in the book are gods of this

Write a positive review about a good book:    It is hard to find books of a high standard in the mainstream bookshelf.   The reason is, they are very popular with the readers, but also with the publishers.  Some of them are good;  some of them  not  good;   some are bad.  So I decided to get the book and review it.  I had a quick read,  found the book useful;  thought that it is a good read.  It is not only useful for the readers.  Its very interesting, and gives a good overview of the history of science.  However, the book is not very good in any other aspect.  Most of the chapters are very vague.    Many of the information is based on secondary sources, but the information can be of little help to the reader.  For instance, if one wants to know the history and geography of the earth, they should use primary source.  If one wants scientific information about the sun, or other stars, then they should do research with a primary source, or go to the internet.  Even if one has a good education, its difficult to do research on the internet, because it is not easy to find good information on the subject.  (This is how I did not know about stars, until I got this book).   I am not against books with very little information.  The fact that this book is only a summary of the main facts, makes it not very useful for someone who wants to learn science, or has a background in science.
Write a positive review about a good book:    One word:  Amazing   My first read of the "Shattered World" trilogy, I didn't think I'd like the books, but I had to give it a try.   The world-building is beautiful, and the characters are very believable.  But, I have to admit that I was expecting more from a fantasy that, while it does take place in a fantasy world, is not one you'd expect to have magic as a main feature.  In addition to a very different magic system, this series is quite different in tone than most of fantasy.  As a good fantasy series should be, I was disappointed by the story.  It was a good story, but it was not as good as the first book in the series, which was excellent.  If you like fantasy, you may like the book.  However, if you want to read something different, you'd be better off going with the second book, which is the best in the trilogy.
Write a positive review about a good book:     4/5 Stars by Michael Azzarello and Eduardo Risso (2014)  This is the second time I've read this book; I've reviewed it previously.   As I stated above, the story is amazing!   This is one of the best books I have read in years! This book is very good. The world building is excellent; you'll be on the edge of your seat as you follow the various people and events as they occur. The characters were interesting and developed well. They are not your usual characters that you read about in fantasy.  There was a lot of drama in this book, and the ending left a bad taste in my mouth. I liked the book, but I think I will not be picking up another Riswell book; it's been awhile since I have gone back and read his books.  6/5 stars by Elizabeth Bear (2003)

Thackeray's novels published. If you are interested in reading another J. B. Thistleires book, I suggest you go and buy "The Black Knight's War" (available on Amazon and other book retailers). It's a fun read and I'm sure I'll read it again, but this one seems like the one that will stay with me. Thanks again for a fun book!
Write a positive review about a good book:   ...I can't think of anything more disappointing than receiving a book in the mail that has nothing good to say about it. I will admit that I haven't read most of the books I received, but I'm still holding out hope that there will be some good ones in there, but so far, not a single good one from the people I receive.   "In my opinion, the worst part of the holiday shopping season is trying to find a gift that will satisfy all the family members, but won't cause all the problems that come with it, which is what happened to me for Christmas this year.  I just found myself in the situation of having to spend a ridiculous amount of money on gifts (at least a $500 value) that will never be able to please everybody."   -Gail A.  (Read full review)  What is the best book for you?   How do you know which book is the right one for you to read?  This was an amazing book! It was my first introduction to the world of paranormal investigation and it blew me away.  I have been searching for a book that would explain the different methods I have used to uncover paranormal activity.  I found the author's explanation of them to be very informative and well laid out.  The book has made a large difference in my life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is quite interesting and very well written. I enjoyed the characters and the story so much I purchased the audiobook.    Review:  I have read through all the reviews and I will be giving this book 3 stars instead of a 4 because of how it ends. So what if he is not a knight at all, what if his mother dies leaving him and his sister as orphans. The world doesn't make sense at all and I have so many questions that I want to know about, but the main story doesn't really have the depth I wanted in my life. But then, I don't have the time, the reading experience, or the money for a good fiction novel.  Overall Rating:  The story is really good but the ending was really weird.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The author is quite nice. He did a great job with the story and has made a very interesting book. I have not read any others that have a more realistic depiction of what it's like to be a man in the military.   The book also was very good. I liked the fact that I was reading about a normal life with a normal family. I also liked the ending a lot. It really made me wish I'd have gotten to finish it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    You are correct, the only reason the author's name isn't "Huxley" is the fact that his first published work was " Brave New World ", while his most popular and influential work is " Bravely  . I can only conclude that a small number of people in a large organization that publishes books in an attempt to sell more books to the same set of publishers. This is the same as the "polar bears don't swim with the sharks" group. The first book in the list, " Brave NEW WORLD ", is a terrible, awful book, an utter mess, and a complete failure. The second book, " THE WINDS OF WINTER ", which I read in English with some success after my school days, was a good and enjoyable book. It didn't completely ruin my reading, but it did have it's share of failings. I am sorry that it has been made clear that this book was a failure in that the author is incompetent. The author has a very small and insular world view. He thinks that "people" are all like this: The whole point of the world-view is that it's true for everybody but it's not true for "me". It's a view of humanity that is a failure. I have to go along with that view and accept that I'm special, I'm better than other people, I have some sort of super power, but so what? There's plenty of time to get along with other people but "you're special", "you get better" doesn't mean you should go around doing whatever you want. That's the whole point. You have to keep in mind that other people are just like you. I guess there is some merit in this view in the abstract, but in the concrete, it's just plain bad. I'm just a dumb old man, who needs a lot of help with basic life stuff. So my view of life is: "Life is what happens to other people." A better view is: Life is what you do with what you've been given. You are what you think about life. People are what other people do to you, not what other peoples do to themselves. If I can get past the silly belief in specialness, I can make the case that he's an intelligent man, and that he was smart enough to make a pretty bad idea into a pretty good idea.

I think she has a lot to add to the world of fantasy, and I'm looking forward to reading her next book!"   "I really like how this series has taken some common fantasy tropes, and expanded on them and made them unique to the people in the story. This is one of the best series I have ever read and has really taken my interest into the world.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a very good book. The illustrations are great. The author does a fantastic job of developing the characters with a unique story.   It's really hard for me to explain just how much I loved this book.  I loved all of the characters.  Each of them had their own special qualities and it was fun to learn about them.  In particular, I really enjoyed the story of Zara and what it was like to go through her experience of being adopted.  The descriptions of a child with special needs and learning how to live with that made me so happy.  Another character that stood out to me was Ben. His experiences with Zara, being adopted and the different people that were going through the same things as he were really great to learn.  Zara's mother, her dad and other adults in the story really stood out and I felt like I was really learning about the people who came before her as well.  I thought this story was really interesting and well done, I think it would be an excellent addition to any parent's library.

I like the Kindle's ease of use and portability. I use my Kindle to read books I own on Amazon (Kindle Unlimited), as well as many free ebooks. I've been looking for a portable digital reading device for a while now, and this is it. I read a lot of books, and with the Kindle, I can download them as ebooks and read them at the same time without needing to reread anything. For a portable device, this device is very solid and easy to use. The only complaint I have is that there's no back button on the Kindle. The back button would be better placed on the screen. Also, I've found that the screen is a little brighter than I would like it to be.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this on my Kindle, and although it's not in the same league as the King's stories, I think it's good fun! It's got the same kind of weird-but-lovable characters and a fun mix of genre.

Write a positive review about a good book:    *   I really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading the next ones in the series. It was a good introduction to the world and the characters.   It is very fast paced, as one of the main characters, Jef, goes on the run.  His wife is with him and he has to escape before he is discovered. I liked how his wife was on the way to a meeting and how he had to sneak on the bus to get away.  As we learn more about his new past, we also learn about a man named Robert, who Jef met on the road and then later married.  We also learn that Jef has been traveling all over the world for several years now, and when he is caught he goes back to his hometown to meet with his former girlfriend and learn that the two of them are about to have their first child.  I loved the writing in this book. The author wrote a good story with good characters and an interesting story line.  There was also a couple of characters I found somewhat annoying.  * I found the plot to be somewhat confusing to follow at times.  Some things were left open ended which I thought was a bit strange.  My only beef about the book was that I felt that the ending was rushed in a way that didn't really go with the overall story. I don't think it was quite as good as the last book but I thought the ending just felt rushed.

I really enjoyed this book. I was really entertained throughout. It was a very enjoyable read. The characters were a great mix of smart, silly, and interesting. There was a great deal of humor and action that made for a lot of interesting reading. I think that many readers will enjoy this book, it's very much worth the read. - Laura I really liked this book so much that I can't put it down. It got so much right about relationships and life.

It is a book that you need to pick up and read immediately! - Emily I really want to read this again as I enjoyed it a lot. - Joanne A. This book is so perfect! It's the story about a boy who is a tomboy, and that's how he's always going to be, it doesn't change anything about him. And a girl who's always thinking of herself as an outsider but just wants to fit in. It feels true to life, and yet it's also so funny, and relatable to me! - Tania I really enjoy this one! It was funny and it was very different from the rest. I don't think it's fair to compare it to another book or to another author. It has it's own unique personality, which I don the book. - Janie I really loved this book because it was funny. I also like the characters. The main character's dad was one of the most hilarious characters. There's also a great little twist at the end that I really appreciated. - Julie A. I liked it a great many times. It wasn't just about one boy and one girl, they have their own friendships and family, just like anyone else. I found this book to be very funny, just great all around! - Nicole This was great. I love the way the characters and the story progressed. - Heather It was great to read about two young teens who have different interests, and their relationships. It doesn't mean that they are gay or anything, it just makes it feel real, it makes sense and it's actually so relatable. They are fun to write too. - Marissa

Write a positive review about a good book:    Thank you for such an interesting and enjoyable read.   It had me asking "How did they make the story interesting?"   The answer, well, they didn't make the book interesting - the book made the story.  I'd recommend this book to my friends who like sci-fi or speculative fiction - especially those with an interest in the history of the occult.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A book like this is perfect because it brings the best and most interesting ideas of quantum mechanics to life for us, the readers.   The science in the book is solid.  At the same time, this book is filled with fun, and witty jokes.  The illustrations are amazing and add to the enjoyment of the book.  The book is full of information about the physics, and has a funny and funny tone.  I highly recommend this book!   I think it's a wonderful book. The physics are explained in great detail and there are a lot of fun anecdotes, mostly about people in physics and people in the real world. The book is also fun to read and funny.   This is a very good book that makes the topic of quantum physics a bit more interesting.  A fun book about quantum mechanics.  One of the highlights of the volume was its discussion of one of the most famous experiments of quantum theory: the Bell test.  From the description in the Introduction:  "The Bell test is one of those remarkable examples of the use of quantum principles to test fundamental predictions of quantum electrodynamics, yet the theory behind it is rather obscure."  I found that description very insightful.  It's one of my favorite stories about the usefulness of quantum theories to test theoretical predictions!  You can read the reviews in the next section, but I'd also like to mention that my review was a copy of the hardback version (I think the paperback edition will be out soon).   I'm pleased that this book does not include some of the "novelty" physics in the previous editions.  So, there is a bit of a down side to this volume, but this is a good volume nonetheless. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    When I was a student at the Royal Academy of Art, I was taught to look to art historians as the most reliable source of facts about the past. My teachers often told me that the study of art was more likely to give me a 'feeling' for the past, and therefore a more authentic 'picture' of what it was like. I believed them for a long time. But the fact remains that art historians can never be regarded as objective experts in the study or interpretation of art, and it is therefore a serious mistake to regard their work as representative of the real picture of a culture.  
Write a positive review about a good book:     You have got this book, and I'm happy that I bought it. It was a great read, especially the last third of the book, which brought me to tears. My favorite is the last chapter (which I recommend everyone read), in which they go to Canada to visit their cousins. It's a great story of family ties, but at the same time, it's a story of loneliness and loss. It reminds me of the famous quote: "All that glitters is not gold, all that glimmers is not the sun." The end of the story reminded me of that one line from the book and I felt as if this book had gotten me through some rough times in my life. This was a very well written book that I would highly recommend. It will be one of my favorites from the summer.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I don't usually read fiction, but I have to admit that "The Last King of Osten Ard" by Robert Jordan was a very enjoyable read. The story of Elayne Trakand, the last king of Oren, was excellent. The characters were intriguing and the book made you want to find out what happened to Elayne in the past. Jordan is one of my favorite authors and his "A Song of Ice and Fire" books are probably the most popular among fantasy fans.

(5/5)    A very enjoyable historical novel that will keep you on your toes and interested for a very long time.   (5/6)  The only thing I don't like about this is the ending. I like the ending for the most part, but that final cliff hanger can't help but make me sad.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a big fan of the book, as a first novel and with that in mind I can't help but feel this is a good enough read to get the full experience out of. It's a short novel, but if you can give it the time it deserves then you'll come away with an interesting, engrossing read. If you're expecting a high stakes epic then this isn't for you, but it's very well written and the writing style does a fine job at creating a compelling atmosphere. The novel was well written with a lot of thought and it's not like a newbie to fantasy would be lost in this tale, this book is actually a good example of an epic fantasy that goes along well with the genre, though it's still not one that I would put on my'must read' list. This is the kind of book that can make you reconsider your favorite genre and pick up another and keep reading to get your full experience, but one thing it does do is make you go back and try the old favorites, and I can recommend this book to anybody looking for something with a great story, but also with a good plot and an interesting world.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book and the series. I have a feeling that I will continue to read more books in the series, and I look forward to seeing more scenes from different points in the story, in which the characters are forced to deal with other people's problems. The main characters also have a lot of emotional weight to them (at least they should.)

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've only read about three of these and had very positive experience with each.   Each book was different, I think I found the author to be rather interesting.  This may be my second book but I think this one is the best.  I have been reading a lot of non-fiction lately, so this is a great resource.  Highly recommended, thanks for the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    Like this book so much that it has taken me the best part of a month to finish it. My only quibble is that the book is so short, that I had trouble keeping up with the whole story, even though I have a pretty good memory. I also found that it had a tendency to be too long, especially towards the end.   Overall, this book has made me want to read more books by the author and has been a great way to stay up to date with the world.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you have a passion for fiction, you'll find lots to enjoy in this collection of books that offer interesting and varied stories of a variety of genres and eras. There is lots to do with all of them and lots of opportunities for the reader to grow to like all the characters. The books are very well done and I would recommend them. 5 stars (out of 5)   1. The King's Game by John Scalzi:   An interesting read about a government organization that wants to get into the business of mind control and mind control technology.  2. The Long Sleep by C.J. Cherryh:  The plot is very unique. It focuses on a group of people who are genetically engineered by the government as part of a military program to be killers. They all have some form of genetic deficiency that causes them to be slow and more vulnerable to their own actions and other people's.   3. The Shadow Campaigns by John C. Wright:   A collection of four short stories that explore a variety different scenarios, but all of which have a lot of thematic similarity.  It feels like a combination of "Warden of the Stream," "Moby Dick," and "Tower of Guns" in terms of setting and themes.  The Shadow warps and folds across three distinct time periods, but the main theme is of conflict and survival.  A great read for a short period. 5.0 stars (5)

Write a positive review about a good book:    My second novel, the first was about an alien called Alistair, and this one is about his family. He's a smart child and he has a good heart, but is he really the type to become a warrior? That's the question. He does, however, try and fit in with the people around him, and it's a small thing that makes a big difference.       Read at your own risk.  My third novel, " A Matter of Time " is about the future of the human race.  It's a post-apocalyptic novel but it's not set in the past. The book takes place on the planet called Zetar, which is a huge spaceship which was crashed, but then rebuilt, and there is a new alien life form, the Kothar, on the ship, as well as humans.  The Kothars have been on Zetars for thousands of years, but their population is dwindling as their food source is disappearing.  At the end of the book, Zetarr is in the middle of a battle with a new enemy, the "Vikarian" - they're a new race with weapons which are so dangerous, it's unknown what they will do.    Posted by David S. at 1:00 PM
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found the information in this book very interesting and useful. It was well presented. I believe it could also be used in the classroom as a resource in terms of creating a positive self image in the children and parents of our children.  The book is well illustrated with a wealth of photos and descriptions of the places and scenes in which the children learn about history.   The author's style is descriptive and informative without being "tough on the teacher."   My only complaint about this book is that the author did not present the information on history in the proper order, although this could be a deliberate choice as the information comes at the end of the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was great, I can't believe it took me so long to read it. The first book I read in this series, the first I bought from a shop, is my favorite book in the series and has influenced my writing style for the longest time. I loved the world-building of this book and all the various characters. I also love the way the author does things in a way that doesn't seem too cliche or over-the-top, but still keeps the reader interested and entertained. It's an easy read but full of action, suspense and action and adventure. The characters are well fleshed out, the world is not over-exaggerated, the pacing is great and the ending leaves you wanting more. Recommended.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good novel, but the author's style is not very good.   (I think this is what a book reviewer is supposed to be good at.)   He is very, very funny sometimes, but if he were to just be funny, then the whole novel would be just jokes.  The main character is a "bounty hunter", who travels in a big black pickup truck with an enormous "giant" cannon in the front.  They have to escape a bounty hunter.  He has an interesting plot.  In a way the story does not work as the author wanted it to be.  At least I hope that the story will be made as well and better than it was.  (This is not saying that I think that the "bounties" are "bad", but I think there are several flaws with the way that the bounty hunters interact and the bounty hunter's relationship with the people he meets, the plot is pretty weak for the most part.)  Overall I like the novel.  It is not bad, but just not the best that he could have done in the novel he wrote.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My new favorite book is The Book of Baskervilles by the late Arthur Conan Doyle.   It tells the story of the legendary treasure hunting of the 17th century, and the adventures that happened as they worked their way through it. It was a wonderful story about being a treasure hunter, and I loved the characters involved.  I have the only copy (in an old hardback) of it, and enjoyed it so much I bought the paperback.  I'm not sure how long it will take to read The Book and Baskerville, but it's definitely worth the wait!   Read the review.

We look forward to our next visit to your store.   Review of:  Life is Full of Goodbyes - by Susan D. Williams (Author) Date Added:  I love the concept of this book. I'm glad that I'm getting a book on the topic of death and bereavement. It gives me an understanding about the death process that I didn't know before!   This book also gave me a sense of sadness as I realized how much I miss the person that I was before the funeral. When I read this book I felt that I have moved on with my life and the person I was never even close to being again.  It makes me so sad that I did not get to meet the person who had died, who would have loved me, who I can still call a friend, but would have never been the same. It was a very tough chapter for me to read, and I felt as though I was just going through the motions of grieving, knowing that my friend was not in that much pain and that I could comfort her. As I was reading this book, I was wondering if my friend had taken her own life.   Life is Full Of Goodbyings is written from the point of view of the bereaved. It's a book that doesn't make it seem like your life is a mess, that there are so many things that could have been done better or that someone could have stopped the pain or helped her. It is simply a good time to reflect on how life can go so wrong.  the author gives you insight on the death of loved one. It didn't hurt me too much but made me reflect on my life. Thank you Susan. :)  : : : :

Write a positive review about a good book:   The first half of this book is an enjoyable read. The main characters of John, a writer and his wife Anne, are not well liked by their daughter. The daughter has a brother named Sam who is an author and also very talented at playing the guitar, and John is having problems with his wife over a disagreement about a new song that Sam wrote. The problem is that John is only allowed to hear Sam's songs and has been in love with his mother. John is not happy with the fact that his wife only listens to Sam. He does not want his daughter to become like his wife and he has tried everything to make Anne understand his point of view. Anne does not appreciate John's point of views and wants John to stop talking about Sam's work. But John wants his daughter and Sam to work on the same project but Anne is having a hard time accepting Sam's way of doing things.   As the book progresses the problems of John and Anne grow and Anne grows to have a soft spot for Sam. The book also has a nice scene of the daughter and John working on a song together, with John singing as the son and Anne singing as Sam.  ,,,,   Overall:  The first half was enjoyable. It had a nice story and it has a good protagonist. The second half is a little disappointing. While the first half did a good job with the story, the second half did not. It lacked the emotional scenes needed to get the characters to develop and the scenes where the story focused on a family of people was a little too overused.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The most successful author of the modern era - by a long way - is Jonathan Franzen.   For every novel with the "great" premise - such as The Corrections (which in the end was a very good novel), or Purity, which has the right amount of romance for a middle-grade book and has been a very popular children's book for a while - there's an equally good novel (such as The Dispossessed or The Corrections ), a novel that could have been much better (such a novel would be Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser or The Thousand and One Nights ) or even a bad book that could be good (such an novel would  be  The Corrections ). Franzen does a good job with a lot of his novels, including this one.  He writes with style and with verve, the characters are very well developed and you can't help but sympathize with the characters as you read their stories.  The characters in this book are not fully developed but you can tell that they'll be in future books and even though they're not fully established yet they'll grow as the story goes on. The story itself is great, it's not perfect and has a number of problems, but it's well written and Franzen's writing is a real talent. The characters are well developed, the writing is not overly complicated and it's a fun book.  Franzen has had a lot to say about the state of literary culture (in America at least) and we'll discuss his thoughts a little further in my next post.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "A unique and insightful, highly entertaining and thought-provoking journey." - Book Review "This is one of the most thought- provoking novels I have ever read... the story is brilliant and thought provoking." - Review by David Hargreaves "In The Secret World, there is a story that can be told about a group of people living on the other side of the planet, who, while they have to hide their powers, are very much in the same world. It's not a very well developed story, but there is something to it. It feels a bit like a science fiction version of the Twilight Zone, and that's a very nice touch, if a bit too derivative of some of those tropes." - Paul M. Crabtree "A truly original tale which is far removed from many genre tropes, and is well-written enough to be enjoyable on its own merits." - Kalev Lathrop (New York Times bestselling author of The Lost City of Z) "I loved this novel. I had never read anything with a science-fictional bent as interesting and as compelling as this novel, and had the pleasure of learning some new things about my ancestors that I had missed in all my other research." - Jeff Hulett (author of The New Earth, winner of the Locus Award for Best Novella) "If you're a reader interested in the future, in the kind of worlds that science fiction writers imagine and the kind that science-fiction readers have already seen and imagined, then this is a must-read... a true page-turner. [A] stunning story." - Dan Wells (author and co-creator of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine) "Hesitates a bit on the technology in this book, as this is set in a future in which the aliens have advanced beyond us, but still manages to be captivating in its vision of the future. It is as much about the way the society sees itself as it is about what is actually going on. It also does an excellent job of weaving together the different characters and relationships throughout. A novel to keep the mind working." - Steven Kenson (author/illustrator of many science fiction and fantasy novels) "There's something very compelling about a well-worn world with no apparent future - the secrets are kept within the hearts of the people. And The Secret Earth shows that even the secrets that are kept are not necessarily the secrets of the past."
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love a good comedy. This book is a little dry, though I think the funniest joke is when a child asks, "Dad, do we have to put butter in the coffee because we're going to be here all day?" "Yes," is the response. 4.6 stars (out of 5) I am a fan of all things humor, so I am not surprised to find humor in a book about a very serious topic. The humor is in a few places, and there are times when I felt the book was missing something. I also don't think that a book on "gum disease" should be light and breezy, but then I am probably just as surprised to see humor in the book as anyone. It is a funny book. You'll laugh. You will think. You may even make a few references to the humor.  The humor comes in a lot of different forms. It includes: a little bit of self-deprecating humor (the "I can't stand the sound of my own voice," "I should go to therapy" joke); an out of the ordinary story that may make you laugh, but is also somewhat depressing; a story that has a character that is "so funny I don't want to read about him" (the story about the guy who can't sleep), and then another guy who's so hilarious he just can't wait to tell it to you (the one where the guy takes a shower and finds his wife's dead body and his best friend in the bed next to her; "Oh my god, that was so funny!" he says, thinking that his best friends is "such a loser").  So yes, I liked this one, though it was a bit dry for me.

Write a positive review about a good book:    - 4.5 out of 5     I bought this because I didn't want to bother with reading about the same topics over and over.   I enjoyed reading this book so much I ordered a second copy!   I am glad I finally read this!  The book takes place in the early 1900s in the village of Rens, Germany.  As part of my history class, I had to review a book by a person who lived in that area.  A friend recommended this book.  The main character is an author named Joseph W. Burdett, and I found this to be a fascinating story.  Burdet's family has a history in farming in the Rens area, which is now part of France.  At the end of the 20th Century the family was running out of farmland.   So, in 1919, Joseph Burdetts decided to go to Paris in order to get more land.  But, the family had to take two young children with them, and a small wagon.   The only person that the family could trust was a German woman, who had been kidnapped from her own farm and forced to work in a bakery.  That woman is the author of this book, and she has a very bad reputation with the townspeople, who think she is crazy and try to take her children away.   Joseph Burtts family is very resourceful, as they find the money and get a large farm.   I highly recommend this book!    I also like that it is written in third person. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must read for any science fiction fan. As far as I know this is the first time a science fiction book has been published in translation and I don't think it was ever available before. I read the original French edition first but I couldn't get over how much detail and character development was included in this translation.   There are also several excellent drawings by Jean-Claude Mézières.     In conclusion:  This has become one of my favorite science fiction books and this is a very readable translation of the first novel in the series,   which is something that I find hard to come by for a translator like   Le Guen.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good fantasy novel with a fun, non-fiddly plot. The author has great world building skills and we get a good sense of a magical world. The magic system is simple, but it works well enough in that regard. The characters are well-developed, though some have little depth (such as the villain), and some are less so.   I enjoyed the humor of the book. I didn't laugh out loud, but I laughed a few times and it was funny to watch.  A book worth reading:  I like a lot of different fantasy books, and this one has a fun plot, good world building, a compelling character and the ending is satisfying.

Write a positive review about a good book:   My son is getting a B.S. in physics from CalTech. He is not a good writer. He only got a C. I found the book very interesting. I will read other books by the author to help him make up for the shortcomings of this one. I liked the pictures. It was a good buy. I hope that he will get a decent B.A. in astronomy.  Review of the book: As an astrophysicist and a member of the AAS, I am very grateful to this author for providing such an insightful review and I do applaud the author's interest in his subject matter. I have read many books on astrophysics and many books by people who are less than interested in astrophysics. I don't think any of those books are as interesting as this book. I highly recommend the book to all people interested in the subject. The writing style is clear, but not as "elegant" as it could have been, but it certainly is readable and I would recommend it to all. As to the pictures, the author does a good job with the descriptive photographs. I'm sure some people will not like the pictures because the author doesn't use the same scientific language as the astrophysicists, but that is what makes this book so enjoyable. It is very unfortunate that the author has not been able to continue the work because he has a real passion for this subject. He could very easily have been a great astrophysician had he stayed at CalTech, and it would have been interesting to see his work there. I don't know that it would be possible to get much further along in the development of the concept than the author achieved in this book, but the reader will be able to tell what the author was working on in his spare time after reading the book, and what might be done by other scientists for better understanding of these galaxies.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is so fascinating to read. It is just as complex as the subject. Very nice, very concise.   It is a great reference and should be in every library in the world!  I just bought it and I am very interested to see where this book will take us in the future.   The authors clearly have done their homework, and have taken a great amount of effort to present the issues and the literature in such a way as to be easily accessible, accessible, approachable and yet interesting enough to keep your interest until the end of the book.    All of the reviews have been so kind and I hope the reviewers who aren't convinced will at least go out of their way to find this to their satisfaction.  I have a copy of this book and it's great, it makes me want to explore a little more. I hope this book inspires the authors to keep publishing.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was going to read this book, but then I realized that it's really just a collection of one-shots, with no apparent story arc, and so I ended up throwing it into a drawer. The plot seems like it could be good, but I guess it's just going to be there because that's how short stories are. I'll keep reading to see what happens, and see how the characters handle it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fantastic book which shows the dangers of getting bogged down in minutia and becoming overwhelmed by too much to accomplish.    It has a wealth of information about various things ranging from the physical and emotional stresses of working in a large organization to the emotional and psychological challenges which come with growing older.  This book covers everything a person should know but still be interested in!   If you do not have a lot of time this book will fill the gap.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "If you are a science fiction reader, don't be fooled by the title. It's not about an alien invasion. It is about the alien invasion that never happened.   The aliens are called the Skaikru and it is the late 20th century. The Skaia is the source of the power of the Skru, so it is natural that their planet of Earth would be a source of power for the Skra, too. The book covers a wide variety of Skaian stories as it relates to the origins of the aliens and their planet.

Write a positive review about a good book:    In my opinion, the story is awesome and well told. I loved the introduction and the overall message and how it was written. The main character was an interesting main character as well as the two supporting characters, the two that are actually shown.

Write a positive review about a good book:    * I've been meaning to start a "Reviews for Everyone" series, but I never got around to doing so.   Anyway, I just got through reading a really good book called The Art of Living (written by my friend Jodi Picoult and illustrated by Peter Schjeldahl) and this is the first in what will hopefully be a series.  I really enjoyed the book, I thought Jodi was a really nice, funny, insightful writer.  It was a good mix of philosophy and practical advice in a way that felt approachable.  The book was well-organized, with both long and short sections at the end of each chapter.  Jodi's writing was beautiful and she clearly has a great deal of knowledge about psychology and art and her ability to communicate that to an easy to understand reader is remarkable.  One of the first places I looked for information about this was a website called www.neurotribes.com . I learned a lot about her personal history, her childhood, how she came to be interested in the arts, and how she became an artist.  From what I've read about her, she is a talented woman who I think will do very well for herself as an artist if she is able to take advantage of the many opportunities available in that field.   She has an amazing gift for getting to the heart of a topic and using that to create beautiful images.  In addition to her books, she also did an incredible amount of work on the site, which was very well done.  And a great resource for finding more of her work is the website www.jodipicoult.com.  A few more things to add about her work: 1. There was a great interview on Salon, with Sarah Jaffe, one of the editors and writers of this blog. 2. The Art Of Living, especially the chapters about art and spirituality, was very, very helpful in helping me understand the connections I had with my past. 3. The book also helped me realize the importance of cultivating a healthy sense of self, one that is independent and unencumbered, and the responsibility of not taking things too seriously, especially in my life.  So many people I know are so caught up in the world, trying to find the balance between work and home, relationships, and other pursuits that it's easy to give in to self-destructive behaviors. 4. My parents are wonderful, and

Write a positive review about a good book:    Read and reviewed with care by me. " The Secret Life of Bees is an outstanding book on a topic of great interest: the relationship between humans and other species of insects. I found it an informative, entertaining, and enlightening book about the nature of social insects, and the many important issues that affect the survival of both species and ecosystems. As someone with no scientific background, the author, an entomologist, made for a delightful read. I highly recommend this book, if for no other reason than the author's enthusiasm for entomology and the topic. I will eagerly await the next book in this series."  --Charles R. Schulz, Ph.D. (Emeritus), University of Kansas "Dr. DeMeester has done a superb job of describing and explaining the many fascinating aspects of these fascinating insects.

Write a positive review about a good book:    * * *   My first book by Eileen Sheehan is an unusual read for my tastes. It's about the time after the Holocaust when some of the survivors were released from prisons and were forced to flee the country. They were forced by the Nazis to become doctors, teachers and so on. Some of them were able to bring their families to the USA. I've never read about the Holocaust in this way before, not so much because I don't like the subject, but more because I've always had this feeling that we can learn from and appreciate stories of survival, and it was interesting to read how the experiences of the Nazis, as well as the other survivors, affected people after the war. And it is very well written and I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in this subject.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had a great time with this. I had a lot of fun playing it and enjoyed reading it. I enjoyed the writing style as well as how it was not heavy on the romance, but made up for it by how good the plot is. The characters were fun to read about, and the plot did a great job of keeping things interesting. The book is pretty well thought out and doesn't just jump around from place to place. It's a book I definitely recommend if you enjoy a good romance. Overall, I'm quite impressed by this book. It got a 4 out of 5 rating from me and I really think you should try it out. I like how the story is tied into the book, and this makes it a great choice if you have just read the book. My only complaints about the book are that I'm not sure if the ending is the best one out there. Also, I do feel that there were some more plot holes than what I saw on the cover, as well a little too much of the romance is focused on a guy, but that's probably due to me not having read the rest of the series.

Write a positive review about a good book:         I am a huge fan of Peter V. Brett's books, so when the time came for him to adapt the King Arthur mythos for the screen he chose to do something new.  I have no idea what the story is about as I haven't read it, but as a movie I love that it combines the best of King and Brett, and the best part about this book is the way the film handles the source material.   The movie is just wonderful.  The only thing I didn't like about it was that the King was not shown at all.  When Arthur is about to die, the Knights of the Round Table come to his aid.  This book was adapted into a movie by Wes Anderson in which the Knight that saved Arthur is called Sir Gawain.  And, according to the movie, it was the knights that killed Arthur.  There is also a very interesting theory about the events that take place in The Sword in the Stone, which has to do with the death of Arthur's brother Lancelot.  I'll have to go back and read that book but the most interesting part about the book is how the characters from the original stories are treated, and I enjoyed that.

He was the only one I had."   -John Kennedy Toole, on losing his father   About this book:   The Great War. A story of a boy's coming of age in a world gone mad.     It's easy to take this story for granted: the war is over, the bombs have been dropped, the peace treaty is a thing of the past. The war has left the planet devastated but in a far worse state than when it started.   a war of destruction has left millions of people dead and an unimaginable number of millions displaced.   and it's up to the boy named Charlie to discover the reason for all of it: a secret so powerful that even the highest echelons of power have no idea about it.   the story is told through flashbacks, first to Charlie's life before the war (and then again in his own memory when his father died and he returns home).   this is a very fast read. the first page or two was hard to hold on to. a lot of information, some easy to find, some harder to find. i enjoyed it more the more i read.   this is a short book, but in fact it isn't long at all, maybe a hundred pages. which for a short story is rather short.  .  , i don't think i could have finished this book in the same manner if it hadn't been for my love of John Kennedy To theoos, so here it is. it was fun and not easy, so that's a good thing. i think the book will appeal to people who enjoy short stories but not those who don't care for them. i don´t know, i just don´  This is a great read. The story is gripping from start to finish. It is about a young boy growing up during the Great War of 1914-18. Charlie is a survivor. He has not one, but two fathers. His father is killed in action. His real father, however, is away in the war.Charlie's mother is trying to raise two children on her own. She is a good wife. Charlie's father, though, is a man with a purpose: he needs a son.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is not only my favorite book in the series but it is one of the best books I have read in a very long time. It has just about everything I love about a fantasy novel: interesting plot, beautiful writing, interesting magic system, and plenty of adventure.     4.      This book is written in third person limited by POV and so we only see the main character's view of events and it's a little bit hard to take him seriously, but other then that it's quite good. The main character, Jefrey, has been brought up by a family who has been around for generations so she doesn't have any experience of the world outside of what she's been brought to believe in.  When she is sent to a kingdom in the south she is treated like an outsider.  This book starts out a bit like your average fantasy novel, but then starts moving away from it to reveal a plot that is quite complex.  The characters are all well developed and I did like the way the main protagonist was developed.  5.    The Sword of Morning, The Serpent's Daughter, The White Rider,   The Crown Tower,  The Crown of Blood, The Mirror of Night, The Stone Crown,   The Serpent Queen, The Swordmaster's Apprentice, The Blood Song, The Dragon's Shadow, The Blackwood Crown,  The Stone of Night In the beginning of the book I was expecting a lot of romance and romance was definitely present, but not to the degree it is in most books.  It's a fun and fast paced read that is full of action and excitement.  I do wish the series didn't start so far out from the first book, but at least there is a sequel and the plot was definitely developed in the second book.  All in all I think I liked this book even though I don't like romance.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The only thing I didn't like was the ending. I've read a lot of books about people who try to run away from their family (or worse, their friends) by trying to get away from one or more of their family members. The problem with the story was that by the end, we see that the main character didn't really run away because he's really afraid of the consequences. Even though his family has been trying to help him escape (and even after they have), his family still loves him and has tried to protect him, but eventually he comes to accept his family for who they are. I didn  The only thing that didn't work for me was the fact that the family doesn't really know that the girl he has been dating is his sister. I mean, he tells them when they visit him and they have a long talk with him. Even if he never tells them, I think they would have known. I felt like that wasn't really necessary, because it was obvious to me that he was a girl. In fact, when he is in high school and is in a relationship with a girl, his sister is clearly the one who is in charge of his relationship with her. She has told him not to run and that she has no plans to run with him, yet he doesn't have any problems running away with her after the conversation she has with him and that he has to do to protect himself and his sister because of his mom's threats. It seems like he only really gets into a relationship where he has his sister involved after his mom gets involved because of threats.   And then there's the ending, which I will admit I was a little surprised by. The main character ends up breaking up with his girlfriend because he realizes that he will only be able to make a good life for himself if he has a sister and family. I think there should have been a happy ending to that story, but the way it ends is too abrupt. He breaks up with her, gets a new girlfriend, then ends up killing himself because he doesn of course regret having that relationship, but he just knows he can never trust his family again. It's also a little hard to understand how he could have broken up with this girl, because he is the best friend and sister and has never had a girlfriend in his life before and she was his first. I guess it doesn't make sense how he couldn't have even been thinking about a new girl
Write a positive review about a good book:    My dad loved this book. He said "You can't make this stuff up".   "Guns don't kill people, people kill people."

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read a lot of novels, most of which are "light" ones, that are not so good that I didn't want to throw my Kindle out the window, and some that I found very good, and this book is among the very best, so that's why I said a positive thing. It's short, fast, and just plain entertaining, so I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good plot. The only flaw I found is that I wished some of the characters were more developed, but that may be because I don't like to read stories about the "good guys" and when a protagonist is one-dimensional then he really loses me, and I've read some stories with a lot more "good guy" than this one, so maybe it's my taste.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book, if you like the sort of stories that have been popular for several decades in SF novels, you will like it. The plot is familiar to anyone who has read a few dozen short stories in that genre. The style is a little clunky, a bit like a first contact story, with the occasional word-for-word repetition and a bit of the usual gush of style that comes from the author's usual style. But that doesn't detract much from the story, which is entertaining, and while the author is not a strong SF writer, he does bring some fresh ideas to the table. A book you can find on Amazon for a low price. The author is the creator of the "Battlestar Galactica" TV series, and if you watch that show, you should probably see some of his writing too.

The writing is good, the research is done with attention to detail and is a good overview of the evolution of medicine, in particular, the evolution that led from the primitive to the modern form of medicine. The examples are interesting, and it is fun to go through the book to see the evolution. The final section, which has many illustrations, is fun. I really like the use of illustrations to illustrate the progression of medical research. My favorites were the diagrams showing the changes in the human body from the earliest anatomical illustrations to the latest ones. The illustrations were also really nice. It's an interesting read. I would give this a 4.5 if only for the illustrations!"  -Chris D. Pritchard, MD, author of The Evolution of Medicine.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved the book. I don't read many YA books because they are difficult to get into and I feel like I have to read more of the series. The YA genre has really helped me to be a better reader. I was a bit disappointed that the book did not have a middle or end, but a couple more good books would have been really cool.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book and I don't think I've ever liked a story more. I think it's the best book in the series. The book had some good parts and some bad parts. The bad parts, in my opinion, were the "bad part" where it was revealed that the evil cult is planning a big reveal at the end of the book and that part was really confusing. The good part of the story was the characters. They were interesting and I didn't hate them. There were some things about the characters that I didn' like but they didn't affect the story in a negative way. The other parts of the novel were interesting, I was very entertained by the story.  The one thing I don' like about this book is the ending. I didn 't like it when the evil girl said she was going to be a princess one day. I don 't understand it at all. Why not just have her be a regular teenager with her parents? Why make her an evil witch instead?   I didn''t like when the story ended. It was abrupt and I felt like I was thrown into a big unknown. But I was excited to find out more about what happened and I'm really looking forward to the next book.   I' ve been reading a series called " The Dark is Rising " by Daniel O'Malley and it is amazing. The characters and world are so good and it keeps getting better and better. I'm excited to read more books.  I give this book 5 stars out of 5 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought the book.   It is my first time reading anything by him, and I enjoyed it.  He wrote about his time as a soldier in the Vietnam war, and he is very interesting about the war and his experiences.  The book is short, but I was able to read it before going to sleep as I was on a train at night.  I think this book will definitely be on my bookshelf for a long time to come.  Overall rating:  4.5 stars
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book. It is a great introduction to the history of the United States from the founding to the present, and a good and enlightening history of slavery.   (5/5 stars)   The book is divided into eight parts, which cover many topics including the political and social context of the American Revolution, the origin and development of American democracy, the slave trade, the Civil War, and slavery as a political institution.  I especially liked the sections on the founding of the country, the origins of political parties, and the political parties during the Civil war.  The author makes very good use of primary sources and references the most important sources in each part of the book.  My only criticism is that the text of the first part of his book is very long, and he could have condensed it a bit. Overall, it is a very well researched, thought provoking, and well written book. The second part I did not read because I was reading a review of a different book. I highly recommend that you read it if you are a political scientist or interested in the history and politics of the US. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A little short, and a little boring, and, yes, a little preachy at times but still entertaining and worth a read. It's also one of the best stories I've read in a long time. My kids are enjoying it.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of those books that makes me feel like I'm in the know, like I've read every other book on the topic. It does not have the depth of knowledge and depth of information that you'd find in a better book, but its just so well written. This is a fascinating book, that is going to change the way you think about a number of topics that you thought you knew about. It's a great read, and I've had it on my shelves for a few months.

Write a positive review about a good book:     This book is the most comprehensive guide to a variety of medical devices that were designed and developed to relieve pain and discomfort.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book and thought it was a very good read.   The main character is a very complex character and one that the reader really gets to know and understand.  When she's not in the bath, I have to say that she has a very nice personality.  She's just shy and sweet.  Also, her mother, who is an alcoholic, is very loving.  The author does a very well job with setting up the story and how the girls came to be in the position that they're in.  In short, it's good and not at all cheesy or boring. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm reading this book in the middle of one of the most horrible winters in recent memory, and, honestly, it's a great book! This book is filled with real stories about the hardship of the people living in the south. The author has taken time to delve into the history of her area, and the stories told are not only interesting to read, but also eye opening. The characters are very relatable to me. I feel the author has given them a sense of humanity and a very realistic sense of what it is like to live in the "Wild South". It's not a pretty part of the US, but it's also not very pretty to look at either. The writing style is very enjoyable to read. The story moves at a good pace, and I feel that the author takes enough time to explain all of the historical and historical details. The stories are all told with a bit of humor. If you like a historical story, I'd recommend this to you!
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best way I can describe this book is that it is a book that should have been published a long time ago. The writing is excellent and the plot is solid. I really liked the characters in this book and enjoyed the way the story unfolded.

Write a positive review about a good book:    " I have a feeling that the story, if not the writing, would have been better had I been the author.  It is a well-written, well-researched read that I'm sure is a pleasant diversion.  For those of you that have never seen a Star Trek movie, I would recommend this book to you.  If you have never read any Star Trek books, you will be very surprised.  The stories are compelling and full of humor.  A fun read!"    I love the fact that this book was written by a man who has been around Star Trek since the early 1960s. The fact that he has also been an actor who played both the villain and the hero in several Star Trek films and TV shows (he's appeared as several different characters in all of the Star Trek series and films) makes it all the more impressive. The book also features a nice bit about the original Star Trek writing team, Gene Roddenberry, Majel Barrett-Roddenbery and Dorothy Fontana. They are also responsible for creating the first series of Star Trek novels.  As a reader, I have to say that the quality of the writing is what I have come to expect from Peter David. He knows exactly how to present a complicated scientific subject and how to make it easy to follow and enjoy. The characterizations are also very good, not to mention the characters who are depicted in the book. In fact, I think I was a little surprised by the amount of female characters that were depicted in this book. I suppose I should have expected that given the subject matter. I also enjoyed the humor and the fact it was written in a very informal and humorous manner.    As an author and professional, it is clear to me that Peter David is an extremely talented and skilled writer and he is able to write a story which is both entertaining and informative. It's also clear that this is a book that many people will enjoy and it's good to know that it has been released.    A  This is a very good book and if you like Star Trek in general this is an excellent read. You can also add it to your Star Trek collection.  " The only thing better than a good story is a great story.  "
Write a positive review about a good book:   Here are some tips for writing reviews: Do not make your review too long. This is more for an author's benefit, but it is a good rule to follow. Do not repeat the author's name or title unless it is really relevant. Do keep in mind that reviews by one reviewer may not agree with another reviewer's opinion. This means that not everyone will like what is on the other end of the spectrum. Do include your contact info if you want a reply. I also have an email on my site for authors and I will be happy to answer any questions you may have. The best part about reviewing books is it allows you to really explore your own interest in the story. It makes you learn more about the book and the author. This goes a long way in making you a reader and an advocate of the genre. I hope this is helpful! -Syd The Review :   A quick little review of this one. The author did an excellent job describing what is going on in this one chapter and even though it is kind of "in my head", I really enjoyed reading it. The plot is really fun, I had no problems with it at all and that is what really counts, the plot is fun. The pacing is pretty good as well, the story was done very well and the way it is told was very cool. The characters are all real characters in this story, some of the characters are very well developed, and the other one that was written was a bit annoying in the beginning. This would be a great one to read on your summer break, it is something you won't be able to put down.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I absolutely love this book! I am not even a huge book nerd but I loved every minute of this book. I am a newbie on this whole "mature" thing. (I'm still learning) but I have learned that we need mature men and mature books! This is the book for the older man who has a passion for books and is willing to put forth a lot of work to read and enjoy them! This book is filled with so much information!     I was not disappointed by this book at all. I loved it! It is so hard to find books like this that are not self-published or are a bit pricey. I've read a lot and enjoyed the different types of books that I have read. This one was especially great. I could get in my "office" and get ready to read. I also recommend this book to anyone who loves books, or is a big fan of any kind of reading or reading culture.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an amazing book. I was a bit skeptical at first but I decided to take the plunge. It is the story of a young girl who is in love with a girl. The story is beautiful and the author, Marcela Frugoli, really captured her. If you love fantasy and you like your fantasy stories to be gritty or tragic then this one should be on your to-read list. She did a great job capturing the feel of what a young boy feels like when he is growing up and I was really enthralled by this story. I also really enjoyed this book because the story was realistic and I didn't feel like it was trying to be anything else. I would definitely recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A wonderful book. I loved reading it, but have had some problems with it. I read the first part of it in one day and then finished it in a day and a half. That is a bit too fast for my taste. It took me quite a few days to get started on the rest of the book and I think this is a matter of preference. I have also found that it has trouble with reading speed. I don't know why it took me so long. One of the things I noticed about the book was that it had a lot of illustrations. I do not like the illustrations and this was a big problem for me. In a book of more than 400 pages I found myself going through a large volume looking for the picture I needed. I'm not sure what was the source of the illustrations but they were mostly of animals that were not used in the book, so I would not be surprised if this bothered the publishers who bought the book. The book was not entirely well written. The characters weren't always very clear. I found it difficult to figure out what their motivations were. For example, who wants to eat the other? Was it because the other person was fat or because of their bad health? Or was it because they were a witch? I wish that these questions were addressed in the text, but this is not the case. I wish the author had focused on one of the characters instead of the whole group. Also, some of the chapters were not that interesting, so it was hard to keep reading. But, I read a lot during the course of the year and I will read the book again.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I absolutely LOVE this book! It is an extremely insightful book on the relationship between the individual and his or her beliefs and motivations. It is a very good guide on how to live and not live a life where you are so afraid of being wrong or getting it wrong that you don't want to do anything at all.   This book is full of examples and anecdotes from other people and from our own lives. It's also filled with many quotes from other books that help in the reading process. The book is also very short and readable.      In general, I find it hard to believe how wrong I was about God.     
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book last weekend. The first half is a really good look at how the Bible is a book and the history it contains and the second half is an analysis of the various different versions of the Bible and why they are all different. As a Christian myself and having gone through an abusive and abusive father I have always been interested in Bible stories. I am glad to see that this book was written with a female perspective and that the author did a good job at presenting her viewpoints. My only problem with this book is that the main character (the daughter) did not do her research when she was in college and now feels like she's a lost cause because she can't understand what the Bible has to say about women. Other than that I really liked this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this a few weeks ago and absolutely enjoyed it.   After seeing some reviews I had to read it so I'm not complaining, I'm just saying that this is a good novel. I enjoyed reading this book so much and wanted to get the book for Christmas, I had no idea this was coming out and I love it, it makes me feel like a kid on christmas.  I'm always excited to get a new book because they always make me feel better after I have read a book before.  After reading the review on Goodreads and finding out that it was going to be a sequel I was super excited, as I have yet to be the recipient of a good sequel.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A book that is a bit difficult to understand at first but then once you understand the plot, the writing style is perfect. I recommend it as a nice story.   "The Great One: An Epic Tale of American Baseball" is the story of a 19th century American baseball player who played baseball in America and Europe for his entire career and died on May 30, 1897 in New York.   the book starts with a story about a man named "Ben" who played the game with his father and grandfather and became the most famous player in the United States.   He was known as "The Great Ones".   Then we get to know the young player in question. He is called "Ruth".   the young boy played baseball but he quit when he was in his teens. Then he had a heart attack at the age of 20. When he recovered he was given a chance to play and he did well and became famous. Then at the peak of his career he gets hit by a car.  : )   There is a story that I have read elsewhere about Ruth getting hit by the car and never fully recovering but he lived a long life (after his death he was inducted into the Hall of Fame)   Anyway the book tells the story about how he played in different leagues and got famous. He played in the US league. When the US League folded he then moved to Europe to play in the French League which had a strong team made up of Americans.  .The story told in this book is a fascinating one. There are many characters in the story. Each of them has their own story and they all become more fascinating over time.  
Write a positive review about a good book:     (4/5) This book is great, and it has a lot of depth and complexity. I am impressed with the depth that the author covers, especially in regards to how the various forms of technology interact with human psychology. However, this book needs a bit more work before I consider it a definitive resource on this topic. For instance, in discussing why humans have a need for art and music in the first place, the author seems to completely overlook the reasons for their importance as the foundation for so many people's lives. In fact, as I reread this book (to make sure I did not miss anything), I realized that one of the chapters on "Music as a Language" didn't really explain this at all, so I had to look it up to figure out what he meant. For those of you who have never had the pleasure of attending a live concert, I have to agree with this reviewer that you can't have enough of it. In this particular case, however, I think that a more compelling explanation of how music works in humans is needed, since music is often associated with the concept of music. As I said before, the book is very detailed, so this shouldn't be a problem at all. The author has done a great job with this book, but one of my gripes is that the first book he reviewed wasn't nearly as good as this one. If you enjoy books about humans, I would highly recommend this one to you. If not, I'm sorry to say that you're better off waiting for a later edition of this book. For my part, I can't wait to read the next edition of the book so I can find out what is going to be changed.  6/5 Stars  Review by: Anonymous on Dec. 22, 2014 :  Just want to say this book is amazing. I know there is more to the human experience than just what we see. But the author is very thorough in the research he does in this book and I'm sure you'll be very pleased with what he has to say. The book is not in my local library's collection so I'm not sure about where you'll find it. I plan to check it out next. The reviews I've seen from people are amazing. .  is also quite good. I can tell that he takes the time to really look into his topics and research. :
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am reading this novel on a train to London. I read a few reviews here of the book and the author, but didn't want to spoil myself with that. It is just a good tale. There is a strong mystery to this book. The book is a quick read and I can't wait to finish it!  "He was going to be a king.?"  Chapter 5: A Little Surprise  My thoughts were running through my mind as I sat in the train and the door closed. I remembered the little surprises in a book, just like a child. Like when a book was written by an older sister with some good suggestions for her siblings. A book by a teacher, a book by her own father, a story written for her son. A story with a happy ending.  And like the story, I had read a little surprise in this book, a hidden gem.  is a book full of little surprises. This book is not so much about the main character, but about the little things that happen to the person that is writing the story. What I mean is, what happened to the character's friend, was a surprise. It wasn't very unexpected. It was the second surprise in a little book full with little surprises that made this book great. .  to the author:  Thank you for a wonderful book, with a wonderful plot and great character development. The story is quick and interesting. There were not many surprises for this reader, although some were left for you to discover.  and I will certainly read more stories in this series.  the cover for this book is beautiful. The author does a very good job of keeping it original, yet fresh. The characters are easy to identify with.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This was really good, as far as the world building goes. The characters in this book are well written. There is very little, if anything, written down about the history of the land the characters inhabit, but they're a very interesting group of people. They're mostly in the present day, but there is one that is in the past with a lot of history that it is trying to learn about and understand. They have a lot more depth, as well, than you'd expect from the simple 'good' and 'evil' side of things. They are really well written, and I really enjoyed the experience of reading this book.   7.5/10:  Overall:      The book is good, there is a lot to like about it, and the characters are interesting, which makes me love reading the book. I'm going to pick it up again, for the sequel, because I'm very excited for it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is fun but it is a bit slow to get there. It does pick up in the last 20 pages, though.  I think the story would work much better in a horror/mystery/sci-fi/thriller setting. You would have the main character (maybe a little boy) and the heroine, his mother, get captured by aliens, have their child get kidnapped, and find a way to escape. They are then caught in a battle with aliens, the main female protagonist gets captured, and the alien women come after the baby. The story could be so much more interesting. I think it could have been so much better.   This is not the book you would want to read with a group of teenagers. It could have worked with adults, but it probably would not have made any teens (or adults) feel any better about themselves.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most complete and accurate history of the early years of the Church. It has everything you need to know about the early Mormon community. The author is an excellent reporter. He has a keen sense of history.

In summary, this is a must read for all Latter Day Saints.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. The only complaint I have is that it could have been so much longer.

It was very interesting.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book.  For all the times I'm a little miffed about the whole "good book, bad book" genre and that "bad book sucks" is a popular critique, I just can't get enough of this book. So. It is, to use the terminology of a certain other series, "the good book for all occasions" -- and is definitely a book you should get, not only because of the characters, but also because the plot is actually pretty good. It all feels a little like a different kind of Harry Potter -- maybe a little more realistic, and a little less fantasy. But even that's probably a bit of a stretch -- Harry Potter is a fantasy, a very much-admired classic. And I know the real story is a bit less interesting and a bit more conventional than the books would have you believe, but that's okay. It's a fun read, with all the good things, but even the bad parts feel like the good parts.
Write a positive review about a good book:   It was the third book in a series. I like the author but some of his characters seemed out of place.   (hide spoiler) (I like this book and plan to read the rest.) I liked it a lot. I found a lot of humor in it. I loved all the different character's. If you like fantasy then you will like it.  I was quite confused by one of the main characters but the other one's got their reasons why they are what they are. It's funny and entertaining, but not quite sure how to take it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    - I had heard a lot of great things about this book from many, many people, including a friend who works at a university library, and I was really excited about it. I didn't know if I would like it, but I was intrigued so I was hoping for the best. I have to say that this is easily one of my top 3 favorite books I have read in the past year. A lot of the stories seem very believable, and a lot are well written. I had a good time reading them all.   "A very interesting historical story and the story of what happened with the 'Lost Generation' is one that needs to be told."   The story of the people who lived through World War II has a certain appeal, so I can understand why the author decided to write this particular book about it (though she has said that "I'm not writing a book for my generation").   The story, as it is told, is both poignant and disturbing.  As with so many World War I veterans, the experience of living through it changed people, and many ended up with a sense of melancholy about life, and about war.  The 'Lost Generations' have become so much a part of our history, I thought it would be interesting to see how the events they lived through have affected the modern world.    The author does not shy away from the painful parts of the story, but doesn't use them as an excuse to ignore the other amazing things that have happened since.  Some of the events the young men who were at the front in the First World War died in have become a part and parcel of our collective memory and culture, and for that reason it is great that this book explores the war and what happened to the veterans.  These are not just stories about the men who went to war, but also stories about what happened afterwards:  And they are told from many different points of view.  As in other World War Books, the stories are told in a very human and believable way.  The author also wrote the foreword, in which she talks about her own experiences living through the war as a child and teenager.  Another thing I liked about the book was the use of the 'hidden language' of language - something that was often a barrier to reading at the time but is now widely used.  This is an excellent book, and there are a lot more of them out there, I

Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book, and so many books that I've read lately in general. The plot, the characters, the writing... it's all just all really good. This is just a nice book to read on a slow day, as opposed to a super fast paced story. It's not really for kids or new adults, but it has great plot and interesting characters and a very good premise, even if the ending left a little to be desired. (I know, it's not the end, but some of the things that happened in the end could have been resolved earlier. I'll take it.) I read this book when I was in my early teens, and the book does have some adult themes. It also has some violence, a little bit. But, I'm not sure, to what extent. It was okay, but not great. I did read it a few years ago. It does seem dated though. Not that this book wasn't still good, but there were better books I'd recommend it to!  5 stars, just a tad on the short side for the story.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The main characters are very well drawn. I liked the way the author set the mood and gave us a little bit of insight on why people act as they do, and why the events in the book happened. I was pleasantly surprised by the overall story. I think it was a bit more action-packed than I had expected, though.   I would definitely recommend this book. It is a good read and a good fantasy book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got this book back in May and enjoyed it to death. The plot is pretty straight forward: two very good friends, Max and Sarah, meet in an airport bathroom and immediately fall in love. Then Max discovers his biological dad is a vampire. Then he's forced to make a deal with his dad, or risk the wrath of the vampire queen, in order to live, and escape her grasp. The characters are real and likable, with Max and his mom being two of the better main characters. I'm not a huge fan of vampire books, but this was very good and actually ended up being one of the best vampire books that I have read to date. I look forward to reading this one again!

Write a positive review about a good book:    "This book changed my life."  "This book inspired me to overcome my shyness." 2. I used the new habit method to implement The Game.   I did not have to give up a normal life; I just used the game as a platform to improve myself. I found that the game is like a puzzle, where you have to work out the pieces, then assemble them into a complete game.  You get the reward of having better relationships, increased self-confidence, and more control over yourself.  I also enjoyed the fact that you can start from an entirely new mindset, and that you will have a completely different approach to life after you start working out.  3. I read The Game to help me stop making excuses for my life.  So I've found that it's not only for people who are dealing with ADHD, but it's a great read for everyone to read and get a good understanding of why our brains are hard wired to get what we want.  This is especially true when we make excuses for our failures.  For example, the book has chapters on why we can't do something, like exercise, for a week because we are busy.  But the first thing we do is break down the reasons why we might be doing that.  And we do this because if we don't, we'll keep procrastinating, then feel guilty about it, and then do it anyway.   4. I've started using the new self-esteem tool because I feel that the Game was a very good tool.  At the beginning of the year, I was feeling depressed because I didn't feel good about myself, and this caused my relationships to suffer, so I decided to take the Game to heart.  After a few weeks, I started to feel good, and my relationships improved, so that my mood improved and I started doing the game consistently.   In addition, I also feel that this self-help program works, as I do feel like I'm improving myself.  It's a very nice and helpful tool to have, and a lot more enjoyable than my ADHD meds, so this is definitely a good tool for me. I have an awesome experience reading The Game, and I look forward to more of your great books.  Thank you so much for sharing this!  --Jodi
Write a positive review about a good book:    Thank you so much for this book. It helped me realize that it's ok to be "unhappy" in life, as I know this is possible and that there are positive things in life. And it gave me hope that there is a world out there I could grow into. And maybe it's something I can find and get to, like it's for other people. And this book will show you that you do, in fact, have a future.  Review from : My mother is a member of the National Alliance for Mental Illness (NAMI).

Write a positive review about a good book:    Hi guys, My name is Jennifer and I have been a big fan of yours for a few years now. I just wanted to say I was so pleased to see your new review of The Complete Encyclopedia Of The Bible published last month. I have always been a believer but now I feel I have a strong enough faith base to read it with open eyes. I am just beginning to dig into the translations. I like that it shows both the ancient languages (Greek, Hebrew, etc.) and the modern languages (English, French, etc.). I am looking forward to learning more from it and I am sure it will continue to be a great source of information for me. In the meantime, I am happy you are enjoying the book! You are welcome to check out the Bible Dictionary for Free at www.bible.info/search. Hello I just finished reading this book and I thought it was awesome, very well researched and presented. I hope you have a great day. Thank you for making this such a great read. -Lily Hello, I thought this was a really good book. I'm very impressed with the way you cover the whole Bible and how the different translations are handled. I enjoyed it immensely. I think we will be using this book a lot, it is excellent. Thank-you! -Nancy Hi, This is a really nice, comprehensive book. As a lifelong Bible scholar (I'm an Anglican priest), I found a number of interesting points regarding the ancient original languages. It's interesting to compare the original languages with the ones we have now. For example, it would be surprising if the original Hebrew had some words (e.g. מאין) that didn't make it into the current Hebrew Bible. You mention the word "tribe" in 1 Corinthians 15:45 (where the modern-day "Jews" would say "Jews"). You also mention the term "the nation" in the Hebrew Bible (Genesis 24:14). This is very interesting. So if you are a young adult looking for some Bible history or wanting to know where some of these terms came from, this is a good place to start. It might be a little dry at times, but I think it's worth reading. Thanks for a very good book, I'll be using it as a reference and reference material for my students. -Steve, Utah My thanks to you, and thank you for the opportunity to

Write a positive review about a good book:    A lot of my favorite books are about people with amazing ability. They are also about people struggling. The thing that I've enjoyed about this book is that it is not about success but about the struggle.   I was really excited when I finished this. I knew the story was good and was happy to find a story that isn't all about success.  The book is divided into 3 parts: 1) the life of the children of an elite family, 2) the family's problems and how they can't cope and 3) the discovery of a way out. These sections are really well done. The children have a life that is full of magic and wonder, which is what I loved.  I really loved the descriptions of the world that the children inhabit, and the way that the story is told.  This book is a really good book about magic and magic is one of the few things that I like about books. I didn't find the story to be particularly complex, but there are a lot of interesting characters and things happen that really made me think.  The magic that the characters use and the creatures are what I found to be the best part about this story.  When I got to the end of the book I was a little sad. I had a lot to like about it.  For anyone who likes fantasy or historicals, this book will probably be a favorite.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent novel.   It is fast-paced, fun and full of action, which is a rare quality in any of the series I have read.  It also deals with dark subjects, although not as openly as some of the others.  This is a great read, and I give it a ten.  5 stars. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very pleasantly surprised by this book. The writing is clear and easy to follow, although I thought the language could have been a little sharper at times. This book is a very interesting read about the ways in which human behavior is influenced by cultural differences, and also the ways that we're influenced by culture. It really does give you a window into human behavior, but the language can be a bit clumsy. I think one of the strengths of this book is that it does give us a clear picture of the basic mechanisms by which our behavior is determined by culture, as well as the ways we can affect those mechanisms.

Write a positive review about a good book:     "I read this book before reading The Secret, which is a fine book of its own, but this one is not as good. The main character is a woman and the book is about the problems that come with her coming out as a lesbian, but the book isn't really about that. Instead, it's about a boy who falls in love with this girl who is actually a man, and she is not only an out lesbian, she is also very confused by it, and when I think about it she is a very complex character. It doesn't make the character particularly appealing, but it is a well-written book about what people might think of as 'other,' but aren't really in the mainstream. I found the character of the boy in this book very sympathetic."

Write a positive review about a good book:    If you love literature then you must have read this. It is my favorite book in the Harry Potter series by JK Rowling. It takes place before the start of book one. It has many scenes that are the same as the book: Harry and Ron are in the kitchen making a pudding when the doorbell rings. When the person in the door answers, Harry's mother and father are standing there, their hands in the air as they are surprised Harry hasn't yet gotten back. It doesn't take long for Harry and Hermione to get back. Harry's parents try to talk to Harry about his plans for the future and he refuses to tell them. Hermione, who was the one to send the letter, is surprised by the lack of reaction on his part. This is why Hermione goes into the Great Hall to get him. This book was a huge help in my understanding of the series, and it was not too long. This first book, in which Ron and Harry are living at 6 Grimmauld Place, was my favorite in the series. It was well written and the events in the book happened in a believable way. There was a lot of tension as Ron was trying to make up for his past, and Harry, who had been there the night the Dursley's died, was struggling to accept his new life at 6. I can see why this book is so highly regarded among Harry Potter fans, and why it gets 4 stars.  29 of 34 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book for an assignment about a historical period and in the midst of that I found myself so overwhelmed by what was going on in this book that I did not have time to fully enjoy it.   For a first book I was very disappointed, and then as I was starting to feel better about the experience the author wrote a wonderful letter to the narrator, who went on to be my friend for many years. A wonderful experience and a good story. I think it might make a good one to read as a companion to the historical book!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm always on the lookout for new books that are good in some way. As a writer I really look for a novel that will not only entertain me but will also give me some insight into the world I live in. This book was a good introduction to the world and characters and I can see the authors efforts in creating a believable and well written world.  What do you think?   I was looking for a good old fashioned noir novella where I could enjoy the plot but could get a sense of why the characters are doing what they do. It is very well done.    The writing style was excellent.   The characters are well drawn.  The atmosphere of the book is well done and you get the idea that something bad is about to happen.  I do recommend this book to any fan of detective novels.  I highly recommend this one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   A little like a love letter, it is a very touching story of a boy who loves and is loved by his mother, and the mother who is trying to make him happy.   The narrator has a very powerful voice, she's a very good writer, and I like that she doesn't say the same things as the other people she writes about, and it's a lot of fun to listen to.  I can't help but think that my mother will see this, but I doubt she will read this, because I think it's just a nice book.  There are some parts of it that are pretty disturbing, and when the story is over you have to re-read it to see how the characters feel and you really get a good feel of what the author wants to do with this book.  7/10

Write a positive review about a good book:    * This book is really well written. It is funny, and the story and characters are really good, and I really enjoyed reading it. The humor was spot on. * I think the book is mostly about Harry, and his problems with his girlfriend, so the story of Harry trying to get out of it was a little boring, but I guess that's to be expected. * There was a lot of action in this book. There were fights, there were battles, there was some magic, and there was a dragon. * The ending of this book is so well done, and it is what I would have wanted to see. I am going to read the next book in this series, because I would love to see what happens to Harry in the future. * This is not a good sequel to this book, but a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently re-read this classic. I have been a big fan of Robert A. Heinlein since I was a child. I love the character he created and the stories of his books. The first time I read him I was amazed that I could still understand how he was able to describe space. I then took a few years to finish all of his novels, and then was finally able to get my hands on the entire series. I never read Heinlein outside of the series and it was a joy to re-discover these books. I can not recommend this book enough.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    (review written 10/26/14). I first read this book back in '89, and was enthralled by it.   "I like it! It's the first book I've ever read about the Soviet economy, and I liked it. I read all sorts of books about the USSR, and the US, and there was nothing quite like it, although I've been to a lot of conferences and other discussions about it, and in those I think there's a lot to learn about it all." (   Review by an American, who apparently does not yet have the good sense to realize that the USSR is a state capitalist country.) I'm not so sure about that; I guess I should have known better than to trust the first person perspective of someone I didn't know well. (To me, and probably to many of my fellow Americans, that perspective is based on the assumption that the Soviets are so naive that it would take a miracle for them to develop a viable alternative to capitalism.) I didnít understand the economic aspects of it (how did people get what they needed without selling their labor for a wage? Why did no one seem to complain when wages were kept high and unemployment was high? Why wasn't the Soviet government able to keep the price of oil high and thus keep the standard of living high? And so on).   The book is mostly an indictment of capitalism (a book about which I always thought that the only useful critiques are those that critique capitalism itself), with the author attempting to show how the Soviet system is a failure in order to prove how much of capitalism can be salvaged from capitalism by the application of Soviet principles.  However, he only managed to get part of the story right, in the sense that it seems that the Soviet central planning system did at least get a lot right.  While it certainly had its problems, it did do a great job of providing a steady flow of consumer goods, education, and infrastructure.  It is not a happy story (and I would argue that it has been used as one).  The author does a great disservice to those who worked in the Soviet Union by not giving them credit where credit is due, which is how we should think of people who lived in the USSR (and not just people who worked for the State), in that a lot did well in the system, and a great deal were not lucky enough to get a high position, much less a top position
Write a positive review about a good book:    * * *  This is a great book for anyone who is interested in building a successful business and/or pursuing entrepreneurship.   This is just a solid book and if you haven't read any books about entrepreneurship you need to read this book now.  I have a few quibbles with it but the book is still really good.  The book gives you a great insight into starting and running your business but the biggest thing is that you will learn something new about your business as well as your career. I am still learning about myself and I am very excited to share my journey with you all. * *  *  * * * I think that this book is very well written and explains the business fundamentals in a good manner. It is a quick read but it has a lot of great info to help you along in your journey as a business owner. If you have never done anything like this then I recommend you give this book a go as it will only help you to improve. * What about you? Have you read any other business books?

Write a positive review about a good book:   "The story is one of the best I've ever read in a short story collection.    I'm giving this book four stars so it can stand with other of the master's work like  The Goldfinch and The Secret Garden.   To be fair the book is not only about the story but also the characters, but as an art book it's a little overrated." "Great book for art lovers and storytellers...a short read, easy to understand, and with an intriguing plot." This book will be the perfect addition to any home, library or study-room.  There are two versions of the book available. One is the standard art book, and one is the beautiful, custom-made "Book of Life" designed to sit on a coffee table.  We offer two sizes and two finishes.  The standard art edition is approximately 12" x 14", the book of life edition is about 18" x 22". We recommend the custom book of Life because of the unique, one-of-a-kind quality. The Book of Life will be printed on acid-free paper with a high quality, linen finish. You can choose between the book or the book with the life on it.

I like this book very much, I have found the book very helpful in terms of helping my son with ADHD deal with the behaviors and the learning challenges that come from it. It is very well written and the images in the book help a lot with getting into the mind of the ADHD person.  My only complaint is that the book is not at all user friendly, in particular for children and for people who don't have a lot of experience in this type of book. The book has some very confusing terminology in it, but it is clear in the text.  This book is well worth reading if you want to learn a lot about ADHD, and I think that anyone should have this book in their library.

Write a positive review about a good book:    -Read it and I'll agree.   In this novel, an American writer is a victim of the Vietnam War, and her father is a war hero. The book is an allegory of Vietnam and the war itself.   --Bookbinder  "This book has been written to honor the fallen, and is a great, stirring reminder of that time and place."   (Read full review)  "In a world where the United States is still committed to fighting in a failed war, it's refreshing to see a book that is more about the sacrifice of the family member who is in the war.  This book has also been written in such a way that it isn't a simple narrative of good versus evil.  It has a very human touch." (Read review) "As an American, it was always nice to read a book like this where an American was on the losing side of a war. I liked that it didn't make me sympathize with the Vietnamese.  Instead, I think it makes the reader understand that a lot of the people in a conflict suffer as well." (Check Amazon Review)  To help you remember the sacrifices that are being made, I would like to post a poem by a member of the United Service Organizations (USO):   --This is not a war that just stopped, but a war still going on,  as is a part of all wars.  But it is still not over.  War is the only thing that makes us a human race.  Because a part is gone, we feel the need to make the other side feel what we have lost,   To help us remember the sacrifice, I am offering this poem on the Memorial Wall,  at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC. This poem is a tribute to those that are currently being remembered.  We will not be able to finish this book, but we can honor those that we have been and are and will be and will still be when we are no more.  Let's honor them.

Write a positive review about a good book:     ( ) It's been a few years since my last book and I am really excited to write another book. I can already tell it's going to be a treat!  ( ) The main character in this book has this really amazing way of writing a story with all the different characters. ( ) I really like the way the main character wrote about the various characters in the story, and I loved how the characters all interacted with each other. (  ) I love the humor in this story, but the story was really just about getting to know these characters, so I wouldn't say it is funny. (I will say, though, that some of the humor came out of being surprised that the main characters were real. (   ) I would love to know the ending, but I am not sure if it was just the book or the reader that kept thinking it was going to end at the end. (Slight spoiler if you have not read this book.  (    ) The writing style is very lighthearted and it really shows off the different personalities of the main cast.  The ending leaves me feeling a little bit confused. I wish I knew more about the characters' pasts.  Thank you for reading! I hope that you all like this book as much as I do! (    )
Write a positive review about a good book:       Thanks.  You can't really give a negative review, because you never know who will read it.  The books I write that I find are not for everybody are often about the most mundane things in life - food, family, love, friendship, the mundane details of living. I am always looking for things to write about.   I always have. For instance, a couple of years ago I wrote a book about how to get good food in a busy restaurant - the main character, Lina, was a food critic.  Lina was kind of the polar opposite of the girl I had previously written about:  she was a writer; she wasn't interested in food or the food critic life; she wrote about things she knew nothing about. The book sold well and got me some book and restaurant reviews. But when my new writing friend Lina came by to talk to me about my book, she said: "You need to do the other thing.  Why are you writing about eating and not writing about writing?  I think you need to find a new job." I did not know what to say to this; then I thought about it, and here is what I decided to say: "I have to write because I don't know how to do my job.  This book is a way for me to express that." That's about as close to a negative as I could come up with to Lina.  Maybe she could come to a restaurant for me if I paid her $5,000 to review the menu and she said, "No, I am not good enough to eat at that restaurant.  If you give me $5.000, I will write the best book you ever read." But I can't afford it. So, I think if I am going to eat a lot, it's best I eat a small meal of pasta, maybe some salad or salad dressings.  My husband has a job where he gets to eat an enormous lunch each day.  It's hard for me and my kids to eat. If I go out, I like to eat in small portions; I find it much easier to manage the amount of food in your stomach.  I try to have my lunch and dinner a few hours apart, so I don the full meal less frequently.   When we go out as a family, we generally try to eat lunch at the

Write a positive review about a good book:   You don't need to tell us what a great read it is  or how you can't put this book down, because we're already familiar with it.  We love to read about good books. We love to enjoy the good writing.  When a good story is told, there's really no reason to skip the beginning.   It's that good!   The main character, Tine, is a bit of a typical middle-school girl.    She likes reading, playing with her dolls, and having fun.  However, one day she gets a letter from her dad asking her to come to his place and get something she was too afraid to get her own hands on: A new pair of wings.  But when she arrives at her dad's house, she sees there's another reason for her visit.  The "wings" are actually giant dragon wings!  When Tine sees these, she has a very strong reaction, but she soon learns she can use them to help her father and friends.  Tine's dad, Mr. Tine has two of the most amazing skills in the world:  A.  It can fly.  B.  He can create wings out of air (like Superman).  This story is so good, even if you've already seen it, you don't have to read it again.  In this book you can see the same emotions as in the movie and the song that the movie is based on, like "Oh! How I love you".   This story is a perfect mix of good action and good storytelling.  We loved every page and we think that we've experienced this type of story since we were little children and now they've got to be true to their childhood.

I'm just surprised about the length of the book because it was fairly short. The fact that it's a mystery, though, is perfect!   And the narration was great.  The plot is intriguing and I'm sure there will be a lot more mysteries to be found in the future.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been wanting to get this book since it was first published. I have heard very good things about it and have been looking forward to reading it. So far, I am pleased with it! The writing is crisp, engaging, and well organized. I like the chapters. The only bad thing I can think of is the use of a lot of quotations. The stories are all very well told and the descriptions vivid. Overall, a good, well written book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book is a good thing.   I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys good stories.    The characters are well developed.  They are smart and interesting.  The writing is easy to follow.  My only complaints are that the books does have a tendency to drag, but I have heard that a lot of these books are already written and it was just not time to write anymore.  A big plus:  I enjoyed the ending. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This review, however, will be about a bad book. I am not one for reading fiction so this book caught me by surprise. There is some good stuff in here but the author has a way of using clichés and overusing words. He has a couple of good descriptions but the main problem is that his characterization is so generic. He makes a character, John Henry, who is basically a bad guy. He is arrogant and selfish, he is a big bully. I was really interested in learning more about John Henry but this book leaves me wanting more. The author seems to have a way with the words but he takes this to the extremes of a cliché and gets very boring. It was really hard for me to get into the story. It's the first book in this series and it is a good start but the second is not as good as the first. I will read the others but they will not be in my favorite series.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The "Hercules" series of books is one of my favourites, because of the originality of the stories (as well as the great worldbuilding), the humour, the characters, the worldbuilding (the series takes place in the same world as "The Last Days of Pompeii" but has it's own distinctive style), the characterisation, the plotline (this is a very complex series with more than 50 books in total and they were written in parallel with each other), and the overall writing style (the stories are not like other "Hemingwayesque" writing like "The Great Gatsby" or "Tender is the Night"). This book is "The House of Hades", the last book in the series, and is set in the world of "The Thousand Names" that "The Winds of Khalakovo" is set on. The main character of the book is a necromancer named Marduk, and it is his quest to find the legendary House of Mardak, which was destroyed centuries ago. The plot is fairly complex, and the first two books were fairly slow to get going, but by the time they got to the House of the Dead, I had finished the trilogy (the trilogy was definitely the weakest of the bunch, and I think I might have finished the whole series after reading the last two books). It has a very unique plotline that is not as simple as it first appears. It does have the feel of the Hemingway style of writing, but it's a bit less "Tale of Two Cities" (which is also interesting) and much more "The Lost World", a place where the very real dangers of a powerful necromancer have not been realised and some of the inhabitants still fight to be freed from the chains of death. The House of Kha has always been a place to stay away from the warring factions in the city of Khalekovo, so the fact that it now stands in the middle of the warzone is somewhat of a surprise to Mardus himself, who is now trying to escape from the clutches of the city and find someplace safe. This has led to M. being hunted by necromancers and their undead slaves, but at the same time there is a small group of survivors who are still trying to free themselves from the bonds of death and chaos that has trapped them in this cursed house. I find this series to be very hard to put down
Write a positive review about a good book:     "It is difficult to find a literary genre with more variety than science fiction. Yet science fiction is just that: an infinite variety of stories and characters to explore. From simple, human-centred dramas, like "2001: A Space Odyssey", to the fantastic, like Philip K. Dick's "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" to the futuristic, like Isaac Asimov's "The Last Question", science fiction offers a myriad of experiences to a diverse readership."     - Booklist   The first time I read this book was through the audiobook version which I found a very nice read.  "This collection is a great start to the series. If I may, I will comment on the audio edition: the narrator is a man whose only voice-acting credits are as a bartender on a soap opera.   "
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got into this book by checking the Amazon reviews. My first thought was to skip it, but it's a great book and well worth the time to read it. The main characters are well written and the story is well paced. The author is a good writer and the book is entertaining. My favorite characters were the male and female in the series that are in the beginning. The romance between the male/male is well done and the female was well done as well.

Write a positive review about a good book:     A book about the Holocaust has to have a good ending. "The Iron Lady," by Anne Frank, is not one of those books. "Iron Lady" is a novel, written in the second person by a woman named Anne. It's a book about Anne, about Anne's struggle, about her experiences, and about the consequences of writing. It also includes a number of pages by Anne in her diary about her life during the war. At the beginning of the book, Anne is 14 years old and is in the family home at Amsterdam (as she's writing about), writing about the Nazi takeover in Poland and her family, about the family vacation in Italy. She's not an empathetic person. Anne does not feel the same kind of emotions that people feel in real life. Anne is not a good person. She doesn't like people. Anne likes the Nazis and hates Jews. She hates the Poles but doesn't hate them very much. It makes sense for her to hate the Poles, because there was a very close relationship between the Poles and the Nazis, so she felt it necessary to hate them. She had a lot of friends, though. She was very popular. Anne Frank is the person who has the most complicated feelings about everything, a complicated and emotional person. In her diary, Anne talks about her father (who was Jewish) leaving her and her mother when she was 6 years old because they tried to escape to France. The father died in Auschwitz. After this, Anne writes a long, angry diary entry about how she doesn't understand why her father didn't have the strength to help his mother and sister escape to a better country. The Nazis take over Anne's family home. Anne's sister is killed by a German soldier. Anne runs away to the Netherlands and starts to write a story about her escape. Her family tries to stop her from writing, but she won't listen. The book is not bad. Anne writes about her family's experiences. She is a bit sarcastic. She thinks that she should not be allowed to go to England, because the people there are bad, but Anne doesn't want to live in a racist country. She talks about how her parents should have married at 14 or 15, but they didn't. They were in love with each other, and wanted to marry. Anne gets caught by the Nazis. Her father is put into a concentration camp with a woman who was pregnant with his child. Her mother gets sent to
Write a positive review about a good book:    As always, an amazing story! I really liked this book. The characters were interesting. And the characters were well defined and unique. The story was fun! There are lots of "magic" in the story. Although it seemed like the magic didn't quite go quite as planned in the beginning. But the characters managed to find a way to resolve the problem and get the outcome they wanted. In fact, it was great that they found a way... I would definitely buy this book again. The Review : I received my copy of the paperback version of  Blood of a Rose  by Mark Lawrence in the mail today. I started it off with a good read, even if it was a little slow, but I didn't want to get too attached to it. I wanted to see how the story would go. I wasn't expecting a good story, so it was nice to finally read a story that I'm interested in. I really enjoyed reading this story, and I found the plot of this book interesting, and different from the typical vampire story, but it did take a little too long for it to get going. I liked the characters and the setting, the story just kept dragging on and I couldn't wait to see where it was going. The end of the book took some time to come, and didn't really solve any big mysteries, but at least it got to that point, and that's the most important thing. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in an epic fantasy novel.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book so much that I didn't even read any of the reviews at all until now. First off: I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. This is my first non-fantasy book about the Wizarding World. And I think my favorite characters are Ron, Hermione and Harry. And then, in the second chapter:  "There are wizards! They're not just wizards, they're wizards in dresses!" This book is definitely not about the wizarding world (though there's plenty about that too), but about all the good wizarding things (like potions, spells, wands, magic, and of course love), and I'm very happy that someone wrote it. This book was so well-written and so well thought out, that I want to listen to it again, in order to think more about them, and maybe to share them with some of the good people I know. I'm excited for all of the Potter-related books coming out in the near future. I have a hard time believing that I'm actually reading a Harry Potter book now. I mean, I don't even know what I'm supposed to read in order. "You've got to read Order of the Phoenix!" or "You can read this or you can read one other book by J. K. Rowling! You know, you read the Harry Potter novels once in a while, so why not just read those? Or you're a fan of this author, and you like this person, or this book and you want to know more about it! What do I need to read?"   My favorite character is probably Harry, though. He has an honest and strong voice that I really appreciate. There's also a lot of nice (and a little smutty, I guess?) descriptions of the Dursleys in there.  
Write a positive review about a good book:      This is a great novel. I found it fascinating and engaging, and I'd like to know more about the family that wrote it and the book publishing world. The narrator, John C. Wright, has a terrific voice, and his voice carries the story.   The book is about the death of William, a young man who dies on a hike. His body is found by a young couple hiking in the hills nearby. William was a member of a tribe called the Mohawk. His family lives on a reservation in upstate New York. His mother, Lottie, is a hard-working person who takes care of her children and the family animals. She's kind, and she looks after her elderly mother. Her older son, John, is less kind than his sister. He is rebellious, quick to fight, and easily distracted. His brother, Jack, is more kind, more respectful, and he always takes care to try to help Lotties when they are down. Jack does have a younger sister, but they are a bit closer in age. Lottes and Jacks have similar father figures in William's grandfather.  "The Mohawk" is one of my favorite books, and a wonderful read. I loved it!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished the book in just 3 days.  After reading the book, I thought "If I could be a girl, this would be what I look like, my friends would call me "Sly" and I would say "Oh, you're so cool" when they ask about boys or girls." I'm not saying that it's easy to be a female, but there is so much diversity and strength in there.  I could tell you about how she talks about herself and about other girls and I'd be a liar, but I don't want to give any spoilers.  There is so, so much that happens in there that I don' t want to ruin.  If you are a girl and you want to become more confident in your body, I highly recommend this book.  Just like my life would be completely different if I was female, so would everyone's.   Posted by Katheer at 1:55 PM The only problem is that it is hard to find something about this book that doesn't just come off as cliche and unrealistic.  I do believe this book has helped some people, but not nearly enough.  So the book is really, really boring.  I love the way the author was able to explain the female anatomy, but most of the description is just... umm... pretty and I think "Sneaky-Sly Sneaky-Hairy" or something along those lines.  It sounds like there are actual words like "dynamic" and "latin" in there, but they don't make much sense to me.  But I do admire the fact that this book doesn't tell the reader to hide or cover themselves up.  In fact, if you are going to be naked for some reason (because you are an outcast or you're living in a world that doesn a) allows nudity and b) the society you live in, has laws against it, is probably very strict about it), I think this would work out just fine.  There's definitely a difference between a girl with a nice body and one with no body at all, but you get a nice little bit of variety there too.   It would be great if the authors who are writing about nudity would really try to describe it in a way that makes sense and feel realistic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I received this book to review as part of a special deal that offered two free copies of another author's book, one from a respected author and one from me!   What I got was a beautifully written story of a young girl growing up in a family that had a difficult time, then coming to accept the hardships of their situation, and finding hope through love.   Unfortunately, the ending was not good and the end was very abrupt.   I received this free book in the "special deal" that offered a free copy of a book from another author.  So it was the other author's freebie that I got. I'm still really grateful, because I think that this is the best novel I've read this year.  It has a very unique style and feels like you're in the middle of a family's life. The characters are real. The author is very compassionate and I can only imagine the difficulties her parents were going through in those times. The ending was the worst.  I am so sorry.  However, I love the author so much. It's always nice to find a book with real love, instead of a love story like so many of these stories.  This is one of the best novels I've ever read and I'd give it 5 stars.  One of my favorite quotes in the book is: "I love you, and I'm afraid I can't stand it anymore," said the girl I once was.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was impressed by this book and it was a lot of fun to read. It is a good mix of mystery and romance.

Write a positive review about a good book:   .. . I was hoping for more from this book than I got. My first impression, as I read the title, was that this was just a bunch of good, interesting, engaging, and well-written stories, but nothing that I could not have picked out on my own. My wife, though, did remark a couple of times that she felt I should not have been expecting much from a book about dinosaurs, given that the authors have been working on such stories for decades, and that they had just a couple decades to make a book that was as interesting, and even more relevant, than other books in the area. It's been quite a ride to come across the book. I think that's the only reasonable reason to keep reading. My only real complaint, on the whole, is that it doesn't feel as if the author really got to the bottom of the various questions and controversies about evolution. They did their best to tackle the main issues, but some of their explanations were too convoluted to be of much help, and others were just too simple to be helpful. But that was only a minor nitpick. It is interesting and stimulating, and I recommend it to anyone who has any interest in this subject, and especially to anyone interested in evolution-related literature.
Write a positive review about a good book:    Reviewed by: a woman who loves this book   I first read this book back in the mid '80s when I was a teenager. After watching the movies (the second is a direct sequel to the first) I was excited to see that this book was not a simple adaptation of the movie but a complete, whole-body, multi-layered, fully-realized retelling of the whole movie's plotline.   This story takes place after the movie's climax and follows a different group of characters, though it does have several themes and scenes from the movie as well as its own unique take.  This is a beautiful book that I have found to be very faithful to the movie, but I also felt that it expanded my understanding of the main character and the world of the book.  I've tried to give a brief synopsis here but I know many of the people who have read this will not care for spoilers.  If you have not read this yet and you like a lot of action, intrigue, and mystery then read this. If you like fantasy, horror, humor, and suspenseful books, then you will like this one, but read the movie first.  3/5 Stars   4) The Black Company by Patrick Rothfuss, The Wise Man's Fear by Neil Gaiman, The Name of the Wind by Patrick N. Sullivan (2003)  I've never read The Name Of The Wind, but have seen the movie. The Black Coa by the author of The Name The Wind   The Wise Men's Fear   Neil Gaimen has written some great stories.  His "Gaiman's Fables" series is one of my favorites, and this book is another winner. It tells the story of a group of mercenaries that goes to war against an evil empire.  When I saw the movie and watched the movie again, I was amazed by the amount of depth the plot has.  The only real similarity between the two stories was the name, but they are completely different from each other.  While I did not care much for this book, I did enjoy the movie (though it does a pretty poor job of capturing the mood).  If the movie had been better in quality, I probably would have had less of a problem with it, but overall it was very good.  4/5 stars  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great book about the first days of a new family.   I thought it would be a story of a marriage and family, but I thought the stories were more about the struggles of a person in his mid-twenties trying to make a place for himself in the world.  It was also a great book to read while I was waiting for my son to come home from summer camp and I had time to read it.  Recommended to a lot of people, and I am sure you will too.

Write a positive review about a good book:     This is a book about how religion in general, and Christianity in particular, is the source of all evils in the world. It's not a bad book, but it's not very good, either. I don't know why the book is called The God Delusion. As the title suggests, Dawkins thinks that a belief in a deity is all it takes to destroy a society. He talks about how there are no religious wars in the middle ages, which is true, but he also notes that it seems like there were plenty of them during the time period of his book. What's really interesting is how much it comes off as a condescending rant about religion and how it's just not true that religious differences were responsible for the end of the Middle Ages. There's a lot of speculation about why the middle classes lost their religion. Dawkins doesn't make any real contributions to this area, though he does claim that it was because the church gave too much support to the nobility, a claim that isn't entirely unfounded.  I liked that Dawkins didn't take into account how the Middle Age developed. He didn't seem to think about how the decline in religion began, or how the poor came to support the church. He just blamed religion. That's not something I can get behind. It might seem a little nit-picky, but this is what I would have expected from a guy like Dawkins who has a background in evolutionary biology, which doesn't teach about how human society develops. .  a book that might make a good companion to a class:  A lot of the information in this book can be applied to any given class. I don't usually like to use the word "class" in a negative way, but the class I teach here in college is a lot more religious than most people are. While I admit to having a "God is love" mentality, there's nothing about religion that causes my students to go to church all the time. We go to chapel once a week for the month and go to Catholic school, but that's about it. The class is pretty much like my old high school. The students are mostly atheist, but not completely. Most have some sort of vague idea of the existence of a God or gods, but they aren't that into it. They're into some sort about love, family, or some kind of transcendent being that can't be explained. We had a prayer breakfast this year
Write a positive review about a good book:      " The only downside to this book is the author, who seems to have little interest in storytelling beyond the barest essentials. For example, he tries to explain how the Great Flood of Noah, in which a giant flood wiped out many people, took place. If Noah had been a "good guy," he would have raised up the righteous to build a great ark that would have floated the earth, but he was "very wicked," and so instead of a perfect ark he let the "evil creatures" drown the world in "flood waters," which the narrator describes with very little detail. There is nothing wrong with the flood story as it has long been told, but the narrator needs to try to give it a bit more dimension and depth. "   My take:     
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book may well be the most useful, but it could have been better.   It is a wonderful story of two young boys. It is told through the eyes of a 3 year old who was born with two hearts and now lives with his two hearts as his best friends.  I thought I would just write a positive one about a great book, but when I started reading the story was so interesting I was not able to put it down, I have the book bound and I will have it for many years to come!   
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm so happy with this book. The characters and the story are well done and all are well developed.

Thank you for the hard work. This is a great read. It's a perfect story, no matter the age level. It will stay with me for a long time.

I also appreciated the clear and concise approach to many of the concepts presented, making this a book for the busy or those with a short attention span." ~  Kaitlin J. Miller, author of The Emotional Lives of Our Spouses: How Marriage and Mindfulness Can Heal and Restore Love " This book is a valuable addition to our current understanding of how the body and mind operate as they interact, and how the relationship between the two may be damaged if both are left unattended.   This is a must-read book for anyone interested in understanding how the human body works, and for those who are in loving, committed relationships with a spouse or long-term lover who is a great listener." ~ Linda Zuckerman, author, The Essential Love and Marriage: A Handbook for Marriage and Family "I will say that there are certainly more important books to be read and more important ideas to be considered when trying to understand the world of love.  But when a book says "here is how you can understand love and marriage," you can take a serious and careful look at what it says." ~Kaitlyn, author on how to understand love, intimacy and marriage "My wife and I found this book to be an eye-opening read. The book is about the relationship of the body to the mind, and the implications that come with it. The author's insights were very insightful, and we both have gained a greater understanding of the relationship that we have and the importance of communication in the life of a marriage. We plan on using this book as a guide to communication between us." ~Mark & Jessica on the value of  The Body, the Mind and the Soul: How Loving Relationships Develop "   The author goes a step further and makes the body a metaphor for the whole person.  I'm sure that is the direction some of the readers were going. The authors do a great job of describing the anatomy and the process by which the body heals itself after a trauma such as a wound.  However, the book's emphasis on the importance and necessity of a good marriage (which is what we're discussing here) has me interested in what's next.  It is good to know that we can still heal in the face of the wounds, but as
Write a positive review about a good book:         This book is one of those books that if you have to ask a lot of questions it can be a little intimidating. The book is divided into three parts: an introduction, three chapters about the history of the religion, and a fifth chapter about the present. The introduction is a very good, very good overview that summarizes the basics of the beliefs and beliefs about the religion. The three chapters cover the basic history of Islam and its history of expansion, the rise of Mohammed, the Arab invasion of India, and the spread of Islam into Europe and North America. The five chapter section breaks down the religion into five main categories: (1) the beliefs of Islam, (2) the life and actions of Muhammad, (3) the early history of Muhammad (622 to 632 A.D.), (4) the period of his death, and (5) the current state of Islam. As you read these three chapters, you will probably be getting a better sense of Islam's general structure. However, one question that will come up is how does a person become a Muslim? Why are Muslims persecuted and why is there such a strong sense of religious obligation for Muslims? The five chapters that focus on the life of Muhammad and his followers are a good place to start.   It is a little difficult to describe Islam in such a simple way, so I will try to keep the following brief. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that holds the belief that there is only one God and a belief in the one true God. Islam has a special word for God, Allah, that is derived from the name of God, as is the name "Arabic". The word Allah is not found in the Bible, but it does appear in the Quran.    It is also important to know that Islam is not simply one religion. There is an entire branch of Islam that is called Sunni Islam. The followers of this branch do not consider Muhammad a prophet, but refer to him as "Al-Mahdi". This means "the servant of God". There is also a branch of Shi'a Islam that are Sunni and do not believe that Islam's founder is an actual prophet. However some of the Shi'ite branches consider him a great prophet. There are also various branches of Islam in which a person can be born as a Muslim, converted to Islam, but not convert to Shi'i Islam. However in general, the beliefs are similar.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The next book I read was called The Great Divide by John Bellamy Foster, about the collapse of the United States and Europe into two superpowers.   He had me at The Big Idea (which I think is an oxymoron).   The book is mostly about how the American and German economies collapsed and what happened to people in the two societies.  Foster was able to pull off the best use of fiction in this area.  He has an uncanny ability to put into words some of the most important things that the reader needs to know about both nations.  To get a better understanding of why they are so similar I would have to go back and read the earlier books on the subject.  The Great Divide is a must read for anyone with an interest in global economic collapse and world politics.

The author was generous and gave us some of the most beautiful and well written writing I have ever read. It has just the right mix of character development, action and heart-warming moments. I found myself thinking about the book a lot while it was in my hands.     My favorite character:   One of the best characters was the little girl. She was a little old lady who was being cared for by her husband. She had a horrible disease that made her blind but she has always been stubborn. I think that's what made her so awesome to me. I couldn't imagine living the life her family has been living. She just had to have some peace and serenity. I love the fact that there are so many different types of people in this book, and we get to know them in a really nice way.      , I really enjoyed this book. I'm glad I read it and found it to be so enjoyable. I definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a unique read about a family and all the characters who they have.

Write a positive review about a good book:        - A good story with good characters. The author makes up the events and keeps things interesting.   - The author really knows what he's doing. The narrative and the dialog are perfect for the characters.  The main character is a young man who is trying to cope with a recent death in his family. In a fit of rage, he decides to get revenge on everyone that wronged him.  The author describes the characters and situations very well. It's clear he's a fan of the genre.  It's a fun story, filled with action and twists.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A really nice book with some interesting ideas, but it's pretty dry and it's hard to put down. I love a good, fast read and this one was hard to get through. I have to say it did get more interesting the more I read it, but I was left with a slight feeling that the book could have been longer and I could have found more details on each of the characters.
Write a positive review about a good book:    * The "Theory of Computation" by Douglas R. Hofstadter in Science (October 1957), was one of the first popular books on the subject. This work is still used to this day by both the layperson and the expert.   "We should not expect computers to be much better than any old person. We should not even expect them to be a good deal better. The only reason for making the machine intelligent is to make it good enough to run an operating system like that of our own." - Douglas R Alva Edison

Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good read with a lot of action. I got it with the free bonus of the new and improved edition.   In the first half of the book I felt as if I was watching a real-life, close up, action-packed TV show and I was really enjoying it. The action and excitement was well-paced. The main character, Jack Harper is just a good guy trying to do the right thing. He is a "good guy" but in a tough place and he's trying to get a little help from a good friend, but then it all goes bad and he is suddenly dealing with a problem he thought he was going to get over. As for the villain, he is a really evil character.    In conclusion, this is a good character-based series that I will definitely be keeping my eye out for. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had a great time reading this book.  It's not a book that's going to be for everyone but, if you like science fiction, read it.   And, even if you don't like science, read this book!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    Good to read about a great game, but the author needs to work more with his story. For instance, I am an avid Magic player (and a real dork), but I have never met a Planeswalker before that was the same type of guy I would describe as a "Dandy Dandy" or something to that effect. I do like the idea of him trying to be the cool kid, but I am not sold on the story of him going from a normal guy to a hero, or for being "the greatest Planeswalker the world has ever seen" or whatever. I think this book could be better if the author made the Dandy Dandies into the type of people that I would normally associate them with, instead of the normal "Dandies" they are in the books. For example, I would like them to be normal guys who go to magic shows in New York, and get drunk (or more accurately, get hammered and play Magic). However, if I went to a Magic show with Dandie, he would probably be a very "normal" guy who tries to impress people by being cool and talking about cards, and would probably make some weird joke. In conclusion, this book is a good example of how some authors don't always write a book that is as good as the game they are writing about.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was looking forward to this book.    I've heard good things about this book, so I thought I'd read it and see if I thought it was good.  This is the second book by the author, the first is 'Fifty Shades of Grey'.   The reason I didn't like this book is not because the writing is bad or terrible, I actually liked this book very much, just not like the first book. I would love to read more of her books and will look forward to more of them.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book. I was looking for a good cookbook for the holidays, so I picked this up. It's great to read with a group of people - everyone gets along very well, and has a good time. I also like how the recipes have some history to them.
Write a positive review about a good book:     I can't remember how I ended up with this book. I was at the local library, looking for a good novel that was light and easy to read, and came across this one by a well-known science fiction author, whose name escapes me. I liked the writing style, which was a bit rough in places, but that's a thing that happens in fiction all the time. I enjoyed the story and the premise. It wasn't something that I just read because I was looking for something light and fast, but something that had some quality to it. The characters were interesting and made sense, the world was detailed, and it ended nicely. There was a slight feeling of a lack of tension, and I wanted a little more (I'm a sucker for those kinds of things), but overall, this book was a good read. The art was quite good, and had some interesting details (the flying car, a space ship that used to be a nuclear power plant, the city the characters call home). A very good read with a good concept, and good art. The story is long, but the pace is smooth. This is a good thing if you're looking for some space adventure/adventure/science fiction. I'd recommend this to any young adult looking for the next Peter F. Hamilton.  43 of 46 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book. It's hard to say anything bad about a book that explains a system in an extremely clear manner that is easy to follow, and that makes the explanation clear to the end. It also doesn't leave any question open. There's no speculation about what happened to cause the change, there's nothing about human nature, the reason why there were different races, and there's no mention of God. You are left with no other choice than to believe what you read, or don't read, as you choose.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a big fan of the book, but i wish it were longer. It starts out slow and has a few too many pages.  But the story itself is interesting.     3 stars:  I liked the book and the art style, but the plot is very slow and boring.
Write a positive review about a good book:    * I have read some of the more recent stories on these boards and have to admit the reviews are very much appreciated and insightful. Some of the reviewers go beyond the "best fantasy novel of the year" to say the novel had the best action/adventure of the new year or best plot. * I've read "The Book of the New Sun" several times. It's one of those books that you have to get through. It is very long. I'm still trying to work out how it's that good. * My wife is a "fan" of the series and loves the book but had no idea about the books prior to this. She had read the first book a while ago. * A little "dark" and more adult than I expected. A little more in the vein of "The Shadowhunter Chronicles" * I loved the "bookclub" that the author organized. I think it was very nice and fun. I will definitely have to come back for more. * For those of you who are fans of Robert Jordan: this book is a continuation of the story and is good but not as good as Jordan's works. The first three books of this series are quite good but this one, although a continuation, is a bit on the short side. I enjoyed it and am looking forward to reading the rest.

Write a positive review about a good book:    Good read...I enjoyed this book. It is a simple yet very effective book, it is well written, but not easy to read. The author explains everything in a good way and has a good story in her backround. I found the author very detailed and easy to follow. If you are a bit confused about how some of things work (like the way a game works) it is a good idea to read this book, you will learn more than you need to know. This is a very good read for fans of science fiction and the story is easy to understand and really gives you a good introduction to science fiction.   The book has a strong plot line and I found it quite interesting, there are some good little twists and many characters to keep you reading. The story is a little bit short and the ending is not as good as I would have liked, but that is why I am going to give it four stars instead of five, since it is not that good. It does have its moments and it was a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My parents bought this book for my birthday. It was a wonderful surprise. I found it easy to read, easy to understand, and was funny. A must-read for children who like stories about animals!    A fun book for toddlers!  This book is adorable and a great way to entertain young kids!  It's a mix of stories about different animals. It has plenty of laughs to keep your little one entertained. The only thing that disappointed me is that there are only 4 of the different animals included in this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is a really nice one. There are a lot of different themes, from the mundane to the fantastical. The story begins with a man trying to return to his family (they're dead), and ends with his wife wanting to be a doctor. There is a lot in between. You can tell that this author knew how to write. It's very easy to follow along.   My only problem is that it ends abruptly. This was a really good book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My family and I loved this book. It is the second book in a series about my favorite movie/TV show, Star Trek, but the book focuses more on the characters and the world of the Star Trek universe, rather than the show itself. The premise was cool and the story was good enough to hold our interest. We've all seen TNG but have never seen the show before, so it's interesting to know more about it. And the book makes a great introduction into the world.  We've all read other books about the series, but we've never read a book about a TV show before.
Write a positive review about a good book:    Good job with the story, and you wrote the whole thing in an interesting style. I was surprised about how much I loved the main character, and I was happy to see a girl with a lot of potential. I thought the main antagonist was pretty good. But most of all, I loved how you managed to make this story about a girl's journey and how we get to see the growth of the character through the story. I have only read the first third, but this book is definitely worth a read. I just have a couple of minor complaints. I think the story should have ended after chapter 5, when the characters were in high school, instead of at chapter 1 when they went to their first day of high school. It seems like a small thing, but I wanted to see more about the character's family and the story's setting. But overall, I liked this book very much.

Write a positive review about a good book:    So I found this book because the person who wrote the reviews and reviews for it were very positive so I thought I'd give it a shot and found myself loving it!   There are so many things about the novel that I enjoyed! There's a lot of humour in it and the characters are likeable and I really enjoyed reading it.   I do have a few minor gripes but that's mostly because I'm not good at keeping up with a book that is nearly 400 pages long.  This is an older book (a little over 400 pages) but I have read some much longer books in my day and have found that when you get a book this long I find it gets a bit difficult to keep up and I generally find it's best to finish a book in one sitting but I'm sure this would have worked if I'd have finished it in a couple of days! One thing I will say for the author though (and I am not sure I can do this without mentioning the author's name) is that she really knows how to use descriptive writing.  I've only ever written one other book which is my latest short story collection so I'm used to this style and was surprised at how well she managed to make me feel the different situations, emotions, emotions when I was writing this book! I'm also a huge fan of the idea of The Great British Bake Off so this is a book I'm interested in trying out if I have some free time to read something that is set in the UK.  I was also a bit worried when I heard the price but I bought it for the purpose of the review (and it's still cheaper than the book) and there was also the other thing that made me feel a bit uneasy and that's that there are some parts of the book that are very difficult to read for me and I had to read a couple times to get through parts I wanted to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first 5 or so chapters of this book are fairly weak.   It's an easy, readable, well-written novel about a young, good-looking couple who is trying to figure out what life has in store for them.  The story has some interesting aspects, but the book does not have the depth or complexity that one would expect from a good novel.  My rating is 3/5 stars. 2/5 star:  I liked this book so much that I gave it 5 stars.  I loved the book and could not put it down.  It was easy to read, I enjoyed it, and I could feel myself going to the library and buying a copy.  If this book had been written ten years ago, then this book would have received 5 stars instead of 3.  This book is well-made with good writing and a strong beginning.  However, the book gets worse and worse.  While I like the concept of a young couple trying to decide what they want to do with their lives, it gets harder and harder for the story to progress.  At the end of the book, you really don't know what happened to this couple because they didn't tell you.  There is not enough information about what actually happened and what they really wanted out of life.  Instead of just letting the story progress, this book lets it stop when it gets to the part where the girl's brother, the guy she fell in love with, disappears.  Why is that?  I am not sure, but that is a big flaw in my rating.  For all these reasons, this isn't a 5-star book and it would have been better if the story were a little more interesting and the book had some depth.  In the end, I do love this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed reading a good romance book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    An awesome book that makes a few simple ideas very powerful.    This was a book I have enjoyed reading for a very long time and had wanted to start reading.  This is a book that I can read over and over again, and it will be in my collection for some time to come.  The author gives a very specific recipe for creating a solid system for creating and managing complex problems.  We often struggle with our knowledge of how to solve problems, but this book shows us how we can create a clear and precise framework for accomplishing those goals, and then move on to problem solving in a logical order, and from there to problem discovery and solutions.  The author is a very smart guy and he has created a book filled with good ideas and techniques to make the most out of this work.  My biggest critique of the book is that the chapters aren't clearly connected to each other and it takes a bit to learn the big picture of the topic.  However, I think that most of the techniques can be used in a variety of settings, and this book is well worth reading for someone with some knowledge of the area who is looking to build a better system.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read many books from these two authors. The characters are all wonderfully written, as are the world they live in. I was surprised to see this book was on my list as it's a young adult book, and there's a lot of sex involved. This is a must read for any young adult fan, and a really nice read for a grownup too.
Write a positive review about a good book:    " The book is a wonderful gift. It really helped me through my very difficult time. The only reason it is not 5 stars is because the last couple of chapters were very sad. But otherwise a really good book and a great gift." "I bought this book as a kind of an "adult" book (it's not in print, but the author had it published in 1985) which I thought would make a nice gift for a child. The story was fun and very believable." "It's the right gift. I really like the book and think you have made a wonderful book. It's a book that will help a child understand how things really are, especially the good side of the world."  -J.D.  From: "Kathleen S. Smith" Subject: Books for adults Dear Kathy, I've been looking for a "good adult" book since I read The Best of Everything. I think this is one of them. It is a simple story, but I love it for what it is. I was able to relate with this one because I had a similar situation with my husband and I thought this book might be able to explain it. Thanks again, Kathleen S.   Date: Mon, 3 Nov 1999 14:10:15 -0400 Kathy, This is a great book for a children's book reader! It's one of my favorites! I just love the illustrations of the house. I will be sharing with my daughters in our church.  and I don't think it is appropriate for adult readers at all. And by the way...the house was NOT on a hill. It was on a country road in the woods...that's where the book takes place in the first part. I would not consider this to be a childrens book. Thank you.  (Kathy Smith)  Kathy  Publisher: Harper Collins, Inc. . This book is appropriate only for young children who have never experienced the hardships of having a family member struggle with addiction. Children should not read it as a "what you are going through is real" book. That would not make it a good story. It can be a helpful, but not a "true story" book, for adults. (June 2001)
Write a positive review about a good book:    "My favorite book by George R.R. Martin ever! This book has everything a book needs, and then some. The stories are engaging, engaging, and most of all they have depth. This is one book you should read in one sitting. The characters are so well developed and rich, and the plots are the best in Martin's entire oeuvre."  —Hilary Mantel, author of The Luminaries  "George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire trilogy has long been the benchmark of fantasy literature. Song of Fire has captured the imaginations of thousands of fans with its magic, intrigue and characters, but Martin hasn't just written about Westeros: he's written about all the kingdoms in the Seven Kingdoms. Martin is not just a master storyteller: he has a keen knowledge of geography, history and economics. So it is no surprise that the stories of his epic fantasy series are so compelling. While the books are full of action, intrigue, romance, political maneuvering, and battle scenes, Martin never ceases to surprise and delight readers with his rich and detailed descriptions of everyday life in his fictional lands."  The Washington Post "This is a great book to read in a slow, leisurely, almost meditative way. If you're reading this book to learn about history, geography, economics or politics, well, it may take you longer than expected to learn the first three." It's a bit of an open secret that George R R Martin's epic fantasy novels are a bit long. There's a reason for that. Martin, in a way, does a great deal of world-building. He's written his novels so that the reader is constantly reminded that each region or kingdom has its own specific dialect, its own unique geography, its local histories. And then, of course, there's the music. So imagine your brain on cruise control for an entire book. Or at least it should be like that for some. This book is a bit more than the average fantasy book. It will require a little bit of effort, patience, and attention to detail. But it is well worth the effort because these books have so much to offer.  While Martin has told us so much about Westerosi history, his writing is as rich as ever. The character development is excellent, from the moment one begins reading The Winds of Winter (a book I recommend especially for fans of House Stark) until one reaches
Write a positive review about a good book:    In case you're interested, I have a good review of the book here:  The book is written in such a way that the reader is able to understand most of the points but will have to turn to the internet for a few details about the specific topic.   The book was a great read, even though I found that a couple of my questions didn't have a clear answer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In addition to a few fun and easy bits (which are the things you always want in a book) this book has some nice stuff in there, especially the "Dalai Lama on the Other Side of the Mirror," a little bit about Tibetan Buddhism, and what is it about the Dalai Lama, who is the incarnation of a Tibetan Buddhist figure from a very remote location, that makes him so inspiring to people? The Dalai Lama has a long and long history in Tibet. He started as a political prisoner at the age of five and was released by the Chinese government in 1950 after some years of detention (the Dalai Lama is the only one of the world's 1,500 Tibetan Buddhist monks who has never been back into Tibet). He later went on to teach at the University of Hawaii and the University at Albany, and eventually went on a spiritual journey to become a "god-man." There are other stories about this "god," but this one, which focuses on the Dalai's experience in jail, is the most interesting. He was released from prison in 1972, which seems to be the happiest time in his life. In 1971, he moved into an apartment in New York City. The Dalai "looks" a lot like a rockstar in that first issue. There is a lot of information about the Buddhist path in Buddhism and he has a few quotes from Mahayana Buddhists. I was hoping this book was going to be all about the Buddhism stuff, but I found a few interesting bits in it, mostly in the form of quotations about "love." A lot of the quotes are from his father, Lama Tsongkhapa. In this interview, he talks about how "love" and compassion are the very essence of Buddhism.  .  The "Dale Carnegie" effect:  While this isn't a "classic" book, there is some fascinating stuff in here, such as Dale Carnegie's first job as a publicist for the Dalai lama. After his first job he became a "cult spokesman" for the Tibetans and in 1974 he became the first American to be given an audience with the Dalai-Lama, and he gave the Dalai a copy of the book, which was later given to Bill Clinton. I found some interesting quotes in this book, like how Buddhism is the one true religion in the universe and if it isn't, then God is not omnipotent. Another interesting quote is from "the Dalai" himself, when

Write a positive review about a good book:    Reviewer: Me The main point of this book is to discuss the various factors of the relationship of the Church with a minority group, and to show that this relationship has a historical and sociological foundation. The author has a good grasp on both history and the sociology of minorities. He uses the term "minority" in the sense that the term is often used in history: an ethnic group or nationality that is discriminated against in certain areas of society. I agree with some parts of this analysis, but find the conclusions to be far too pessimistic about the future of the church in this part of the world. For example, in the United States, it is estimated that 3% of the population is black. The majority of Americans do not share such views; yet they are still a minority in the country. Likewise, the church of China is not going to disappear in the near future. On the other hand, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is relatively small in comparison to the Chinese church, has not yet accepted that the world is divided into many races or ethnicities and that this division is permanent. The Chinese church is still a small church, but it does not have the support that the Mormons have in the West. I think this book should be read in combination with the book by Peter H. Johnson, The Church in China. (Johnson, p. 14.)
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an extremely engaging and enjoyable novel that does not rely on the "big bad" in the usual "graphic novel" mold.   There are many twists, turns, and turns in the plot that will keep the reader on their toes.  The main character has a lot of character development and a nice arc throughout the novel that is well-written. The first half of the novel is quite enjoyable as well, but it can get a bit grating toward the middle.  I recommend this novel to fans of the genre who like their action and romance to be well written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "   When I first picked up this book it seemed like a great read. After reading it I found that it was a bit lackluster and boring. I guess I was expecting a very different type of story from this book but this book just wasn't very interesting. It doesn't do much to build up a story as it is basically a recap of the first part, so it is a bit confusing as to why the author felt the need to do so. The story isn't overly deep nor does it leave a great emotional impact on the reader. As for the characters, they are pretty one dimensional and don't make an impact on my opinion of the story. The two main characters were kind of bland. The main character wasn't really developed at all, while the other main character was a lot more fleshed out, and I think the author could have created something much better from her character. Lastly, I felt like the story was rushed and it didn't feel like there was enough time spent developing the plot as it seemed that it took so long for the two main people to realize their feelings for one another, and there is only a couple scenes that really had that feeling. Overall, this is a book I didn't recommend to anyone, but I do recommend giving it a try if you are looking for a good read."
Write a positive review about a good book:    What do you like best about this book: The good humor that you get from a very sweet and silly story. I like how the characters of the author's and her husband's love story are realistic. I also like how well the story was developed throughout the book. I liked how the couple got to know each other. Also, when I read the story in the last part, there was a very touching scene where the couple shared a kiss. It's very touching, as if the author was a part of the couple's relationship. What could have been better: I am a bit disappointed in the author for not including the first part in the book in a different edition. It could have given a better feeling for the story.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really loved this book and really want to read more by this author. It's got a real feel to it that is very well done. The characters are very well developed and each have a special thing that makes them memorable. I liked how the book kept the mystery in mind as well as the character development.   This book made me think and I really enjoy reading mystery/science fiction/fantasy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The world is too chaotic for any one human to control it:  For example, when a group of young people are having their own problems with bullies, the only person you can call on is your ex. You can't find a solution to the situation, and when things get bad, you end up having to spend a lot of time on the Internet, making your own videos about the bullying, and trying to solve it.    There are also people who can give you a lot more advice than just about anyone else and are not afraid to share their opinions, but their advice may not be correct and their knowledge is incomplete.  I love a good fight:   It's hard to be perfect; a fight is just as good.  This book is a great book to bring a group together.  It's not a romance that's going to keep everyone engaged the whole time, but it's a book that gets the audience invested and excited to see who wins the next fight. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    You're looking at a book that I bought a few years ago, and I really think it's the best way to learn. It's about the life of a small-town girl from the South, who gets picked on and beaten by her classmates, but through dedication and the help of her best friend, a strong girl, she turns her life around. It sounds like a classic story, but it's much more than that.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a great, funny book. It has lots of great jokes, a few too many, but overall, a good, funny read. The characters are very unique, and you feel like you're learning about these characters as they live their lives.   One of the things I really enjoyed about this book is that it does not contain a single happy ending, which is rare in books. It's about people trying to make it in the world (which is an interesting challenge for a young boy). You will feel like this boy is trying to get his act together and his best friend is trying too.  This book was definitely a nice change from the typical young adult genre. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked this book. It's good that a book is written by a former military personnel, and I liked the stories and the details in this book (especially the use of a "T" shaped marker as a symbol of honor/shame). However, I was disappointed in the book. The main character, the soldier that was captured on D-Day, was described as "a man in a perpetual state of denial." He was the one who didn't believe they were going to die on that particular mission. I felt it was a poor decision to use a book like this. The fact that he was so convinced that they would be victorious, should have been something that made the book interesting, and in my opinion, it didn't.   The "revision" of history books is not a good idea, especially in a time when the media can be used to "teach" history in ways that are highly questionable and untrue. The use of book revisionism as a means to spread disinformation is something that should not be done in any way, and particularly not by a military service or a history book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   It was a good read. It made me laugh out loud, especially the story about how a woman tried to kill a man. That makes me laugh more now than when I was reading it. That story about a man who would rather have his cat shot and eaten than see a man be allowed to touch his woman was funny as I know the woman did try to do the killing herself but failed (she was so dumb). The second story where the two of them got into a fist fight was funny (not the best writing but funny nonetheless). As for the next two stories the author makes a mistake and doesn't follow the logical conclusion that a woman who's always trying to put herself over a man should do the same when it comes to him being nice to her. But again, I'm not so sure it's logical when you think about it, especially since it's a woman that goes after a man and tries to kill him. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    (The first 10 or so pages is basically the beginning of a movie where the characters are introduced) There are a number of scenes where the writing is really amazing. It feels like you are watching a TV series from the 1960s - The Flash TV series. There is a sense of humor here and they don't seem to be afraid to use some of the classic movie tropes that we have grown accustomed to over the years. (A couple things that caught my eye, the scene of the "hateful" and the "benevolent" characters were really funny. I also thought the scene between a "curious" woman and her husband was very touching and very well done). The writing was very good -  I did not find anything too over-done, everything was very well balanced. I liked some of her dialogue a lot more than I expected, I like how she could say things like "I'm having trouble writing" and be just as humorous as she was. There was a lot of good character development as well, the best being the fact that she really didn't want to kill the man that was keeping her son at home. She did eventually take him, but she really had to. She was very upset about not being able to be the woman she wanted to be.   (One thing I didn't like was her having to constantly hide the knife on her kitchen counter.) The character of the woman who was not quite as happy as she had made herself out to be was also interesting - she was very intelligent, had a successful career but still had some issues with her mother. There were some really nice character development moments with her and the other women. I really liked all of the supporting characters in this book - they all had something to do in this story, and I was glad they were there. The ending was very strange - there were a number things I really wanted to see happen but didn't - the final fight was nice and cool but I'm a little sad that it didn't go that way.  I do think that this book should have been longer but it was a very fun read. I found the story to be really well thought out and the world to be well put together. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the classics but wants a bit of a modern touch.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been reading this series since I first heard of the series back in the mid 90's.  It's an old series and a new series but it still holds up as a good fantasy.

The Good : The writing was absolutely amazing and it is very original in its writing style. The story was well written. The only real issue was the beginning.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was just looking for something to read for a weekend or whenever I had time, but didn't want to pick a book from the library. I am so glad I found this book! This book has all the ingredients of a good read! It's a nice mix of science, history, and a little romance. The book also has a little humor in it, so that's always a plus. I really enjoy these stories and the way the author wrote them. I can see myself reading it again and again. The cover is gorgeous too. The book was very well-organized, the only thing that I did want changed was the cover. It wasn't the best, but at least it wasn't that bad. Overall a great read, I recommend it!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book because it is a classic and I was curious to find out how it was different from its predecessors, so far so good.   The new version is better than the first one and the introduction is shorter and more detailed than the previous one.  It is still very enjoyable to read and it does a good job at creating a different version of the original.  The main characters are both extremely likable (except the main villain) and the story is interesting and fast-paced. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    (Don't give the book as a gift.)  The title says it all:  "In the dark of night, an innocent victim of the terrible crime of the year walks through a city that she has never seen before; her world is changed forever. She learns about herself, about the world she now calls home and about a man who, despite everything she knew and everything she believes in, was always there for her. Through the eyes of the victim, a story is told about what happened during the night of November 5th, 1985. The story is of an innocent girl, who was raped, tortured, murdered and then discarded in the dark, and her story is shared by the one man who found her, a man called 'The Driver' who is so important to her that she gives him a name and the last name of her rapist." - From the author's blog. "In these twenty-eight years, I have been able to look back and see that something happened on a fateful evening, something that changed my life forever; something that, had it not been for my father, would be a memory rather than a piece of my life, a memory of a place, of a time. As someone who has only known the city of Detroit from a distance, I am pleased to have been a part of the experience. I look forward to hearing about the journey that lies ahead." - from the pre-order page.   (There was a problem with the link. I fixed it. -Igor) (A.S.)

The 'Promise' book was much shorter than this one, and if I hadn't read the other books then I wouldn't know that much about the events of this book.) (S.E.)

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. The plot was interesting, well written, well paced, and the author's imagination was interesting.   Unfortunately the book didn't work out as well as I thought it would. The characters are bland and uninteresting and the action scenes were boring, to say the least.  It would be interesting to see where the story takes us next, but I won't be holding my breath.  This was a fun read but I didn't care for it.  "And the last you are to come.

This review is from: THE HARDENED ROSE: The Legacy of R.J.M. DeMatteis  Posted by: Robert James on April 28th, 2011, 9:10 am I really loved this book, and can't wait for the next in the series. This book, like many other of DeMattes work, was very well written and well paced.  The book begins with a very creepy dream of the protagonist in which a woman is being murdered. The dream has been affecting her for some time. She and her boyfriend go back to his house. They go in, he is on the bed.  After they go into the house and start looking for the murdered woman, a very powerful, evil-looking man (who seems to have been the first to kill her) approaches them. He then tells her that she has to do something in return for helping him. If she doesn't, the woman will die. So she has no choice but to go into his home and kill him.  But before she kills him, the man appears to her. He tells her what she has just done was wrong, but that she must do it. She refuses, and then tells him she doesn avenge her sister's death. The man gives her a dagger, and tells her the two have a choice. He can let her live, and they can be friends or he can kill her.  She decides to kill him, but at the last second decides she doesn't.  This story is great. DeMatte's writing is excellent and there is a great deal of detail in the book. I
Write a positive review about a good book:    In my opinion, this book is an important work on the psychology of music. It is filled with examples, many of them excellent. And it includes a very nice discussion of the role that music has played in a variety of cultures, from the earliest forms of music (caves) to modern-day performance. However, there are some rather strange and unnecessary ideas about "sophisticated" music, and also a couple of the book's more strange and nonsensical assertions. I'll cover the more interesting of those in a minute.   The first of the many good ideas in the book is that music is a kind of language.  I can see how that would be confusing for someone like me, who knows absolutely nothing about music, to be able to understand. But the author gives some really great examples of the connections between certain kinds of music and certain kinds (and levels of complexity) of speech.  For example, the author describes how certain kinds and levels of music can be very effective in triggering certain kinds or levels of empathy, and he presents evidence that this is a universal human trait.  It is also possible to understand how certain types of music may be more effective in helping people to develop new skills.  But I think that the fact that the author is able to draw on so many examples of music making and listening to make this point is probably a good thing for me, but probably not for others.  I would be happy if the author would have spent some time looking at the specific kind of music that he is talking about, and maybe a little more time getting into the nuts and bolts of how he did that.  If we go to some examples of actual experiments that have tried to figure out the connection between music and various skills, it seems to me that the results have been mixed.  The author cites many studies that show no effect, some of which actually showed positive results, others that showed negative results, some that showed mixed results, and most of them that found no effect at all.  However, some have shown effects, and some show mixed results.  While there are several good reasons why this might be, I think it probably has to do with several different factors. The most important one is probably that the experimenters were mostly very young (the average age for the studies that I have seen was 16), and the kids were probably really into music (the "music" that the subjects were listening to was probably all
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book is written in a concise but well-chosen language with plenty of pictures and diagrams to reinforce the points it makes.   It is definitely well-written, but unfortunately there are some very obvious flaws that do not make it easy to understand, or to understand the details of the points. The main problem is that the book tries to present a large amount of material very quickly without the same quality control that most books have.  Some points are very easy to make, some are much more difficult than it seems, and some of the "tricks" are very hard to understand.  There is also an unfortunate tendency to skip over the material that is not relevant to the main points and move on to other material.  The first chapter, for example, starts with a long explanation of what you must have in a gun, but doesn't go into much detail about the kinds of guns or what kinds of gunpowder are used. This is just odd.  Also, in the end the author says that gunsmithing is very easy and takes about 6 months. This makes no sense.  A lot of the details, such as how to shoot guns in the jungle, are easy to find online, but most of the other things are not.  One chapter is devoted to how to repair your gun, and that chapter is full of very vague instructions about tools and whatnot.  After reading all of that I realized that this is just more "sales" and "educational" material. It doesn't give a good overview of gunsmiths and gunpowder, but it makes up for it by making a lot of fun, informative, and interesting exercises. The next chapter covers how to make a sling, and it is a really good book.  It gets you started with simple sling construction, and also covers the various types of sling bullets.  This is a very useful section to cover, because I know a lot more about sling bullets now than I did when I was trying to figure out how I could make a good sling. This section also gives some very specific instructions for making sling ammunition, which I did not know about. The chapter then goes into a whole lot of details about how to design, build, and repair military and sporting weapons, which is a good section.  What is really missing, though, is a clear description of the types of weapons that are available in the U.S. These details are very important if you are thinking about

Write a positive review about a good book:   I got this book in an e-mail from a friend who suggested this. I was hesitant to read it, because I've read so many of these, but I have to say that I had a very interesting and enjoyable time with it. It was very well written and it wasn't too hard. The main plot is just that, and it's fairly simple but not boring at all. I enjoyed the characters, especially the two main characters. One of them is very well developed and I found myself wanting to know more about her (she is a princess of a kingdom) and her situation. The other character is extremely interesting but the plot didn't seem to fit well with her as I could see that the authors knew that a part of her story was to keep her from getting in trouble. The last bit of the story is pretty good as well and I can see why it was cut, but it's not so bad as to ruin the book for me. Overall, this is a fun read and it really helped me feel like I'm in a fantasy world rather than a book world, which is what I usually enjoy. Highly recommended for those who are a fan of fantasy, who want something new in the genre, and for those of you who like good action and fantasy.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This review is the first in a series where I'll share my thoughts on a book, and try to share my own experience reading it.   In this book, author A.D. Wise writes about how he was inspired to write a book about the early life of the founder of the LDS church.  When I first read about this book I was skeptical about the author's motives.  It turns out that there was no attempt to gain any sort of fame, but it seems he simply wanted to tell the story of one man's experience.  I am a very humble person and tend to believe in a higher power, but I felt like it was not enough to let one man have the spotlight on his life and then to turn around and tell the church about that story when I was raised in church. The book is not only a great read, but a great story about one man and his experience. It is a testament to the LDS culture and its emphasis on education and learning, as well as the impact that church leaders had on the lives of other people and how the leaders and members came together to make the church what it is today. I am very interested to read a few more books about this man and if he can tell us a little about how the story was told from his perspective.  In my opinion, the book was a great first step in learning more about the man, and I am glad that we are being introduced to the lives and stories of others like him. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am going to be reading this book again for the first time and I just finished it this morning. The plot is simple enough - a simple yet fascinating tale of an eccentric man and his mysterious cat who is just a bit out of this world. I did find it a little hard for the characters to get much going, as it took a few reads to really understand who these people were, but overall this is a really good book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I purchased this book because I read a few of their books online, and my favorite was The Secret. I have to say, though, that The Secret was one of the few I had actually read.   This book, however, is so much more than a simple collection of stories about the paranormal. It's about a man, David, who is haunted by the ghosts of his father and a brother, and his relationship with his mother, who feels as though her son is dead. I love the characters in this book, and how they each have their own issues to deal with, both at the start and at the end. There is a certain melancholy to the book, that I love, and it comes from the real person that I feel like I've known. I hope that I continue to read these stories, because the stories are really good, and that we get more insight about the characters than just their paranormal abilities. It will be nice to see more about David and his mother as she struggles to overcome this curse.     8/10
Write a positive review about a good book:      I've tried some other self-publishing books and the results were not as good as this one, so I'd recommend to those looking for a good read. 5 out of 5   I don't know why I waited so long to read this book, I am so glad I did. A must read book, you can't go wrong with this one. 4 out of 4   This is my first foray into self publishing and I'm very impressed. I received my book in a timely manner.

It is definitely a keeper for me, if you're looking for something new and interesting. 3 out of 3   It was quite short, but had a lot of interesting information in it. I'd probably pick up a book of this on a short read. It was not a bad read. The story was interesting enough. It will not leave you wanting more, but it was interesting and would be fun to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    Like   The first two episodes of The Walking Dead, " Safe Haven " and " New Day ", are a lot of fun, even if a certain element of suspense is lost by the end. The action is good, and the action sequences are fast and intense. This is the first time we are exposed to the walkers in any detail, and in the first half of the episode they only appear on the edges of the screen. They are a fairly scary sight for the viewer, and they do look good. In fact, they looked even better on the Blu-Ray, especially with the new 3D effects. The second half of " Safehaven ", the episode in which Rick Grimes becomes a walker, shows us that he is far more than the walking corpse that he has been portrayed as. While the first episode shows the walker in a more passive and slow state, the second half reveals Rick's character development to have taken another turn. Now the walken is a powerful force to be reckoned with, but it is still Rick who leads them, and he is still in control. When the walkons attack him, it is Rick who takes the first blow. The walkers are much more aggressive and unpredictable in this second half, with much more physical contact. This episode is the best of the season so far, and if you haven't seen it, you need to. The only issue I have is with the lack of development, and that can be a problem, especially in the mid-season, when all of the episodes tend to have the same storyline, and sometimes even the same cast.  - Cliff Click Stars To Buy The episode in the middle of Season 5 in which Carol, Michonne, and Andrea are infected by the walked is a pretty nice episode, and quite scary. There is quite a bit of tension as we see the three of them struggling against the walkies, especially Michonne who is struggling with a lot more confidence. The scene where she is fighting the walkie is very effective and well shot. The tension, the tension, all those tense images have you thinking, "is this really happening?" " Are they really going to turn me into a walkie-talkie? " - Andrew Click Stars to Buy I found the second episode of this season much better than the first. It is much more action-packed than the previous episode, it has a more balanced plot, and it isn't just the "bad
Write a positive review about a good book:    - I have to say that I'm thrilled that this was a book I could enjoy. I'm going to say more on the characters later on, but for now, I want to mention that the first few chapters were fairly slow and tedious. However, once I got used to this, I realized that the pace would be much faster if the story weren't such a mystery. That's not to say there wasn't anything of importance in the beginning--the first three chapters, especially, are well-paced and are filled with suspense, drama, and action--and if you're interested in romance, then you might not want to give this book a chance, but the mystery is really what drew me in to read the book.   It was very difficult for me to put my finger on what was a part of the mystery, but I'm guessing that a character had gone off the rails, the police were looking for them, and they were all in some way involved. I found the first three, fairly slow to begin with, but then I realized they were building up to a huge climax. This final chapter also had a very intriguing plot development and was a lot more satisfying to me than the previous three. As for the characters, I did enjoy all three of them. But they didn't have the same depth to them.    I highly recommend this book for all. It's one of those books that I'll definitely look into in the future. I've always been a mystery fan--I'm a little more into them than romance--but when I came across the description for this book, I knew I had to read it. I actually think that there was too much mystery about the plot for a romance series--I know a lot of romance readers are into this kind of thing--but since I don't own the series, I decided to start this book. I have a feeling that I may end up reading more of the novels.
Write a positive review about a good book:    " I feel the need to write a positive message because there is a lot of negative out there. It's not easy when you are a woman to be a positive voice in our culture." "I am writing this review to warn people about the upcoming "Frozen" sequel "Fairest of them all"  The book does a great job of giving readers a little bit of background to the story. However, I believe there is also a lot in the book that makes me uncomfortable."  " The books are well written and detailed, but I feel like they got away from their goal of being a book for girls and instead became something else. It really reminded me of "Hocus Pocus." " "Overall the book was an enjoyable read. I feel a little uneasy about it, but in the end I liked it. I think this book will be fun to read with all the girls in my family and as the mother of two girls who are avid fans of Elsa."   The book is available now on Amazon.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was thrilled when I picked up this book on the recommendation of a friend. She's so sweet and has a huge heart. She also loves horror movies and I feel like I was able to connect and relate to what she was saying about this book.     The book is the first in a series, but not the only book in the series. In the first book, we have a girl who is a member of a society that believes that only those with a supernatural power can be a proper witch. She was raised to believe she was this special little witch and her sister was so close to her, it felt like an immediate connection. She and her friend are hunting and fighting ghosts and evil creatures from the past. This book is very similar to the first. It's also similar to a horror film, but the film is actually scary.  This book has been a great read for me. I feel sad that it's not the sequel to the last book but I'm glad it's here. I'm definitely going to keep reading and recommending.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am absolutely in love with this book. It is the perfect book to listen to while driving in the rain, it has something for everyone and it is one of those books that will take you somewhere new. It will keep you interested with every word, so long as you are not bored to tears.  I've tried reading about every horror genre out there, and I still can't quite put my finger on what this book is about, what exactly is the "tough guy" thing about the stories that I feel is so interesting about this book and makes them all worth reading. So maybe it's not about a "realistic" character, maybe it is a "dream" character that's not really real, but this book I find interesting and very scary for sure.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    One reason that I keep a lot of books I've enjoyed around is because I remember how I felt and what I loved about it when I was a kid. This is a book that made me feel that way.   It's got a really interesting story about a person who lives on the opposite side of the universe (from our main character), yet shares the same soul with him. It's a very different kind of book to be sure, and has some pretty cool sci-fi elements that I found fascinating. The main character is named Thea, but I prefer "Sandra" as her name sounds more like something out of "Star Trek" (the show).   I'm not going to ruin too much, since I found the book and will keep it to myself, but it's one of the books I feel like I can share with anyone who may be interested.  Thea's world is a lot like our own, except that its inhabitants have been split off from us (sort of like the Klingons from Star Trek).  The book's premise is actually pretty neat, and I found it to be quite original and interesting, especially with how it deals with the difference in human society.  If you liked any of the Star Trek books by Roddenberry (and I do - I still have my first hardback of "The City on the Edge of Forever" ), you'll probably enjoy this book. I gave this book 4 stars, and in doing so, I've read many other books that I've been highly impressed by and which I enjoyed. Thea is a great character to read about. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    Recommend:   This is a very interesting book about a group of Russian prisoners of war. I do not think I know how to comment on the history of the Russians during WWII. Most of the things we know about Russia during WWII are based on the writings of the Western journalists or from the writings made by western correspondents (for example, see this article by John Toland). The books published by the US were mostly from the Western point of view, and most of what the Russians themselves did during WWII is not discussed. There were two books by Russian writers about the war (Drakhov's memoir and Durnovo's book on the liberation of Stalingrad). In the end, however, the most interesting books were made by Russian soldiers. A few years ago, I had the pleasure of meeting one of the authors of these books, Oleg Drakhov. He is a Russian army soldier who was captured by the Germans and fought until he was wounded by a German grenade. While on his way back to camp, he was killed by a sniper. His memoir is filled with great stories about WWII. This is probably the most readable book I've read about the history during WWII, but I did not see any points in the book which are not already covered by the above books.
Write a positive review about a good book:   In the introduction to this work, Professor Maudlin wrote:  The most comprehensive treatment I have yet seen of the phenomenon I am studying. I have the feeling that Dr. Maudlins work is not finished.   This is certainly true.    The book is certainly not over, but there are certainly some interesting and important questions left to be answered.  And the questions to be asked would appear to be, at minimum: Why is it that the average American is no longer a religious believer? What is causing it? What are the causes of the increase in non-belief? How can we best respond to those who are turning away from religion?   The answers to these questions are difficult to answer without a much more detailed understanding of what religious faith is and the reasons for its existence.  There are no shortcuts, which is perhaps why the religious are not keen to be forthcoming about them.   There are several ways to answer these questions. The easiest would be to go right back to the beginning of the last century and ask how religion has evolved throughout history. This would be an interesting and fruitful research project.  It would also be an excellent study for a graduate course. It is a good idea to read the introduction, which gives some history on religious beliefs in the United States.  But as a professor, I felt that the questions I had about religion were not adequately answered. For example, a large percentage of our population is without a religion (see chart), and it is a fair assumption that as we have increased in population, we have had more and more non-religious individuals. Is that a fair conclusion? Or does a good answer exist? If religion is dying in America, why does it seem to be dying more rapidly in some areas than others? Why is this happening? Are there any good explanations? The most complete study of this question appears in the book The Long and Winding Road: How Religion Is Being Wasted.  That book is a superb and scholarly study.  I highly recommend it. I did not go back to it during this study, but will use the information there as the basis for my next analysis. I will attempt to summarize the important points made in the introduction of that book, and give my own opinions on them.  I think I have covered all the bases of the first question in my previous article, The Death of Religion in America. I am sure most of you already know how religion
Write a positive review about a good book:    In my opinion, it's a very well-written book that gives you an inside look at the development of a popular genre and gives you a unique view of the lives of two major figures in the field.   My review    This is an important book for those who love sci-fi. The author covers a lot of different areas in the book, not the least of which is how science fiction came to be. The introduction, though it is an interesting read in itself, doesn't really tell you all the story. I recommend reading the book from start to finish, but the book could be a lot shorter with more of an intro. This book was a very enjoyable read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    You could call my review about "The Drowning Girl" a "rebuttal," because I think the book does a decent job of portraying a pretty good world in a realistic fashion. A girl dies, she's eaten by sharks, and she's found by a fisherman. She's been there a month, and so she's in "recovery," though she's just getting by and the people around her don't seem to think of her as having "recovering." Then the shark attacks. So: The book is a good first book in a series, though I think it's a bit more linear and predictable than I prefer. But the world is pretty fascinating, and I'm still learning more about it. My favorite part is that there's nothing supernatural in the world, which I like. And there's just a lot of good character development, which is nice. There are a lot more surprises in this book than the first two (or even most of the first three). The setting is pretty unique and interesting, and the characters are all very human, which in this world is the rare thing. (The only weird thing is that the two sisters are not cousins, which doesn't make much sense to me, because they're supposed to be cousins. Maybe there's an explanation in the next book?) "The Sea of Stories" has been getting a lot, lots, LOT, of positive reviews on Goodreads.com for a while. I've never read it, so I don't know what the critical consensus is, but the consensus is that it's an excellent and very believable first book, with lots of action and a great protagonist. I'd love to read the series.   "The Ocean of Stories: A Tale of the Deep by Peter Orullian" by Patrick Rothfuss So this is a book, I guess, that I've heard of, but have never heard of. Basically, it's Rothfus's sequel to "The Name of the Wind" that's basically his "prequel," though it's only a few hundred pages long. It's a sequel to a book called "The Kite Runner," though, which sounds like an awful lot of effort for the small amount of information it gives about the original. The only thing about the first book that I liked was the title, which, for my money, sounds awesome. The first part of this book is about the two main characters.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is the best non-fiction book I have read on the subject of money and economics in the United States.   A must read for anyone interested in economic freedom and personal freedom, it should be required reading for anyone who has a serious interest in the economics of the United State.  It does not go into the weeds of economics, it is focused on the essentials.  This is a very good book that should not be missed.   Reviewed by John F. Pappas, PhD on 5/29/2014  An excellent read. This book not only covers monetary theory, but it goes into the background of the economy, explaining what is really going on. The author is highly knowledgeable and the book is filled with good information. Highly recommended.  Comments  comments

Write a positive review about a good book:   . Goodreads is a wonderful platform for authors to share their latest work with their audience.   I have downloaded and read a number of books from the Kindle store on my Kindle 3, and a number from the KDP store.  I am very happy with my experience so far.   Goodreads is an amazing tool.  It really helps you get a feel for the books you like so that you can make a decision on whether you want to buy the book.  They allow you to rate a book. I'm rating my favorite book, The Hobbit by J. R. R Tolkein, 9.5 stars.  A really good and exciting book for young children.  This is just another in my long line of fantasy books. It is my favorite so far and is a perfect introduction to a character like Frodo and Gandalf.  All the other books in the series are great too!  I love reading!   The Hobbit by J.R.R Tolke.  As mentioned above I have purchased the first three books.  The only things I think that are missing from the series is the second book (The Return of the King). That is really my only criticism.  My wife and I read it in one week and it was so hard to get through that we didn't get to the end.  Also I don't think I can recommend the first two books that much because I am really not sure what I was expecting from them.  For instance, Gandalf is pretty much a complete blank character.  Gandalf just doesn't have anything to do in the book and never really talks about himself. In The Hobbit he is the king and in The Lord of the Rings he is Lord of Rivendell. This would be a good start to an epic saga.    As for me I'm on the first book and have read the first 3.  While I do have one major complaint with the book, that is the use of a white horse as a symbol of the Ring, I think I would still like the series.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked this book. I have a lot of sympathy for the authors. I'm not sure how this book would be different were they the authors of the book. It doesn't matter. It's a very well-written book. The story isn't what makes this book good though. It has great writing, good writing and characters, and good dialogue, it's all very much there. It just wouldn't be my first choice. For the first book in the series I'd recommend to anybody. This book is a worthy follow up.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was intrigued by a lot of this, but also very skeptical. It felt like a little of everything: The book is funny, the characters are interesting and well-written, but there was something missing. The mystery was very good, but I couldn't quite get it...The pacing felt a little too slow. The conclusion to the first section was really cool, but it didn't come into play here. I think the author could have used some more humor, which I could have seen coming, but the ending felt a bit "let down" and not exciting enough. And of course, there were some very "cliche" scenes: The "hilarious" ending was especially bad. This wasn't a bad book by any means; but this is a book I'm sure I'll come back to at some point, but not yet. I will give this book four stars, but that may be a bit much.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It's not exactly the perfect book but it's very good. I love the "dark comedy" that is so popular now but in the early 1900s was all the rage. I would have liked more of an emphasis on the sexual side of the book but I like that the author is an "old school" author.  12 of 12 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:   The Dark Tower   ( Stephen King )    There are two books I'd describe as good in the King way:  1. The Stand   2. Carrie   While I've yet to read The Stand, I'm excited to try out Carrie.   And to be honest, I haven't read The Darkest Minds   very well so I have a lot of catching up to do!  Good books:  And this is my review. I've already mentioned one of the books I'm most looking forward to- The Stand- I haven.t read that much so I'm looking forward for the first time to reading this.  I'm also looking forward  to reading Carrie - the name comes to mind first and foremost.  Here's a quote from the author about the inspiration of the book:   "    I wanted to use the words as closely as possible in order to avoid any confusion. It was hard, though, to translate the complex and enigmatic language of a dead man's memoir into a readable narrative. I think this was the most difficult task I've ever had to perform as a writer, and one of my biggest disappointments.    The first thing I noticed is the vast amount of dialogue in this book; even King, in his introduction to The Dark is Rising, said "a lot" of words. This may have been intentional. But I think I should have realized that it would be necessary to keep this enormous volume in the same font as the other books. That is, I wish I could have kept the font of King's own signature on the last page. That font just looks like a monster." The story is set about 100 years after The Stand.  The main character is Roland Deschain, who is still a young man at that point.  The book starts as the main character wakes up in a strange house.  He has no memory of how he got there.  Roland finds a "carved door" that leads to an old barn.  There, he is taken in by a couple who live there. The couple is Henry and Lucy. They are the "good" guys.  Henry is a gun collector who has a gun named "Tommy Gun" and a woman named "Polly".  While in the barn, Roland discovers a book.  This is the book "The Gunslinger". It tells about the last journey of Roland

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read a lot of fantasy novels, and while a few of them have stood out to me, I have to say this was one of the better ones. The worldbuilding was good, the characters were well fleshed out, and the characters had some growth. The story flowed smoothly, and I enjoyed the magic system. There was just one thing I found really annoying: The main character, Tormund Giantsbane, is a dick. I'm not saying that his character arc was poor or anything, but he gets a lot worse after he has the dragon to do his bidding. There were other aspects of the book that were weak and/or unnecessary, but I'll get to those later. One thing I didn't like about the book, but it's something I don't think would be too detrimental to the plot, was the fact that the author was really quite lazy. Not so much in plot, but in the way he used a lot (or, more specifically, how he used the characters). For example, one character spends most of the novel in a dungeon in which he keeps other characters prisoners. This is a bad idea because it gives the other characters little to do, because they can't do anything without being killed. I suppose this is a necessary part of the fantasy genre in which there's a lot going on, but not for the reason it seems. In fact, it might have been better to leave the other character in his cell. At the very least, the author could have made him a more interesting character with more than a few moments in which to show off his ingenuity and courage. There are also some chapters that seem to have no idea where they're going or what they're supposed to do. But that's a minor complaint when you take into account the vast amount of information that is conveyed to the reader, and how well the author handles the world. For those who don't care much about the worldbuilding, there's something to be said for this. I just wouldn't recommend it to people looking to become avid readers in a genre that's already pretty dense.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first time I've had an audiobook I didn't like. This is not a criticism of the quality of the book, but an honest assessment of a book that I wanted to love, but didn't. My first experience with this book was a surprise. I've read so many of the series I was excited to listen to this. Then I read the book. I have no idea what happened, but I know it didn't go well. I think I got so caught up in the characters, plot, and events, I didn'st pay attention to the book's narrative structure and story. I'm not going to make a statement about the character development or world building, but a lot of my problems arose from the fact that I didn' t take time to think about the story as a whole. I wasn't reading a well crafted fantasy, but just an easy-read one.   So, I'll review my experience on my personal level.  I'll start with the characters: I really liked all of them. I could never quite decide on a favorite, but for the most part I liked all the main characters. It was interesting how many of them were changed in the course of the story. And I have to say, this book is very good at making you care about the characters. They were well-developed and the events that took place made you feel for their lives. I liked that they felt real, even if they did have to come to terms with what they were going through. I loved how the world was revealed and how much I was invested in the story's progress. I also liked how the characters developed their own lives. It made you realize that sometimes people have to change in order to stay who they are. I was also disappointed with how all the characters were described in a very stereotyped way. It seemed like the author tried so hard to show us all the good and the bad. I don't think I'll be picking up the next book in the series. I'll keep listening to the other books, but it's not looking good. I wish there was more focus on the world building. I'd like to have seen some more detail on the mythology.
Write a positive review about a good book:    (1) If a reader has just started reading and thinks there is nothing new to learn, this is a good place to start.     (2) There is a lot of good information in this book.  In fact, this book has been cited as a good resource by several others who have already read and have found it useful.  The chapters are structured to include important topics such as how to get your first book published, how to negotiate with agents, the economics of self-publishing, the writing process, how good writers approach the book industry, what is a traditional book deal, how a book is sold, and the economics for book marketing.  I also found it very interesting and easy to read.  There are many good sources for information, such as book reviews from various publishers, online forums, and my own personal experience.  You can get a good general overview of the publishing industry at the beginning of a book, as this is written specifically for book writers.  If you are a self-published author, I would recommend this book to everyone.  It is a great way to learn about publishing and publishing in general.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I thought this book was good until I got to the final couple of chapters. I have a problem with books that have an ending that is not very satisfying. I don't believe I'm in a very strong position to say how this book "was", but there were parts that bothered me a lot. The fact that this book can't figure out a way to end with a cliffhanger, and end the story on a somewhat satisfactory note for the characters, is what bothered me most. It's all very nice and I would have liked to know more about the other characters. The author seems to know how to write a good mystery, but the ending just didn't seem all that satisfactory. I'm still going to buy this book but I might not have the same high rating as I would like.  5 of 6 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:    "A terrific read and great for children and adults. A very nice story!"  This is a children's story, but the concept is universal - why would anyone turn down a great story like this? This is an interesting book about a new kid in the neighborhood, who is kind of clumsy and loud and stubborn, and is really smart when he has to be. He doesn't always get along with the neighbors because he wants to be the center of attention. He is one of the only kids in the house who doesn't have any friends. When he does have friends, he sometimes has to fight with them for attention because he thinks they are being mean. When the other kids ask him why he does things like that, he explains his reason for doing what he does.

Write a positive review about a good book:    When I read the first book in a trilogy I got hooked immediately. It's about a young girl who is going through a breakup and who is trying to keep her relationship alive while dealing with what it means to be transgender in a world where being transgender is frowned upon. The book is short but it is filled with powerful moments.     The second book in the trilogy follows the girl as she goes on a school trip with her best friend and finds herself drawn to a boy from a different neighborhood.  Best story collection:    I loved this collection. The stories are beautiful and I liked each one very much.  In a way the stories were like different chapters of a different story but I think that's just how the stories came together. The short stories have a lot of heart to them.

A nice little book with a strong focus on character and a nice ending.  You can find the book at:   Amazon  or in a Kindle Store   I recommend this book as a must read.  You won't regret it, even if you don't like to read romance. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read the book, and it's a really good book and you should get it on your list. It's hard for a book that was written by a famous person, and if there's ever a reason to get a book about him, this is it. It is a story about an astronaut, a writer, a man with a deep passion for his craft, and the many trials and tribulations of being an astronaut. There are also other parts to the book that are really good, and that made me want to read the other parts just because of what I've learned from it. If you have only read the first half of the book and enjoyed it, then you're in for a treat. You get the astronaut, his passion for the craft, his love for writing, his struggles, his relationships and his life as an astronaut and astronaut trainer. I enjoyed reading this, and I hope the other half of it I read is just as good and worth reading. 5 out of 5 stars It was a joy to read! I thought I was reading a biography until I realized I was actually reading about a book! This book is fascinating and inspiring. One of the best space history books ever written! I wish the author had written a sequel book that would take the reader behind the scenes and get a glimpse of what it's really like to be an astronaut! I'm not a historian but the more I learn about space history the more excited I get about my space career! I hope my space-loving children read this book.

I have read the books in the series so far, and am just about finished reading the first, which will be the conclusion of the series as we know it, which I highly recommend. For those of you who may be reading this review because you are new to the series, the series is based on a series of short stories by James S.A. Corey. While most of the stories are set in the present time, there are a few flashbacks and other time periods, and in them, the characters are dealing with the same events that we are. A lot of the scenes feel very believable to me. This series should please those who like time-traveling stories, or those who enjoy time travel/conspiracy thrillers. The characters are all unique. The author has tried to write a story that would make an action-packed and suspenseful thriller and has succeeded in this regard. For me personally, I enjoy the story that Corey has written here because he has tried very hard to write in the style of the great writers of the genre, and I think he has succeeded. I hope that readers of the books will enjoy the books too.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have purchased many books on a wide variety of subjects and this is probably my favorite of all of them. I read this at the recommendation of my wife. My wife, she is very interested in the martial arts, had read a few books on it. This one is the first book she's ever owned that she enjoyed. I think it's an entertaining read and I really appreciate that it gives you some tips on how to go about learning how to make sure you are a good martial artist as well. It was a very useful book and I will use it as a reference from now on. The information is in no way complicated so you will be able to understand it even if you are not a martial arts fan. The cover is very informative as well, especially if you plan on giving this book to a friend.Read full review

Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book because I was looking for something good to read. It's been a good read so far. I love the characters and the settings and the story is compelling.   The characters are complex and the plot makes you care about the characters.  I will probably be reading other books by this author as I can't wait to see how the story continues.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was so looking forward to reading this book. I really enjoyed it. This book really is an insightful look into the life of a former cult member.    My rating: 4 Stars This book does contain a lot of valuable information and experiences that have been hard to find outside of the cult. For example, it describes how each new recruit is selected into the cult, is given a "life mission," and indoctrinated with the idea of a "Higher Power" who is guiding them. The book also describes how all the leaders in the cult communicate and relate to each other in a highly structured way.  I really can't recommend this book highly enough. It has a very clear, informative and entertaining message about why people become cult members. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I didn't like this one at all. I think the plot is bad. I thought it was a story about a mother trying to save her son from a cult which he will have to escape from in order to save himself, but it is more of a story of her wanting to save herself and trying to escape to save the son. She doesn't really seem to want to save him. The only one she loves is the son she is leaving for college, but they can't get to her son because his father is in prison. She is also too worried about getting her son to get the money she wants so that she can pay for her son's college. The father of one of the men in the cult tells her that he is going to kill his daughter because she won't marry him after she goes to college. This is not exactly a nice family, but I thought the author did a good job at making the bad situations more realistic. The author didn't try to make the family likable.   What did I like:    -the way she portrayed the cult is so real. If this were a movie or something, I would have said this was really realistic.  -she does her best to make sure she is not in the way of her son and her other son's friends. She tries to keep her distance from them.  with her work schedule it was hard to read a book without thinking about work or homework. , and that is a problem. I read this one just to get it out of the way. I was glad that I did. And yes, the book is not a romance. I enjoyed reading this. This is my favorite book by this author so far. I haven't really finished this one yet.

Write a positive review about a good book:    If you enjoy this book, you will be delighted by the amount of new information on the topic and its value in treating depression and bipolar disorder. If you have suffered from mood disorders, the writing is easy to understand, and the information is presented in a way that is nonjudgmental and does not give one a false impression of a person's illness. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    (The "PENIS, MATE!!" story)   It was so refreshing.   I didn't know how to feel about this book.  In the past I felt a little  embarrassed about my "sudden" need to read this book after a long hiatus.  There were things I couldn't relate to, but I kept going back.  And then I came to this scene where I realized that this was a book that was completely different than the previous book that I've been reading.  The plot was very intriguing and I'm curious to see where this novel goes.

Write a positive review about a good book:    (i don't know why it's necessary, but it is, at least here.)   I'm not a huge fan of historical fiction. They're always so long and so verbose. They tell me a story and then leave me to find out what happened. I don't want to. I want to read the actual thing. And not just any old history: I want a book that tells me the actual history behind what happened, not the half-truths and falsehoods and fabrications of the past.   So I'm glad I read this book. It's one that I'm sure will be quoted many times in the years to come.
Write a positive review about a good book:    So I loved the way the author and her editor handled the "sour grapes" issue (they really should have made the book more of a love letter), and the conclusion. I would recommend it to all who like fantasy, or just for the sheer enjoyment of it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   . -   When I was first offered this title, I knew it was a gem in the making. The book is set in a world where dragons have become an endangered species. They are hunted by humans for the right to eat. The author, Jon Skovron, makes this setting come alive. It is beautifully crafted. The fantasy elements come to life like nothing else. I was also drawn in by the author's writing style and his unique way of presenting his world. Skovrons writing style is full of humor, charm, and fun. He is a good story teller, and he makes the reader think. This is a great fantasy read for those that enjoy dragons and dark fantasy stories. I would recommend this to anyone that likes dragons, dark fantasy, funny, and a good read!
Write a positive review about a good book:    *I was skeptical to start but I was hooked * I don't usually write these reviews so forgive me * I'm a writer who writes a book a year so far * I have a hard time thinking of the words to describe this * I loved the book! *The author describes what life is like for those who don't have children - the challenges, the hopes, the struggles - but does not use the word "childfree" * It's a fun book about life * The ending is well written and is emotional and makes a great point about being a writer * If I'm ever a writer I'll be reading more of these!
Write a positive review about a good book:    -I found the story very intriguing and the characters were very likable. -I thought it was very unique and original and it gave a very vivid portrayal of the world and people in the book. -The art was very nice to look at.   I was so surprised by the ending of the book because I wasn't expecting anything like that.  -The story was very enjoyable and I thought it had great potential.  It was an amazing book, but there are several problems with it. The biggest problem is that the book starts off very well and then it gets progressively worse. The whole book I really enjoyed and thought that it was a very good read. It started out like this: A boy, and a girl named Sarah, get stuck in the world of the Dead. The boy has the ability to read the minds of the dead which he uses for all kinds of useful things such as finding a missing friend who has left her. Sarah is the only one who has the power to read minds and the story develops from there. The story was interesting and it had some really good twists. The first book was very short, but I think that the second book ended very poorly. There were a number of characters that were introduced in the first book who were never mentioned again. There was a lot of confusion as to what was happening with them and when did they die. I felt that there was a bit of a let down at the end of the second volume because it was so rushed. It didn't even take place entirely in the Deadlands, but it felt like it could have been. It would have been a much better book if there had been time for a bit more explanation as to why things happened the way they did. It is clear that the author is a talented story teller and he could have done a much more good job with this book. The last issue is that there were several characters that I felt were forgotten. They were never really explained or given any more character than they had before. I didn't care at all for the guy with the giant sword that I always heard about. He only appeared in one book, I never saw him again and I never got to know what he looked like or anything. Other characters that are introduced seemed to be forgotten altogether and there were characters that just didn't seem to add up with one another. The writing was very good. It was very vivid and interesting and I was sure that the characters would get into
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book does NOT live up to its claims. It doesn't offer a balanced view of the pros and cons of a nuclear power system. The author states in the preface that he is "not an expert on nuclear power but am in no way qualified to criticise its benefits and cons". He offers no analysis of the issues surrounding nuclear power, and fails to acknowledge that the risks from nuclear power are very different to those of fossil fuel use. The first chapter, in which he describes the risks involved with the operation of nuclear reactors, is woefully inadequate. This is the first place where the author reveals his ignorance, and I am sorry to say that we can expect the rest of the book to be as badly researched and written. After a little thought, you begin to wonder whether there is even such a thing as a good nuclear power book. The introduction is in the usual style, with a brief introduction, the author's view of nuclear power and a discussion of the costs and benefits of this energy source. He has no real background in the subject matter and, as the book progresses, his opinions do not change. He makes no distinction between the risks and the benefits of nuclear, and seems to argue that the benefits outweigh any risks because the world will be free of famine, nuclear weapons etc. I cannot recommend this book to anyone on the grounds of factual accuracy or scientific knowledge. We should all be very skeptical before accepting a book as an "expert" in a subject in which the author is clearly not an expert. The book has an agenda and it is to promote the nuclear industry and its advocates, not to inform the public about the risks that it faces.   The book should not have been published at all. It should not be on sale in bookshops. The writer and publisher are so desperate for attention that they will say anything to achieve it.   the writer and the publisher are afraid that the public might learn about the downsides of nuclear technology. I agree. If nuclear plants have to close down because of a problem, we all lose. That should be the point. But it seems that the authors do not care about the consequences for humanity, and are more concerned about their own political agenda.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really like the book and like the cover and the artwork and the concept.   Overall the book is really well put together and it's easy to read and follow along.  I liked this book very much! It is a really well done book that doesn't rely on any specific skills.  The book has great diagrams to help you keep track of things.  It is really interesting and a good read.  I would definitely recommend this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think it was great. I liked it so much that it made me feel like I needed to read more. I really want to read the sequels but it is only $1.99 on Amazon so I may just have to wait until I can find them on sale.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have to agree with the above review, and even my own opinion of this one.   This is a pretty good book, and I wouldn't even consider it one of the lesser-known of the Lovecraft stories. It's very different from Lovecraft, but still has that familiar feel. I like the fact that Lovecraft uses the "miasmic" to evoke a feeling of the unknown.   is a novella written by Lovecraft, who wrote it when he was in his 60s, which is a rather uncommon age for writers these days. It was reprinted by Arkham House when they re-released a number of Lovecraft's work as a series, and they also put a new cover on it.is a very simple story. One man's life is transformed after a bizarre occurrence, but he'll have to live with the damage for quite some time.is an extremely powerful story, though. It combines horror with fantastic ideas, and that alone makes it worth reading. I'd also suggest giving this one a shot with a group, just to get a feel for it, as the language can be quite dense.
Write a positive review about a good book:     I am a huge fan of  The Hobbit  and  The Lord of the Rings  films.   I also love the book series, but  The Silmarillion  is my favorite.  My two favorite scenes are the scene in the Elven-king's chamber, when the hobbit Frodo (and the others) escape from the giant spider and they hear the High King's voice saying, "In those days the Valar had power over the world: the Vala had power."   The second is the moment when Gollum is released and says, "I am freed!   This scene just makes me smile.  So glad Tolkien wrote such a great story!  I was always interested in the elves and the other Valar, but never got to the main story.  So many characters!  It's very exciting to see all the different versions of the Hobbit.  The Hobbit is more like a fairy tale and not a historical novel, but that's okay.  One thing I can say is that this series is written really well.   There are so many characters in this series.  You can easily keep reading this series if you like fantasy or if you are a fan of Middle-earth.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good and well written book about a little boy who becomes a giant. This story is full of life and humor.

Write a positive review about a good book:    In a year with so many great books (including many of my favorites from last year) The Last of Us makes the list. I will definitely be reading through it again, for sure.   This is a book that is so well written and I really hope that they bring the story to a close. This is one of my favorite books of the year. The best aspect is, if there is a sequel, it won't just be just the same things, but also the same characters. This book will give a great story that will be hard to top, and it will give you a great experience at the end. 
Write a positive review about a good book:     This book was well written. It is a fun read that is not at all preachy and definitely will make you want to read the rest of the series!  
Write a positive review about a good book:   A good book on marketing that I had to read for my dissertation. It is a quick read but covers a lot of ground. I like the format, the authors don't give any short-cuts to a formula. It starts from the premise of being a salesperson (which is how I sold products online for 10 years) and takes you from there. I had seen other sales marketing books but never found one that addressed what I needed. I found this book to be really informative. The research is excellent and if you read the whole thing, you will learn a lot about the industry. One thing I did wish the author did differently was use some of the techniques that are used by salespeople in their presentations. It can be distracting and you end up wondering what the author is doing while he is talking. So for this reason, it wasn't for me. I do recommend this book for people who want to learn more about the sales business.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you are an old fan of fantasy, or just a fan of good writing, you really should read this book! It's a wonderful mix of old and new, it's a very exciting story with some very original ideas about dragons, the magic of the books, and a whole lot of action! The magic system was a bit different, but I like the whole idea of a magic system which is a kind of self-regulating mechanism. So I can say this is a solid fantasy debut, it has my highest recommendation if you are a fan or fan of historical fantasy. If you have only read a few fantasy books, I think it's worth reading this one. If anything, it might make you think that you should start reading some more classic fantasy to expand your library, but this is an enjoyable story with lots of action, magic, humor, romance, and all the best aspects of fantasy.
Write a positive review about a good book:     "We all have some ideas about ourselves.

Write a positive review about a good book:    So far, I'm really enjoying this book, though I can't say I know of the author's works or can say anything about the subject matter as a whole. I guess that's because my experience with the series was limited to a few hours of reading in a bookshop in a small city outside of London. My main problem is that the book doesn't get into the details of the story (like how does someone become a killer/shifter/necromancer/etc). But that isn't my fault as the author seems to not be interested in the detail and focuses more on the main plot, which is cool I guess. I'm also a little disappointed that the story doesn't seem to go anywhere in particular. Like I said, it is really starting to get good and I'm looking forward to what happens next.
Write a positive review about a good book:   .   If your not a fan of fantasy, you might not like this book as much as I did. But if you like fantasy, this is the book for you.   Fantasy has always been the genre that I can relate to, whether I'm reading a fantasy novel like Terry Brooks or a fantasy book like Stephen King, because in both cases I have read them and I understand the emotions that they create in the reader. In both cases, it's that feeling that you get when your imagination takes hold of the world around you and turns it to something that you feel comfortable with and that you're able to empathize with and get behind. The way that this book does so is that it builds the world, the characters, the world of Tamyrlin and the world she is based on, and the characters in the story are in love with each other and have to make tough decisions. But then the characters also have to deal with the repercussions of what they do. And that's where the author shows off her ability to make you feel the emotion of the moment and then to tell you in such an immediate way as to make it seem very natural.     The book is very fast paced, and it gives you enough information so that it doesn't really require any foreknowledge. And yet it still provides enough to keep you interested, and to make the book even better. In the last two thirds of the book, the author does an incredible job of building on the romance between the characters. And all I'm saying is that if you are interested in romance, you should try to go get this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:       The best part of this book is that I don't have to remember the title to understand what's going on. The characters and story have their own voices and personalities, and if you're a sucker for a mystery story and think you know where this is going, then this book should be a hit with you.
Write a positive review about a good book:      I have loved reading about the adventures of a young boy and his dog after a flood destroyed their home. It's been a long time since I have read a book that has so much emotion and love.   I'm on the fence about this book but really liked the story.  The whole family just seems like a really great family, even though he's only two.  Overall this was a great read and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for something to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    - I found the story and characters to be quite entertaining.   I enjoyed a lot of the character's reactions to the new environment, and the story developed nicely.  I think the story is fairly well told with many interesting events.  - The characters feel well-rounded with the main characters and minor characters being somewhat well-developed.  This book had a very strong plot with some very nice twists.  The best parts of the book were definitely the ending and the characters' reactions to it.    - Although the plot is good, there are some inconsistencies between the events described and what actually happens.  As a result, I felt like I was reading a book in which the story changes a lot and events get slightly out of sync.  Also, there were some very minor character developments, which I had a hard time getting invested in.  Nevertheless, this book is a good read if you like fantasy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:      I bought this book because I needed to have something to read during a time of great sadness.   The story was good and well written.  I thought it was a good balance of sadness and hope.  In conclusion:    This is a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   For the most part, I liked The Way Things Ought to Be  . In spite of the author's strong points in favor of freedom, the subject of slavery was not as well-researched as it could have been, and the overall quality of the work was lacking.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A must read for anyone who wants to get to the bottom of a conspiracy, or a big deal. The only thing I can add to this review is that I am glad to see the author's "Suspense" is still alive, and I hope it doesn't die out for the same reason that "The Truth About 9/11" seems to be coming back, too: The evidence is irrefutable.

And to get her back, she must venture to the forbidden lands of the forest where a great evil lurks: the Witch of the Waste. This is a wicked story with a good payoff!

Write a positive review about a good book:    If I want to write a good review of a good novel, I tend to first try to determine whether the novel's strengths and weaknesses are more or less favorable, or at least different.   This can be difficult because many books that I think are excellent will also seem to have some weaknesses.  For instance, A Clockwork Orange has lots of good passages, but it also has lots   weaknesses. To a novelist who loves an epic style and an intense story, A  is a strong book, but not at all to a novelist looking for an intellectual challenge or a challenging novel.  I've found that I can often find a good quality novel that isn't as good or entertaining as some I've liked but that is nevertheless a good story. If you can find a quality book that is more intellectual than a traditional novel, a good thing about it is that you might learn something new about your favorite genre.
Write a positive review about a good book:     I have found this book to be highly helpful.   This book is the most up to date and concise resource on the subject of learning languages and the resources I have found on the web.  The author explains in clear language how to learn a language and how it works from a practical perspective.  I have spent countless hours trying to learn Spanish and have never come across a better resource.  Thank you!  The best resource to learn about learning languages.  I'm not going to write too much about this, but the main point that I can see from this book is:  When you use a lot of resources in an attempt to improve your knowledge, you may be missing out on the most important thing.  It's not that you need to use the best materials to improve in languages; rather you should be focused on mastering the basics and building your confidence as a speaker.  With that being said, there are some useful resources on this site that I will link out to later on.   I'll start with the ones I think have been most useful.     : Learning a language is not always a straight forward process.  Many people find it to be a lot like "trying to catch the flu" for them.  There are a lot that find themselves feeling very frustrated and anxious about the whole process.   This book, "  Learning a Language "by Richard E. Friedman,  is aimed at those who have some idea what they're doing and are hoping for an easy process. However, the author does not shy away from challenging concepts either.  For those people that are not sure what they want out of a language or feel they aren't ready to start their journey, this book may just be for you.  To start with, he goes through the language's basics, how they work, and the general concepts.   In the second part, he breaks down each of the main concepts into specific steps that you can use.  Finally, he walks you through a few simple exercises that will help you master the language.  After you're done with the second half, the third part is what makes this book so unique. It's called "  How to Learn ", and in it, you will find the most comprehensive resource I've found so far.  This is the first language that is based off of a "real-world language".  You will learn how to go from zero to fluent in two
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am an avid reader. I have read every single book in the entire trilogy in the last three years. I love these books so much because the story is compelling. It is a complex story, filled with magic, and also is very dark. It does not hold your hand, but it is worth the read. The characters are interesting and interesting characters is a key to a great book. I give this series five stars.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If I would have known about this book I would've bought it sooner. I bought this as an intro to learning Russian, and the book was quite easy to read and get the point across in one sitting. I was also a bit concerned about the language learning section (I am a language learner and don't feel like it's easy to pick up some of the vocabulary I'm using), but the author made a very good case for the use of a language immersion course and her personal experience.
Write a positive review about a good book:    You'll see that the writing is solid and the characters' motivations and emotions are well-written. The story is a little too short to really be exciting, but I do like the concept of the story.   It has a bit of a slow-build and then a quick action.  It does feel a bit like a prequel to one of the "Star Trek" movies, but it isn't, and the concept is interesting enough to keep me interested in the plot.  "This isn't a prequels or sequels, this is a stand alone novel." There are some bad reviews for this book.  And there are some good reviews.  I don't really know why people get so worked up about it.  A prequel is an excellent idea.  If a writer tries to fit the entire story into a single book, then they need to cut out a few things.  Like for instance, we are still not told how "Shada" and "Dudley" met.  That's a whole new story line and there will be a lot of "Who is Dudley?" questions.  So that's why the book ends where it does. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As a college student I have to say this was a great experience! As someone that has recently taken my son to the library for his history and the world history books. He loved it and thought it was really interesting. It was a pretty well written book and I really enjoyed it. The book wasn't too much of a shocker to anyone that has studied world history, so I thought this was something fun to read. I think some more children books would really be great for younger students, especially in the sciences. Overall, I would give it 4 stars and would definitely recommend. For younger children This book is just a must read, and I would absolutely recommend to younger kids.
Write a positive review about a good book:       This book helped me improve my speed and my accuracy in my shooting. It also helps my confidence when shooting at targets and close up. It will definitely help me out! It's a great way to improve! Thanks for making a great book available to the world at no charge. by: TONY RAY by  JENNIFER HENRY By: ELLEN ROBINSON  My name is Ellen Robinson. I have had an interest in shooting for more than 25 years. I started shooting at age 15 and have a good understanding of the fundamentals and my ability to shoot well with a lot of practice. My passion for shooting has never waned. By Joe:  By  Michael:  This is an outstanding book and I recommend it to all who are interested in improving their shooting and the quality of their marksmanship. " The Secret of the Perfect Rifle" is a concise and well organized account of the science of modern firearms. It provides a logical foundation for further study and practice in the field.... This book is indispensable to any serious firearms practitioner" (National Rifle Association) by J.H. BURR By Richard:  In my opinion, this is a very good book for beginners and a good tool for more experienced shooters who are considering the purchase of a new rifle. It's not a technical manual by any means, but more of a "how to" for beginning shooters on the fundamentals of the field of shooting. The authors cover the main topics that one needs to know in order to do well in a field encounter and I found the book quite useful. It has a good balance of theory and experience to keep it interesting and accessible to both beginners and more experienced shooter. The authors clearly demonstrate why it is so important to have a solid foundation before you can attempt anything like advanced shooting. The author's knowledge of the subject matter will be of interest to all shooters. Most importantly, he covers the most important topics and provides a useful explanation that will likely serve to inform a beginner as well as an experienced shooter and explain why certain practices will be a good choice over others. He covers some basic ideas in the beginning, such as choosing a suitable rifle and setting up your scope, then goes on to describe in detail the mechanics of a perfect rifle. I found this book very easy to read and very thorough. I believe the authors know what they are talking about
Write a positive review about a good book:    1.    A  book about how to  be a great writer.   The book is written very well.   There are very clear descriptions and explanations to every bit of information.  The author talks a lot about the different elements of a good story and the way in which each one affects the other.  I am really impressed by the author's writing style.  2.  The main character is really intriguing.  For me, her love of the arts has always been interesting.  It is not as strong as it could be.  There is a lot of sex in the book and she is not that far from my age so it may have been a bit unrealistic for me.      She does end up having a nice relationship with a guy who also does artsy things with his art.  She also has an older brother who is very much into art and is also into a lot, in fact more than most people I know.   3.  He goes down and comes back up as a nice little guy.  This is good and bad.  On the one hand the story is written well. There are a lot more character development than I could possibly ever hope for.  At the same time the story kind of ends where it does.  3.5/5 is a good score. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm writing this review in hopes that the title isn't taken off my book case.   I bought this book when it was released and was looking forward to reading it as much as the other reviews mentioned.  It is a great story that does a great job portraying a character through the book. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good book:   There are times when I think that I'm reading a bad book. For the most part I have never done that, but there have been times when a book has really let me down. This time around it was a book that was really bad.

Write a positive review about a good book:     What I think about this book: This book was interesting. It did make me think a bit about how we choose how we want to live our lives.   The main character is a woman named Tilly. She is a mother of three and her husband is a truck driver. She wants to be an artist but the government is forcing people to work and keep their heads down. She hates the whole idea.   (hide spoiler)   This is one of the most interesting books I've read. It's a book that will have a lasting impact on you and hopefully get you thinking about some of the things we do every day.   is an interesting book. There were times when I thought that I had gotten the whole picture and I was in love. I think if someone gave this book to a group of people who weren't artists this could help them a lot. It is a fascinating book and has something to say about a lot of issues that we have. One of the best things about this story is that there isn't a clear cut answer. Tilly doesn't have an answer. She really just tries to think about the bigger picture and get to the heart of the problem. That is something I could definitely relate to. I would have liked to see more of the family, maybe they had an answer but it was still very interesting. This book is very well written. I loved every little detail. The book is well told and well thought out. It makes you think about a LOT of things and I really love that. I love to read about a different perspective on a lot things. This was not a book about how much the government should interfere with people's lives. I definitely have a lot to think on about this one.is an interesting and interesting read. I really enjoyed it. This is an excellent book to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    If you're a writer, reading this book can be a good way to keep a book or series fresh in your mind or in your writing routine.   The authors did a good job explaining the principles behind each of the chapters, and each of them contains some good information for a writer.  It's not always necessary to spend a lot of time on a chapter, but the information is still useful.  There are some good examples of the kind of questions you can ask.  They also give you some practical tools (some of which might be useful in the future).   I really enjoyed this book.  I recommend this book to a lot my fellow writers.
Write a positive review about a good book:    There is nothing more satisfying than getting a book you love so much.   When I received this book I was a little scared, but I really wanted to love it too. After reading the synopsis of the book, it's clear this is a love story, that I am not the only one, the love story of two different people that end up together and fall in love, which I love. I love all stories where people fall in-love and get married and are happy with the relationship, I think a couple of stories like this is what makes a story great, it brings out the best in everyone involved, in this case two people, a man and a woman who are in love but don't know why, I like that a lot too. The main problem I had is the start of the story.  I think there was way too much romance for me to read and not enough romance between the two main characters. I would have rather read about their relationship with each other and their new life together.  Also it took place too early in the story, there was a lot of the two of them getting together too quickly and it didn't take enough time to know how it would work and develop. Overall a really fun read.  This is a really good read about two couples that end-up together. The author had me really entertained from the beginning. It took a while to get there, but once it did I was so happy. I am just in love with the way they are written, they are both really good, so I had to put up with the romance, it just didn't matter.  My wife had her first kid and the book got her through a difficult time, the characters are great and their relationship made it really easy for her to forgive the child who was very cruel to her. She still cried though. My only complaint is that it is only at the beginning and then you're left wondering what will happen later.

Write a positive review about a good book:    My review   I've read a lot of books. I don't get the sense that my tastes are all that different than most people's. Maybe that's because I'm so interested in what goes on in the mind of other people, so it's hard to get too hung up on what I read. So, the fact that I was interested in this book was a surprise, and my expectations were not met. My main disappointment was in the execution. This book does not have that same momentum, that same sense of excitement, that the other books have. It starts out with a great premise, and the author clearly put a lot into making this book. She takes a bit of a backseat to the main character, but she has her own point of view. It's a good thing she did, because the main issue with this book is the writing and pacing. It doesn't pick up until the last half of the book, and by then it's a bit worn and it doesn't work. As someone who's a fan of fantasy/science fiction, I want more excitement. The action, excitement, and magic are there, and I like when books are fast, fun, and thought-provoking. But the last third of this book has a very slow build-up, which I don and think is not well done. I wanted to find out what happened to the characters and the world, and when we don't find out much about them and the setting, we find out a lot about the main plot. The first half of this is fine. The second half is not. I'm disappointed in this. It will be difficult for me to pick up another fantasy series by Stephanie Allynne. I look forward to reading other books by her.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My son had been reading about a vampire. It had all the right ingredients of good fiction. It was believable. It didn't feel like fiction. The story made sense. The characters were likeable. The plot and twists were interesting.   This is a fantastic book for a child.  If you know someone who likes horror and fantasy and are looking for a good mystery, this is a good pick. I got the book at my local library and read it on my own. The book has been on my shelf for years. I still want to pick up the sequel.  If you know a little bit about horror and have read the previous book by the same author, you will not be disappointed. The novel is really good and has some suspense. I do have a few minor gripes about the characters. The main character is a teenager with a troubled past and who is a bit of a loner. This is the kind of teen that I would like to have around as a role model. The villain is very evil and the villain really likes his power over people. I think that the villain could have been more clearly defined so that he didn't seem so villainous at the end. If I could give this book more than 5 stars, it would be. I found the book to be very well written. The only complaint I would have is that some of the plot lines in the book seemed to have a lot of potential and potential for a series. However, the author's main focus is on one book. If you are looking to try a new author, I would recommend the series by the author and not necessarily the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read a number of reviews of this book, all of which express similar sentiments. I personally found this to be one of the most fascinating, thought-provoking, and well-written books that I have ever read.   The story begins on the first day of the New Year, when young Michael (or Michael 'Boomer') is visiting the home of his uncle, Joseph, to talk about his impending entrance into high school.  After some discussion about various subjects, including the relationship between religion and science, Michael decides to take a look at some science classes taught at his local public high school and finds the curriculum to be anything but rigorous.  He does a little research on his own, and discovers that some of the science teachers at his school have already been fired for inappropriate and non-existent teaching.  Michael decides that the course on the science of water is the least offensive, so he goes to the classroom and sits in on some of those classes.  As he sits through some of these classes, he is struck by the fact that some teachers use a number  of different methods of showing water to a student.  For example, they will bring a glass bottle up to the student's desk to make water flow out of the bottle.  And they will also use various devices to try and make the students turn their heads toward the water, with one teacher even having to use a hose to do this.  When Michael confronts the teacher about this, she gives him the same response he would have received from some of his own teachers, telling him "there is nothing wrong with using your eyes".  Despite all of the techniques used, some students will still find that they can't turn their head, and that they just don't understand.  To show them that they do understand, the teacher will have the students stand on the edge of their desks and drop a pebble into the water.  The students will be unable to see what happens after the drop, but at least they will be able to see that the pebbles have made some water pour out of their glass bottles.  Although Michael has come to the conclusion that there are many ways to teach water science without violating the students' rights to their own eye views of the world, he wonders if the same should be true for everything else. So the next day, he attends the local science fair, where he sees some pretty impressive exhibits and is pleased that so many of his peers are
Write a positive review about a good book:    Good read as a whole, but not sure about the characterizations. This was a tough read for me because I found myself having problems with the characterization. The way she described her life with her husband is as if he was a monster and the only reason she was alive was to keep his secrets and abuse him. That's really not how a marriage works but that's the type of book she writes and I don't blame her for doing so. She also describes him in such a bad way that it seems like the main reason she married him was to have him abuse her. That wasn't the case but I felt bad for her. Her main character was also a monster, yet I felt she was a good enough writer to make him human, if not sympathetic at times. The writing style isn't something I would want to read again, but I still would recommend it for a good read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was in a hurry to read this but was pleased that I did. The book is well organized with useful, easy to read information about the different methods of making the mushroom powder.

Write a positive review about a good book:    What was I looking for?   A good book, that I like.   The story was good, but the characters didn't seem that deep and complex.  The only good thing that I can say about this book, is the cover. I can't wait to get it and start reading the next in the series. (hide spoiler)  "If I can stop thinking about him for a moment, he's already dead." I have been reading this series for a while and I think I have fallen in love with this story. This was a nice change of pace from the action packed novels I have recently read. The only problem is that I have a feeling that the book is not over with. The final book may be even better, but if I have to wait until it's done, I might be a little disappointed. I have read reviews of this book that say that this is an unfinished book, but I really didn't get the feeling that that was the case. The main character is still alive and well in the world in which this book takes place. The story is still unfolding and there are plenty of twists and turns to come. The author does a good job of introducing the characters, but it is still the same characters, so I'm not sure that I will be picking this one up. I am still going to give it a solid 4/5 rating just because the cover really does capture my attention. (view spoiler) I am so happy that this series was released in a paperback edition. I feel like there should have been a hard cover version available and I really hope that this story will be picked up by a publisher. I will continue to read the other books in this series, but there is really not a lot to compare this book to. The one good thing is that this book is only 9 pages long, so it is easy to read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    To give the author credit, she does an admirable job of describing all the great things about a place. However, at the end of the book she gives the reader a map showing every single place in the book as though it was the exact location as it was portrayed in the story, so that readers have to travel to each place in order to read about it. Not only does she do this, but she also fails to make it a good thing. She does not show the many other towns throughout the world, so one can only assume she traveled there during the course of the story. In this way she gives readers a map that is not useful to them, but that will be of great use to anyone who will attempt to walk the Earth, and not get lost.   If only the author's map was this good, we'd all be able to go places!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read The Long Way Home  while driving home one night, and it really affected me. It's a book with a great story that is simple and to the point. The main character is a man who spent the past 40 years working for the US Government in various roles, yet found himself on his own after his wife left him for someone else. He's got a lot of problems but has some interesting experiences. I highly recommend it.  Read a negative review:  If I could give negative reviews I would. The book doesn't tell a very nice story. It is rather about a guy who gets stuck in the woods. He doesn't get help very often but he does get help from some of the things he does find. I think the book could be longer. The ending didn't make sense. Recommendation: 
Write a positive review about a good book:        I loved this book.   As a matter of fact, I love it.  A great story, that has me hooked to the end.  The characters are so endearing.  My only regret is that I wish I had read it sooner, and that I could have seen it a bit earlier (before it became a massive bestseller and everyone wanted to read it).  If you are looking for a great story about a boy's love, try this book out.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is well written and interesting. This book is just a good read. The only downside to the book is that it is very long, I am thinking of doing a paperback edition. I like the author's philosophy. Thank you.  I'm a science fiction fan, so I was excited to get this book in the mail. It's well done. The story focuses on the aftermath of a big earthquake, and the people who try to cope with a new, harsh world. There's also a bit of a twist and a murder. A small thing, but I liked it. The characters are well developed and the prose is clear and readable. I could see myself reading more of the book.  The first section is good. The second section is a bit lackluster, though that's probably because I read the final chapter a few days ago. I enjoyed the second section because it was really interesting to see what the other people in the community did. I'm sure I could relate to a lot of them. The rest of the chapter is basically filler. I guess I wanted to see the fallout of the earthquake, but not the details. I will continue reading the next book, though. " There were a few times when she tried to stop me, but she didn't have a choice; she had no choice. But what I was doing wasn't right, and I was being irrational. She didn't want to stop it, but they were running out of time."  "I was never the type to blame someone else for their bad decisions. There were so many reasons she did what she did, and there was no excuse. It was a tragedy, and she had to live with it, as best she could." 
Write a positive review about a good book:    - - -   I really enjoyed this book, but there were some issues I had with it. The characters were interesting, and there was some tension in it, but it felt a bit rushed, especially toward the end of the book, and it didn't really make sense. This is a good story to tell with a twist, but I thought the ending was a bit abrupt, and I'd probably give the novel a higher rating had I had a little more time to think about it. (8.5/10) "The Lost Child" by Eilene Wilson I think that Eilen is one of the most underrated author in the contemporary SF literature. She has many books published, so I could read several more of her books (like The Last Question or Last Question 3), but this book is her magnum opus. I was surprised when I read her story about a young girl who has lost her twin sister in a car crash. There's a twist in the book which I thought was interesting, but after reading it, it feels a little rushed. It's not a bad book, per se, but the first half of the novel seems a bit unorganized and doesn't really get going. I'll give it a 4 because it's a good first book, even though I wasn't a fan of the twist, which is a shame, because it could have been used better. (9/10). "The Man Who Would be King" by Gregory Benford I really like the writing of Gregory Benf: he has a very unique style that makes his books feel very different. His novels have a lot of tension and tension is the main ingredient of his writing, and here Benford succeeds. This book has a lot going on for a good chunk of the length of the story, and for me, it felt like it took forever to get to the good part. While there are some twists and turns and some unexpected plot developments, the book ends rather abruptly (although I would have liked to have seen some more plot progress in the last section, the last third of the writing). Overall, the writing is good, but this story could have used a little extra time to establish the setting, the characters, and the overall conflict of the plot. I think it would have been a better story with a little bit of a twist or a different ending, but if you like action, action is what you'll get in this book. (7.
Write a positive review about a good book:    One of my most treasured books of all time! It has been so much fun to watch a few friends and family members get hooked on this story and come up with their own take on it. My husband got hooked on the ending with the most beautiful voice over of his sister crying to him "it's over, he's no good, it's over" and she's right. It's over. But it's also been really, really emotional to see people who have been following this story for years now, in their 40's, 50's, and now 60's, all of them with a fresh outlook on life, realizing the truth. That's what makes it so special, the honesty, the vulnerability, and the honesty that comes with it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    * I read this book because I wanted to get into Lovecraft but never managed to do so, but since I've read The Whisperer in Darkness by Neil Gaiman  I decided to give this a go and couldn't be happier!   The plot:  * It's not the best of a series and the pacing is off in the beginning, but this is what I look for:  ** I have only read two of his works, but I can say that I have enjoyed them all, and I'm sure this is also true for most people who have read him.   The way he develops the characters, his themes and his themes of the cosmic horror make this a must read.  Overall:  If you like Lovecraft you should really give this book a try.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The first part of the book is an extremely detailed description of the construction of the atomic bomb, which was the first time any detail of the project was ever described in detail. A good deal of the second part is an exposition of the use of uranium in the bomb. The third part describes the details of the Manhattan Project itself. I am very interested in this book for its description of a very important project in world history.      
Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently got the paperback edition of this book. It is a great read. I was surprised to see that the author changed it to include a short "afterword" after the novel, which is not a good idea. That's not a "pro" or "con" about the book; it's just my experience. I do appreciate the original novel, but I don't like the new "afterlife" story.

Write a positive review about a good book:    Reviewer: Mr. R - I received my order a few days ago, and it arrived quickly. I'm a little worried about the fact that I ordered the book with a title that includes "I" but then I don't know how that was supposed to work so I ended up with this, a book about the writer Mr. L, but I will say I think it's a pretty good book. I was glad I got this book, and I think I will probably read more of Mr. W's books. Mr. J - Mr. M.M.'s review was very good. Mr. W has done a really great job of exploring the writer's life in this book. It's not always easy to get into the author's world as you can see, and Mr. E is a nice addition to that world. Mr D.H. - Mr L.D.'s review of the book is right. It was nice to get a book on the writer. I really liked this book as a whole. It could be read as a novel but in fact is closer to a short story as there is a lot of back and forth and in-depth research. I will definitely be reading other books by the author. Mr P.E. - I have to say that this is a very solid book about a writer. He gets down into the writing process in a very interesting way. This book is one that I will be recommending. If you are looking for a book with some real insight into the making of a book I would recommend this book highly. Also, it would be helpful if the author would have a web site that would have more details about the author and the book. There is very little information on the author page and the author doesn't seem to have a website, if that's the case. I would still recommend reading the book, but if there was a web page that had more information about the book and who wrote it I would not be so critical. Overall, I think this is an excellent book that is well worth the read, especially if you have read anything about Mr L's life. It will be a good reference for anyone interested in the history of the writer and his work. I also highly recommend the book to anyone interested about writers of short fiction.
Write a positive review about a good book:     (1)    (2)     (3)  I read that book. I'm glad I did. The world is full of good people. I have so many friends and family members who would help me find a way to make a living doing something I love, but can't quite get out of my head. There is something about having to travel the world to do it. The way people react to you when they learn you have a hobby. The feeling that I get when I go back to my hometown after being away for a while and meeting all the people I grew up with and friends I made at school. The weird little things people notice about you and say things like "I have no idea what you are talking about". The fact that I just read that and can't think of a single reason to not write about it. I was able to tell my own story. A lot of my life has been spent doing things I'm not good at. Writing and art are the things I can do. The more people know about me and what I have to offer them the more people are willing to lend a hand.   You might find this to be a bit off-beat, but I think I have an idea what is behind this. People need something to be grateful for, but don't really know what to give back to society. They need something. A way to express their love and appreciation, but not feel forced to do so in a way that they feel they're being shamed or wrong for.  Maybe we should be ashamed of being so poor, so powerless to help ourselves.  I think maybe we should all be proud of what we have instead of letting our problems dictate how much we love each other. I think about all the good friends I have that aren't "successful" in a career way and how many more friends I had that are. Maybe I should make this a thing. I mean, why shouldn't I be proud to be poor and alone. Why shouldn't we all be happy when things are good, and unhappy when things aren't? I think being happy is a luxury we should only have until we want it so badly we need to give it away, and not everyone has to have it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The plot:  It starts off a bit slow, but the story picks up and is very well paced. A well paced book is one that you keep thinking about it. This one did, so I kept reading for awhile. The ending is quite good. It's a sad story, but well written and well acted. It ends nicely. The characters were all well developed, and I liked the fact that they all had different experiences. The only problem is that the book had to end, which left me a bit unsatisfied. The Good: The plot is good. The story keeps you reading throughout, even when you have a bit of a hangover. The plot was excellent. The way the author wrote is very good. Some things were a bit difficult to understand for me, but I got over it pretty fast. It wasn't too hard to figure out that something bad had happened to the boy, so the book made me think about what could have happened to him. The book is a bit short, but it ended pretty nicely. Also, I liked how the author included some facts about the boy's life. The Bad: The book was a bit too short. It ended on a cliffhanger. There was a cliff-hanger, and it wasn't enough to make me want to continue the book. The language in the book wasn't the best. The bad parts were the parts where the boy is talking, which I found a bit awkward. The other things I had a problem with were the ending. The author said he wanted it to be over with, but then he left it hanging. The Verdict: It was a good short book, but there were a few things I wish had been more important in the story. It did get better as the story went on though.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My boyfriend is a big fan of the series (but his rating is low). I just finished this book a few days ago, and thought it was very good, though I'm not totally into the romance. I wish it was longer, though. If you like YA, or you think you will like Y.A. if you read it, you should definitely try this series.  I had to ask about this.   The only thing I can say is that this is not a romance.  There are some nice moments, but not enough for me to rate it high enough to give it 4.0.  If you're looking for a series with romance and cute animals and happy endings, try a different series. I read it in one sitting, and the next morning I didn't recognize a word of it.  It is about a cat named Pup.  I think the author was having trouble with her first book in the series, and so she decided to switch from a normal girl to a cat.  In the second book, she did a much better job. I also read this one in one day because it's YA. My son was really excited to get his copy of this, and is having a tough time understanding it.   I read it to him, and he has had a hard time trying to read it so far.  But he's learning so much about cats and his mother. Pup has some of the most incredible stories ever told in a book.  This book will definitely keep him entertained all through the winter break.  It really is great for younger kids. I would recommend this to kids ages 2 to 8. The cat loves all of his toys and loves to be the center of attention.  He's always there when you need him the most. At this point it is time for bed.  My son is exhausted and I am tired too.  So I open the book and read this to him.  The night is long and cold.  At last I close the book, and lay down on my back to watch the stars.   The night ends. Day 3:   Pup and I go out for a long walk around the neighborhood.  We eat at a fast food restaurant.   It is the most comfortable place we have ever been in.   He's been getting a lot of attention and I think he is really glad that I am his

Write a positive review about a good book:    In this book you are given the chance to meet a good friend who has been the catalyst for you becoming a man. In addition to being a great author, Tom is a great guy. If you can get to know Tom and his wife, Sarah, you may find yourself reading books from here on in for the rest of your life. The best way to describe Tom's character is to quote him directly: "We have been together for twenty-one years; I'm a very lucky man. Sarah has been there for twenty years; she's a very, very lucky woman." This is a book that any man should be proud to read. I was able to meet the man I had known since he was eight and his life has always been worth living. A must read for anyone interested in the life of men and how women influence our culture and men's lives in general. I also enjoyed Tom's response to my questions: 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A fun read with some really cool ideas.   This is a really unique idea.  The ending is really neat.  As an adult, it is easy to become bored with science fiction stories.  It is easy for me to get bored with a good sci-fi story.  But this is an interesting sci- fi novel.  I would highly recommend this to a younger adult. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was good but it wasn't perfect.   I would say this was a good read, a very enjoyable and enjoyable read, but it is not without faults.  It has its moments and its flaws but it was enjoyable.  The beginning is interesting and well thought out. It goes from being a simple tale of a boy and his father to a lot of different things and a lot more people.  At first I didn't like the book but I quickly warmed to the story and loved the story, the characters and the love that grows between the boy and the father and the mother. The plot, the emotions and the tension built up during the book made it an enjoyable read.  I was also very curious to know how this book would have turned out if I had read it as a novel.  When I saw this on a Kindle, I knew it was a novelette and decided to read the novella first before I purchased the book.  While I liked the story I felt the novellas had a lot less to give.  Although the stories are short, there are very few characters and they don't get to really grow as characters during the novesletons.  Overall it was an enjoyable reading.  There was more depth and emotion given to the characters in the novedlettes.  However, they were not as interesting to me as the story.
Write a positive review about a good book:     I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick and easy read that doesn't take a lot of time. The only thing I would have changed is I would want to see the cover art. That would be an extra $1.50. I have not found a book that has the same artistic flare as this one. It is just a solid and well-written book.  The first time I read this book I was blown away. The illustrations by Kiyo Yamada are amazing. It was great to see a book with an art style that wasn't just about the story. I think they did a great job in giving the characters some personality in their appearance, but I wouldn't want to get too attached to any of them as they all look very similar.    Overall I enjoyed this book. It wasn't difficult to get through and it wasn't hard to get interested in the story as it started out. As the story developed I got more and more invested in the characters and it was easy to care for the kids.   So what did you think?

Write a positive review about a good book:    * I had a blast reading this. The plot wasn't original, but I liked the characters and the overall plot.    What I liked:  There's a lot of discussion about what's "good" and what's not in this genre.   While I was very excited about seeing where the book went, I wasn't as happy with what I was actually reading.  At times, I found myself getting bored with the character interactions.  A few times, the story felt rushed and I was left disappointed.  In the end, however, I would recommend this book to those looking for a unique fantasy story.  How I would rate it: 
Write a positive review about a good book:    Posted by Stephanie B. at 6:16 AM No comments: Sophie St. Onge's The Book of Wonder: A History of the World's Most Famous Lighter is the most recent of two new books by the author, who has a doctorate in English and a masters in mathematics. St.Onge is a very accomplished journalist and writer. Her work has appeared in National Geographic, The New York Times, The London Review of Books, and elsewhere. Her background is in philosophy, but she devotes a good deal of time to history and economics. The book has several themes: "Lighter: The Secret History of Our Greatest Invention," "The Great American Experiment," "Cities and Money: An Evolutionary History," and "The Invention of the Computer." As St.onge puts it, the invention of the lighter was a "brazen demonstration that people and innovation are equal and complementary." She gives a good example from the invention process: There is much to learn about the history of electricity, and about how people built the electric machine at its core. But there is no better source of historical documentation than that of the earliest electric lamps. When the first one—the world's first lighted oil lamp—was manufactured in 1848, it was a huge and startling surprise to the world. And as the first lamps went on sale in London in 1851, people went out of their way to get their hands on them. By 1850, it seemed that everyone in the world had a light bulb of their own. St.ongen's history of the invention and early manufacture of electric lights and how they were marketed is interesting and informative. The book also has a good chapter on the economic impact of electric lighting on cities. She goes into much more depth on the impact on the economy than the authors of this article will. One other aspect of this book that I particularly enjoyed was her chapter about the electric telegraph. Stonge writes about how the telegraph's inventor, Samuel F.B. Morse, thought that he had invented a way to "transfer the spoken language to an electric telegram, and make the transmission of speech to another part of the world virtually instantaneous." This idea, which was developed by the British, was called "the telephone." The Book of Wonders includes a short bio from the editor of the magazine that originally published the book, The History Channel. A short biography is included at the
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book. It was my first time reading a zombie book and I had fun. I thought I would get sick of zombies as they came around in the next book but I think I can get used to them now. I also liked how it wasn't just the main character but also several other characters that were also zombies. I think that was really cool. I liked how the main characters weren't the main protagonists but they were still very likeable, I think it was an interesting way to do that. I enjoyed how the book kept showing the world through the eyes of characters who have a lot of history but the book never seemed like it was going to be a one-off zombie story. It just went in a lot more depth and I liked that a lot. It is the main focus of the book but it doesn't drag too long into it. I found it interesting because the main zombie characters felt very real to me, and that's not something you usually find in a zombie novel. If you are a fan of zombie fiction you should check this book out!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've never read a book before, but I'm going to try this one out. I really enjoyed this book, which I think is a pretty great read. It has a bit of sci-fi-ish feel to it, but not too many, so it was interesting. I've seen the movie "Avengers: Age of Ultron" and it made me laugh a few times. I think the movie version of Ultron was pretty close to the book, it wasn't really a perfect, but the movie did a better job at portraying him. Overall, it was an interesting read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    You get a sense that she wanted to communicate more about the subject, but didn't know how to do so in a way that wasn't clunky or pretentious.   It's an enjoyable read for the length it takes to read, but if you want to read a longer book, you'll probably want to wait for the next one.  I give it 3 out of 5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A few years ago I bought a book by John Updike which I have recently been rereading (probably about once a year). In this book I learned something about John Upddike's father that has never been told before: Updiker's father was a real genius who was known as the most prolific writer of all time. Updick's father got into the literary arts as a young boy after his parents divorced. He worked for a bank while he studied art and was then discovered by the then great New Yorker magazine. Upddiker's mother didn't want her son to work in the banking world and so his parents split up. Updcike grew up in the Upper East Side of New York.  The Updikes lived a comfortable life. Updtike was very rich, but he was never too extravagant. His house was simple and small. The Updikis spent their days relaxing at their vacation homes in the country.   The Updcikes were not famous, just wealthy. They were wealthy because of their art collection (which is in the Smithsonian) and because John Updcick got his first job at age 10 as a janitor at a high-end resort in Key West. John Updtiker became an author at the age of 9 after getting his first magazine article in an art magazine. The Downward Spiral Updike's parents divorced after he turned 7, and it didn't take long for his parents to get back together. But by the time he was 9, Updicky's mother became more and more desperate and told him not to talk to her son again, and to never talk to his father again. Updyke tried to ignore his mother and his father started getting angry and more frustrated. It didn't help that he had been in a fight with his sister a few days before. The stress of school, work, and relationships was too much to bear. Updxke became an outcast at school, at the bank and at the resort. He was an outlander who was a stranger to the world.  He was too unhappy to be a successful writer. Updanke became the only child of his family to live a lonely and isolated life.  For years Updiked lived his life in his mom's apartment at 40 West 46th Street (a large building). The building was designed by Richard Neutra. Updatike tried to avoid talking to people in his building
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story was interesting. I really liked the premise: a boy who has been transformed into a girl with the help of magic. She is extremely intelligent and does well in her school, and the teacher seems to be happy with her. She just happens to be a girl. The premise is great, and I could imagine myself reading it many times over.   I loved the characters. The character development was handled perfectly, and every character had their own unique background.  The writing was really good. The dialogue and descriptions were fantastic. I can't even describe the story. This is one of my favorite books that I've read in a long time, and it deserves a 5-star rating. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was pretty good.   It did contain a few things I didn't like about the book, but not enough to warrant its 2 stars.  When I first saw this book, I thought, "Oh, there's a new guy trying to be a writer".  When the review said that he'd written two books, I was surprised.  I thought he had written more than one.  There's a lot of similarities between "The Last Days of the Empire" and "Dusk", but I'd actually written a trilogy.  In "The Final Days", he takes the story up a level with a warlord who wants to take over all of his homeland.  "The Empire" is much more down to earth in that the "Empire" is just about him and his "House of Thorns".  And yes, I did get annoyed at his constant use of that word, but I think it's true. I'd say, in all honesty, that the two books are not exactly comparable, but "The Lost City of Karkis" is more of a dark fantasy.  He mixes up the history of his culture with that of the land. He gives a lot more space to the people and it works.  When the main characters are all dead and the only things that remain are the memories of their pasts and the books that hold those memories.  It feels a bit "out of place" compared to his other books, so I was slightly disappointed when I read that the book was coming out a year or so after the last one. However, there were still some nice things about this book.  Firstly, the characters are very well written.  The "main characters" are both believable and well developed.  Although there isn't really any "development" in this book (at least not what you might expect), the story is really enjoyable.  These two books were written in a lot different ways, but they are both very good.   So that's my first review.  If you like this book or have any questions about it, then don't hesitate to ask me.  My email is:  [email protected]  And if you are interested in getting more information about my other books or have a question about what my future plans are, then just send me an email and I'll try to answer it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good read "A book about life and love: that's a strong word to use, because what I had in mind when I started this book is something that might sound cheesy: a book about a boy and his father and the life of a young man in America, between the two." I'm not really sure I can speak for others here, but I felt that the book was about the author's parents and how their relationship with the son that they had was very strong, but a bit too strong for her to accept. They had been together for a long time, so this might have been a bit hard for her and I have a feeling that they would have probably had a very difficult time accepting her homosexuality (in the book she is bisexual). But what I can say is that I read this book because I was drawn to the characters. The way the author described the boy, his childhood and their relationship made me feel like I was actually there in that life and time. The main character is a very good reader, but there are some other characters that are rather annoying. I'm sorry for the spoilers, but when the protagonist is in the hospital, and one of the nurses comes in to help, it turns out that he is "a bit of a wimp." Yes, that's right. I didn't like that aspect of the book because the story needed to be told. The story was good though, especially if you're a fan of YA books with gay characters.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read a lot of poetry in my life, and have written a lot for the blog (I'm a poet), so I've definitely picked up some useful lessons.   As I read it I got a feeling of what it would be like to write one.  I read "I See Light" and it made me think of the phrase "a good book is like a candle that lights you up."  When I've read good poems, I don't go back and read a whole new book. I read parts here and there, sometimes multiple times a day.  But when you pick up a good poem or good book, or even a great one, you can't go through it as a single book.  When you read a poem or a book it's not like going through it one word at a time, but as a whole.  If you're reading a book from cover to cover it will probably be an unending reading experience. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book a couple of years ago. It was a decent but not great book. I felt like I was reading a history book. Then I reread it recently and found out that the author of the book (a man named Robert S. McNamara) was a great businessman who was a war planner in the past. Then, in the early 1970s, he decided that he would write a book to warn the American people about the future consequences of a nuclear war. I found the book very depressing. The man had no idea what he was talking about and was just a bit ignorant of the history of World War II. However, the book is still worth reading just for the insight that it gives into his thinking.   I'll probably not get this book up again because it's depressing.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "A novel that tells the story of a young boy, a girl, and their encounters with the various creatures of their environment. It's about the creatures as well as the humans and how their relationship to them is complex and not quite a simple one. As in all good fiction, this is a book to be read with an open mind, but especially as a child."
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book and I liked it a lot. The description of his method is perfect and this method worked very well. I am always searching for a way to remove skin so that I can see better and also for a less painful removal. He used the tip of a scalpel and I was able to see everything very clearly, even if it took me a few attempts to get it right. I will be recommending this method to my family members who are looking for a new way to cut their skin. I also bought a smaller scalpel because it is too big for me to use the large one and I had some discomfort while I read, but I think I will buy the small one next time I have some time to spare!  Write a negative review about an above average book:  A very interesting book, however, the main problem I found with it is that the author goes over very complicated concepts. It is not really something that is easy to understand and he does go over things a lot, however he could have spent more time explaining each concept. Also, it's really hard to get an accurate picture because of all of the illustrations he uses to show how to do certain things.  No, I'm not a medical professional. However, I think if I had to read it again I would read some chapters a few times.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "Dissenters: The Undeclared War on Dissent," by Susan J. Douglas, is a fascinating and informative work. It will also make you feel a bit uncomfortable, for it makes an argument about the state of dissent that most will find disturbing. It is a rare book that gives us a clear, cogent account of how the First Amendment's Free Speech clause came into being, and it provides a powerful argument for why we should now restore the freedoms that were once limited by that clause. And most of all, it does what it set out to do: it shows us how a certain brand of American liberalism is a moral menace in the 21st century.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    If your experience with the "Nirvana Experience" has been good so far, you should read this book. It will be fascinating to see the different "realizations" that occur at different times throughout one's life.     " This book is fascinating because it is the first true, complete, and accurate account of the " Nirvana Experience " from the perspective of those who have experienced it. " A review:  The author explains the different types of "realisations" in terms of what they call "mental activities", which may be described as "thinking in terms" or "thinking from within". This has been described by other authors as the "consciousness-experience" or simply as consciousness, but I prefer to call it "thinking", and there is no need for a "conscious" in this context.  In many cases, the experience has occurred when the subject is "thinking at the right time".  The "thinking" has a "purpose" and often involves the use of language such as, "When I was about to give up my idea, I noticed that the idea I was thinking about was a very good one".  In addition, the subject can "think" about something else, which could be a problem if there are no solutions. For example, one can "have a thinking" about "the feeling of my right leg" if there is nothing wrong with the leg, and it would be best to not think about it.  The subject is then faced with a dilemma: "I am feeling a bit sad about the leg and would love to go to the doctors, but if I have my 'thinking' about the feeling of the leg during the day, I don't want to get the leg any worse." This is also what "thinking within" is about. The subject will be trying to be objective, but some parts of the experience can still be experienced and it is up to the reader to decide what "reality" is perceived.  This book can be read both as a psychological book (to describe the subject's reaction to his experience) and as a psychology/religion book (that describes the subject as an individual).   This is a well-written book, even though it contains "experiences", i.e., things that have happened to me.  In many of the experiences, my sense of "self" has disappeared.  However, I know myself as I am
Write a positive review about a good book:    Good books come in many shapes and sizes.   It would be nice to find a book that is both the perfect little one to start off the collection and then expands to include some of the more complex and sophisticated novels as the story progresses.  While I am not sure the final result will be as good as some of my favorite first reads, I have to say this is the first time I have picked up a new book and truly appreciated it.  This is a very good story and I look forward to the rest of the trilogy.    It is a good read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The Book: A collection of short stories by various authors published by the author in the US. I was pretty excited when I first saw this, since it's one of my favorite genres of fiction: mysteries. However, my initial excitement was dashed when I opened this book, only to discover the only reviews for this book I could find were from the Amazon page, where reviewers have complained about the book's slow pacing, cliched characters and a general uninspired writing style. But for the most part, I found this to be a very enjoyable read. I loved the variety of voices, the mystery and the character, and even the romance (I was surprised I'd read about this one!) I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good mystery or mystery/romance, as well as a solid book from a new author.
Write a positive review about a good book:    * * *   "I found the plot of The Good Earth, a collection of stories by the British novelist Jonathan Lethem, to be deeply involving."   In the best way. There's a lot to love about this story, and it's not just the fact that it's about a guy who goes from being a successful rock star to a struggling writer. The story is a great deal of fun, even if Lethem isn't the best at writing about himself, and I liked the fact the protagonist's life changed after he took LSD. "The Good Earth is an intensely human and imaginative narrative."  *  The Good God is the name of the character's home (I know, how lame). His wife left him after he was arrested on charges of molesting his children, so it's up to him to raise their young daughter. He decides to open a "Good Earth" to help the homeless and poor. It sounds like he's a pretty nice guy who just needs the motivation to write a book, so I'm not surprised that the book was good. I also liked the story because it was about a man struggling to get by. "But let's be honest here: It's all a lie," he sighs at one point. And I would agree that it isn't always easy to get through a story. I felt this way with the story The Devil You Know, which is about a young man who becomes obsessed with a former lover after losing her to cancer. He learns to love her again and then he is killed in a car crash and buried by his former lover's father. That's right, I just spent the last two paragraphs describing how horrible it is.  * I'm just going to be honest and say that the only reason I liked this story was because I had been watching the movie The Devil's Advocate and decided to check out a Lethem book. The Good God  would make a great movie.       **   "Lethem's fiction, especially about the early 20th century, is also filled with moments of extraordinary lyricism and humor."  **

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am not a huge fan of mysteries. I have enjoyed some great mysteries over the years, but they usually fall short of being very satisfying or satisfying me more than they satisfy my desire to "fix" the problem of the mystery. In addition, I tend to like the more supernatural/sci-fi/philosophical mysteries because the mysteries are more "hard" and harder to solve. But, despite that, I always enjoyed the mysteries in these books because of their intriguing mysteries (at least that was the case in this book). And, I will say that, although I didn't particularly love the ending of this book as much as the others I read, it still ended on a strong note. And I didn'st really need to have to find out the ending the way they did in these other mysteries. And, it also came to a satisfying conclusion. A good way to end a great mystery (even if it doesn't end on a high note like this one) is to bring it to a well-rounded and enjoyable conclusion. It's a shame this book didn't end the way I wanted it to end. This is another great book by the authors, and I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. If you're looking for a good mystery, I suggest this one to you. The only thing I didn' t like about this book was the fact that the characters felt a bit boring. It took a while to get into their personalities (though I will admit the characters are very well developed).

Write a positive review about a good book:    I started reading the book a few weeks ago. The first chapter (called "On the Front") is the best part of the book. A friend recommended this book and, although I had no idea about it, I started at Chapter 1. There are some good points about how we are raised and what we should expect as we grow up. In Chapter 3 the author goes into the different types of abuse. He talks about how they are different in each case but that they are the same in both cases. He explains that the abuse is always the same: "the abuse, the humiliation, the abuse of power. The abuse, of course, is the very thing that they deny is happening to them"   The author goes over the steps he believes should be taken when someone is being abused. He states that in all of the cases in the book, if you go through the steps, you will know what is happening and what is being said.   After I finished the first chapter I had to re-read it, this time because I was upset at the author. He makes some good and points about being abused but he just goes over them in a boring fashion. It is not very well written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I can only recommend this book to people interested in the subject of how the United States came to be as a country. There is much in this book that is factual and is worth reading. There are also some points that are quite controversial, but that is the nature of the current debate."
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I think he does some very good work here...he does a great job exploring and explaining the complexities of the social fabric of the nation and the ways that this social fabric is constantly challenged by those in power. I don't have anything negative to say about this book. He does an excellent job of exploring the history of the US as well as a great deal about the political and ideological history of both the US and Cuba."   Recommended Readings   by Robert E. Lee      " A masterful history of modern US foreign policy written by a top military thinker.... It is a remarkable book that will be hard to beat."  --Robert Jervis, The Miami Herald ".. The book is a masterpiece of military history...one that offers a detailed, compelling analysis of the historical role played by the United States and the US military in the Cuban Revolution. It is not just a good history of Cuban history, but an outstanding one. It should be required reading."

Write a positive review about a good book:      It's a good story with a great setting. I got a laugh out of it.    There are some inconsistencies though; there's a small incident that I found to be a bit contrived.  5.5/10

Write a positive review about a good book:      "I'm so happy to finally have my book. It took my many years of being an avid reader to finally find a book I'd always wanted. It's a very complex book with a lot of philosophical and psychological elements. The language is quite different than anything I'd read before, and there are a lot more illustrations. The best part of the book is the conclusion of the story: a beautiful story of a child's journey out of childhood, an exploration of the ways that we are born to be and how we grow up and mature. The illustrations are also fantastic. I've always thought they were the best part."   -The Review of Books
Write a positive review about a good book:    Good book with good reviews. I don't know why I did not buy it when it was first released. I haven't gone back to it, but I have recommended it to a few people and they have been satisfied too.   Reviewers: I have never seen any reviews complaining about the stories being "too long". I always thought that people were just trying to nitpick their way out of buying it. I know people who would read only the first few hundred pages of the book just to get past the first 5-10% that didn't make any sense to them.  If you can't tell, I am a sucker for "Haunting".  But... that is all the way back in 2004!   It took me a long time to get around to this one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The   main   plot, is very well written, although I found some inconsistencies with the characters and some events not quite happening as planned in the ending. I do like that the plot has a strong ending though! It has some real emotional tension.   The world building is solid with the background and the creatures. I liked the use of the magic. The main character does get caught up in the magical world a bit too much, so his feelings are mixed in with the magical creatures and his own feelings about being part of the world. I was a little bit disappointed in the lack of real villains in the story.  One of the most realistic characters    One of the things I liked about this book was the combination of the two stories: it's about the magical creature world and the humans. The stories are both interesting.  Overall, a pretty good read and recommended. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    So I really liked this.  I am a big fan of fantasy books and books in general, but this one is different than I expected. The main protagonist is named Cailin, and she is a woman. I found that refreshing to read about a strong, independent female character who isn't the type to rely on a man for everything and doesn't have to live off of her husband's paycheck. She also isn't a perfect woman because she struggles and does all of the work around the home, but she's a lot better than what a lot of books have shown in the past. The writing in the book is great and the magic is very well done. It doesn't take much to create a very good scene. The book is long, but not long enough to get bored and just end. I also really like how Cailins personality was portrayed as she struggles with things that would normally be a huge turn off for a lot women. It made me feel as if she was a strong woman who was struggling with the same things I did in middle school.   I also love how Cails got a second chance at life through magic. I don't know if it's too much to hope for, but I'm hoping that some other magic user who isn 't the perfect person could become a real mentor for her.   5 out of 5 stars Great book, but the final book has a number of inconsistencies, and the whole thing is very confusing. The best part about the book was the magical world and the world building. The story was good, but there were a few problems and inconsistencies. I was very disappointed in the final story, but still very impressed by the world. If you like a good fantasy story, you may enjoy this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The last time I read "I Have Never Been to Heaven" (a title I have read a lot of, and can't get out of my head) I remember this little book was the only one I had read about religion in the US. It was from the 1980's. I don't know if anyone remembers this book, but I do, and I'm not sure I want to. I did a little research and found out that the book is not even written by Dr. Richard Dawkins, but by a professor who goes by "Dawkins theist" and writes books with titles like "On the Origin of Species" and "The Selfish Gene." (I have seen "The Blind Watchmaker" in the background. Dawkins himself doesn't appear to have had any input.) In fact, "Dawn of the Gods" isn't about religion at all, but the history of religion, and it is not that good. At one point Dawkins writes: "We have not evolved for our own happiness or our own advancement. We have evolved because we are social animals." So, he thinks there are good reasons why we have evolved to live together, and why it is good for the group to be in a good mood. But that doesn't make it good for humans to take their own pleasure in taking other people's happiness away. (The title may make it sound like it is about God, but really it is a critique of religion.) And that may seem like a small issue. It isn't, because we have other issues that have arisen out of the belief in a god (though that may be the point). And if you don't believe in a gods, the argument for atheism isn't so strong. And even if you do believe in god, that still doesn't mean that there is no good reason why we should take others' happiness away from them. As a child I never believed in a God, and that's a good reason to give up belief in god. The first paragraph was a little awkward for me to read, but in the end I did find it to be an entertaining read. I also had to think about some of the things Dawkins had to say about religion. After I finished reading the book I found it very interesting that he says a lot about how religion can do a lot for us and how it can help us, and about how bad we can be to other people by not being nice enough, or by being selfish
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm not a massive fan of fiction in general. I'm very busy as well and I don't have the time to read very much. That being said, this was definitely a good read. It was a well-written, fast-paced read and the characters were all interesting. I would definitely give this 5 stars if it were an option. The writing and characterization was very good and I could tell how involved the author was in the book. There was also a lot of plot development that left me interested in what would happen next. I found myself very engaged in the story and thought that the author did a great job. Also, the book had some great characterizations, I think this is important to a book that I enjoy. I highly recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have the following problems with the novel:  The story is linear with only two main characters.  The two main female characters do not seem to be that well developed.  I do not know how they could have written an intelligent woman who could not write an intelligent man but they still did.  If the men were given a backstory or character we could learn about them we would understand why they were so uncooperative or why they would never have let others help them and did so themselves.   It would be a wonderful story but it is a story of two women who do not want to write a book that can take them anywhere but the two women do not get along at all.  My rating is 4 stars for the story but 3 for the characters.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am looking for a story book that is written by a native English speaker and that is based on the classic stories of the Bible and other Bible related works.   If I could find a book that was both, it would be a life changer.  My daughter has read and loved the Bible story books and loved reading a Bible story book for her Bible class. I had to look for a book to compliment the Bible stories so I could read my son an adult story book.  I will definitely be purchasing this again.  This is a great book to read to my grandson that is just getting into the "big stuff" as we speak. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys reading a good story book and is looking for something a bit different. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am very happy with this book, and I'm glad I tried the first book. I had never read any book in English by the same author, but this one is quite a bit different than my expectations. The story is set during the 19th century in a small, medieval town called "La Ramea."       (hide spoiler)] It starts with a character called "The Bishop" (no actual title).   And then we get our first glimpse of the book...a young woman, a widowed mother, living with her three children. The Bishop, in his early days as a young priest, has fallen in love with a young woman named La Rame, who is staying in the area for a few weeks for a visit.   After a while the Bishop and La Rimea are married, but she dies soon after, leaving the Bishop alone and looking for answers to his past love.  I did not like this book at all. It's hard to describe why because I don't know any better.  It seems the author wrote it because he knew that he hated "The Name of the Rose"  (which I really enjoyed, and also loved the audiobook for this book). He writes a good story but he was trying to create his own version of the novel and not to copy it exactly.  There are a lot of scenes in this book that don't really happen in the novel or are just rehashes of the characters and events that are in the book. I do like the narrator, she sounded natural, but at times I felt like I was reading a different book. If you like romance, you will like this. If not, you may not like it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The writing is good. It is short and to the point. I really liked the "why" it was written, I mean it's an interesting read and easy to digest. The author describes each and every step the characters take to get from point A to point B. The characters are the most engaging part of the book. I liked that each of the characters are a little bit different and it made for a fun read. I enjoyed it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "I read a good many books about women, and I'm usually a little disappointed in the results."    The best advice I've ever received about books:  Write a good review and then don't read it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found myself in a good place to pick this book up. It was just the right blend of humor and romance, I was able to relate to the characters, and I thoroughly enjoyed the story. I also appreciated the introduction of the two female characters, who are a little too stereotypical for me (more so than the male characters are), but I think that's for the best because both of these characters had an interesting background, and were able to make me like them even if I didn't find them all that interesting. They were likable, and their story was fun to read.    I'd recommend this book to everyone:  If you enjoy a good adventure, and love a good romance then this is the book for you. It wasn't long before the main characters were together, and it wasn't really long before things were getting really interesting. There was just something about the story, about the romance, and about the characters that made it worth reading. The characters were lik-able, they had a lot of growth, and they were definitely different than what I expected them to be. This book definitely made me want to read a few more by author Kim Harrison.  My favorite part:

Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book and found it to be a very enjoyable read. The narrative is somewhat slow (probably due to the pace of writing) but it does have an engaging plot that leaves you intrigued for the end.    Review:  This book is amazing! The characters are unique, and there's a lot of detail about the cultures of each city. I really liked this book. The story is definitely unique and fun. If you have been looking for a fantasy book to read, or just a good story, go and get this book!  This is a must read, and I recommend it to anyone who's interested in good fantasy.
Write a positive review about a good book:    " I am one of the many that found this novel to be an extremely engrossing and thought-provoking read. I would like to believe that I've taken a few words from the book to help my own life through the rough and tumble of a busy college life. I was not so sure about reading this one, but I am glad I did. You can tell this is something a good, hard-working woman would write. The language is strong and it was a bit of a challenge to get to know the main characters, especially as the story progressed. The book has a lot of heart in it, and it certainly is not a happy book. There are a lot more twists and turns than I expected. I did find it quite hard to put down. The ending was absolutely wonderful." ~Tara-J.     " I have to say that I am really liking this book. It's a good read, even if it seems to be a bit complicated at times. I feel like this author could write a whole series of books like this, but this is a good starting point." ~Katrina  " This is a great read with lots of action. You will not be disappointed. " ~Sandy
Write a positive review about a good book:    A story about a young boy who has a dream to be the world's greatest hero. One of my favorites, this story is full of life and fun.   I'm reading the new anthology "The Children's Book of Imaginary Friends". It's a great idea, to create and share books about imaginary friends. The kids in this book all have amazing personalities, and there's an element of the fun to this book, too! My son likes to read these books with us, and it's so good to have more of these kinds of books to read to him.  If you're into animal stories, try "The Cat Who Lost Her Tail" by David Levithan:

Write a positive review about a good book:    1.5 stars:  It's all a lie!   I love the concept, but the book is a lie.     This book, which is being billed as "A Look Into the Psyches of Your Favorite Artists," contains a lot of empty, uninteresting facts about famous artists.  The book is divided into two parts, part one is called "The Artistic Life," and part two is titled "A Brief History of Art."  Part one of the book, the Artistic life, is mostly about the life of the painter.  In part one the authors talk about the artist's life, and the authors claim that "for every artist there is a personality.  "  In the Art of Manliness, we talk about how a person's work and personality are the foundation for a great person.  I don't believe this.  My view of the artist is:  "If you want a great painting, the first step is to understand your artist, and then you have to figure out how you are going to get that painting into the world."   The author states that there is one major artist who is one of her main characters, and all the other artists are portrayed as having a personality, but that the personality is "less than ideal."  The authors claim in this section that there are other "strong personalities" in the world.  One of my personal favorite writers is Kurt Vonnegut.  He is a great writer, but his personality is strong.  Another writer is David Foster Wallace.  His personality is very strong. The book, I feel, is nothing but a personality study.  This section also states that a person who has a strong personality will not have a bad painting, and a person with a weak personality will have a good painting.  And here's the kicker:    "the book also shows us that personality can be an important tool in shaping success, which should make us more than just a little uncomfortable.  For if everyone's personality is the same, what is it that gives them their unique personality?   " If you want to know what I have to say about the personality and art of famous people, I would point you toward " A Brief History in American Literature: A Book About the Artists " by David Korten. 1 star:  We are told that an artist's work is the foundation of his personality. We are also told that the
Write a positive review about a good book:   I did not finish reading this book until a few days ago. I read the synopsis a few months ago and loved the concept of how to get started making video games. As a kid, I loved playing games on my television and on my Apple IIe, with my dad's Atari 2600 games, as well as on my Commodore 64 and Commodore Amiga computers. My parents would sometimes come over to my house and I would play a game with them. The last time I played any kind of video game was in the early 80s when I had my first computer and my dad bought me an Atari 520ST (I don't know if you knew that at the time). I've been a long time gamer since that time. This book was a lot of fun to read and I really want to read more about video game development and the people behind it. I love that the book covers all types of games and that it has a little bit of everything from puzzle games to real time strategy to shooters to racing to action RPGs, etc... I can't wait to start reading the next one.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My first impression of this book was 'good' - but then that's a pretty low bar.   The book is about a boy who is about 12 years old - which means he has only known of the existence of magic since he was 12. He is trying to learn what that really means. I was surprised to see it's not as'sexy' as the other books in the series. There's nothing hot and sexy about this. It's pretty boring, and that was what I was expecting.   with the exception of the'sprites' who give the boy the spells, these are things that you'd see in other fantasy novels.   the problem with this book is the pacing. The boy starts off learning about magic (and not just in his dreams) but as the book goes on, he gets frustrated and wants to find out what magic is for, not for himself. Also, as far as I could tell, there's no reason for him to learn the magic. I didn't understand why it mattered or what the'magic' was. When I read about this in other books, there was a lot of back and forth about what it was used for - but in this book, it's just as if the boy just wanted to know why it works. The reader never really gets an explanation, it seems.     So what's the point of this review? I'm not saying this book sucks. This book isn't bad, it just has a few flaws in execution.      My second thought was 'wow, this is just like a real world fantasy novel'. I have no idea if it's a fantasy novel, but the story is really interesting. I've never read about a 13 year old being asked to learn how to cast magic spells - but it sounds like this might be it! And the writing is well-written and interesting. If I were going to read more about magic, I'd definitely pick this up!
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the book that changed my life and I'd highly recommend it! I had no idea what I was getting into. I am a long time reader and I remember the first book that I ever bought was the first Harry Potter book. That is all the books that I have read since that first.  The only negative thing I can say about this book is that the pacing of the book seems too slow for me. I would have liked to see more of Harry's adventures.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished this book and I loved it, but I did have a couple problems with it. First of all the main character was boring. She was extremely dull, not to mention her character had no development. She didn't do anything different, even when she became a doctor she was still just the same. She did have her moments, especially when she was getting to know someone, but for the most part, I don't care for her, she just kind of died once she became the new doctor. The other problem that I have with this book is that the main protagonist is such a boring, weak character. I mean she was just a bitch, who constantly tried to get in a fight, who had trouble getting out of the house and who tried to be a doctor, but then again when she tried to tell someone what her problems were she became very stupid and I found it hard to take her seriously. Then she started her internship, but she couldn't stop being a bitch. She even tried to sabotage a patient that was trying to make her see the light. Not only that, but when she left the hospital to go to college she didn't stop trying to find a way to get back into her good graces with all the mean doctors in the hospital who had been harassing her, and it made me very angry. It was horrible. So basically this book was boring, the character wasn't developed and I didn't find her to be intelligent. That's all, for the best book in the world. I enjoyed the fact that it was about a doctor and how she had to deal with the world, but it was so boring that I just wanted to finish it so that I could get home and turn off my computer.
Write a positive review about a good book:    * I've been reading a lot of history of science (both the real kind and the fictional kind). As I mentioned in my review, I'm a fan of history, so this is a real treat. This book is filled with stories from all sorts of sources; it's a very informative and useful read. I particularly liked some of the stories about the historical background of specific sciences. The book is a bit on the dry side at times, but if you like stories of research then you'll find some enjoyment here. And for those of you who prefer to stay away from history of scientific research, you're in for a treat.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    What makes this a good series: This series was written by Stephen King, author of the books that made up The Stand. Although the series is a good read, the story is quite predictable, and there are a lot of clichés in the beginning.   The book series that King wrote as a teenager was so different from the ones that came later, it was hard to expect anything else.  It was a good idea to write a series that was not the same as The Stand, but was still different from it.  The Stand did not change it's form, so they should not have changed the plot to keep it similar to it. The series has a lot to offer.  King's story has a great plot and is a lot better than that of The Stand.  The characters are not only interesting, but they are written very well.  And the ending is better than the beginning, and that is what counts. The Stand was a lot different from what it became later on, but it is not a bad story.  Although the story, plot, and characters are similar, The Stand is a better book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   Pyrrhic    is not without its flaws, but I don't think it's a bad book at all.   It's just the wrong size for the purpose of getting the gist of what was going on in the story.  This doesn't even take into account the fact that the author used the same character (a guy) and the same setting (a post-apocalyptic dystopia) to create two radically different stories about a very similar event.   It's also hard to tell if the events that happened to this guy are fictional (they're in the book) or if they are based on real life (we know for certain they aren't), but there's really not much reason to think that they are real, since they are never explained or even mentioned in the rest of the book.  I'm not a big fan of apocalyptic fiction, but if I am going to take a risk writing something that is explicitly not about a future apocalypse, I don' t know why I'd go through all the trouble to put in this sort of random crap.  It makes the book seem like a random collection of disconnected, unconnected, and unrelated stories that happened at some point in the last 10 years.  The writing isn't bad, but it's just not suited to the genre.  I liked the book, but not enough to give it 5 stars.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A very good book that is well written and told. The story and characters are extremely well drawn and the plot is interesting.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I highly recommend this book if you are at all interested in using your computer as a "home base" for a free speech-oriented website. The author presents a number of legal issues and challenges in the world of free speech (including the issues discussed in this book) using a humorous and well-researched point of view.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   My favorite book, but it took me a lot of time and patience.   I enjoyed this story a lot and I was satisfied with the book's ending.  The main character is very complex and a very great character.  He is a great love interest, and his love for his own child is a strong motivator in his decision to go into surgery.  It took me about three to four months of reading to finish this book and it made me want to read a book or two on this subject!   4/5 stars.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "I was surprised that the author was able to make her work as enjoyable as possible while maintaining an even temperament throughout. Her writing is so well done that I found myself wishing I could put down the book and start writing. This is a great story, and a wonderful book that I look forward to each year. It will take me many months to finish, but I feel that it will be worth the wait. I would recommend this to any writer looking to get better."  "I really enjoyed this book. It was an unusual and very well told story that I enjoyed thoroughly. There were a couple of things I liked about it that I didn't think was entirely necessary to make it the book that it is. There's some plot elements that seemed like they were there to set the stage for other things, and other things that were just sort of there that I wouldn't have noticed unless I read a lot. But overall I still found this book to be excellent. The author uses a bit of fantasy/folklore, but the story is focused on the characters. She has a nice balance between action and emotional stuff. I liked the way she put together the story in ways that fit the characters in the story. The only thing that I felt was a bit out of place was when she mentioned that there's a magical book on the desk of the protagonist, but that the protagonist never reads it. That was a little silly to me, but it didn't affect my enjoyment of the book. I just have to say that if I ever see a magical-book-of-death that says that the only way to get it is to pick it up, then I'm going to have to have a few words with the author of this book." It has been an honor and a pleasure to read this book, and I thank the author for her hard work in completing it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    (If you've read more than 5 books in a genre you enjoy, I encourage you to start with a little book from your own library and read it to get a taste for it.)   My Favorite Book of 2015 is (by far)  The Best of 2014. I think a lot of the reviews have been very positive, but I feel like it would be a lot more satisfying if this one had a less-than-average book rating because the book is so good! I would have loved to have seen a book that wasn't as hard to read or not as short for what it is. (For those unfamiliar with the work of Daniel José Older, it's an autobiography that I really enjoyed. ) The character development is amazing, but this book feels like a really personal book. His character is an incredible, fascinating one. There are also many references to the science fiction novels, which was something that was really unexpected. (Although this could be a book about the work that came after. I can imagine that it could feel somewhat similar to something like a science fiction novel.) The way his character talks about his work is fascinating to listen to and I would absolutely recommend this book. (And I can't wait to start the next one!) I'm a big fan of this genre (science fiction/fantasy), so The Best is one of the books that I've bought the most for the past few years.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A must-have!   This one is one of the few good non-fiction novels I've read in a long time.  It's the story of a black-and-white World War II pilot, and his adventures in Korea in the early 1950s.   He's the only white guy in the war; the rest of the pilots are all Korean.  The only other novel I've seen with a good amount of non-white characters, and the pilot is also non-Asian.  A great look into the war from both sides.  I only wish he had been a little more realistic in his depictions of Korea.  But hey, if you like good stories with strong characters, this one is for you!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It would be easy to conclude that these new books are so good because of their authors. These authors have written some of the best books on their field and some of my favorites as well.   It's a shame to have to say that, because my personal favorite authors aren't here (I will be reviewing the two new books for their authors and other excellent writing, but I have some personal preference in my favorite authors) - but, that being said, I will still say it is good to have the three authors here in this new series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My husband and I loved this book.   We had heard so many great things about it before we decided to read it, but we were so glad we did.  I don't read much science fiction but have been reading a lot of nonfiction lately and I have to say that this book definitely has been my favorite nonfiction book I have read recently.  This book is all about human psychology, the way that our brain works. The author makes this a very enjoyable read.  There were a couple times when I found myself being a little confused, but this was only because I have no clue what she was getting at.  It was so interesting.  The book also had some wonderful illustrations that made the book feel very well done.  My only complaint about the book was that it was a bit too long.  Maybe I would have liked a shorter book with fewer illustrations? I will probably start reading the sequel. 10/10.

Write a positive review about a good book:    If I had a book this would be it. It is a well written and highly intelligent piece on the subject of the evolution of social organization in pre-modern society. It's not a popular book, so expect a lot of hostility from religious conservatives. The book is well written, thought provoking and will likely change your worldview. (review from my local library)    From what I can understand this is a great book. I agree with the author, that it is hard to argue that all pre-historic societies were evil. There were always people who wanted to stay close to nature. But this book gives examples of when people were more "primitive" than the "primitives" of today. Some of the examples are: 1. People were "wild" as a child, and that is why some of the earliest human societies were. When did this happen? The book shows examples of people growing up in the forest with only the animals and other humans for company, until they have children of their own.  2. People had no social boundaries in prehistory. In many cases this is true, however, in other cases a certain social boundaries do exist. So I believe there are good points to the idea of being "wild".  3. People did have their own leaders. This was a common occurrence. , 4. They had to be careful when building roads as they might have a herd of wild animals at a short distance. This is an example of social hierarchy  , 5. In some cases people built temporary houses to stay away from the herd of animals. This has been shown to increase a people's population. In fact if you looked at the oldest pre-history sites on the planet the number of people in those sites are always smaller than the people of modern societies. 1, 2 and 5 I disagree with on the following points:  4 and 5 are easy to disprove. Prehistoric people built shelters for the animals on the roads, but also have no problem keeping up with the herd, as the people's own animals have not moved. If people were not going to live in the wild all the time then they would have to be living in other environments. And in the case of 4 and 5 the people are in different environments. Also in the cases of 4-5 they have not been living in those environments for so long, or their skills to interact with the animals has not evolved yet. So for
Write a positive review about a good book:        "If you're looking for a good read, look no further. This novel is an important one in the history of modern horror fiction." --Loretta Lynn, author of A House Divided, The Devil's Rejects and The House on Mango Street.   I'm reading this book and I've been enjoying it a lot.  The narrator does a good job of portraying the book in a manner that is both readable and not too long, yet the author doesn't go on a big tangent. The story starts out with a small story about a woman named Anne who has taken on the role of "the new girl in town." She has no one to talk to so she goes to a local tavern for drinks. This is a good choice for a short story that is set in the early 1900's. The tavern has been around since the 1800's and the owner is old and has lived in the town for decades. In a nice touch, we learn that the owner's wife died when she was very young. The inn has gone down hill since then. It was once the home of a well-respected doctor, but the medical practice went broke and they have been in the same building for more than half a century. In another nice touch the character that is introduced is named "Pussy." Pussy is not an innkeeper by profession, but a streetwalker. She doesn't know who the old man is in the tavern. The old man, a surgeon, takes a liking to her and he introduces Pussy to the town. He tells her that she will need to find a new place to live, as she is a long way from home. Pussy begins her search for a new home by sleeping on the railroad tracks and the other residents of the town try to help her out by finding out where she can find a bed to sleep on. But eventually Pussy's problems take a turn for the worse. She is being held in a small room. In her room the windows are closed and she cannot see anything outside. The man in the old house, the surgeon, and the town all are trying to keep Pussy quiet. When a group of children come to the house for a party, Pussy decides to escape. She gets on the train that takes her away from the town forever.    It's a short short story with a good, well-written narrator.  I highly recommend this story to anyone
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's like a cross between a science fiction novel and a fantasy novel.     - Review by Mark B.   I found the writing to be excellent, from start to finish.     This is a great book with a lot of thought put into it.   - Rating by Joe P.  I found the worldbuilding in this book interesting and I liked the use of different styles and techniques. The magic system is also really well done. The way in which the magic is used in this setting is also very interesting, and the way that it affects people is also a really interesting aspect. I think that the world building is very well done, and in the way the author describes what goes on, you can definitely see the care that went into this book. The only thing that I think is a little odd is that there is a lot more action than in the novel, but I think this is because the author wanted to show off the setting, and I think he did a great job. The story is very long (around 150k words), and it was a very enjoyable read overall.  The writing is very good and it has a lot going for it. The writing in this novel is great.  This book has a long, detailed and intriguing story, which is something that I appreciate in books.  It's something that is done pretty well here.  (The only downside that I can see is that the last 5% or so of the book is very repetitive. The ending was quite unsatisfying.)   It does a great service for setting a new world and it does so with a fair amount of depth and complexity.  In the end, the story is interesting and the book was a joy to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of those books I can see myself returning to time and time again for the experience of reading it. I'd like to see more of this kind of thing out there. This is very well researched and is filled with so much information it is difficult to go back and read it all. I also feel that the author is giving a lot of credit to his wife for keeping the manuscript a secret for so many years! I like the fact that it is so accessible and can be easily read in an hour and a half. Thanks for putting this book out there!!
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a really good book and I think everyone should read it.   It is a history of American labor unions and is written by a labor historian who also wrote a book about unions called The New Guilds: Industrial Labor in America, 1800-1913.  This book is based on actual transcripts of labor union meetings.  The history is presented in the form of a series of articles that are often very moving.  One of the articles in the book is an analysis of the New York Times, a newspaper for a wealthy and powerful class.  As the owner of the Times, Warren Buffett had a very strong opinion on union labor.  When Buffett died in 2011, his family refused to hand over the papers.  At one point a labor union member was in a dispute with the Times over the use of the term "union."  To Buffett's chagrin, he found out that the New Yorkers who owned the Times were union members.  It was probably good that he did not get to see them.  They probably liked Buffett's paper because it was pretty expensive.  There are a few points in this book that I disagree with.  First, I think that unions actually have much more power than they used to have.  I am not sure what the numbers are, but I suspect that the labor unions have a bigger impact on industry than they did in the 1960s.  Second, I am bothered that unions in this day and age can do something as simple as get employees on their side and use that information to change laws.  Third, I like the idea that unions have to constantly adapt.  Labor is a tricky game. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The narrator's voice was perfect. The narrator was not the voice of the book but an alternate perspective, someone else's thoughts, which is a very good thing. I was drawn in by the narration and not the plot. The book had a lot of character, which was exciting to read and made me want to continue. I think I read the book on my flight home. I really enjoyed it and found it very well done. The only thing I didn't like was the use of the title in the cover art. There was no text on the cover. It read "Dance with the Devil" rather than "Duel with the Dragon".   This is my second pick for the book club and I'm sure I'll give it another go in the future.    Read 5 reviews:  5.0 of 5 people found the following review helpful: . August 27, 2016 at 8:19am  I just finished reading Dance with the Devil by Lacey Hunt. It was a good experience and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something to read in the fantasy genre. I particularly enjoyed the writing style.  I got this book on a recommendation from a friend who had finished it and liked it. I have to admit I read it on my way to the airport, just for the sake of getting it out of my bag. I read a lot at airports, so I thought I'd try something different. I enjoyed the book and it took me a while to finish, so it took a while for me to recommend it.   What I liked about this book:   The premise is intriguing and fun. It does a great job of keeping the reader hooked until the last page.  's narrators narration is fantastic. It is believable and interesting and very immersive. The author writes well and her narration was spot on.   The story is very well written, as there are multiple POV's throughout the book. The story moves along well at a good pace. It will keep you on your toes and keep you wanting more.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   As long as I've been a fan, this book has been on my list.      In case you aren't familiar with this character, a former spy turned mercenary, he becomes embroiled in the criminal underworld when he returns home to Russia after his years in prison. The book takes a pretty light-hearted approach to the book, but I did enjoy it a bit more as the action progressed.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have to say that I really enjoyed this book. The plot was good, it had some nice world building, and it was very well written. I was so intrigued that the characters and their motivations were very real. It didn't feel like you were reading a "textbook." This is one that I plan to continue reading. I am going to start my next read on The Great Gatsby before I finish this one. I hope to read some more good books by this author! The Great Gattaca   This book has gotten 4 stars from me because it was a bit of a slog. I didn't enjoy the book that much. I think the main problem was with the ending. I found it to be unsatisfactory. The main character, Peter, was a little stereotypical and a bit annoying to me. However, I do like the book for the world building. The writing was good though.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read all three books of the Chronicles of the Necromancer trilogy. I am in the midst of reading this second book, and am very impressed. I can't help but get excited every time I am reading about these characters, as I want them to succeed in their goals. I have seen a good chunk of reviews on this series, and most of them are a mixed bag. The biggest complaints are that the authors are lazy and forgetful. This is a matter of personal taste. If you like good old fashioned fantasy with a dash of science fiction or even magical realism, you will enjoy this series. It is hard to imagine what the first book in the series will be like; it is almost impossible to imagine the second one either. I highly recommend the trilogy!
Write a positive review about a good book:    Read the first chapter and have fun. It starts out pretty interesting. I'm not sure why there are no women in the world who have the intelligence and talent that the female characters in this book have, but whatever, this is a fantasy novel so who cares. There are three different characters, who all have different levels of "talent", and the story focuses on a number of different races and their problems. This makes the story quite different than most. At one point, one character is a human, and another is a kor from the same planet, but only one of them has any talent, so their characters aren't really that interesting to me. But I'll give it the benefit of the doubt, and assume the author has good intentions, and is just writing what he thinks would be interesting to his readers. I found myself reading a lot more about these characters and their relationships, and their different races, than the main story, but that's fine. This is just a fantasy book. The only real criticism I have is that there is so much dialogue. The book has a lot of "dialogue", or the need to write "dialect". This book was written in a hurry, and the pacing is uneven. One chapter will have a lot, a lot talking, and then another will be all "so." I don't like that, and that's what makes this book a little "meh". I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone, but if you do want a fun, fast-paced read about different races of people, this might be worth a look.
Write a positive review about a good book:    What is your favorite novel? I love this book. I have read it a few times. I like the worldbuilding and the characters. I was interested in finding out about them. It is one of those books that I look forward to each time I get a chance to read it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The most important thing about this book is the fact that it's written in the style of a children's story, rather than in the form of a novel.   This is not to say that it can't be a book for adults but that the story it tells in this form is definitely much more enjoyable.    The author is a good storyteller and is able to create the perfect setting, for a story about three children in the jungle.  If you are a fan of Disney movies then this is a great book to read.  However, as this was first published in 1993, there are definitely better stories that are still worth reading.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I started this series after having read about it on a few other places. The book covers several subjects, and in each, you really come to understand why I would enjoy reading it. The first two books, which covered the first 3 months and the third and last three, I enjoyed. This is definitely a series I would want to keep reading. I am really glad I read it. 5 stars for it.
Write a positive review about a good book:     5 of 5 stars Sarah P. The book is very good and I am very grateful to have found it. I am currently trying to understand how I became so attached to my father's work and how I was not able to break away from the addiction. Thank you for your advice and guidance. I have finally broken free of the habit of my father and his books. He is now my mentor and I can only thank him. I will definitely recommend this book to others.  My father was always a writer. He was on the National Honor Society, was a history major at U of O, and a graduate of Western Washington University (in journalism). He worked as a staff writer for the Seattle Daily News. When I was young, he would read aloud to me the letters that he received. (I don't remember any of the names, but it was all very long.) I loved reading those letters. One morning, a note popped into my mailbox. It was from my father, who was writing about his book "The Power of Good." I was fascinated. I knew nothing about him and this letter is the first he ever sent me. (He was the only one who actually knew of it.) He told me that his book was a fictionalized account of a man's spiritual journey from a Catholic boyhood to a fundamentalist Christian youth camp. He wrote that he was a convert at that time, and that the experience led him to change his faith. It also lead him to develop a deep empathy for others. He said that he felt that all people were capable of making the right choices in their lives. This was exactly what I needed to hear! This was the first time that I felt that he actually felt that way. I read the letter and my heart broke. (As I said before, I had never heard anything in his books that said that his son would go out and kill others.) I was so torn up by the letter that I couldn't believe that he had actually written it. Then my father mailed me a copy of his book in response to my question, so I could get the book for myself. In that book he talked about his experiences as a child (he had been abused at an early age) and the spiritual journey that led him and his family to his beliefs. It didn't make sense to me at the time because I had always believed that his experiences were all just fantasies. But after I read that book, I realized that
Write a positive review about a good book:    "If you can stomach the first 40 pages of this thing, it's a really great introduction to the genre of science fiction, featuring a cast of characters who range from the intelligent but slightly arrogant to the morally complex and utterly evil. This is a fun and funny book that doesn't take itself too seriously. The characters are likable and, while it's the kind of story I would be happy to read again, it does have a bit of a slow-burn feel to it. The plot is fairly straightforward, as is common for many of the science fiction books I've read recently, but there is a nice sense of humor to it."  Read an excerpt here  "There is a sense of something very, very wrong in this world, and as you read this book you feel a little bit like the protagonist. This isn't the kind a good story wants to have, but it's still a lot of fun, and one that I really would recommend." 
Write a positive review about a good book:      I really liked this book. It's a nice mix of science and magic, and some very interesting ideas.   My review of:  The Feat of Knowledge: How to Become a Great Writer by David Foster Wallace David Foster Wallace was an English author. He has written a number of books, mostly non-fiction, but some popular fiction, like Infinite Jest, is also available.  Wallace is best known for his novel, Infinite J.  I read his book, and it is quite good, but not a true work of fiction. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm really enjoying this book. I like that this book explores different ideas in depth.

Thank you so much.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    One of my favourites:  In a word:  Amazing.   This is a book that was an absolute joy to read. I am amazed at how well the author has created and has done with the character of John F. Kennedy.  I have to say that I am a great admirer of John Kennedy and his life.  He was a man of great integrity, but he also was a political pragmatist.    He believed strongly in social justice and he always worked to make things fair and equitable for all Americans.  John Kennedy was a great man that I wish to see the country that he loved and the people of his life continue to lead the country in.  This book is a great introduction to one of the most important figures in the history of our nation. 4/5
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really love this book.   It's a quick read with a good, action-packed plot.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This was a pretty easy read. It was a story that I could relate to a lot, and one that I've watched many movies and tv shows based on. I could only really relate to one of the main characters, but I feel that it's easy to identify with all the main character's emotions. I enjoyed the fact that the story was realistic, although I did think that a good amount of information wasn't revealed at the end, but still I liked it for being realistic.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book on my way to the beach in Mexico and I loved it, but I am not sure I'll read any more.   I had some reservations about this book, because it seemed like a re-run of the "dynamic duo" trope from the earlier books, but it really wasn't.  This story was very interesting and different from previous books in the series and I enjoyed it.  I wish it was longer.  Overall, this is another great book in the Dragonlance series and a great addition to the series as a whole.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The only fault I can find in this book is in that we can read the same lines in multiple places and still get the message. It's hard to tell if the writer wanted to do more in the story or if the reader wanted a different result (I'm talking about the ending), but either way, this book would benefit from having another story in it (one not so much about the same person as about a whole family). A third character is introduced later, but it's more a story about the two who live with them: their son's boyfriend (I feel like I know him). I'm giving this four stars because I love the simplicity of the writing and the themes.   Someday, I hope to write an ode to the story of two mothers and a single son.  "It's funny how one man can be the very best thing that can happen to you."  (1) What I want to do is make a film about the love between two mothers who are fighting for their son and trying to make him happy.   (2) I am a single mother who was adopted. I feel like there is a way of life for every mother but I am not really seeing it right now. 
Write a positive review about a good book:        -   This is one of those rare books that I have both read and re-read so many times.   It may be the last book that I read in the original English language before I read it in translation.  In some ways the book has an uncanny quality to it.    I remember reading it years ago when I was 14 and it was one of my favourites and I can still remember the feelings of excitement and the fear as I discovered what awaited me in this mysterious land.  This is a very good book for people who are interested in this genre of story.  It is not your stereotypical fantasy novel, but this book manages to be a story about what is actually going on in a fantasy world.  This book was so incredibly well written.  There are a lot of memorable characters and you will not be disappointed if you read this.  I really enjoyed it when I re-visited the land of Erelke.  I was surprised that this book took so long to read.  The first half was very easy to read because the magic system was so very different.  But then the second half started and things really changed and I became very frustrated because the plot was a bit too slow and boring.  All in all, this is a book that everyone who reads fantasy should read. It's very difficult to put into words what makes this book so great because the story is so beautiful and interesting and I think that this makes this a good read for all ages. This was a very interesting review.  For me, it was about my desire to read this book again because I found this very interesting and different from other fantasy.  If you read these kinds of books, please give this a try.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book with an original thought is always enjoyable, and I found the story very interesting and captivating. The characters and story were all developed very well. I especially liked the way the story progressed, and all the twists and turns the author included. I also enjoyed the plot.   My favourite character in the book was Gwen.  She was strong, independent, and very funny.  This story was very well-written.  I think it was great to have a book of this kind in the library for young readers and adults alike. It can be very engaging to children as well.  My youngest daughter really enjoyed the book and I think it would be good for older kids too. It would be fun to have more books like this. I was happy to find this book at the library. I am looking forward to reading other books that have good writing.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "I can think of a whole slew of books that are better than this one, but I'm not going to buy it." -- Joe Sargent, book reviewer, The Oregonian "It's a little overlong, but the story it tells is a gripping and fascinating one." -- The New Yorker "A brilliantly written tale about a strange man whose life changes dramatically, and who is haunted by the ghost of his past." -- David Haglund, reviewer, Library Journal "A darkly funny, terrifying and thoroughly enjoyable book. There's an old saying that it takes more than a shotgun blast to kill a man, but that's not exactly true; it takes a book of great storytelling. Here, there's a good chance that the man in question won't even remember the experience." -- Stephen King, author of Dark Tower "Ethan is a thoroughly enjoyable protagonist who has the strength to walk a difficult road, but his emotional core has been scarred beyond healing. A tragic figure, Ethan seems like a throwback to our own time." -- Jonathan Lethem, author, The Fortress "Easily one of the best books on the short story that I've ever read.... The short story is the perfect vehicle for such a story. It's short, it's funny, it has an unforgettable protagonist (a man whose past is less than satisfying and whose present has been ruined by a terrible love affair) and it's not over until the last page." -- Robert Bly, author, The Last Days of Pompeii "Eliot has a gift for combining the absurd and the macabre with a surprising degree of emotional intelligence.

I liked how the author tried to provide a realistic look at the world. In this book he tried to explore the psychology behind depression, and that is what makes it good. I've heard a lot of people talking about the bad side of depression but never really bothered to explore it too deep. Here is a novel that is worth reading.

Write a positive review about a good book:  
Write a positive review about a good book:    If there is one thing I've learned through reading books is that if you read a book, or a series of books, over a period of time you'll pick up on little details that can tell you a lot about what you're reading.   For instance, in this book, I noted that the man who would become the villain in this story is named James.  I found this very interesting, because it meant that he was very young, and would probably have been born in the 18th century.  This fact is referenced in the book in the character's name, the fact that his parents were so poor they couldn't even afford a horse, and the fact the one thing they owned they gave away for free to a beggar.  The same book also states the following: "At the time James was born there was one child in the village who lived on the same plantation as his father."   I'm guessing this is what caused him to take up an axe and try to cut down the trees in order to gain a piece of land.  He was also raised by a woman named Mary, but that's not too interesting since she's his sister.  If James hadn't been such a simple-minded boy his whole life he would have become the main character in his own story.  In a previous review I talked about how this was one of the more interesting villains of the book.  Even though it took me a while to read it, once I got into it I really enjoyed this story. And while I didn't enjoy his actions as a young boy, it was still fun seeing how he became evil.  However, there is a character I absolutely hate in this series.  She's a woman who can make someone into a monster with a thought. She has a similar personality to the demon in the previous story. She is a very evil character, and will just make people into monsters just to take the credit for them.  And she's also the villain.  It's a bit frustrating that the hero never really takes advantage of this, because if he had she wouldn't have had to.

Why is it so thick? I've never read anything that thick. The pictures in the book are really really good, but I can only use half of the page... What a waste.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book helped me to understand the concept of "snow" and how this idea evolved into a term to be used to describe the cold temperature of the Arctic.   I also found this to be a very good read for a beginning climatologist.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in studying the climatological changes of the arctic.  The information within this book is well-organized and is a good introduction to a topic that can be very difficult to study in depth.  I will recommend this to everyone, regardless of what you want to study.
Write a positive review about a good book:    *   For me, I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in learning to play the clarinet, but the book really was a great introduction to music.    The author, who has played the clarinets for over 30 years, has an excellent and very clear writing style that makes reading his book extremely enjoyable.     I can't say enough good things about this book.  The author is a great and insightful teacher  
Write a positive review about a good book:     "If you have not read this book, get a copy before you leave."  —Booklist  Review: The War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells   "Wells is an original, a visionary, a writer who can weave together two very different themes into an exciting and engaging book. As a writer, Wells may be the very best we have." "We have no way of knowing the full extent of the impact on the world of Wells' story, but the story of radio was far from over. For every radio program that fell silent in the mid-century, there were a few that continued, and a few more that began anew."  in the book as a book "The War of The Worlds" is the only novel to have a radio drama as an adaptation. It is the first of a series of radio dramas that made its way through the early decades of the 20th century. It has always been very popular as a radio series, but never in the way that the novel is. It began life as a novel and was originally published in serial form, but then was collected into one large volume, and then another large volume with a series radio play. And then it was published as a series in the form that it ended up, radio drama.  In many ways it is the same as any other radio drama – there is a central central protagonist, an ensemble cast and a plot. But, although it might be entertaining to sit back and listen to some of the conversations, it is hard not to be captivated by the imagination and the genius of H. G. Wells. He is a genius. He was also a great storyteller, and in The War Of The Worlds he takes the best elements from the novel, the narrative structure and some of its ideas, and creates a whole new world of drama with it.   For instance, the radio play is full of the sort of inventions that you could never imagine if you were on a set that didn't include a radio transmitter. I had forgotten the "polar ice-cream" and "telephones without wires", but the radio drama doesn't forget them.  (p. 9) The characters themselves are also wonderfully invented. As the plot unfolds the radio character gradually becomes more and more interesting, and we are soon immersed in his mind. And it's not just a mind – it's an entire society as well. This is a

It is funny, and it's smart, and its characters are believable, and the story and the ending are really good. This is a very good book. I like it."  ---S.M. Stirling, author of The Best of the Best   "I can't think of a book I read over the last year or so that I enjoyed as much as this one did. It's the rare book that makes you laugh out loud while learning something. And it's a book that you can put down and come back to again and again." ....   If you are a fan of funny books, this book is for you. If you are looking for an enjoyable read for a first book, or just a fun romp through a dark, twisted world, this is the book for you!   I love this book.   * I really liked the book's tone. It was fun to read, but also really frightening. A lot of the ideas that the characters had, such as the "Berserker" bloodlust, were really cool. I also thought it was funny. The characters were really believable.     . * The book is a combination of horror, fantasy, and humor. Each character had their own unique personality. The horror elements were well done. The humor was pretty funny.   is an enjoyable romp across the vast land of Narnia. It takes place in the land of Parnath, a place that is very unique in the world of fantasy. This world is not earth. It isn't a "mundane" place that we all are used to. There are some pretty dark elements. This book is very well written. The story keeps you guessing throughout, and keeps you on the edge of your seat.   a fantasy that is dark but not grimdark. The stories are dark, but not overly dark. The book's story isn't just about Harry, or the other characters in the story, but about the reader as well. If I hadn't been expecting to be surprised, the book would have been a total surprise to me. The author doesn't have an overly serious tone. This story keeps things fun, but it's not all humor and fun. It has some serious themes going on. You will be disappointed if you don't like this book, but

Write a positive review about a good book:   If this is the kind of book that you were expecting, then you will find something of value in this novel. The story is told from different perspectives; a man's life in the military and a man in a wheelchair struggling to adapt to life after an accident. The pacing is slow, and the characters are not that interesting. The ending of this book is unsatisfying, however, and does not really leave the impression of a good ending. This book does have a lot of promise. I will read more of this.

Write a positive review about a good book:      This book is a must-read for anyone wanting to start a new hobby of birding.   I was in the process of switching to birding and found this book to be a great addition to my birding library.  I have two little guys (Sparrow and Dove) that I've been looking for for a long time.  This book has been a great resource to keep me motivated to get the information I need to find them.  The images and photos help to show the different birds and give a great birding experience.  My only complaint is that I wish they had a "What to Do" list.  Another thing I would change is the fact that there is no pictures for every bird in this book.  However, the birds are all fairly well known. I hope this is just a little small complaint for a wonderful resource.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've enjoyed the new and revised editions of these classic novels by C.S. Lewis since they were first published, but I didn't know there were any more!   The stories are as timeless as they are entertaining, and you can't go wrong with any of them, but it's the details that make it all worth having.   (From: "A Plea for Lewis' New Books" on his personal website ) What is a Plea? A Plea is a series of short articles written by myself, in the form of letters from fans of a certain book, intended to help readers pick the right one to read. I will be adding letters to this page at a regular interval from now on. For readers who enjoy the work of C. S. Lewis and who do not like the new edition of Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe by C S Lewis, I recommend the following books. Chronicles of the Narniad by C H.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This was a brilliant book. My friends and I were discussing it and I said that I read it in one day so that it was good for an entire week. I'm glad I read this on the weekend. The book is a great introduction to the world of kung fu and the book is well written. The authors have a great sense of humour and the descriptions of the culture are just so fun to read.  I was not impressed with this book. In fact, I think I'm going to return it to library for a refund. The story is so poorly written, the author doesn't think about what type of fiction he's writing. Instead, he just tells a fun story about a bunch of karate guys who are in a karate tournament and the tournament is held at a hotel (the author's hometown). There is nothing to be said about the story other than that I really enjoyed the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I started this book in December, and finished it on September 30, 2018, which is almost a year to the date of publication. This book is definitely a work of fiction but it is quite well written, and a wonderful read. It's full of wonderful and vivid descriptions, the description of the different scenes, and the descriptions of the characters. I really liked the characters: all the main characters are very realistic, even the women and children. There were some characters who really annoyed me: for example, the men are obsessed with sex, especially their sexual encounters, but even though the main character has a fetish for female breast, he couldn't control himself around a real woman. I am also annoyed by the characters who take pleasure from the suffering of others and don't care about anyone's personal issues: the little girl in the hospital who is being cared for because she has cancer and no one else can make her better. Also, I would have liked more discussion about the medical issues the main protagonist is dealing with, I think she was an incredible doctor but there was too much silence about these issues. The illustrations and some of the illustrations are so beautiful, and I really like how there are different styles, different scenes (like in the scene of the nurse's party), different situations (like at the school). I also like that they wrote the book from the perspective of a woman in the middle of all this; she is not in the background like we are in many books about war and war atrocities, and she is the one who has to deal with the war itself. All in all, it's a great book and I recommend it to all women, both young and old, because it's definitely not just a female version of a book about men being men.

I will read more of the author's other books.
Write a positive review about a good book:    Reviewing a good story is never easy; I get nervous and jittery every time.   One of the things I like about reading is the chance to pick up a book and immediately put it down and start it over.  In this way, I've tried to write a review for the latest book in the Star Wars Expanded Universe and I'm pretty happy with the result.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I started this series.  The idea that Star Wars  needed a sequel was just so exciting!   I read the first trilogy, which were the first books in the series. Then, when George Lucas started work on the prequel trilogy he created, I wasn`t sure if the story had ended or if there was a new one.  When I heard that the sequel was coming, I thought I would love this book and not be disappointed.  So, the first few pages I was skeptical.  Then, I got excited.  But, there were a few issues.  First, it was hard to get used to the idea of a Jedi and Sith being friends.  For a while, I wanted to make that happen.  It really wasn't until about chapter 10 or so that I realized they were actually rivals.  They both hate the Force and each wants to rule it.  With the help of a new master, they can finally get their hands on the Dark Side, the Sith.  As far as their romance goes, it wasn't all that bad.  Not that it was bad. I thought it was pretty good.  At least, they did have a good time together.  However, it felt like it wasn` t really meant to be.  This isn`t the way Luke and Leia were meant to fall in love.  Luke should have fallen in love with Han or Leia and been happy.  Perhaps they were meant for each other?  In any case, I was a bit disappointed that this story did not explore the new powers that Luke was getting.  His mastery of the Force should have led him to use his power to save Han and Leia and help them become heroes.  He didn't use them because he doesn`t care about them, or even because of his feelings.  And, that really bothers me.  Although this book did have some interesting stories, I felt that this series had been going on too long.  Lucas took out a lot of the
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read all of the books by Robert Jordan, and enjoyed them all. There's one thing that always bothered me though, which is that they seemed to have done the same amount of research as my average "high fantasy" fantasy novel, and then added a bunch of their own "unique" details to try to add a little more "mystery" to the story. I mean, the "history" from Jordan, of the first night he encountered the Aiel, to the creation of the White Tower (and its mysterious location in the Shadow), to the various legends of the First Men and their descendants, to Rand's childhood, to how he came to be so close with the Aes Sedai, to what really happened between Rand and Mat, to why the Forsaken are still active, and so on. These details, which aren't really that unique by themselves, feel like they've been copied and pasted from every other high fantasy book I've ever read. But, as I've said before, that's exactly what high fantasy is about: putting all that history into a novel and hoping that you can somehow tie all the loose ends of the past together into a coherent whole. So, I was surprised when I saw that RJ and his publishers hadn't put out a follow-up to A Crown of Swords, and when I read that this book would be his last. He had just announced that he would be retiring from writing in the near future, and I figured that it would be time for him to make his grand final chapter. However, he released a teaser, and it really gave me a lot to think about. First of all, it's the same format that A Memory of Light has used since his first book was published, with a big prologue, the first chapters, a lot of characters, and a closing chapter that ends it all. Secondly, it has the same characters in it: Rand, Mat, Perrin, etc. Thirdly, it takes place directly after A Crown, and contains almost no new information about the characters except for a few new characters and some new information on the world. It's basically a completely different story, but a completely the same story as A Crown. I'm not going to say anything more about this because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, but I thought it was a really cool move. The teaser has some pretty cool scenes, and seems to imply that he has some more big things planned
Write a positive review about a good book:    The idea is simple:  The idea is basic: the human being is capable of much better and a lot more. We can become much better people, through training and discipline. What I got was a very good start.  The book doesn't say how to do it, but it provides a clear view on the basics of the path. An extremely positive and practical book. I liked the fact that it was written with a lot of humour, especially when it comes to the various types of training you can undertake. The first part is mainly about the principles of nutrition: the most important thing for our body and our mind. When it comes down to it, everything is more important than the food we eat.   There is nothing more fundamental for your life.   It is clear that the first principle is that everything has a direct and immediate impact on our bodies.   It also says that there is more to nutrition than just what is on our table.   Some foods may be beneficial to some people, while not for others.   We also need to think about what we need in order to maintain our body's physical and mental health, as well as our emotional state. This part gives a lot about the importance of proper nutrition: to make sure that our body is receiving the right amount of calories and nutrients (with some exceptions), as well that our bodies get enough sleep.   There is also a brief section about fasting.  I was a little worried about this part but it was actually really good!   This book does a lot for me on an emotional level, I found that the chapter on fasting was very useful in understanding my own need for a break from eating and how I could do it for a limited time, without going on a diet, and without feeling hungry at all.  This section also contains useful tips and reminders about how to avoid any cravings.  It's a great, very well written and easy to understand book and is a great start on your journey towards an improved lifestyle.  I can't recommend this book highly enough and would highly recommend it to anybody looking for more information about nutrition or health. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't have any bad things to say about this one. This is not a great book and I am sure that it will not be for everyone. That being said, I will give it two stars for that: "The first chapter of this book is a masterpiece, filled with character development, an incredible narrative, and a strong plot."   That is an honest review I have written.   (more notes about the review below)   In my review of The Good Earth, I said that I would give the story one star but I decided to make a "hope" rating instead.  A review like that sounds nice. I don´t think you have to have a high opinion of this author to rate the book low or high. I think it depends on how you interpret the book. As I was reading it, I have a very good feeling about it.  I would say that the writing was very good. The book is full of interesting characters and interesting stories and it doesn´t have many surprises. The only problem I had was that there were only six main characters and the first six chapters are basically the same. However, the first chapter is really awesome and it does a lot to open the book and introduce the world. The ending of the book is definitely something I am looking forward to reading more about. It also has a great ending so far, so there is that. There are a lot of interesting things about the setting of this world and the characters.  I also think that there is a huge potential for this story to get even better as the author continues. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read this and i can say it's one of the best books i have read. The way they make it realistic is excellent. The plot is interesting and the characters are well written.

This is the perfect combination of the military and conspiracy thriller books and i highly recommend this one!

Write a positive review about a good book:    What I liked:  The characters were realistic and interesting, and there were several different viewpoints to consider.   Pacing and action were solid:  (3/5)   The plot was weak, but didn't take much away from the story, as I would expect.  Novel-quality writing: (4/5):   This was a great novel to read because of how well the characters were portrayed.  It was clear from the beginning that the book would take place in a world that was heavily influenced by the Roman Empire.  I really enjoyed the descriptions of the people and world in the story.  For a non-Roman (and thus Roman) setting, this one was quite well-done. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In The Last Days, George R. R. Martin tells of the end of the world. It's a short book and as I mentioned in my review of Dune, it has some major problems with pacing and exposition. However, there is a lot to love in this book and it's a must read for anyone with an interest in the story of George R r r Martin.   It took me a while to read this one, but it's well worth it. The story of the story is well told and the characters, while not the same as in Dune (for instance, Balian the Redguard is the only true villain of the book), are well-developed and interesting. There is much to discuss about the story (in particular, the politics and theology of Martin's universe, the fact that it is fantasy) and I recommend it highly, though I do admit that it has its faults. The first thing to note is that there are a lot of names that don't have very obvious links to Dune. So if you're a Dune aficionado, you'll be a little lost and you probably won't love this book as much.     The second problem that I have with the book is that the pace is really slow. I don't know what this book was trying to be but it never gets going. I'm sure that there was a very good reason for this, but to me it just didn't work. The plot was fascinating and the prose was captivating, but the pace didn't allow it to develop much and it got me wanting to know what happens next in the storyline.  The story of The Last Kings is really cool and while it's an interesting concept, it never really made me want to read the whole series. It takes a while for things to happen, and a lot is left to the imagination.  The first time I read it was while listening to the audiobook, and I can see why Martin would prefer this way of telling the story, but I didn't love it.  However, I do love what he does with the magic in the world and I really liked how it evolved. I also liked how he created this world and how the religions, and even the customs, worked in this world. I can understand how he decided to take such a long time to tell the story and I think this is a flaw that can be avoided with a shorter book.  I can't wait to

Write a positive review about a good book:    I love the characters and setting of this book.   It really does come across as a book that could be the first of many books from the author.  There's nothing particularly spectacular here, but it is a well-written tale.  It is a short book at just over 500 pages.  The writing style is smooth and easy to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:     A very fun book to read. The main character is interesting and likable, I enjoyed her story. The pacing of the story was very good and I was able to finish the book quickly without getting bored.  I will most likely pick this up again. I would also suggest you read some of the other books by the author. She is a talented author.  and finally I would like to share my thoughts about the writing style in this book:  This book uses a very easy to read style of writing. The story is about a young girl, she does not need many details to know who she is and why she does what she does. She seems to be a normal kid with a strange dream. I enjoyed the way the author writes and the characters. I liked the characters as much as I liked some of her other novels. I like her style and style of storytelling. She uses a certain language that I have not heard before. I can not help it but laugh out loud sometimes because of how easy the author made her language feel. Her writing style is something I want to continue reading in the future. Her stories were great and I definitely recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My book "The Little Book of Veganism: How to live your vegan dreams" is an excellent guide to veganism. I can confidently say that this book is the best book I have ever read on veganism, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in a simple, non-technical introduction to vegan eating. It is written by a vegan chef and vegan consultant, but he uses scientific and logical arguments to convince his readers that a plant-based diet is more healthful, and more fulfilling than one that is entirely animal-based. I was very surprised when I read that a vegan cookbook is not available in this format because it is so easy to understand and very informative. As far as vegan cookbooks go, it is my favorite.

Write a positive review about a good book:     I have just finished a book on the early Mormon experience written by a non-Mormon, which I have come to admire and respect. The book, by David L. Paulsen, takes a new approach, I thought, not to tell us the whole story of the early Church, but to describe a Mormon who, through a number of personal circumstances and an unusual series of events, had an unusually happy childhood. It is a good read, though as a historical work, a little thin. But it is a powerful testimony of the power of a good person, a good community, and the power, for good people, of a positive, trusting attitude.

From this blog post "This book is a solid read for anyone who appreciates the fine art of the thriller... It will keep you on the edge of your seat and not let you rest until you've figured out who and what is causing all the carnage and death.... It's a very, very clever thriller.. ." From a review at Goodreads  "One of my favorite mysteries and I'm really looking forward to the next one."  From a Goodreads review at Amazon  I've been interested in paranormal research for a long time, because for me it was a subject that intrigued me in a totally different way than some of the other paranormal books I'd read. So I've been looking forward for the next book. I'm not sure what the next will be called, but I think I'm going to give it a shot. I was delighted that my first real read of the series was a thriller. And it's so different from most thriller books, because it's about two characters working together to solve the mystery. It feels less like a mystery and more like a thriller with a very real story that doesn't take itself seriously, in a very enjoyable way. The book has been on my reading list for some time, and I think it's a really good book. So far, I like it.

" The whole book is worth reading as a cautionary tale about how life goes for one in a war-torn country during a time of desperate need. - David Leavitt- A review for the book " (This is a review for ALL books by Marilynne Robinson ) 
Write a positive review about a good book:    Read for fun. My wife and I will be taking our first trip together. I'm so looking forward to the trip and to reading this book.   This book was not the most complex of the three I have read so far, but it was the most fun. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In a way, this book was perfect. The structure of the book is flawless: the first chapter, a short explanation of the topic; the next two chapters, short stories from my own life that have been used as examples to support the points; the last two chapters are longer, elaboration of some points, and then a discussion of the last four chapters (one story was adapted to the point of the story), which gives a better understanding of the subject matter and makes the topic more "readable".   I recommend this book to a friend who is trying to understand the issue of sexual slavery. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   The book was very well written. It would take a long time to read, but I enjoyed it. I like stories in which the author goes beyond what is usual and makes some sort of impact.   The narrator was good. There was a bit of a narrator thing going on. I was expecting the narrator to be more of a fan of the book than me. It wasn't a huge problem for me.  There is a problem with the way the book is told, it has two different narrators. The first is the main character who is a man. The other narrator is a woman. I don't have any problem with that, but it seems a bit strange. It just doesn't fit.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The only negative point I have with this book is the cover. The book is set in a world with a very dark and gritty feel to it. It was pretty dark and the style of the art wasn't really to my liking. If I were in the mood for a more lighthearted adventure I could probably go with the cover I did for the "The Fortuneteller" or the "Coyote". I can't really think of a good reason to change the cover though. The title is a nice word to use because it really shows the tone of the story: the "fortunetelling" of the old folk who are all around you. "The Last of the Fauns" is a very nice story as well and a good way to wrap up the book. There's a whole bunch of adventures in this one, I am surprised there aren't more.  Rating:   "The Last Of The Faun" is the first book in the "Children of the Night" series by M.A.R. Barker. This book takes place in a parallel world where humanity has gone extinct and the last humans left on Earth were Faun's. As a child M.R Barker is an avid fan of children's books. This became the focus of her children's book series and she wrote an encyclopedia for them titled "M.A.-R.A." After the extinction of humans there was a large population of Faun in the world. This was a time of chaos and death, all humans who were unable to make it to the next generation were slaughtered and it was the Fauchers who were left with the job of helping those who were not so fortunate. M.B says she wrote her encyclopedia to help her children understand that the Fauna were not bad people: they had made a terrible mistake by hunting humanity, but had also done some good for the Faire. The Faucher children had a lot to learn.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I started this one reading it as a kid.   The thing that really stands out to me is that it was written in the 1940s.  I know I'm just being shallow, but as a 7 year old my mind has been conditioned to only think about the future.  This makes me wonder how this book is being taught in schools today.  The best part about this book was when my teacher in school told us to read the book and find out what our future was going to look like.  My teacher also said that this book "was a good time to learn about the civil war"   After that we went on to read a few of the other books.  If you can read a book that was written over a century ago that was just about the Civil War I highly recommend this book  
Write a positive review about a good book:        This book is a really good one. I am an artist, and this book is the result of a long journey. It was difficult at first, but now it's very easy.    A very useful book. I like what I see, it shows a way for us to communicate and see the world that a child doesn't have.
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's hard to be objective about a book that's as much a part of my childhood as a Barbie book, but "The Adventures of the Super Spy"   by George Lucas is an okay little read and a nice treat from a man who seems to like the whole Star Wars thing.    This is the first Star Wars movie that's ever gotten me excited, and it's certainly a fun and unique piece of the saga.  My favorite moments involve Chewbacca.  In a book about one of the most awesome spaceships ever made, it's interesting to see how this one was designed and how it's different from the other, smaller, "special" ships.  It seems like this "super-spy" was designed for just one thing, but it does everything well.  For instance, Chewie is able to pilot the ship as if he were walking on his hands because he has super-strength.  I mean, why wouldn't he be able to, right?  Also, it reminds me a lot of how the T-16 and T-38, two similarly named Star Wars vehicles, were meant to be more rugged and less mobile than other T-series models.  But it also helps that we get to see Chewbaccas in their early years.  There's a lot more to the book than I've already read, so I highly recommend it if you're a Star Wars fan.  -J.R.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book, and I can recommend it highly to readers and teachers. If a new teacher takes this book on as a resource, they will likely be well on their way to success. The main character, Lucy, is an excellent example of how to approach the topic of literacy in a way that is useful and exciting. Her life story is interesting as well, but the book takes an unexpected turn near the end that is a very pleasant surprise.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite part of the book is actually reading the "The Best-of" portion, because that's when you get a chance to read about the actual process of creating the book. I'm an editor and I've been editing books for the last 10-15 years. I read a lot of book and magazine articles about what they do. I've seen a lot more than a few books that were so bad that I was like, "What the hell is going on here?" So I tried to do some research into the "what is the process" to see how they do things. In the end I came away really intrigued because I didn't think they did things in a conventional or traditional way. As an editor I think I'm one of the best-prepared people in the country because I've studied the way they work. And it was interesting to see it from their point of view. And I was surprised that they didn't use any of the traditional publishing methods (not that I'm a traditional publisher!).   There were a lot less editing steps (and many less things to edit for) and more editing "takes." That's why I liked it the most. The editing was very "creative" and I'm going to start my own editing service.   If you haven't read this book yet, please read it.  The following are excerpts from the book which provide some insight into the editing process.  First of all, they have several chapters in the book (the first 10 or so), and the next 10 are called "The Editors," which are actually about their personal lives and experiences. One of the things they mention about themselves in the "the editors" section is that they actually do not edit in any traditional sense. They just do their own thing. If a book is a rough draft, they can work on that rough draft and make it "better." If the book needs a bit of polishing, then they can do that too. I really liked that section. One thing that struck me about their own approach to editing is that it's extremely collaborative. They often have a whole team of people at their disposal, and a variety of different opinions. For each book, they will have different opinions about how they think each page should go and they try to work together in a very collaborative way.  They don't want to have any sort of "editor" who is simply in charge of making a book look better.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first book I have ever read. I loved it. This is my second time reading the series. It is very difficult to read but not a bad book at all. I was very happy with my purchase.  5 out of 5 good book and great service I recently purchased a copy of this series on amazon.com and was impressed with the overall package. The quality of the book itself is great. I would like to add that I received the books in about a week. The delivery was very quick. My only issue with the book was that it did not come with a dust jacket. If I had known that I would not have purchased a second copy. Overall a great purchase. If you enjoy the series please purchase this book.  and i was extremely pleased by the excellent quality of this book and service that was offered by the seller and also the prompt arrival of the books after a week's time. This book has now become a favorite of mine and I hope that this review helps you to make a decision as well. Thank you for a very well executed series
Write a positive review about a good book:   The main characters are well developed and the worldbuilding is amazing.   It has enough plot to keep your interest, but nothing too epic.  This is the first of two in a series and the sequel is great.  If you have a great imagination, like a child's, this is a fun book to read.  The author does an excellent job of world building with his characters and plotlines. The main characters have strong personalities and you can definitely see where the author got his inspiration from. The book takes place in a future world, which is a little bit like the "post apocalyptic world" genre, but with a twist that makes it seem even more futuristic.  I love how the author makes you feel a bit like a detective, because as a detective you need to piece together a lot of clues. This is definitely a good read for the detective in you.

Write a positive review about a good book:    If I have one complaint about this book it is that it can get a bit long when the main character is a teenager.   He has lots of interesting ideas in a short time, but it can be hard to keep up with all the details.  Still, the book is a quick and interesting read.  It is a good addition to your science fiction collection and well worth your time.

The way it is written is very good and very accurate. I do not regret giving the book 3 stars. The book is a really good description of the war and the war-time. You have to do the math on how many soldiers have to die every day and the way the Army gets them killed is really accurate. , September 13, 2015
Write a positive review about a good book:    "When he was fourteen, Michael first saw his dad play baseball for the University of Maryland, and his dad started to get serious about pitching after a few years with a mediocre club team in Baltimore. The only problem with this is that he is really just average, and as an adult, he has become mediocre, in both the baseball sense of mediocre and the basketball sense of really good.  There are times when he pitches like his father, and times when his father pitches like a professional baseball player: when he makes a few mistakes on the mound, he can usually pick himself up and go back to being his old self.  His dad does most of the work, but Mike has to have good eyes. He sees a lot of things on the field and he's got a pretty good radar when it comes to pitches.  But he's never really been good with pitchers, and he rarely lets the coaches see the potential he has in him.  Mike has been the same guy his whole life and it's a problem.  He's always looking to improve, but when he does, it usually looks like his eyes are going to get him into trouble.  Michael's eyes are one of the many things that separate him from his father.   If his eyes weren't so good, I think he'd be more like his dad.  Because his eyes aren't great, he's often looked upon as a bad kid.  Now, I can't really blame his dad for that.  His father is the one who put him in baseball in the first place, and so there's a good chance he's just trying to make the most of what he has.  When it comes down to it, though, Michael is still just the same Michael.  I don't know what kind of eyes Michael has, or if he even cares.  It's pretty clear though that the only reason he plays the game is because he likes it and it helps him pay his bills.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book and would recommend it to anyone, even to someone who isn't a fan of urban fantasy, which I don't think is a genre I would like to try. The writing is perfect for the urban fantasy genre and is entertaining from beginning to end. The characters are realistic and believable and the story was interesting from start to finish. The author's writing style is well written, the story itself is engaging and the author is a good story teller. The story is good, but not quite good enough to make this a 5-star book. I would suggest the book to urban fantasy readers who enjoy a good urban fantasy. This is a great book and I would highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I like this book a lot. It's a solid collection that should appeal to most people who love science fiction. There are some things in here that I didn't like but I still liked them a lot enough to recommend this book to most sci fi fans.   I've also heard that some people hate the story about the ship that crashes and its crew getting stranded on a planet.   I didn't mind it, because it really just was a new twist on the old story, I actually thought that it was neat and was fun to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was recently at a science fiction and fantasy book store and I happened upon a copy of the new "Gravity's Rainbow" by Robert Silverberg and was thrilled to have this new classic to add to my collection. I have to confess I've been looking for a long time for the book and finally was able to find a copy for only a few bucks. "Gravitrons" was written in the 1960s, and is not the same as the movie. If you have seen the movie, you will realize the original was the more sophisticated and more accurate movie. In the book, the book is actually called "Grain Gravies" because of the science behind gravity. The gravity of the book works in a way like the gravity in the movie as well as other gravity-related books. As the gravity of a "gravitron" grows, it attracts other gravitrons (other gravitons) to itself. The greater the gravitational attractor, the more gravity is attracted to it. Thus, as the gravity attracts the gravitron, the graviton becomes more and more gravitronic and eventually becomes a black hole. As soon as the gravitor is a blackhole, it can do anything it likes, and it will pull in everything around it. At a certain point, the gravitational energy reaches a "critical mass" which causes the gravitizent (that is, the object being pulled towards the center) to be "sucked in" by the gravity. Then, like a balloon, the "sucking force" is released. This is why there is a "pop" when you go through a blackhalo. The blackhole is created when the gravitic medium is very large but the density is so low that there is no density gradient to pull anything in. Therefore, there is nothing to pull in, so the gravitaion is released and the graviotron is released (or so it would seem). The gravitational medium (the material on the inside of the blackhole) is not a vacuum, it is a very strongly attracted medium which sucks in everything and holds the object in place (until it becomes a supermassive blackhole). The book is not set in a vacuum so I'm not sure where the "pop pop pop" came from, but it seems to be in fact a result of the gravitational collapse which occurs when the gravity increases too high. Since the object which is pulled in and pulled out by the black hole
Write a positive review about a good book:     What I really like about this book is the way the author portrays himself as the man who gets it. A lot of writers write from a place of ignorance or fear of the unknown, and this man shows no fear. He talks about the wonders of life, and how they can be accessed by being open to the wonder of the moment.   The author is an excellent example of the open-mindedness that can be a key factor in opening up the mind to the wonders and mysteries of the universe.    " The idea that the natural world is a mystery is, I would argue, the basis of modern science."  --Robert P. George, a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a frequent contributor to Commentary.  "This book will make you happy, and I'm pretty sure you will." --James W. Loewen, a physicist, author and lecturer on science.

It was written from a female point of view, and really captured the feelings of a very nervous and shy child trying to make friends.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was really surprised by this book, I thought it was just some rambling diatribe against Christianity. But the author's understanding of a Christian worldview is actually very interesting and illuminating. It is as if he is writing a short, detailed treatise on the Christian worldview and the beliefs of the people who subscribe to it. It's a very enjoyable read, and as far as I know there is very little other information available that is as comprehensive or as informative as the author has gathered from his many years as an apologist for Christianity.

Write a positive review about a good book:     The first book of The Great War series is a brilliant read in the truest sense. It was written in 1936, the same year the US entered the Second World War. In my opinion, the Second was a more dangerous war for the US, since many of its soldiers were killed on the Eastern Front. The Second was, however, a more interesting one for my own interests. I enjoyed the story of two very similar characters, the American colonel (James "Machine" Kirby) and a British officer (Avery "Dapper" Fergusson). They were both in the same army (the British). However, there was an important difference: the British General thought he had to do the fighting on the Western Front; the US general thought the Western front would be just as good a battle as any on the eastern front. The two men eventually meet up again, after both their countries are in dire straits. The book is quite short (125 pages), and is a real work of history. The only thing I did not like was the ending.  I will never forget when I first read this book. I was 11 or 12 years old, and this was the first time I had ever heard of The Second World war. I just found it fascinating!  Review by: Anonymous
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book on the first try, and I loved it. I was surprised to find how well it is told. I didn't realize I had heard so many stories about how the government is working with the industry. It didn't feel like that was all there was. I really felt like I was in on the secret. I'm glad I read the book. The title and description got my interest right away. I enjoyed the adventure and the mysteries. I think this book can be considered a spy novel. I like how it was different than most books that I have read. This wasn't something that was told from one point of view or one viewpoint. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you are a fan of science fiction, read this book.  I loved it!!! - May 26, 2010Excellent  Reviewer: John D. from Seattle, WA USA - May 24, 2010  Subject: I liked it but  It was a well-written book by a master, but the story line and characters felt like a rehash. That is not the author's fault and doesn't detract from the book at all. The narrator was a nice change from the usual boring "everyman" type who's main job is to narrate a story, but that's it. The story felt like an hour-long soap opera, complete with a series of cliches that reminded me of the original Star Trek pilot, "A Private Little War".   This is the only book I have ever read by a non-American author, and the only one that made me laugh out loud at first and then realize how bad it was.   If you're looking for a good read in a short time, this is a good choice. However, I would recommend you buy the book before you read it.

They would probably argue. It was obvious to me that both authors had taken some classes in their undergraduate degree and knew the basics of their chosen field, but then you mix them with the people that know the field best...the authors themselves, and you get something like this.   a few years ago a couple of people at a conference came to me and asked what I thought of their book (the book was published by an American publisher). I told them the book was good but not great. I was only in a "literary" mindset at the time.   of course they said that they knew what was good and bad, and this book seemed to fit the bill. I told the two guys at the conference that the book had a couple flaws, one of which I could see in a single reading, and they just didn't care. The other thing that stuck with me was the author, who I felt sounded like an arrogant, ignorant, "no-name" author in the first half of the

It was like I was reading a series of science fiction novels written in the 1990s. It is also like a modern take on the story of Jack and the Beanstalk. It's a pretty good, well-written book that I'd recommend to a wide variety of readers.

Write a positive review about a good book:    If you're a fan of my novels, you will not be disappointed with this collection. This is a great collection of stories by some great authors. The stories are all quite different and not all of them are very good, but all of the stories were just right. These are some of my favorites in this collection, and if you're not into vampires, horror, or werewolf, don't hesitate to check out some of these.   " The Fae"   A beautiful first story about a girl and her best friend who get caught in a fae ritual in the woods. This story is a perfect example of the way that vampires in this world act. I liked this story a lot and will definitely be picking it up. "The Lost Brother"  A bit darker than most of the other stories in the collection, this story takes place on a road trip with a group of friends that is going to a concert. Things get complicated when a strange man appears in the group and they all have to deal with it. Not really my favorite in the bunch, but it's a good story that I enjoyed.  "Gothic"  As a fan, I liked the idea behind this story. This was a very eerie story. I like the way this story is written, and I was just hoping that the ending would be more upbeat.  "The Girl's Name Is…"   This was the last story I read. It was the most disturbing of the book. The story is about a witch, a vampire, and a werewolf who are all looking for a baby to raise in the hopes of saving it. The werewolf is the most powerful and can kill the witch with one look. The witch is so angry she can't handle the fact that the werewolf won't leave her alone. The vampires want to kill the werewolves for this and are really upset. I felt the story was not very exciting, but overall I enjoyed this story and will probably pick up the next in the series.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The second book was better than the first. In the first book, the author tried to write a "fantasy" of her own creation, and it just didn't feel real. In this book, she created an entirely original story about two people who don't believe in God, and the impact it has on them, their family, and their church community. The book was filled with tension, suspense, and romance. The author does a great job with the language and the descriptions. It also did a great service to her readers by making me feel like I was there, and making me think, "what if that happened to me?"   As a book reviewer, I am not one to write about the book but rather to review the book as a story to read. I feel that my reviewer's job is to provide a fair review and make people aware of the book so that they can make their own choices about it.  The author of this book was a former church member. She had a lot of faith and a lot that is good in her life, but she couldn't believe the Church anymore. She wanted to share her thoughts on how she found God and how she changed her life.   As a church member, I was very intrigued by the book, and wanted to find out more about it, so I made some observations:  First, this book is very good. I was interested in what was going on in this woman's life. I didn't think she was making a mistake because she didn't believe any more, but rather because she had been raised that way and just couldn't bring herself to believe that this was true. She also had doubts about the Church from when she was younger. The second thing that surprised me was that this story is not told from the girl's point of view. In my opinion, a good author should always tell their story from the perspective of the characters. It is always good to take a different perspective of a situation. However, when it comes to this book and the characters that are being portrayed, I thought that I was seeing things from the point of views of the parents, church officials, church members, friends, and her neighbors. The only time the parents are heard is when the daughter is telling them what is going on with her.  The parents, especially the father, don't seem to have any opinion about the matter. He just seems to be trying to help his daughter
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm trying to be a little more careful when I'm picking out books.   The other night, I was looking for something to read and found this on Amazon.  I had never heard of it until I read about it.  It's definitely worth a look.  The stories and characters are interesting and interesting characters.  This one was particularly hard to put down.  Definitely an awesome book.
Write a positive review about a good book:     My most treasured book, this is a wonderful way to learn about how a particular group of people (the Muggles) are perceived by a larger group of magic-wielding individuals (the Dark wizards of wizarding Britain).   This book covers the development of the muggle-wizard relations as we know it today - in particular how the muggles came to be accepted into wizarding society - and has a few things that can be seen as "fluff" but otherwise it's a very good book.   I'm not sure I've ever actually read this book so I don't really know if I'm going to be able to give a good review (it has a pretty lengthy introduction).   The first part is about the Muggling population as they are formed: they live in a large village surrounded by fields, gardens and sheep.  This is pretty much the pre-Muggle England, so the peasants are the same sorts of poor farmers that we've got.  These peasants are treated fairly well by the wizarding farmers but their lives are very simple.  As a result of the fact that the Muggle-Village is surrounded by land which it can not sell, the peasant are also obliged to be on their land year round.  Their houses and their farms are very large and the village has several churches and several public buildings.  From the start the Mists of Wizarding Britain are a threat to the lives of the Muffley family and are blamed for their death by the Ministry of Magic.  While Muggle society is very different from that of the medieval England the wizard-mages don't seem to be worried about this, as the wizard (and wizarding) communities are very close-knit.  In addition to this there are plenty of good chapters on the Mimblywicks and their relationship with the wizards.  The book also covers the Mabbles and their history as well as their development from the peasants into the wizards that we know today.  There is also a great chapter on the wizard's attempts to create a wizarding legal system (the wizarding world being a completely different system from that found in the middling England).  It's always great to read a book that doesn't focus on any particular aspect of the wizard/wizard relationship but this time there's some good discussion about what wizarding law is like.  Also, there's a bit
Write a positive review about a good book:    "This book is the kind of book that everyone should read." -Robert Greene (author of THE GREEN ROOM )   I'm an English professor at a midwestern university, where I teach on a wide variety of subjects, and, over the past few years, I've had a lot of opportunity to read, say, a good deal of literature in general and, more specifically, in the Middle Ages.   One of the most enjoyable, fascinating, and rewarding aspects of the study of literature is reading the written testimony of its great masters.  If you like history and you want a good story, you should read Middle Ages novels. If you have some spare time on your hands, read some Middle Ages prose and poetry.  In recent years I've read a great deal of contemporary Middle Ages literature.  Middle Ages romance, however, does not come close to comparing to the quality of the prose of Middle Ages fiction.  To the casual reader the first thing that might strike one is the great number of medieval characters who never appear in any of the novels.  The most obvious is the hero of Middle Age novels, the "Great Hero" of all Middle Ages stories: the great chivalrous knight-errant whose adventures will leave your readers gasping for more.  I remember as a young man reading about a chivalric knight who was called "The Green Knight" in a popular medieval novel.  However, this character had nothing to do with any actual historical figure.  Medieval romance is usually a more interesting and imaginative account of a person's personal, intimate life than the life of the king, as if the king never got to meet any of his courtiers.  By contrast the best of Middle English fiction reveals a more realistic and personal side of the knight-ERT in a way that even the best modern romantic novel fails to do.  So let me say this: the first time I read something by Robert Greene I thought he was a "mad-genius" and a "master of the written word."  I've been reading Middle Ages for a few decades now, and I have not been able to say the same about many of the Middle English writers who have appeared in the popular press.  Unfortunately it is true that most of them have been overshadowed by their much more famous and popular contemporaries.  For some reason they haven't received quite the attention they deserve.  One might even argue that they are being overshadowed because their
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was lucky enough to have received this as a free sample, which is more than most authors get. I have to say that I've only read a few books by this author, but this one is the best of the bunch. It's not perfect but the story is well written and the characters all are well developed. I also really liked the writing style of the book.   The characters are very human, but the author tries to make them as much more complex than they are.  I think this is because of the author's limited experience as a writer, but I like it.  The book is written in third person limited. I think it's a little bit difficult to keep up with the story, but it's good for this type of story.  "The King's Men" by John Gwynne I really enjoyed this book. The story is great and the concept is very intriguing.  What I really like about this book is the plot, and I love the character development. There is a lot to like about the story. The characters grow on you pretty fast, and the author did a great job of showing us the different sides of the characters that we never see in a typical fantasy book. My only concern is that I was very disappointed that the book didn't have a sequel, and at some point I would have liked to see the world get even more explored.  "The King" is the only book by this writer I have read so far, and although this book did have some problems with the writing and the ending, I was definitely pleased with the book as a whole.
Write a positive review about a good book:    * * * The plot was really interesting and well written. The character were really well written, and I liked how they were all very different but very likable.   I enjoyed the story and characters the most though.  *  I found this book a little hard to read. As the main character is on the run from a bad guy, it took me about 3-4 books to get to the end. I didn't understand what was going on with the main characters at all. I had to keep thinking about what was happening and if it was even relevant.     * *** * There were some good bits in this book, but overall it was a little long for my taste. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    Review: I have always had a fascination for dinosaurs. In my teens I read the children's book "The Jungle Book". I still like the story and still like dinosaurs but I've always wondered about how they got to the point that they were the dominant species on the planet. When I saw this book I knew it would be just the book I was looking for. This book was definitely more action packed then the movie and the dinosaur was definitely a lot more like real life. I love how I saw the book from a different view. The dinosaurs seemed a little out there to me and the book was not long enough to fully experience the fullness of these beasts. The book does teach kids about dinosaurs but it doesn't come off as too biased, like so many children's books do. I also like the way the author has fun with the dinosaurs and we have to assume they do have their own personalities. I would love to read a whole book about them. I can see a great sequel to this book.Read full review

Write a positive review about a good book:    A fantastic read. One of the best of this decade.   In the end, though, I'm going to be a bit more critical than I want to be.  This book has been the subject of some debate among readers. It's a bit confusing to put it all in writing.  In terms of world building, the author is a bit too much like Robert Heinlein for my taste. But this does have a nice world-building and an engaging story. I have to wonder, though... Why?   I love that there are different cultures all over this world.  I also love the fact that the author made a point of keeping it real. It is not fantasy. In some ways, it is closer to real life, especially when it comes to the way the cultures work together.  What I love about this book is the characters.  The author has the ability to write the whole of this book, and he does.  It is the best work of writing I have ever read. It gets better and better with every reading. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been reading this book for almost a year now and I must say I love the story. It was a real challenge to keep up with the characters' reactions and I thought it was very entertaining. This book was so realistic and was made even better by the fact that I could get to know the author very well. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story with an interesting cast.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite character is  The story:  A mysterious girl in a dark room goes through the motions of killing her friend.   The story is an easy read, the characters were very interesting.  The writing:  I was surprised that the book is written in 3rd person point of view, i was expecting a first person narrative.    The book has a very dark tone that is unique and I liked it.  I enjoyed the ending as well.  The ending was perfect and left me with a great sense of peace.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It's hard to believe that a book about a child who suffers from a serious disease will be good...the author describes the child's life, and his own reaction to it, with great detail and the perfect amount of detail. He gives an accurate description of the disease (as it's called on this planet, and was known by many tribes of Indians in the 19th century), the treatments (which I thought were very useful), and the symptoms. The author even has some really great pictures. One of the great features of this book is the amount of information that is not presented as a series of scientific factoids or anecdotes. The reader can clearly understand the rationale behind the treatments that are given to the child. As I have already said in my review of The Boy Who Would Be King, the author makes it quite clear to us the scientific principles that support the treatments given to this child. We are also treated to a wealth of interesting and interesting stories about the other people involved in this child's treatment. The illustrations by the author are top-notch, and are a joy to behold.   One of the issues with The Boy, is that the author presents information about the illness that the child goes through in such a way that it looks more like an exotic exotic disease than a child's disease. It's a little bit like what one might see in a children's book, where there is a cure for a common cold, and the author describes it as if it were a disease with its own unique symptoms. Some people may find this a little too much like a children�s book to get excited about. But if you think about it for a second, it is a book for kids. Many of these treatments and therapies are effective and useful treatments for kids with similar illnesses. Some of these kids have died as a result of their treatment, but most have become well enough to take part in adult life. One has to think that the kids who are getting treated are actually experiencing a much less severe version of this disease than the children with whom we live. The Boy Is a Star is about a young boy who goes to see a star for the first time in his life, after which his life and the lives of others around him is changed forever.      This is a very well written book, and if you are willing to have a good look at the illustrations, then it will give you a good idea of the world and the people living in it

Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book.   If you like stories about the dangers of being a child you'll love this. It has a simple plot, but the stakes are very high and this makes it an excellent read.  The art is amazing and the characters are all very likable.  And the music... well, I think this is where I got the "chick song" in my head.  I'm sure many people (I know many people who like to listen to "chicksongs") find it pretty awesome, but I'm not a fan.  It does what it needs to do: it tells a story and leaves the reader feeling satisfied with the ending, as well as the story.  Overall:      I give this a 4, for what it's worth. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In the hands of a good editor (or author) this is a terrific book. The author, a self-published author, has a real knack for writing about his experiences. The style is simple and clean, and the story is powerful and full of substance. I think there are a lot of good authors out there, but not that many who could write as effectively and as persuasively about something as the author here.

Write a positive review about a good book:   A great read! I really enjoyed this book, it had me hooked right from the start. If you like fantasy and a good fantasy book this is definitely a book for you! This book is a wonderful read. Great action and characters. I was also interested in what became of her son as he grew up. It is a very short book, only about 200 pages, and the book is fast paced with action and some interesting plot lines. If I have one complaint about this book it is the ending. I loved the beginning of the book but I did not love the ending that much. This story is well worth the reading. It gives us a glimpse into the lives of our characters and I did enjoy the story. However the ending left me wanting more and I felt like I was left a little confused about the whole thing. But then again if you read the beginning and the middle of the story you will understand what I mean. It was a quick read and I highly recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   A nice book that has a few good ideas, but it's not a novel.    The character is just a simple minded person who seems to make his own rules.  Also the book doesn't really help with the characters.  The plot is a waste of time too.  It doesn't have much to do with the story.   You do get the feeling of a group of people working together for a common goal.  But it's just a group.  And it's really a waste. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the book I was waiting for.   This is the one book I've read that has convinced me that the world is a better place when we work together.    The only downside to it is that the illustrations are quite detailed in places, and I've had to go back a couple of times to figure out where I'd been and what I was doing, so it may not appeal to some readers.

The author, as always, covers a wide range of topics which will interest most people and be of interest to everyone. It is clear he knows what he is talking about, and his ideas are sound. However, there were times when I was unsure how far the author was pushing his beliefs in science vs. religion. He does not appear to make the link very clear and I often had to go to another page or two just to make sure I understood what was being presented and how he was coming to his conclusions.   However, I cannot put this book down. It was an interesting and well-written book and a good example of intelligent design. I recommend this book to everyone interested in science, philosophy, or religion. - March 5, 2011The Science and The Philosophy of Interreligious Dialogue  Author Response: Thank you so much for your review!

Write a positive review about a good book:    Review by Mary Jo Smith    (1) What a wonderful story.   It's one of my favorite novels and I've enjoyed reading many of her books.  It is the first in a series and I'm looking forward to reading the other books in the series.  (2) This story is a nice change of pace from the more action packed stories I've read from her.  There was a definite shift in the mood, as it seemed like a real, honest, coming-of-age story. It was very exciting.  I'm not a huge fan of the "love and war" type of story, but this one felt like that is more in the realm of romance.  This story also has a great amount of "in between" scenes, which I think adds to the realism.  Thanks for writing a great book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The reason why I haven't had a good read in a while is that there have been no great authors who have managed to create memorable, yet simple, plots. And, this is exactly the case with this book.   In the beginning the story sounds a little convoluted, but there's a lot to keep track of and a satisfying end, even if the narrative is a little too simple.  I do wish the book had been longer (for the sake of my own sanity and for future readers, perhaps) but the story is not the main problem here; it is rather the writing that does not impress me.

Write a positive review about a good book:    Review - "This is an excellent book. It covers the history of the British Isles as well as other countries that share an important shared history. It was written in an accessible manner with a good level of information. If you are a history buff, or even if you are not then you will have learned something valuable from this book." "My only problem with this book is that a lot of the information that was provided was outdated by a number of years. This may have been to preserve the information contained, and was the reason that some of the earlier sources did not make it into the final book (this was not a problem in the book that came out before). As such, many of the dates in this book will be off in some respects. I did find this book quite helpful for those who wanted a good overview of the period in which the book was written, and to see a good picture of the history. I can see why a number people would prefer to read the more recent book. If a person had been looking for a book on this period I would think that this would be a much better book to pick up."

The author explains the background of the story well enough, and the book has a real, believable feel to it, and although it is a little too serious to be fun, it's still worth reading. This was also my first experience with reading about a child's sexual assault, and it definitely made me think twice about making the decision to go through with a child sexual assault. I also found a lot of humor in the book, which is always a good thing, and I thought the ending was very satisfying. I am looking forward to more from this author!

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have a lot of books that I'd have loved to read but didn't, and I'm constantly amazed at how hard it is to write a good review. This one seems to do the job. I'm glad to have it, as well.   I also think that there is a point to the worldbuilding. In this world, the whole human race has long since vanished, but not completely. The humans of that world have evolved their own culture and language, but it still is based on the original one. The one that's the same in all human languages. So, if you take a modern English speaker, a native English speaker from that world, and have them switch languages with you, you'll still be able to understand each other. They will still be recognizably the same person. There is a lot more to say about it, but that's mostly why I read.  7 of 8 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:    The best book in my reading list and an excellent review of the entire genre. I have yet to come across a book that can compare to this one.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently bought a copy of "A Tale of Two Cities". I have to say I am very happy I did. I am a book snob and a person that loves the classics. I never read a book by a foreigner before but I'm pretty sure this one will change my mind about that. I've loved the French classics since the days when I first heard about the novel "Gustave Flaubert". This book is very close to the French classic, but a little more personal and original, because of a different plot and an additional chapter that is not part of the main plot. The writing is excellent and the author gives us plenty of information. I also like the fact that the reader can have a dialogue with the main character and understand the details of how the main characters thought and acted. I really like the way the author created the story that he used the two main characters, the protagonist and the antagonist, as a metaphor. I think a lot of the best novels use two main protagonists as a contrast. The author did that with both of the protagonists, the main one (the villain) and the secondary one (who the main protagonist is trying to stop, because he thinks he's the real one). The secondary protagonist was the narrator, because she knew about the whole scheme, but still was fooled by the main villain, and the main antagonist used this as a way to make the whole book as long as possible. It was pretty funny and interesting to read. Although I'm not a huge fan of classical novels in general, I really enjoyed this one and would recommend it to any book lover, if you love reading about classical novels.

It is a fun read and you can understand it even without a degree."   From Amazon.com: "I didn't know anything about the world of the ancient Egyptians before reading this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved it.   It was a good read.  I also liked the idea of the old man in the car telling the kids that no matter how many times you hear about how horrible things are there is always hope, and that the good things don't go away. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a really good book and really good idea. I think that this book might have the potential to be one of the best books in the genre.   The main idea of this book is that one of our protagonists is the same as the narrator in the book. It is as if our hero is being written about as he would have acted himself.  My main issue with this book isn't the narrator, which I think is a good thing. I like the idea that it is possible to become a better person just by reading a good piece of writing.  The narrator is actually very good at conveying the emotions of what it is like to be a man and he manages to get the reader to feel the same emotions that he does. If you have never been a man before, this book will make you realize that it can be really scary. 
Write a positive review about a good book:     "One of the more challenging and fascinating works in the twentieth-century literature of sexuality."   (Rudy Bienstock, Los Angeles Times Book Review)     "The world of sex is fascinating, and Dr. O'Neill's book makes it accessible to an informed and engaged public."    (E. S. Hines, The New York Times Book of the Month)  "Sensual pleasures are not mere pleasure—no one does them in a way that is pleasant for all the participants—but a pleasurable state of being, an act of giving and receiving."     (Charles Bukowski, quoted in Sex and the Soul)    The book tells of how an elderly couple from rural Australia, in their early fifties, came into the world with a son, an adolescent daughter, and a granddaughter. The man was a carpenter, and he was married to a woman named "Tilly," who was the mother of their two sons. They lived in the tiny cottage that they had built. When the man died, the only survivor was his son, who was a shy, quiet boy. He was a writer, but he never published a book. He never took a class. He did not read the Bible. He refused to read the works of a doctor called Dr. Henry O'Neil, who had done experiments on animals, including experimenting with a small boy. "Why are you always writing about animals?" asked his mother. "Dr. O. does that, too," said her husband. The children were given some books about animals, but the boy never looked at them. He knew everything. "He was my father," said his son. His mother asked him to read something about his father. But the boy was too shy to talk about his family. They could see nothing about the man in the books. "How did he die?" asked her. "In a storm," he replied. He felt that he had always been a man without a body, a body without a name. He had seen his body every day, but it had always belonged to his father, and now the body was gone, and when his body died, he would die. He always imagined his father as a man in a suit, a man with a cane, but there was no cane, no suit. "I don't want to live anymore," he told her. When Tilly was
Write a positive review about a good book:   "I've been reading this book since it was published in 2006, and the recent re-release has given it an unexpected boost. This is one of those books that, once read, is a must-read, and if you've not already read it, then you really have no excuse.    ( I have read it twice since then, and even in a re-read it is an especially good book) I'm not really a fan of dystopian books, though I'm not sure why.  I read The Handmaid's Tale this summer, and I thought that it was a very good book.  It had the kind of dystopia that I liked, a sense of tension and unease that I love in a book, and a strong female protagonist that I thought was a strong heroine.  While the novel isn't particularly deep or complex, it is definitely worth reading, and there were some aspects of it that I found to be particularly effective.  What I didn't like about it was the way that the author uses the female protagonist as a plot device in ways that could have been done much better if she hadn't become the primary plot device.  Even in that version, the protagonist was still very much a main character in her own right, and that made the story weaker for it.  There is something that I'm trying to get at in this review though: The Handmaids Tale, like a lot of dystopian novels, has a lot to say about class warfare.  I've always had a problem with class warfare, and as a result tend to avoid novels about it. There are a couple of ways that dystopian novels can explore class warfare: firstly, by using class warfare as a major part of the story (as is the case with The Handmaiden's Tale).  Second, and more subtly, by having characters who are very class conscious and who are aware that they are at the very top of the social hierarchy.  These two options are the ones that are used in The HandMaid's Tale. The first option is interesting, because there is an element of class warfare to the story, and although it is not the main theme, it's still an interesting and important theme.  The second option is somewhat more subtle, and it relies on the assumption that the women who read the Handmaid series will be aware of the fact that the novel is about a class struggle.  By doing this,
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you read all the way through this book, you will see that I'm in the minority: I love this book.   A lot of books that I read seem to be about how the author is trying to "take over the world," so I thought I'd try my hand at my own kind of writing -- trying to put a positive spin on a book so I can show how to write that same kind of book. First off, I'm a big fan of John Grisham. I've read every novel and non-fiction piece by him and even though I don't particularly like his work, I've bought most of his books. As much as I love Grishams writing, I was somewhat disappointed in this book as a whole: it wasn't as good as it could have been.  What the book is:  In this novel, the hero, a woman from Texas called Marge, sets out to write her life story in the style of a true true true love story -- she begins dating a man named Henry, who turns out to be her brother (I just realized she's an only child), her best friend, her husband, her father, a man who loves her but keeps her from really being happy, and finally, the man she falls in love with.  But her true love, Henry, is kind of a jerk.  As she is trying desperately to get what she wants with the least effort, she ends up with an alcoholic husband, who she hates.  She's a woman who is in search of a love that really doesn't exist in the real world.  I think that most people who read this book are probably thinking, "This is good, but who cares? This isn't what I'm interested in." And I'll be the first to admit that I've always liked books that make the reader care. That's why I think The Secret is so good:  I've also been watching a lot of "Orange is the New Black" lately, and it reminds me a lot (in a bad way) of this book (which is why I'm giving it a star).    This book also reminded me a bit of the movie "Garden State," and it makes me want to see that movie. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed reading this book. The characters were real, and they had real, personal goals for their lives. I can see myself growing to love these characters. If you want to read something different from your usual books this is a good option.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book a pleasant change from most books I have read lately.   For example, I had read a previous book in the series ( The Diving Bell and the Butterfly  (2003) by Stephen R. Donaldson ) but was underwhelmed with the novel (although I have not read it yet so I am not sure what I mean), so this book was refreshing to me.   I liked the first few chapters, but then it went downhill from there, and the author didn't seem to get the point of the book.  It is a good story, about an important historical figure, and I am interested to see what he becomes as the story progresses.    But I did have some difficulty connecting to it and not really enjoying it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book and will certainly give it a solid 5 stars for that reason alone. It's definitely not perfect, and I wouldn't say it's the only worthwhile book out there, but this book certainly comes pretty close to perfect.   The book's main story takes place at the end of the 20th Century in the USA and Europe and is about the aftermath of a nuclear war between the US and Russia. The book focuses on the relationship between two characters. One character is a scientist who is attempting to develop a nuclear bomb with his best friend. The problem is that he and his friend have a very difficult relationship due to the fact that they live on different coasts and have differing philosophies regarding the technology that they develop. The scientist is quite pessimistic about what he has done with his friend and thinks he is incapable of making his plans a success, but the man in question is absolutely convinced he can do it.   He is a man who has already done a lot of research and is fairly sure about a lot, but it is his lack of confidence that causes him to make many mistakes along the way and his lackadaisical attitude towards the science that are the cause of his downfall. His friend, on the other hand, is a young man who just recently moved to Los Angeles from Chicago and is eager to explore the city in hopes of making it as a filmmaker. He is fairly ambitious and willing to take risks and is willing to let go in the name of being successful. However, like the scientist, he is a pretty pessimistic man and the one constant in their relationship is their desire to make this work out as long as they can, which they hope could be 20 years.   the scientist has a lot to lose when his friend dies, and the story takes us back and forth through time, in between the man's memories and the memory of his friend's parents who are looking for him. The story of their relationship, how they both came to be here and what happened to them, is one that I highly recommend. The character development was good and I was pretty attached to the scientist throughout the story, while the friendship between them was one that was not as strong or as developed as the scientist and friend's relationship in the book. I think this would probably have been even better if they were married, since it is clear that the scientists were together for a very long time and the man seemed to like the woman, but since it doesn't really matter in the
Write a positive review about a good book:       A good book. I love everything about it. It's funny. It talks about important life moments in a different way than other books do. I wish there were more books about depression/life. I mean that moreso than I wish that there were better books about sex. I think all of the books in the "depression book" genre are pretty bad about that, at least. I don't think they're "bad," it just sorta doesn't ring true for me. Also, as you mention, some of the people who read this book also live with depression/the flu/etc., and some of them are a bit more understanding than others. The main character is more understanding then most of the other characters, and she has a lot of support, even from some of her own family members. I am happy that someone finally came up with a book about the depression/depression and other mental illnesses that is a bit different then the other popular books. I also think that it may be helpful to have a book that doesn't come from a doctor, like this one does. That would be nice. Maybe one day I'll find a book with a doctor who is actually interesting! :)
