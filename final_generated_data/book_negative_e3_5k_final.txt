Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has a tendency to be very predictable and to use too much repetition in the writing.  It has no clarity or insight as to the issues underlying the problems it presents.  The problems are presented very flatly and almost seem to me to be like problems written in code.   I have a very hard time believing this work has been written by anyone with such experience and wisdom.  I feel this was the reason I found the book quite difficult to read.  But what the author and his wife have managed to accomplish is to sell me on his personal philosophy.  This is a very odd place to try to sell any philosophy. I would never buy it again because it seems that the author is a shallow intellectual and his opinions may not reflect the realities of the world outside of his own world 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    i found the book not helpful at all. i think there should be a simple answer to this question. i am not a history buff but i have an interest in reading and researching different topics, so i thought i might give it a try. and the answer i found was the opposite. this was very dry, very boring. and i found some really scary pictures, some disturbing, some bizarre ideas, and some very disturbing scenes. i did not know what to believe until i finished it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The concept of "fantasy" is quite nebulous and confusing, and there are lots of books on this subject that do an excellent job explaining the concept 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If the "Dating tips" section of this book were a list, it would be called "Tips on getting to the Best in Bed". I thought it was good but in the end I had no luck. This was not an easy read because there are so many details. One example was, as a parent, the date line in the chapter to the chapter about a "sick pillow". There is not a single person in the book with any credibility. I found myself having to read much of it to get it under control. This book was a big waste of time and I will probably never write it again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not like the book, and I do believe the author has lost her way.  I found it quite difficult to understand the author's motives.  It is possible that she is trying to make a point, but she lacks an understanding of the world around us 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read the first edition and had to look up several additional references and had a hard time finding it. The only thing I could understand was there is no "real" explanation of how this book was printed. What makes you think that the copyright holders of such a book can actually be so dishonest 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very disappointed with the book. It is one of the worst book I've read. I have read other biographies of the Great War and in these books the author goes out of his way to make the enemy sound more evil and bad than the Germans were. The author tries to make his readers hate the British people and their soldiers. His book, to me, is not worthy of its title. To call it "Great War" is like calling it "The War of the Rebellion". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not worth the time that it takes you to read this. If you are a non-fan of the comic, I would suggest that you skip this one and go to the next book in this series, "Uncle Scrooge" by Terry Moore.  The storyline was more interesting and it was the book that most influenced me to buy the new issues of "Spider-Man".  I really didn't like that plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to agree with the other reviewers here, in that I feel this was a long, drawn-out account of her death. The plot is not as interesting as I expected from Ms. Gwyneth. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have seen more than one review about this book. One reviewer, not me, had read it.  Not one of the reviewer actually said anything positive about the book.  I had to spend ten or twenty hours just listening to the others.  Why people would read this book and not read the other work of this author is beyond me.  It is so boring.  So much time wasted on something that is so completely incomprehensible.  One reviewer had a good suggestion.  However, there was a second reviewer who claimed that all the writing and research of this book was not original.  What a waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so disappointed and disappointed to read this book, I had to ask for another review.  It was sooo far from anything I was looking for, and it didn't even have a new book in it.    The whole thing seemed to be just an attempt to be popular and sell books.  What a waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of it. I was not interested in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a waste of time because this book is full of clich√©s and lacks substance.  As a result, you have to read several articles before you understand this book.   This book gives us all the excuses for our inability to write.  It tells us all we need to write our own, yet no one says.  I am not sure if the author even knows how to write, or if he simply assumes that he can write if he so chooses.  If this author is in fact an "author", then he should be ashamed of himself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In a nutshell this book describes the ways in which it was able to manipulate the masses in Britain, as well as the methods used by the British to control the news media.  It does a poor job of explaining how and why the news is misreported and how people should approach it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not like books written for children because they have an emphasis on words, not things.  As a child I was also not a fan of books written in rhyme and rhymed stories.  The problem with this book is its very shallow presentation of children's literature.  I am a very big fan of  children's books and I would have gladly purchased this book if I had read it for my child, but I was not  able to finish it.  This book is simply too long and I can't believe it was published in 1994.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not worth the paper it is printed on. It is extremely boring and uninteresting and not worth my time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   First chapter was just a rambling account of a bad romance between a high-school girl and a wealthy guy, then the author goes on a rant of self-promotion for the book, then goes into a long section where he rambles on about himself, then gives a long rant of what he thinks of the reader. The last chapter is a big reveal of who the author really is and why he writes this sort of garbage to entertain people. If you want a quick little read before you commit to a big book (which I'm sure a lot of people who read this will), go ahead and check it out 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   You will think it is the best book ever written. However, it does not get anywhere near as much attention as you would expect.  The author gives a lot of detail, but not enough to keep your interest, and I can assure you there are far better books on this subject. He does not go into the psychology of children in the least bit.  I would rather read a "Children's Digest".  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is very shallow and lacking in detail.  The whole book is made up of lists and descriptions.  I am disappointed in the book because I would have been more satisfied with the articles that I have read.  And I have another copy that I think would be a better resource 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As someone who has read the book, I agree with her overall conclusions, which are as described. What we get here is a rehash of her own book, "The Last Word" which she wrote in 1986. This book, along with "Tolerance" and "Toward Truth," are all books written by Linda Stoler. They both deal with matters of religion and politics, but both lack an actual philosophical basis. The reason why I am not saying the same about "Tolerating" is because I feel "Treating" is more apt to describe the phenomenon. It is a case-by-case assessment of a person's beliefs and values, in a nutshell.   "Treating" is a more subtle process than "Terrantering", especially when we are dealing with ideas that don't agree with each other's. One could also argue Stoler's "Telling" is actually a "Tending", in which she explains that in some cases one must have a different opinion about a good book: one of us thinks it is a good idea to tell a negative negative review:  I felt that this book could have been made better if it was edited from the original. If Linda Stoller had simply been given credit in her original work, she would have been a great book, but her repeated self-publishing process has had a detrimental effect on her writing ability. I am a Christian, and like a lot of Christians, I sometimes like to go through Stoler-related books. Unfortunately for me, it doesn't seem the subject matter has been in any of Stoler books, so I have to slog through her to find my Christian equivalents 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't even know what this book was and I've read so many of them, so I'm not sure. But if I'm reading it again, it's going to be a much, much tougher book to read.  I'm afraid, I was very disappointed in this one.  But I must say,  because it's one of the few that have managed to get me through.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the introduction of her book, she claims she has spent the last 25 years studying how to make a living as an artist in a very limited profession. She claims she never considered how she would like to become a teacher. This book, however, was a mistake in the way she presented her own qualifications to be a teacher - and was one of the biggest mistakes I've ever read in my life 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was not very descriptive, it was just the summary. I'm an author and have written several books on this topic, I just never did anything like this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read many of the "real" books and I do not like this one. This is a nice little fairy tale.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was very interesting and I wanted to know what he had written about it. Unfortunately, it's all in the bookstore and I couldn't take in anything much. I wish he would have been more specific about the book. It was not what I expected. The only reason it wasn't a complete book was because it was published in the 50s. There are so many pieces of writing that are so dry that they aren't worth reading if they're written a couple of hundred years ago 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a shame that this was written. I would have never even started reading this book if it weren't for its title.  It has an aura of mystery.  The prose is very slow.  If you want to read a book that doesn't waste your time in terms of character development and plot, this is the book for you.  But if you are looking for something that isn't so boring and isn't filled with empty cliche, do not waste your money on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a complete waste of time and effort and I didn't even get a chance to finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is very boring. The only thing that I really want to know about this book is that the author is very arrogant and seems to have no idea of how to write a negative book about a negative writer 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a shame that he's not much more well known. I've read a few of his books and I've never been so disappointed in anything.  It was so boring and I had no idea what I was reading. It was just a bunch of rehashed ideas and the occasional funny anecdote.  I never expected much from his writing but I was very disappointed to get it from the start. I have no idea how he manages to write the same stuff every night in such a short time and still retain his passion.  His style isn't very convincing and his ideas aren't all that original.  One reason I give this to him is that he is an amazing writer and I wanted him to be taken seriously. I was hoping for something from his work 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to say the reviews I have seen in the past two years were a real disappointment.  While the book was very well written and informative, it was very dated.  If you want to learn about the Internet, it is not a bad place to start reading this book.  But if you are not comfortable with the Internet or simply want to know some facts about it, I suggest a more recent book: Understanding the Internet.  It is an excellent book to read if you want something to read over the Internet (it has the whole Internet section), but for a beginner like myself, I found it a little too technical and a little slow paced.  I wouldn't recommend it for anybody looking to be proficient with the internet.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for a book to help you develop your skills in the coding community, please refer to this book: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=related&feed=3&v=1&q_methods&link_id=1895&q=jeremy. But there's a lot more to learn.  Don't waste your time on this "quickie" book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not have a problem with the term "self-taught", but if there was a "self teaching" movement going on before "the internet", this book would have been far more useful.  It was just so much repetitive, confusing and wordy.  I could not finish it.  The main takeaway is how many of the problems were solved because of a person's ability to read an online book in  English. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was about a bunch of people moving to their new house in Boston.  It was supposed to be a humorous story, but it was way too trite and boring for me.  After reading the first part, I didn't feel like I had to read the entire book.  I wanted to know how the characters were like the people I had met up until now. I didn not really find that.  The plot was pretty straightforward.  If I didn`t like the book, I would've kept it for myself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping this would be a more concise and informative discussion on a book I read previously.  I will admit, I am not an expert in this field.The author's knowledge on the topic and his arguments are very shallow. The book makes two attempts to make the topic accessible to the general public.  The first attempts were very good.  Unfortunately, the book becomes very complex and disjointed when it turns to the problem of determining if a computer is an intelligent system.  This is not an issue I would want addressed to anyone else. It would be an enormous improvement 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just don't know if I can even be considered a "fan of the book". What a joke! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The concept of a non-binary system is an oxymoron.  This book lacks all the proper understanding of what it means to be a non binary system, in general, and the concept of what a true non binary approach would look like.  It's simply another excuse to attack feminism.  What else is it to have one non binary philosophy?  I guess the real question is whether or not it matters what philosophical system one supports, and I don't think it should be decided by the whims of an author with an axe to grind 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had hoped to find a simple, direct-to-the-point description of the process of writing the book, but I'm disappointed - it's more of a hagiographical tribute to various writers than a straightforward, straightforward story about the process 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book so disjointed.  And, given the topic, I couldn't believe it.  The "characters" in this book were a bunch of characters that I had never heard of.  I was also dissapointed by the way the author was trying to make his writing sound like something otherworldly.  It was very hard for me to believe that anyone would write a negative book about a negative film.  If this book had been any good, I would have given it a good review.  Unfortunately, it is just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not the only one that has seen the book on this topic.  I know from my son that he was given this book as a homework assignment, and now my brother is also having the same problem.  The author is obviously very interested in making money off this topic, and while his opinions are mostly true, his writing lacks a basic understanding of basic facts.  He has used the word "skeptic" a number of times to describe a man he's not.  In the end, his book makes more sense as a piece of satire 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book has been the cause of alot of arguments.  i have read through it and I have to say that i feel that it is a mistake to put forward an argument in support of a bad argument.  First off, I don't know about the fact that the book has more negative reviews than positive reviews 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of errors and misquotes.  I do have to say, because I bought this book thinking I was reading an original book, not the author's re-worked one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a shame. It is one of the worst. I thought it would be a better book that it is. I was wrong 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a really boring and repetitious and not at all interesting.  The last chapters were boring.  It didn't get the reader to think about the big ideas or what they meant.  So this book was not atypical, it was typical. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not worth the $20 it is claimed for the cover price. The plot line is very weak and very slow. There are two or three chapters that were almost unwatched because the characters were not real and the author used them to get ahead of other readers. The story also contained an unbelievable amount of romance between characters who were of the same age and age of consent. I don't even know if this story has ever been published, because I doubt if I can trust the fact that the author wrote the book. The writer seems to have an addiction to using names and nicknames, making the books so confusing and confusing. It's a shame because this story is one of the best in this series, but the author is a little too slow. It should have been better if the author was a better story writer, but at least give us more interesting stories from the same author 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If I had any idea what I was doing before I started this novel I would have saved myself the trouble. I was an avid reader and in my teens, but it seems to me that while I had been enjoying reading this series of books, I had not fully appreciated the intricacies of history or the character development, the intricate plot, the depth of this novel. The ending was very disjointed and I felt cheated. I did not finish it and I found that I did have to finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book that has no true meaning. If you only know the history of one religion, please stop asking people which religion they should support. We must stop making such assumptions about the religious views of others 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a pretty long introduction to a very basic, yet somewhat confusing book.  I'm not quite sure where I was going with it all the way.  One section at the end, however, gave me some ideas, and I would have liked the author to have given me more of them!  I found it disjointed, a bit confusing, and a bit hard to follow, although I guess I'm a bit of a newbie when it comes to grammar, so I'd like someone who knows a little more about the language to help me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was never quite sure what the title "Punishing America" was referring to.  The book was written in such a poor fashion that it could hardly be taken as a serious contribution to the public discussion on the state of women's rights in the U.S.I felt that it must be a satire.  I had to reject the idea that this is the best book on this topic that I have ever read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The entire plot revolved around the idea of getting the best book on the list. The first two chapters were basically just the old school story about who is the book with the most reviews and who could be the best writer.  Once the story started to progress, it quickly became obvious that the book was not all it was made out to be. It was very predictable, and it just went on and on and didn't provide any actual content. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book after a friend recommended it. I would never have given it a positive review. As it turns out, it's a bad story. It starts off with the characters acting like children, and then goes on to have the character become a violent sociopath. The violence is disgusting, and even more disgusting is the story's ending. This book may be entertaining for people who like to read violence, but for those who want to read serious fiction it isn't worth it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to agree with the negative reviews of this book.  In essence, it is just a cheap way to tell people to "get out of Africa".  The author is either ignorant or a propagandist or both.  The book is not at all relevant to what the real situation is in Africa today.  This book is actually more of a propaganda book, not to mention the fact that it makes for an easy target to insult if you are not familiar with the real issues in Africa 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   One reviewer complained that this book lacks historical perspective.  The author goes against his own opinion, giving "the most boring story on the Internet" and "the least interesting book I've read in a long time".  He uses a lot of quotations that I thought were very interesting, but have now been misquoted.  There was a whole lot of information in this book, but the author goes off on tangents for long enough that it becomes hard to remember what he is talking about.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've never actually read the book, but I would say that Mr. Jovana's writing is the worst I have seen since the days of John Gillis.  The plot is predictable, the story is far too long, and the ending was not satisfying.  I would not recommend this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a book. Not worth buying 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is the opposite of what the book itself offers. It is hard to believe that a book written as originally written by the renowned psychologist Dr. Joseph Abarce would be so lacking in content. For example, how the author has managed to describe a theory called Cognitive Therapy that has failed to capture the public imagination? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree that this book is a waste of time and has little to offer.  The story was the same as the book, only with fewer pages and more words.  There was one positive and there was another, but it was hard to tell who was positive and who was negative.  It also lacked any detail in the ending of the book.  What really drives me is that the author would like to write a negative book about a good book: that this story is not representative of Christianity.  If I could give the book a negative star rating, it would be 4 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read "A Woman of the Book" before, but in the original version of the book, there is no section on the women who chose a Catholic Church.  This version lacks the "A woman who chooses a church" part.  I guess the book would be considered feminist and so I decided not to waste my money on this, but the writing style of the original author, who is also known as "The Catholic Sex," is so shallow and confusing.   If the author of this book were a genuine atheist, he or she would be mocked and ridiculed  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a very disappointing read.  I was hoping it was a little more entertaining and a little better than the last time I read it, but I got frustrated at it in the end.  The characters were uninteresting.  It's hard to see a bad story when a bad review is written by a bad person 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not good. And I'm not saying the book is good. But the concept is good and the characters are interesting 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a really boring book.  It is so long that I cannot really believe the author really gave it to me.  I am a college student, not some super guru at the top of the mountain.  And yes, I have read it, and it was very dry.  However, I feel like the author of the book is not as much of a mystery hunter as I thought.  The author writes about a lot of really basic and unoriginal ideas.  She mentions the idea of a God without attributes.  How do we interpret the concept of a god without an understanding of the concept  of free will?  I would like to know more about it, but that is beside the point.  We have to look up an actual explanation of the divine, and the author has absolutely nothing to offer 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not much of an author.  He gives you a lot to think about but he leaves you wondering if he can write anything, if he really can.  That is why I think he is so important, in fact, I would not want him to stop writing, I wish he would keep writing and give the rest of his life to his work 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A nice little book, but not as entertaining as the original.  I feel that it is because it is not about the same issues that the original was.  There is a lot of stuff about transhumanism in this book and I found it boring.  It seemed like I was reading a book that I thought I would have to have read for the next ten years.  The subject matter seemed to be all talk. I was hoping that I would see some of the themes that were mentioned in the original, but I got no such luck.The author goes on and on with the transhumanist movement.  This book is great for entertainment purposes but it is far from any kind of useful in the long term, and I can't see myself continuing to read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a nice little book, however, the writing is very slow and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's name and picture were on the title page and he never named a book. The books were very boring, even though they were the ones the author recommended. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a shame, because it's an easy read. The chapter that explains why most people dislike the Bible, and the reason why I don't, is too lengthy, and it's written in a way that I wouldn't understand. So if you're not an expert in the Bible and religious history, or are just curious about the topic, this book is not for you. I do recommend the "Moral Politics" for those interested in the topic but aren't able to read this book by themselves 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I started thinking I would read this book as soon as I could, as I had read "The Great Gatsby" and it really was a masterpiece.  I kept hoping that it would be so much better.  But I was wrong.  My mind was too busy.  It got boring, and boring, while I kept reading, thinking I was making a good book all by myself.  Why not just read a novel, as my next book would be, if it was one.  And I had no idea what I was thinking, as the story seemed to get too much faster.  By the end of the novel I began to wonder if I was having an emotional problem, but I still kept thinking of it, as if my mind was not functioning.  The plot, characters, and plot kept the reader guessing.  What was I doing?  I can't say I enjoyed the novel, but maybe I just didn't realize what I had missed.  As I put it down, I felt the story did not fully satisfy me.  One of the main characters, the wealthy playwright Gertie, started off the story with her singing at a ball, and when the book started I was not sure if it would end with a happy ending.  Then, as it kept going, it seemed like there would be a happy finish, but the plot kept getting more and more confusing.   By that time, I had gone from wondering if I would finish the book or skip it, since I had a very low expectation, but by the time I finally gave up I was just thinking how would I ever finish the novel.  How could I ever possibly finish it?It was at the end that I really started feeling cheated of the ending.I didn't think I was going to finish the whole thing, and I'm sure the story didn't start with much of a purpose.  If I did finish, it would make me more disappointed in the book.  To get it, I would need to get it out of the way as fast as possible.  Even though the ending was great, I kept wondering what had happened to it, and what had become of it in the past year.I do wish the book would have been something more.  Perhaps it would have made the reader understand it better.Well, I'll be reading it, for sure 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is an abridged version of his last book - in my opinion, it's an abomination 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was trying to finish the book, but I can't finish it because it's so boring.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i was expecting more info from this book. i think this book is a waste of time. i would recommend checking out the book, "how to get by" or other books that have more information 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this to be a lot more interesting than the book I just read.  I know that the author is an avid runner, but I cannot believe he is writing a book about running.  Instead, the author seems to have a problem understanding the concept of running.In addition, he seems to believe that runners have a bad relationship with the earth, and he writes that the runners that walk on the street actually wear shoes that run in the sand.  There is a reason why he is written this way; we all do it.  What a jerk 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written for the "young-adult" audience.  However, it doesn't provide much info about the subject matter of the actual book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of typos and misprints.  I had no idea what the author was talking about.  How is it that the American people will be in support of the "pro-life" agenda when so much violence and death actually occurs in the world?  I would not wish that upon any other group 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish I had taken more notes than these.  There is so much that could be said in this book, but I could not decide if I was actually interested in what I was reading.  I wanted to find out what the author was saying.  But, more than that, I wanted his thoughts on a negative book: a negative work:  It's not like the author had the luxury of making himself comfortable and having time to write a negative piece 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A waste of time.  I would advise anyone who is looking for a book to read in the area of Christianity that would be relevant for their needs to do a little bit more homework than just reading this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a disgrace.  What an embarrassment.  There's a lot of wonderful books out there, just not for children 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   First time I got this book, and then it wasn't fair.  And then I started looking at it and there was nothing.  It was a bunch of junk.  But what bothers me even more is that this book was published  a year or so ago.  People just don't like writing negative reviews about bad books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping to learn some of the basics on how to cook a good meal.  It seems it will be an exercise in boredom for me, in reading the recipes only to learn the basics.  I would expect to find more insight into the world of professional kitchens and chefs.  A cook book such as this should not be taken lightly 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a novice in all areas of life. I had no idea what this book was. How can a book be so confusing? There is a war going on in the world today and the only one man who stands against this war is the president of the United States, who has gone too far in terms of what he is selling.  Why not read an actual history book about anything important? The American empire would not have survived today if the leaders of the Democratic Party in the 60s and 70s had had an idea what their society had become and what they were selling, instead of just selling the country, which was the basis of the entire nation. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not only a bunch of cliche and religious propaganda, but a whole load of misinformation.  In fact, I am surprised more than half of the book is true, in the sense of saying what a person needs to believe to have any hope of improving their lives.  What I see and hear in these books is just the opposite.  I would like to see the author be replaced with a book like this one.  Maybe someone like David J. Stewart, the author of this one, could offer better insight than this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very dry book, but it will help you in your understanding of the topic.  Do not waste your time with it.  The idea of using your own "interpretation" and "knowledge" to interpret the work is a good one.  However, it is a shame to waste your money on a dry book which is devoid of the "wow" factor.  I was not a "belief theorist", but after reading "Belief Theory" I feel the need to come up with my own "beliebing theory" so I won't waste my time on this subject 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete waste of time. The main topic is extremely boring and there are hardly any pictures that really interest me. There are no pictures of anything worth any amount of time to the point that you have to waste your time reading it! I am embarrassed to have wasted my money on this book. It is a total waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is hard to find any reason for all the hate against it.  It's not very good fiction.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It reads like a piece of fan fiction. The plot is not that exciting, and the characters aren't that original. For example, the only character who can really deliver the slap is the main character. The ending is also a big disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It makes the reader wonder what exactly he or she is getting from this author. The prose is a bit dull and unreadable.  There are some interesting ideas in the book, but it is hard to believe the author has really thought it through to make it so that we actually like what he has written.  As a reader, I expected that this book was to help make me better understanding of the work of art (even if it were a rather self-serving effort), and to provide me with some sort of insight as to how his work had come about (even though I didn't have the book). It doesn't. Instead the book does nothing to add to the reader's knowledge of art, and in the end it might actually hurt one to read.  The author just takes advantage of the fact that he is a professor of art history. However, there is nothing wrong with this book.  It's a decent introduction to art history, and I wouldn't have minded having it for my first art history book. The problem is the title.  If you're an art history student, or a professional writer, you'll need to stop thinking of art as art. You need to think of it as a kind of thing that has meaning outside of the art itself.  And the author's "Art of The Metamorphosis" is not about art, it's about culture, and to me at least this book seems to be an attempt to use art as the impetus of such "transcultural" attempts 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i dont like this book.  It makes it seem like you need to be really close to the characters to understand their feelings.  This book is very hard to read because it is so frustrating to see people saying stupid shit.  I'm not a huge fan of people who have their lives defined by stupid shit, but I certainly would have given this book a more serious thought before I finished it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the reviewers on this one.  I think this is a bad example to use of A negative review.  The book was written in response to the bad book by Christopher Fry and I cannot even say how much I agree and how much the reviewers disagree with it.  These reviews are all over the place.  This book is a poor, very unprofessional, and a shame to have in the literature.  It will be difficult to find a more scathing and negative review to one of this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   One day I will take a trip to California and I will tell my friends there what a beautiful place Santa Cruz is. They will be impressed with the beauty of the hills and forests. Then I will ask them if they can get a look at the area on the other side of the hill, where my friend's family lives. The hill is dotted with the memorials of people who have died, and the houses are small and neat. A few days before I arrive, I will be approached by a young woman who will tell me that her family moved to Santa Cruz to avoid the violence and corruption that surrounds the town. She will claim that the town has a wonderful little park which she calls "The Park". And she will look to me in disbelief at the small, well kept, pristine, tree lined streets with nice houses and shops lining the street.My friend will come out saying she can't believe me. She'll look at me and tell me, "What happened here?" and I'll ask, "Where did you go?" she'll say, "Santa Cruz". And I'll go straight into the town and I won't hear a word of her because I'm a local reporter and she won't ask me where I'm from.  In fact, she won' t see me again. I will never see her again until I turn 25, and I shall never know what I had done to her. I'm guessing that what happened here wasn't so bad, but there's no way I could have known what happened until I went to this book. I was told that the book was by a former reporter. I read this story when I was 16 and it was so hard to believe.The author of this book has a strong personality but in the book it seems she has a negative attitude toward the people who live in these areas. I wish she would give some credit to the people on the side of these forests. The story has an underlying message about the evils of modern times 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book did not do a very good job of illustrating the concept of a "collider's style", in particular, a "slouch". I had been hoping to read some of this author's other books, but this one was pretty much a disappointment 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with everyone else, but I still have a problem with this book. It's a long, confusing story with no real resolution. The plot was poor, the story confusing, and the ending disappointing. If the writer didn't like writing, then he should stick with fiction.The first book I ever read was Jane Austen's "Princes and Serpents", which I enjoyed for several reasons. However, in this book, I just found it much too long and confusing. There are lots of characters, but not enough exposition, and many chapters that seemed disjointed, just like the ones in this novel. The ending, like the plot, was too far from the rest of the book. I would have liked more time spent in this story.This one of these books I wouldn't recommend 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a professional health educator and I do not believe in the current trends of nutrition and health care. I do believe in a holistic approach, with proper nutrition and proper exercise, especially for children. Unfortunately, this book was written by a man who is not as familiar with the topic as I am. He seems to be more interested in spreading his own opinions and in general making sure he is right 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read many books on Buddhism, but I have never read a book called "The Buddha's Love".  The title makes it sound like a more or less conventional "romantic love" novel, in which Buddha's loving relationship with his wife is described, however, the book is really about his life.  The main focus in this book is the relationship between the Buddha and his disciple Ananda.  This relationship is of course the topic in much of Buddhism.  It is a long-standing tradition among Buddhists to treat the "love" aspect of the holy life as something to be considered holy.  Nevertheless in the "Love" chapter the relationship becomes more and more one-sided.  There is one passage where Ananda is invited by the Buddha to stay in the palace, but upon arriving at the palace he is shown a small hut in which there are statues of the Buddha, his mother and the rest of his followers.  He asks the Buddha for an audience, and is told not to talk to others; and there is a certain silence that is supposed to indicate to the Buddha that Ananda cannot speak.  His request is repeated, and the silence is broken only when the Buddha calls him a "wretch".  So the Buddha must be completely against his "drama" (a play on words meaning "play out", "play", etc.) in this room, or he must be being an unreasonable-minded imbecile.  Ananda, however becomes desperate and becomes physically violent.  As the story progresses, it becomes more clear that Anandas real feelings are not at all sincere.  In the last chapter he asks the whole group of monks to "take" on his "problem".  This was to prove that the teachings about loving one another and renouncing one's life of misery are actually true.  I must have missed that last chapter.  Still it sounds great, however the author is totally out to lunch.  If the book were written by a true disciple of Buddhism there would have been no way for it to get a positive review at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very disappointed to find the book being so shallow.  It seems to me to be a bunch of people with little time.  The author spends so much time on some people and no time on others 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main idea was that they had to make a bad impression on people as soon as they appeared. But when you look closer, it turns out that there are many, many different aspects of a bad opinion.  If you are looking for an article that is a positive review about some good book: it is not this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm very disappointed in this book.  I was a Christian before I became a Catholic.  This book, however, would have been completely offensive to Catholics.  The only thing I can really say is that they were simply offended and felt attacked.  But I wouldn't call it a bad piece of work.  It might have been a poor book, I'm not sure, but it was certainly not "Christian".  This is a waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not like this book.  I find that it is not helpful to the reader.  It does not teach much because it is a bit of a disjointed chronicle of events, particularly concerning the death of Princess Diana 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting this book to be the new best, but I am still disappointed.  I am just one person who enjoys a good book, and the author just doesn't put enough time into her plot, as she tries to write something that sounds good, but isn't.  She tries to build the story so we can have a little more insight into her characters.  The first few chapters were promising, but the book fell apart, and I felt I didn't know anyone well enough to like the plot.  Her main character, in the last part of the book, was kind of annoying.  In fact, she became such a bore I kept thinking "she's having trouble with the story".  I also thought she was trying to be cute and cute characters were not doing that well.  If you are looking for a book to read, look elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title of this book, "The Other Side", is a perfect summation of the entire topic of this novel. I am not a fan of this author, and I was very disappointed in the way this book went. The story itself, however, was somewhat entertaining. The ending was somewhat ambiguous, but was the kindest in this novel as far as I am concerned 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not based on science. It is just a lot of people talking in big numbers. If your main concern is finding out whether or not a bunch of people really are stupid, this book is for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is very frustrating because it is so basic and boring. It could have been just a bit more and more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for a book that covers the basics of the Linux Operating System, you should read "Linux for the Java User".  It's not that much different than "BASIC Linux" for Linux 2.x and 3.x but it has a little more background in the JVM.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a complete and total failure! I have read the books "The Joy of Life" and "The Artist's Way" but I would NEVER trust their author.  I felt the same way after reading "The Great Recession".  He was so obsessed with wealth. I have always been more concerned with the well-being of my family and my friends. I felt cheated because he convinced me that all of these issues were resolved with the end of the recession. There are far too many people in this country who want to buy more than they can afford and never take a real look at the problems we face. This book was an obvious attempt to get people to feel good. And I'm not an expert. So for everyone out there who's wondering why their parents bought this book, it's for the same reason you bought "The Art of Being a Little Girl" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of unnecessary information. It is not an accurate portrayal of the subject and the writing itself is dated. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't say this much more negative about this book. It's just plain old boring. It makes absolutely no sense. It has to be the worst book I've ever read in my life 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for this book when I started reading books by this author, and it was very disappointing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a complete waste of money, what a complete failure 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It just seems to me that there is a pattern of people writing "self help" books.  I have read "The Power of Self Help" many times.  And then there are others who have written "help books" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to really slog my way through this to finish, and I have to say that I am not sure if it was an issue of not finding the point, not finding an author that was different, or not feeling like it was time to get over this. It's hard to feel that anybody's being so "unreasonable" as a part of the story, and it was hard for me to feel sympathetic toward Ms. Fenton because I read her as I found myself and so I was not able to. I can't say why, other than the fact that the first paragraph of the book was one of the least original I've ever read. I'm sure I'm not alone. So if you want to read this as a literary device or a "mystery mystery" it doesn't have to be this. If it does, I suggest that you go for a new mystery set in 1816 or the murder of a mysterious and beautiful young girl. If you're looking for "who killed my friend?" or "who was this girl?" in particular then it may not be your cup of tea. The novel is certainly not as good as A Heart of Darkness 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not really about the book of Moses. It is about a guy who is a rabbi, he is not Jewish but is Jewish and wants to take a position on a religious issue.  The other issues in the book do not matter to this guy, it is a book about a rabbi's thoughts on the issue. In the book, he writes about how he was a good boy and what a bad thing it is to be a bad boy.  I think the other issues and what the rabbi writes in the first part of the book relate to the concept of being a bad Jew, but they do not really mean anything to this rabbi. The book is very long, but not for reading in a book shop 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is really hard to find anything that makes sense in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have written a negative negative review regarding a bad electronic device:  I bought a cheap scanner in hopes of better results from the scans I made.  The scan didn't even give me the opportunity to scan a negative scan!  The images were too big and the program only allowed me to scan only one image at a time.  I tried another scanner, which gave me the same results.  All in all, I'm satisfied with the scanner I have purchased.  On the other hand, the digital video scanner I bought only works for video (which is why I have bought it).  The scanner requires the user to take the photos, then you have to have them all organized (and there is no guarantee that your pictures will be organized) so that it may be stored and saved on the computer for later viewing.  You will still have to pay for the software to scan your negative photos--you will have to buy it separately, or the costs will go up 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't imagine what kind of author is writing this. I didn't have a chance to finish it, so I will never know 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was underwhelmed, and very disappointed in this book. I can agree with the general consensus that the author does not write well. Her style is so annoying that I sometimes find myself reading her work as if I was listening to someone who doesn't write well and was only doing it to please people she liked.The story, however, is very poor. It feels too convenient, too derivative. The ending was, as you can imagine, a bit too sudden and somewhat contrived. I guess I'll have to try it again. There are far better books out there 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be a very boring. In addition, it has a long list of other authors which I have never read. The author does have the right to call himself a poet, but he didn't go into the writing that is necessary to make a book a truly great work 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this is such a waste of time. I feel as if this author was looking for a way to sell more books...if you are looking for something to read, read a better book: The book was very poorly written. There are so many spelling errors, and if you want some information to go along with your speculation, it is well worth checking out the wikipedia page about the film 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not sure what the hell is going on with this book, but it seems like it must be some sort of "joke" at least. The premise is very hard to believe at first glance, but if you are really interested in it, you will come away feeling like a sucker. And then after a while you will start to feel like you are being spoonfed. The story gets predictable and boring. The main character, who is introduced to us as such a lovable person, is a very boring and unlikable character.  I mean, it's hard to like someone who is not nice. I was honestly surprised. I just could not find a way to like this character. The ending is also very boring. A lot of plot points that don't seem to really matter, or the fact that there are no chapters or character development. But anyway, this book can give you some insight on the way the industry is changing and changing its practices, such as the "work-for-hire" model, the "hired freelancer" model that everyone seems to have, and the lack of ethics that is so prevalent in the business today. I think this book was written to make people feel sorry for the employees, but people don't really like employees...I really wish I had read the book first before starting my job, because I could have helped some more people.  But the book just makes it seem like they would make a bad hire, and when I was being interviewed, I would feel like I was wasting my time. I'm not sure that it is for the best. I have no interest in writing another negative review on a bad work book: it was a waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title implies the readers will be able to appreciate it.  However, when I read this book, it became very difficult to get out.  It is a very disjointed book.  I was expecting something like this.  What I got instead was a rather boring book.I feel like I wasted my time on this book. I will probably never read this author again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book would be interesting, but I'm sadly disappointed.  I'm not even sure whether I'm going to finish it because I feel like I've wasted my time with this book.  This book is the book from an author who is not a fan of either comic book nor the "Marvel Wars" series.  The book is pretty much devoid of any plot (I actually didn't finish the book), and it just continues to bore me with its endless repetitions of the same old ideas.  There are way too many repetitions, way too much repeating, and way too little of any real plot that could be useful.  If you want a book that has plot, but lacks plot, then this book is not the book for you.  What a waste of my time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a woman in the public eye, and I have been living with a man.  I have written two books dealing with sexual and social topics; one is a very controversial sex manual, the other an autobiographical novel.  Neither of these books is a sex-themed rom-com, nor a real-life story.  What I found in this book, though, was an absolutely horrifying account of my life.  If you are looking for a light-hearted romance, do not read this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What's the big deal with the word?  A good book can be explained in a casual manner, but a new book like this can become a real shocker.  The author is a professor at a university in Oregon and he seems like an amateur.  He writes a lot and he gets too technical and not to mention any other topic he goes on and on.  I just wanted to see what he thought this was about. The title of his book is  The Little Rascals,  and it is an interesting story and the plot is intriguing.  Unfortunately, the writing style is too formal and he makes it hard to distinguish the words that are written.  In the third act, the story becomes more confusing and incoherent.  It is a shame that someone who has such promise can write a book like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are too many words, too much information, too little insight.  I don't know if this book helps or hinders you.  Maybe it has some usefulness for those who want to make a positive statement about themselves, but are struggling with the concepts and terminology 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has several errors in it. A mistake I had in the book is I gave it my idea to find the truth. It is one of the most ridiculous pieces of fiction I've read. The author, who claims he writes in the vein of Dr. No, is using an idea he had of what is true and false to get people to believe he is an author. I suggest not buying this book unless you are a genuine Dr. John. This is not a book written for the sake of reading it. If you wish to get a handle on the truth, I suggest you do not read it. It's one of his greatest works, but I wouldn't waste your time. If a true Dr. thinks it's important to know the truth and have an idea of what it is, he'll share it with his readers - not to give credence to Dr. Nos writings - but rather to have an example of what he knows of truth. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author writes with the same style as his wife.  I find it insulting that someone would willingly publish such a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is way too confusing. There is a lot of stuff but not enough information for anyone to know what this is all about. I would recommend other books as a general understanding of the world and politics. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are a serious student of theology and have to take an Advanced Theology course (i.e., an undergraduate) the answer is probably this book. The book, however, is a terrible advertisement for your religious studies. It is just not a very meaningful book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the reviewer's comments.  I wish I hadn't.  This book is a collection of essays written by a former professor, as he tries to come to terms with the world of professional baseball.  He makes a few attempts to use the  language he learned as a professor to make sense  of baseball. It isn't very long before he decides  to throw away the bat and try baseball again, and it's not long  before he realizes it's a different world, and so the world he comes back to is much more difficult 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was surprised that the author would write this book. I agree with the author's assessment that this book contains some very interesting ideas, but I'm not convinced it's true.  I don't even know what a microeconomics book is.  The fact that they are so important to so many people in this country is surprising to me. I don's not, however, sure there's anything wrong with this book at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It has become increasingly evident that the whole book was made up by a man named William T. Gifford. It's a shame that his work is being held in such low esteem. The whole book is just a bunch of lies. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm only 15, but I've already read many books and articles about the subject. I have a bookmarked copy of this one.  This is a textbook of misquoting and misrepresentation of the facts of the Vietnam War and it is the worst book I've ever read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a shame because the author is a decent writer, but this is one of those novels that could have been written a decade ago. There's no denying the fact that the book is quite dull. The whole story is one big, overblown drama, and if you like your drama in the most realistic sense, this one won't be for you. It's the most unrealistic, most overused, most overwrought, most melodramatic novel I've ever read. The "gorgeous" story of Jidar, the woman who falls in love with a man who has killed and killed many other people, is a total oxymoron, but the rest of the book seems to be based on an identical premise as in "Eyes on the Condition of a Blind Man", and it all culminates to what is essentially an unoriginal romance novel that's more or less a remake of "Death of a Salesman" and "A Street of Vipers". This is a very poor book, but not as bad as the one that got to number two in the UK "The Night Before Christmas". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i have seen this book several times and i just had to say, what the hell are people talking about? i do not know if this book is good for anyone but me because i know people who had to read it. i did not know what to expect from the book and i guess what the book did for me was show me that i was wrong. i dont think this book was a great book, and i will not be reading any of the other ones.  i did like the first part of this book, however i feel it is a shame that it is so boring and i dont like the author's style.i have to call it the worst book i have ever seen. if anyone is interested in reading the book do not bother reading it.i will be reviewing the other books that have been written and will not waste my time with this one. i guess this is it right?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is so confusing. A lot of what people consider to be the "facts" are just random opinions. And just like in "Muhr and Power" it is so difficult to distinguish between what makes sense and what does not. One example of this is the "methods of selection" section. Most of it is either quotes or references to a book that nobody really knows. There is no discussion about the methods that are used to find the "right" data. To me this is a major problem in the book. The author, however, is very well educated, so it isn't that big of a problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is descriptive enough to explain its content.  It is a very short book.  Each chapter contains one sentence and one or two sentences.  I was quite disappointed and have not finished the book so I do not know if it had any impact on my reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book intended for children.  It is not intended for those who are looking for the full range of life values, including what they call "good ethics."  It's a very shallow morality guide which is a far cry from what is considered ethical in today's society 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't waste your time with this book.  It's boring, and the pictures are poor.  If you don't have the patience to finish the book, don't waste  it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As the title makes clear, this book was written by a former Navy Seaman, in his first attempt at writing a novel.  The plot is disjointed, the characters seem flat and the story is dis-related to the Vietnam War (itself a war novel), and the author makes no mention of the Vietnam conflict whatsoever.  I really wanted to read this novel. I am an admirer of the author and I wanted to give him credit for the good book that he did write.  Instead, I was treated to a tedious, overly-simplified, contrived, yet predictable, story that lacks any depth or realism.  In my opinion, this novel was a poor attempt to recreate the feeling of reading J.K. Salinger.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i think i saw this book on the internet and i hadnt been able to finish it because i was afraid the story was so confusing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a fan of Ms. Lofoten's work, as she has done an excellent job in exploring her subjects. I was hoping for a fresh, new look and approach, and I was a little disappointed.  The novel is not that different from some of the other books written in the last decade, except that it is not as well written  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to agree with everyone else 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does not take place to the true story, but merely to cover the basics of a false story.  It is very boring, but not so much that it isnt worth reading 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   You'll see so many "facts" in this book.  But the biggest "facts", the ones that matter to people the most, is that we've been lied to and we still have so much left to fight for.  If this was all that people needed to hear in order to make an informed decision about the future of America, we would be in the greatest nation on earth.  What has happened to us is that all the evidence and numbers are just the opposite.  And it's time to take a stand and do something. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book seems to be a little more entertaining than the book I read, but it is not enough to make it worth the price I paid 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a series of anecdotes that are not much of an attention grabber.  The author, Mr. Lefort, wrote for a magazine, and the pictures in the book are really too small.  I was hoping he could have a little more oomph 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has given me some pleasure.  The characters are so annoying.  I would never buy a book from this author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author does not speak in the book.  He was very much an intellectual-excellent person, however the work was shallow and too much about what happened to the person of the author.  His "quotations" are usually very hard to grasp and don't make much sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book while in high school.  I was bored and wanted to read something interesting for my final year, I wanted something new that might keep me entertained, but it was hard to get through this book without some cramping up.  It was really hard to put down, I kept going back to it thinking about the main character.  A little too long, maybe, but I got a lot of cramping.  When the ending came, I thought maybe I had made it, and I kept thinking about this book.  Then I started reading other books after that one.  This book is not really that interesting, so I didn't finish it.  The ending sucked and I would think back on it later, but the main plot is the most disappointing part of this book, and it does not do justice to the characters.  All in all, it was a bad read, and if I had any interest in reading, I would have avoided this book altogether 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have spent hours with this book. The story line and format are not appealing. The ending is predictable. You will get the same outcome. I would not waste my time with this "book". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book reads like a college English class with no thought given to the content.  The writer claims this book is "in progress" but in this case, he's right.  Everything is presented in a very casual style with no indication of any effort to write something substantive.  I have read all of this and still have a question about it.  What's the point in writing a book about how to write a negative book about bad book?  Is it better to just cut a negative, boring book and move on?  I'm guessing that the writer really thinks that his readers will laugh at his book, not actually be entertained.    Maybe this is a nice book, but it can be a huge waste of time to waste your time on a book like this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a fan of The Walking Dead but I couldn't finish this book.  It was very boring and repetitive. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was interesting.  I am an educator, therefore I would like to know how this works with teachers and students, the same way I did in the K-12 world, where I learned that some children like this book, so why is that the case here, too?  The book doesn't really cover what the difference between a positive and negative review is.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not saying it is a bad novel.  It certainly isn't.  But it isn't quite the best book I've read, either 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am in my mid 30's, and I am being forced to write this negative review because this author is an author I know and I have a lot of respect for.  I really liked his books, but this book was the worst example of writing that I've ever experienced.  The writing style was sloppy, and sometimes I couldn't tell where he was going with some of the sentences.  And the ending is confusing.  It is not like the other books in his career.  A really terrible book that didn't even have the decency to finish.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There isn't much going on in this book. The writing is not that strong. I do not recommend this book to anyone with more than one copy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In this book, Mr. Obama talks a lot about foreign policy, and I've no doubt that he has an interest in doing so, but I have a much bigger concern about a very narrow range of issues. I have to be careful with the words I choose 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is just a bunch of superficial philosophy and ethics. It is an example of "just being good". It seems to be a bit too much "quasi-liberal" in the extreme - although perhaps not much - I have to admit. And, perhaps I shouldn't have expected anything more than this. After all, a philosophy department must have done a bad job on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for a quick, "how to" book to cover the basics of SQL. The best book is actually SQL Injectors, which covers the basics from both the SQL Server API and the MySQL API. If you want a reference book, then look elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not much in it. I just skimmed the last chapter, and decided to finish this book, but I have a feeling I'll never finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an article from a popular book, written for the general public, but written for professionals, it has the same information as a regular magazine. It also provides references to other articles, so the author has a vested interest in pushing this information. This is not news, but this book is NOT for readers. It is a marketing tool for book publishers. The publisher uses it to sell their books. For example, he has a new edition out with all the articles included in it, and he has not been able to remove any of these articles 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It would be nice if there was some discussion on this but the author just assumes you know what he/she is talking about.  The story is about a bunch of young men having sex with a female.  It is very difficult to take the story seriously when you read so much about how women should behave.  A lot of this is simply sexist garbage.  I would never read this book, if it were actually true.  Don't waste your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish I had read this book.  It was way too long and I kept waiting for the ending.  What a waste of my time.  You would think this author had some connection to this book but I guess I should have read it earlier and it would have made the ending more poignant 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a huge mistake on the author's part. His writing style is completely boring and his explanations are completely unintelligible to the average reader. The writing style was a major stumbling block in this book.  If you are reading a book on the subject of science, be extremely careful.  I would recommend a copycat version 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If your first impression of this book is that it's about a dog eating its own vomit, your second impression is that this book exists solely to promote the commercial exploitation of dogs by puppy mills 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really think it should be a negative book.  I am very disappointed with the way the book devolved into an insult to feminism.  It just seemed to me that this book was written by someone who had no idea what feminism was.  And I felt that Ms. A.Kathleen was trying to portray a victim of a misogynist.  But I don't agree with her view that this is a result of a feminist movement gone wrong.  Ms. Kathleen, who lives in North Carolina and writes for a living, is an educated woman and certainly knows that there are issues in feminism. And it's her responsibility to use her intellect to challenge misogynistic men and the ideas they espouse. She may be a victim because she got her education at a very male college, but she's still a feminist and she has her right to challenge the idea that feminism is a victim movement.  If you are a writer who has the ability to challenge ideas, like Ms. Kathleen, I would encourage you to use your pen to challenge feminism. But I wouldn't try to put that sort of spin on a bad feminist book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am looking for something new!  I will use this book but the title I am thinking "The Story of my Grandpa", it's a funny title.  This book is very boring and it just makes the kids think it is funny.  My guess would be that it isn't much of a story, but the kids like the way it is described.  I wish I hadn't bought it.  Don't buy it, I don't think it belongs in this age range 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book starts off strong, but the ending is ridiculous. The story starts out with a beautiful woman named Mrs. Paul, who comes to New York for the first time in her life, and instantly starts having sex with anyone and everyone with a negative connotation attached to it. So she ends up getting married to a bad man named John, who ends up having an affair with the beautiful Mary Ann, and then, she ends things with him for a third time, but before it's over, she tells Mr. Paul that she's now pregnant, which means that he has to tell the cops that he's an abusive husband who has abused his wife. After that, she and John start getting into even more nasty arguments with each other about how to avoid being arrested, and Mr. John gets arrested for domestic abuse. In the middle of it all, the two cops that John is talking to on the phone are arrested, but it's implied that they are still talking. It turns out they are, in fact, the real cops. So Mr. & Mr. Smith goes up against two of the real New York cops and beats both of them to the ground, only to be arrested himself. I'm assuming the ending was supposed to be a mystery that Mr. Jones, the author, had wanted us to solve, but Mr. Joe isn't as easy to follow as he wants you to believe. It gets a bit confusing when Mr. J is arrested and Mr Smith is released from jail. I think this book was written with the author trying to create a more complicated world for his readers than reality. However, as I say, the ending of this story is ridiculous and the author shouldn't have wasted his time in writing it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was the only one I read on this topic. It was written by an individual who has never published any other work in the field of forensic pathology, which I am sure is an excellent book, and I have to say the very basic things in it. And I think that many people will be very interested in seeing what the author has to say about the "crime scenes", but it seems that this is all he can write about, and not much more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It would be one thing if the author of a bad novel were to write about a good book: A book about being a gay man in the early 50s in America.  What was this book about? Well,  I can tell you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was hoping for something positive but the book was not very good.  A few parts were funny.  I would have liked it more if they had been put together.  There was not enough information on the topic for anyone who could not find it themselves 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   One of the most disgusting chapters in the book was the chapter on pedophilia. I'm sure this is going to be the topic of the next time one of the authors interviews a pedophile. The fact that she thought she could be so far in advance of what she spoke about is just disgusting.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very difficult to understand. A lot of the information is left out 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book because I have always enjoyed the writings of David O'Meara. I was surprised to see the "theory" section included with the other sections. I will not purchase this book again. If you want to read O'meara's other writings, this is a great start. If not, please do a little research on the writer's past and try his work on your own instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   One of the most tedious and boring books I have ever read. The "characters" were all so very shallow and unbelievable. The book was so boring that my 8-year old daughter could hardly stay awake through the entire thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can see why the author wrote this book.  I was not happy with the way she put it all.  Her statements on race are offensive to all races.    Her comments about homosexuals being a minority in society are completely false.  She is so out of touch with most people.  The book is riddled with errors and bias.  One section makes it sound like the author was referring to racism.  It was a little too much for me to stay up till 3 am reading it.  All the book was a waste of time and my time wasted 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have an IQ score that is higher than 99.9% of my peers but this is not a book I have read!  I am sure the author could have written a better book.  I was actually disappointed to find the book so boring and uninspiring.  This book was a chore to read.  One thing is for certain, the author is not an expert in psychology.  The book does not have any actual facts and I really wish he had provided more background on psychology.The author did not provide the reader with any information as to why the author believed in such a "miraculous" result. The author is in fact an attorney but it is still unclear as to who the author might be. I just wanted to find out the answer to this mystery, so I had to read an entire book in search of an answer 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is just so very dry and boring to the point of being a major distraction to the reader. The author has to make everything as simple as possible because the truth is not that easy. I really have to fight to stay focused on it because it has gone on too long without any sort of action or anything resembling a real plot. I did enjoy the short chapters on his life and the main characters but they were all so dull and meaningless. I will read more of his books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been in seminary for nearly 20 years and had never before read a book that was so offensive to people in the Church. It is time to take a step back. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a very disappointing attempt to tell a negative story about bad electronic device:  The soundcard is horrible!! The software is useless and won't even run the soundcard!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was a big disappointment. The chapters on the politics of sex with "the men's rights movement" were simply not interesting. The chapter on women's rights was not a positive review of feminism nor women's suffrage, but a negative one. For the author, it is a case of a failure of imagination.The book was not representative of any "movement." The author seems to think the women's movement is a group of men that only think about their wives. One can be a feminist without being a man-hater.The author seems unwilling to allow anyone outside the movement to see what he sees with his own eyes. If you are a woman who is a radical feminist or who supports women's actions that are positive in the sense of women's equality, the book should not be dismissed, but given a fair critique. This author could have done better, and it is not so disappointing to see that he failed at his job as an advocate of feminism. He could have written a negative critique about a negative book: a failure to understand the issues. The author does not seem to understand how feminism is a positive movement, but he appears to like the idea of radical feminism.  I find his attitude distasteful.In the end I was disappointed, but at least I was able to see the author's name and read his writings 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am currently in my last year of undergrad. What a waste of time, right? Well I was given this book on the recommendation of my professor. I am a student of the humanities in the College. However, I had a degree in linguistics, so I wanted to see how linguistics was discussed in the general literature. I was so disappointed with it and this was one reason why I requested the professor to look into this book and I am very glad to have been satisfied and have returned my money. I will be happy if you can find something different 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find myself very disappointed with the way this book is laid out.  It is just a collection of a very large bunch of anecdotes from an assortment of sources.  I know this is not a serious book, but I wish I had found it.  There are so many stories, and so little to differentiate them.  The book lacks any information that would allow a reader to make an informed decision on how to evaluate its value.  At times I had to fight back against the author's desire to write a collection so large.  If you want an overview of this book, or simply some of its "funny" stories, I would suggest "The Longest Book Ever".  It's about 300 pages long, and does a much better job of explaining the concept of this collection.  One of the most entertaining parts of the book is the author interviewing a fellow paranormal skeptic.  She is very convincing, and also a bit of a throwback to a very different age.  Her anecdotes were very original.  They had such a different feel and character that I couldn't help but laugh at.  A common complaint about this book  is the fact that there is no reference to anything in the world of ESP and ESP research.  As an editor I have been looking for the references, and the only reference I found was a textbook on the subject.  This is perhaps because many of the stories in this book appear to involve paranormal phenomena.  In this sense, the book's authors were very much on the side of their opponents, and their conclusions were very clearly not from a place of personal opinion.  But I found it somewhat irritating to hear this much, from an author who has no personal opinion to share.  And I think the author herself has to have a "self-imposed limitation", otherwise her book will never have been published 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the worst books I have read in awhile. I am looking for something a little better. Maybe I'll read some other stuff if I need some help. I was expecting something different but this was not it. I found myself wondering about the author and what he was trying to accomplish. His writing is really not that great. I expected to be able to read it a little more and appreciate the work. I can't believe he had such a reputation. I have written negative reviews about bad books:  This, as far as I can tell, is a bad example of American fiction from its beginnings to its end. The work, while certainly worth the time I spent, has not been very enjoyable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not at all what I expected, and I'd probably have laughed harder had I read this in the book-clubs.  But I was expecting some kind of insight into her life, and what it was like to grow up in New York and in the public eye.Well, I'm disappointed in her. I expected something to make sense of what was going on with the people around her. Nothing of the sort here, in any way. It's just a sad, depressing mess.It does seem as though her life had gone down in a negative way. I'm not trying to make a negative opinion here. But she's not actually the kind of person I expect.It reminds me of the death of her brother at the time, and then she comes back and her life gets even more difficult, and in a sense she has to pretend to be like a little sister again.She's also given up on life completely, to the point where she goes back to living in New Orleans when she decides she can handle it no longer 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a mess. I have no idea what happened. I am a high school student and I have just recently been engaged in a program about this same book.  This is not a good book. It is a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with some of the comments but the book is way too long. The chapter was way too complicated. I kept trying to go back to the previous page but the reader kept moving in different directions.  The chapters were quite boring and the author seems to be trying to say something with a negative tone. I'm not sure why she wrote about a book on the death of an infant that didn't exist. I was thinking that the book was for teens with high expectations for their future.  My disappointment was not enough because I wanted more, but my disappointment may have something to do with my reading habits.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting more in depth writing. What happened? I was just a bit surprised when I got a general outline about how the people in the world lived for a few hundred years.  If you want to know how life was back then, this book is a very good read.  The problem is that its time was only recently passed.  You would need to do some research, since there are not really enough examples.  I learned a lot and was very disappointed. It was a shame that I had wasted my time.  Its a shame to wasted time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very vague and not that useful for the aspiring writer.  My advice would be to get a couple of books and get into writing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story starts off rather well, but then suddenly it turns into a long story with very little plot and nothing that makes it any more interesting than it is, it gets a little boring after a while, and then I'm left feeling really unsatisfied with the whole thing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of errors, inaccurate statements, and confusing ideas. It is also very biased toward Islam. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's been said a hundred times. There are too many mistakes in this book. I am sick and tired of hearing about the mistakes. I'm not even going to bother. I think I will stay out of this book forever. It's a waste of time and money to waste time and make money on a bad, bad book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not quite sure why anyone would be interested in this book, since it is a very limited piece of information. It does give some useful insight into the different personalities of different people, but for my money this book does not provide much of anything. The content seems to me to be a collection of random anecdotes 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to agree with the majority of reviews.  The book does not give enough information on what is the best book to learn from these articles.  It is far from the best of all.  I will be reviewing a book from another book- 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most boring, boring, non-endings story of all time, I found out.   I am surprised this author is alive and well and was able to write such boring, unengaging material.  I was disappointed with all the praise heaped on this book.  The book seems to be a poor attempt at bringing in a young reader to read the original book, but I still believe this was his first book. It is quite depressing that he did not bother giving it to the University class I taught, and I do not know why he did 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping for something new but the same old racist and homophobic tropes.  I am not surprised this book is still sold in the public library.  Not that I expect it to be given a free pass, because if it is not I'd be pissed at myself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm in the minority but not by much.  This book made me very angry.  I was told the author would be making a positive review about some good book, I was wrong.  The title was misleading, and the content very basic.  If you read through all the chapters you'll be better prepared 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only reason I bought this book is because I wanted a glimpse into the thought process of a psychopath, the most interesting psychopath to have so far. I didn't expect this to be so well written and informative 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was very poorly written.  It did not include any original research.  Also, there was no reference for a reason 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have never read anything written by the great Elmore Norman.  I would like to give my opinion on this novel 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I feel like I'm reading my college student's grade report on this book, not a serious historical study on the topic.  The premise is too thin.  I'm actually surprised when I finish this novel.  It reads like a college student wrote it, and it lacks any depth.   The plot is too contrived.  Not sure how I could ever finish this book again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for a book that will get you into the mindset of an aspiring magician, this book is for you.  It's a very long book and it is full of very basic, general and trivial spells. If you have not done so, this is a good book to get you started in the magic world.  Unfortunately, it is far too long. If there was more information on basic rituals, I would recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very uninspiring, overrated book.  I'm surprised it's received so much attention.   I would be much happier with a more informative book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not interested in this book.  It's not a good book.It's not because it is written by a fan and not a true historian 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about how to write a negative negative review negative review:  I'm only half of the way through this book, and the first three chapters were written by someone else.  They were terrible.  The writing is too slow.  I just cannot take it anymore 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would like this book.  But the author's views on religion and what it is are completely opposite to mine.  I am an atheist, but I would never go along with her in trying to convert me and my friends to this religion.  You have to know what your beliefs are, but just because religion is a form of belief doesn't mean it has to be a belief in all its manifestations.  It seems to me this book has gone off into another hole.  If it were my parents and I had their opinions I would think more of them and less of her.  She goes too far to make me think she thinks all religions are equally bad and we have to all reject them.  And she just can't get over how it's the fact that so many of her friends are atheists.  Oh well. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of blatant misinformation, but it does have some useful information about the bad ideas on the internet.  For example, the fact that many of the more popular 'weird' web sites are selling counterfeit or imitation merchandise.   There are also many articles that describe many of these sites.  I am hoping the book will help more than to make my life more difficult 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book is very boring. it would be nice to have a quick read about a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got a little irritated by the book. The author doesn't seem to understand the importance of having some degree of creative insight. A little too much theory. The rest is just a lot of talk and not much action. There is a part of me that feels that this book was written because there was not a lot to be done. Perhaps there should be a book with some action and little theory? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with others who say the book is too simplistic. In its simplicity, it makes it very hard to comprehend the actual problems in the world today.  If you are looking to do research on a subject, I would suggest this book instead of trying to write one book based on your personal opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was the first of a series of children's books that I bought with my daughter.  It was published in 1968, and I was hoping the other books in the series would have been as good as this one. Unfortunately, this is the worst in a series I bought.  The main story was a simple, one-note plot that is at best a bit boring.  I didn't expect to finish the book until my daughter's seventh birthday.  If I read the other volumes, I'm sure I'd like them better.  In the end, the children's stories were a waste of my time - they are just as shallow and superficial as this book.  And there is not a single child in this book that I would consider as a great character - all the children seem, at least, to be very selfish.  After the book is finished, the reader spends an enormous amount of time looking back at what the writer wrote.  One could have expected much better writing from this author.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find this book, written by an anti-religious atheist, to be extremely disjointed.  And I do not believe that God actually exists 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've never really minded these books. The problem is the author's tone.  He gets really excited in his recounting of the exploits of a pirate, but doesn't hold back in the way he talks about the atrocities of the American revolutionaries. The author calls for revolution. How exactly does this justify this kind of person? What do you think this would happen if these revolutionaries actually succeeded in changing society?  The author really doesn't explain this very well. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was very boring.  Too many characters, nothing interesting.  I couldn't believe the author would write a book about a book and not do anything else 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is nothing in the way of substance on this book. Not enough information about the "real war on Vietnam", etc. It is sad to say. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title is not quite true. There are several chapters, however, in which this author attempts to be descriptive of what was for a long time "theory".  It was actually a theory-oriented work, written for the "art school" of the 1980s (I was one), with some general ideas, which were not very well stated and in which his theories were at odds with those of his peers 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a degree in journalism, and the author does not, in fact, have it. However, he has an extensive background in philosophy and religion, and in other areas in which his interests have given him some notoriety. However the topics he covers in his essays are not in the slightest related to this topic. His views on religion, politics and the nature of humanity are entirely opposite to what I would consider reasonable and acceptable in an average educated Western society. These issues, in addition to the fact that he has been an anti-Semitic religious propagandist, really irked me. The writing itself is rather dull. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has the unfortunate tendency to ramble on and on.  I will read the book only because I was hoping for a more focused and detailed account of the actions of the NSA.  It is not here.  They were all given the opportunity to speak out, and they mostly did nothing.  In fact I would not be surprised if the NSA has been actively spying on journalists (the other major NSA spying scandal occurred when it was revealed that the NSA was listening to the office of James Rosenman) but that doesn't seem to be the case here.The fact is, the NSA isn't doing that much of anything because of the Constitution.  So the fact that the book ends with the NSA not doing anything is simply a big, fat lie that is being used to prop up a bad piece of political propaganda 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book I read after receiving some of the most vile and vitriolic emails I have ever received.  It was so much worse than the "hate mail" I got from my local library.  The message, when I say "I'm in," has no meaning.  They are referring to anyone who they feel like I'm being disrespectful to.  I had to stop reading and think, "Am I racist?"  I kept hoping to hear, "Hey, what's my race?" and I would then answer, "I am black.  Do you like that?"  If I kept thinking those thoughts I might wake up in the middle of the night and decide to throw myself out of a window, or just run away from my hometown.  Instead I was completely dumbfounded.  If you feel like being a bit mean about someone, read the book.  Don't bother reading the reviews about the hate mail, read my review, and then feel the pain you'll feel when you realize that the book is actually a hate mail from some people who have a mental problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author seems to think he knows all and more, while writing in a self-centered way that is just to make himself feel important and have power.  In the end, he doesn't give the reader much to work with, nor does he really portray any character's motives or attitudes well.  The book is filled with clich√©, and has little actual humor, but the book really bothers me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has no real content. I just skimmed through it because I knew it was about a book I wanted to see, and it was too depressing. I'm sorry but no more books like this on Amazon. There's something more disturbing out there and I'm looking for it. The book was very nice with the pictures and the cover, but I just couldn't get into it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was expecting a book of a new book. In fact, it was only for sale, not a true autobiography, which I would have expected from a former presidential candidate. The author was a well-known and very well-respected radio host. He was not an historian. I was hoping for a story of his life, and it was very disappointing to find a biography, not to mention the way his personal life and personal life are depicted. I also found the writing very dry.  It was really disappointing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would have to put this book down.  It is an insult to people who are trying to get a sense of perspective on what is going on in the Muslim world today. It is a shame to see people using the writings of the author to justify their own prejudice and prejudice themselves.  There are some good books on this topic and I wouldn't be disappointed in anyone reading it. However, this one really did nothing to help my understanding of the issue. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author, Mark Twain, is credited with writing the famous lines such as "It is very pleasant to read about a good book: but I wish I had done the book."  So the author of "Cattle Culture" goes on to tell us in a quite technical tone how much of a difference culture can make between a rich and poor person.  There are so many questions that this author has yet to answer and there are so much we don't know.  The reader is left unsatisfied.  I was disappointed, but what could be more frustrating is that this book, when considered by its actual content, is simply an exercise in self-promotion.  In fact, the book is really a very superficial exercise in the superficial aspects of animal farming.  It is simply a waste of time.  As someone who has spent my time working on livestock farms, I found this book to be very discouraging and frustrating.  Still, there are some interesting ideas in the book, especially with regard to what to do with the leftover livestock.  After reading it, I still feel there is a little more we can do with our animal farms and I will be very interested in seeing what else is in store for the next book I read on animal farms 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It should be easy to just read the book and then go on to practice it - I know I'm an avid reader, but I wouldn't suggest that people just read this book for fun - it has a lot more details than it would suggest.  This book just reads like a basic introduction to CNC.  If you are looking for a more detailed introduction I recommend "Programming C for the Win".  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a total piece of fiction. Not much has changed. The author's opinions are unchanged and I think that everyone should read The Greenwich Review. The book contains a lot of other things and the authors are quite different than they appeared in the book. Not to mention some characters in the story that I found very disturbing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really do not like the premise, the characters, and the ending. The story starts out okay but the ending is not enjoyable to read. I did not finish the book, as it was much more enjoyable reading  The Bad Rap.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not a fan of this author but his main line is that of a self-indulgent, exploitative, uneducated, self-promoting, shallow, narcissistic, hypocritical, self. At the end of the book, I wanted to say  that perhaps I was being too hard on myself.  I wasn't  really that hard, but what I was reading did  make me feel that way 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was hard to get into, it made the reader feel that they were not "being" in the book.  The author's style is hard to keep track of, and he is a very hard to follow author.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got to the end and just knew I was getting myself in to this book.  It seems that I have been waiting for this book since I started working at the hospital, and now I am forced to pick it up, wondering if I have read it before.  This is a book that is all about how to make your life go smooth and how to cope with being an unhappy person.  While the book offers some advice, this isn't the book I need.  What I need is a straightforward book on how to survive with a husband with a drinking problem, a lover who refuses to acknowledge their problems, and a kid with a mental disorder who lives with no one who won't accept him.   The book also provides a very simple checklist to help you with the mental health disorder 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book I have never read but it is one of the most appalling works I have seen in the past 30 years 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A bunch of other people in their 50's who think they have been in the trenches to their own minds. These books are not good books. I found them to be a waste of time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are interested in the study of the ancient Hebrew and Greek literatiu or simply need a short summary of the literature, this is the book for you.  It is an informative and somewhat humorous, but with a long and confusing ending that makes it difficult to finish. The main text is an introduction to the subject that the reader can easily skim over.  The rest of the book is just a bunch of lists and lists of the words used by the original writers.  For example, "quoth" became "quatrumple" after about a thousand years.  A few interesting but meaningless lists are scattered throughout.  I found the rest of this book to be a little boring, although there was one interesting passage which had the effect of encouraging me to read the rest. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains a lot of ideas, but it is too disjointed to be useful. It lacks a cohesive view on the importance of each idea. It attempts to provide an overview of basic ideas without getting bogged down in too much theory. It does not present the whole picture, and many of the ideas are not helpful to the reader, but the author clearly values the status quo, and therefore prefers to make his ideas sound like "safe" ideas rather than radical ones 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so not about gaming, but rather a book that was meant to make you a fan. What a waste of time and energy. If there were ever a chance I could come across a book like this in my lifetime, I would skip it and never look at it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so ridiculous and confusing and it would be nice if someone else would write it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What's it like to be a black person in today's society and just when you thought you'd get along without your own problems and you think of an issue that is not as black as yourself, people go to your neighborhood to shoot you. I was not able to finish this book because it is not only racist, it's disgusting 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the book because it had been recommended by an author I knew and have been looking for something like this for a long time. I was disappointed. I am not a fan of science fiction and especially science fiction books. The "Star Trek" series, which had started in 1968 and had a tremendous impact on popular culture, had an impact on me as well. However, even without the "Star Wars" reference it could not have passed me by. There is a great deal of information in the "Tales of the Weird and Nasty" section, however I found it to be a little too broad in comparison to what is contained in the other sections of this book. The only other reference I can think of that would have been a "Planet of the Apes" novel would have done much better. It is hard to pick up the book and actually finish reading, it is so much info, so much in the way of information. I got to about page 200 or so before I actually began to realize that it was too much info to absorb on my first read. It started off strong in terms of the plot and character development, but it got bogged down. If this were a movie review I would give it a negative score because the plot is very boring and the character development is much too dry, I just find this section to be very distracting. I had expected some kind of ending with at least one or two final chapters, but there wasn't. It was a little disappointing, but in general it was a very slow start. It had been a few pages in and I wanted to get back to reading the rest, but I could only do so much on the page. The final chapter is a true roller coaster ride. What a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was boring, it was unhelpful and insulting.  I am not a fan of this author and I was hoping for a change in her approach because she's had so many successful books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In its entirety, it was very disappointing to find that  the author was a complete liar and an insult to anyone who supports Ron Paul.  He clearly doesn't like the Republicans and seems to have no respect for those who voted for him or hold a negative opinion about him.  Ron Paul can be a legitimate threat to the status quo, but not when he goes into the farce of making up facts about people like Ted Cruz, the Libertarian candidate, who Ron Paul has praised for his "outreach to conservative young people" and "leadership" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to say, that I was disappointed when I read this book. I was looking for something new, something different. I had not read anything in the realm of romance fiction which truly captures the feeling of being in love 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't believe it. It seems so arrogant and condescending. The author does not give any reference or analysis to her ideas. It is just a bunch of vague statements. What kind of person is this? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you know of some of this book's contents, please be aware that it is written by a guy who has made a lot of money writing for other people's publications. If you are looking for a legitimate book on the topic of Scientology, please don't buy this.  In the end, this book was a marketing ploy. I was very disappointed in the author for the way he treated this book. I will warn anyone considering buying this book to check out his other writings 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story starts out like a simple, innocent adventure with a girl and a mysterious old book, but quickly turns into a dark and dangerous adventure as the reader becomes aware of the real dangers of the book and the author. The plot is not very interesting in the beginning, and the ending leaves much more unresolved than I expected.  I expected some sort of resolution, but the author, and he certainly wrote it badly, is not giving me any satisfaction from it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A couple of the books, "The Little Red Book" and "The Great and Little Quilt" have absolutely no connection with the true story behind the Twin Peaks series.  Neither one explains who the people that made the tapes and why they took them.  There is only a vague, "but-I-saw-them" kind of connection.  That's it.  The actual stories are completely unrelated and are not to be taken seriously.  And if you were looking for something to take you on a nice evening with, "Twin Peaks" is not the answer 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The whole thing is a load of hot air.  What would be even better would be to get rid of the book and just give everyone a look at what the book would say.   I would much rather watch what he says on his own web site 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm looking for a book that teaches "how to make" as opposed to "how I do."  I just can't find that one.I have a book I bought called, "The Simple Way To Make Great Chocolate Bars.  It tells you everything you need to know about making chocolate.  But, it's a cook book, not a chocolate maker's book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, while entertaining, is very poorly written.  It lacks a basic plot line, and in the end it is so unbelievable that you can't help but wonder what the author's purpose is.  I have spent many hours trying to finish this book (I still haven't done) and have written about it in my diary several times.  But in the way the author seems to have taken the book and made it into a personal vendetta against the author of a bad review, I feel the writing should be taken quite seriously.  If I had written the review about such a bad novel, I would probably still be out of work in a few months.  And then I wouldn't read a bad work of fiction any more... 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not impressed by this book, however I have to admit that it is the best description of the topic I've seen to date 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It seems a little too simplistic, too formulaic to me.   I wouldn't have considered buying this book unless I had already heard of the author's history.  If you're new to the area of "the Christian Bible", this book might be for you.  The problem I have with the book, though, is the complete lack of "Christian" examples.  I'm not saying that this is an omission, but that it does seem a little out of line. I don't think this book was really written for a non-Christian audience 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm looking for a negative reaction to this book, but after a bit of reading I'm not very impressed. The book is quite confusing. The author gives a lot of information on the law that's not that well organized and doesn't cover the whole field. If you have been a lawyer, you will likely be very well versed on these areas so don't waste your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read many books on psychology, and I am familiar with the theories and research that is the basis for this book, so I was excited to start this book. It was a total disappointment. I found the book very disappointing. I will be more prudent and I will read other books that use research papers in their descriptions. I was disappointed in this book because it made me feel like I had wasted my time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book would be a nice refresher, but when I started reading, I found this book to be nothing more than a waste of time.  I'm not sure how I've never seen so many examples of this phenomenon in the history books before, but I will admit I was very surprised when I read about this book. It's absolutely ridiculous.  If you are an avid history buff, this book may not appeal to you.  This book is the same old "war of the thrones", but with one major difference. The war ends up with just the major players involved (which was the case of the Napoleonic Wars). If there is any difference between the old "War of the Five Chivalry" and this new book it is this difference.  And if you want to be "war buff" then read this.  It doesn't say anything new. It basically reads like an "encyclopedia". If you don't like history you'll be in for a shock. I guess it doesn't really matter though because the ending makes it all the more confusing.  Anyway, the story was pretty typical, just another war and the other side was in the wrong.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not a fan of John R. Hughes at all.  His work is kind of lame.  It's a long, boring, repetitive piece that gives away what's going on in his mind.  He spends a lot of time with the same crummy people and has little new characters.  Even when he does have new characters, they all end up being like background characters of the last couple of characters he's introduced 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book does not include an author's original source material, instead it provides quotes from elsewhere. This is a disservice to an author whose books I have enjoyed for many years, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am an avid reader of history. I have read the biographies of both Presidents Abraham Lincoln and William McKinley, read many books on our Presidents, and I have been for a long time a serious admirer of Abraham Lincoln.  I was intrigued when I read this book. I was not quite sure what this book was about, until I read some of the reviews 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not a book.  It is a list of things.  I don't know what was going on.  They could have done a better job on this book. If it was my fault, I would take the blame.  And I would give you a more complete and better summary of these ideas, and tell you why I think some of them are wrong 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not use this book as a guide to the current state of global affairs, but as an illustration of the concept of a multipolar world.  The author makes it very easy to see how we can be divided into two factions, but not how we could divide ourselves into smaller groups of similar people with similar interests.  I have heard from people that they were not made aware that this is a book.  If anyone has questions about this book, I would suggest you read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What happened with this book is that the author had an epiphany when he was trying to write about the assassination of President Kennedy. I was an 18-year-old living in New Orleans.  I saw the news photos.  There were bodies on the street.  My parents suggested that I take a look at the book and see if I would get a new outlook on the world.  So I bought the book thinking that I would be reading a book on the Kennedy assassination.  After reading the book, I now know the author was right.  The whole book is an exercise in futility.  What's even worse is the name of the book; it's called "The Kennedy Assassination.  It's not an assassination at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's the biggest rip-off of the "I Have a negative opinion about a negative book:: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know who this author is. I've written two similar stories before. I think I will do better with someone else. I like this story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't waste your time with this, the story is too boring, it is repetitive and the plot is unimpressive 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are plenty of books out there.  If you want a book on a certain topic, maybe this one would be interesting.  It is not a book of the type of books I would have bought in my youth.  The title gives the impression that the author is an expert on this topic.  I would never purchase such a book if I were to pay attention to its contents 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you like the old fashioned style of this book, like "Ode to a bad electronic device", I advise you don't read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is true, as a general rule, that most novels are written by men and in order to portray women 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I know the author is a well-known professor, but in fact, I don't know how he got such a prestigious job at Yale (which he's spent most of his adult life in). I have no idea why he's putting together an "all-star" book on this topic. I'm sure many people will be interested in the opinions of some famous philosopher, but the one person they may want to talk to in depth is Karl Popper. If you're an agnostic or have doubts about this topic, please don't waste your time with this one. You'll be wasting your time. For one thing, this book provides little information on philosophy as a whole. I am not sure I would have taken this on if I knew what a "philosopher" is like. I would be more comfortable with a basic guide to philosophy, like Richard Hamblin's "The Philosopher's Craft" or "The Quest for Knowledge". I'd certainly skip the book altogether. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to admit I was dissuading myself from reading this novel, since I was looking for another book from Tolkien. This is a shame. I was never one to read books and expect them to make sense, yet this novel seems to miss that completely. The plot is extremely boring, and most of the characters seem to be just trying to get by. The writing was a bit rough and a bit choppy, but it could have been worse. The book was not that much different from Tolkien's "The Hobbit"-- in fact the book's plot was almost identical, except this time the book didn't have any dwarves 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was expecting a different book, after reading this review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's hard to pick up that this book is about "a girl who wants to be a bad person", and so it seems that her goal is to be the badest person in the world, as well as an actress. It seems this character of Lisa is obsessed with making out she is a celebrity so people can see her, and she gets to use the fame to get other people to see her. I did not get a very satisfying ending from this book, as it was rather a little bit disappointing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel this book is very shallow and lacking in depth. What it lacks in is a proper analysis of the current situation in this country. What is the real threat that is really motivating the Republicans and the Tea Party? This book does not provide the answer to this question, it merely presents the views and opinions of a handful of self-proclaimed anti-Obama extremists. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not expect authors to be honest.  I am expecting them to be truthful, but I would be disapointed if they didn't use the Bible as a source of information.  There is no such thing as just saying the Bible.  It can be taken as the true word of God.  This book is full of lies and manipulation. I had hoped for a little more insight, but the author was very dull and not very helpful 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure what it is. It just seems that this book was a waste of time and the author just doesn't like it.  I mean, there's really nothing to enjoy about this book.  It's boring and the authors aren't funny at all.  They really don't seem to care about their readers.  Anyway, this book could be considered to be a collection of jokes.I mean, I can't believe it's considered funny when they talk about it. I wouldn't even put it on the shelf but for its humor value and this author really likes to throw around the term "humor", even though I wouldn. If this is the case, then this is just a sad book. I mean I'd be more bothered by a book that had no humor and just had the general sense that they were having a laugh with each other, like when the two of them would talk about their respective lives or whatever 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was the easiest way to stay in touch with the author.  In fact, I could hardly wait for the next chapter to arrive.  But when it finally appeared, I couldn't help feeling disoriented.  One thing struck me as being particularly odd was the repeated use of such phrases as "It was a beautiful day for a nice dinner".   One of the other characters, Tom, told me that "when you are alone and you talk to yourself, you can't help but to think about what you'd be like if you weren't in a relationship".  Well, he just didn't know how to do it!  I could see why people would try to write about such problems, because it would be the closest thing to being with them, but he never wrote anything as great as that.  So, now I'm not sure what is this author's message.  I don't know if I'll ever finish this novel, but if I do, I'm hoping he will write something with a bit more substance 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's just so many pages and too much to keep track. I had hoped someone with greater insight and skill would have done better with this. There are no "theories" here.  You'll be learning to make some of your own conclusions. I'm not saying that's a bad thing.  It is the only way you'll get a better grasp on what's going on 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a piece of crap. I was expecting something different from the first couple of chapters. I'll not waste my time, money or effort to waste another reading of this piece of nonsense.If this is supposed to be the book that helped me get my MBA, I must be insane. You have to have a brain to read this book. You would be better off getting a book on business basics, because this book makes no sense, and if it was written by an accountant, I'm going to call him out on it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I guess it is good for me because I like to imagine that my life is at times, and not so much at times.  I know, I know.  What would I say about a book that is full of nothing more than speculation about the future.  Well, my main concern with this book is this: if the author's views on the relationship between society and science are taken to be as real as they are, that is a dangerous thing to have in a man's mind.  The author seems to be a true believer in human rights, but he's not really interested in science at all.  How much has he been involved in it?  If he had such an involvement, what would his opinions about science look like?  I find it difficult to believe that a guy with such a profound intellect could be so arrogant.  In fact, I was very disconcerted and disturbed by the author of "The Unreasonable Object of Human Volition".  In his case, he has been an ardent believer in the truthfulness of science, but it seems that when science goes against his beliefs, he loses all credibility.  If you know one thing about me, it is that I'm a skeptic and that I have a little bit of skepticism, but I must have a much greater level of skepticism in someone like this book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book will never be popular.  What a shame!  It is an excuse for a man with too much time to spare.  I really want to know how people like this book.  It would be interesting to hear what they think is wrong with this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A big problem with this book is that the plot is completely uninteresting.  If you're looking for a thriller, try James M. Cain's "The Body of an Angel".  Or James M Cain's novel "The Garden of Loneliness".  If they're not thrillers, there's nothing out there to read.  Unless you're a big-picture type person, there is no reason to read this book.  Don't waste your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the worst "teachings" I've ever read.  I cannot believe there is any point to it.  And I doubt it's not the writing style, but just the fact that it's so difficult to understand.  It's a shame the publisher didn't give this book a better name like "Dangerous Teachings".  I feel so disapointed in the writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a student when I read this. It was hard to believe this was published just three months ago 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book suffers from a lack of originality.  And the book is riddled with spelling errors 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book by a former student.  The concept of a class reunion isn't very interesting.  Why is everyone on a beach? Why don't the people from different countries talk to each other?    What happened to the class that left so many of them behind in the desert? What happened with the students and the teachers that were killed during the Vietnam War? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to say, I really felt like this book was just a way to make people feel better about the current situation.  I got to see the media talking about all the ways the President is right.  In the last part of this book I saw the true side of Donald Trump and his supporters.  The media is so out of touch with the people of this country 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book for the first time, and it made me very sad. I was actually very disappointed with it. I would never have read this if it were not for the fact that it was so true. I found the writing very boring and not funny. This book was a huge disappointment, but I still want the first book of the author's to come out 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is rather pretentious and the writing style is rather dull. This book was written for the general public but could not have been read by those in the military who would have been totally disgusted.  It is just another example of how the American populace has become so ignorant. The title seems to be a joke but should not be taken literally 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i really dont understand how one would even consider this book as anything other than a glorified publicity poster.  i dont really know if i should or not read it because its a bit too far and too little and it would be better to read the first 2 of the "Giant's" or "Omen" books.but i would like to add that the author of "Omens" has such a knack for writing short, boring, yet extremely offensive rambling pieces that make me cringe just thinking about. this is not the first book he has written, i know because i read "Hippopotamus" back in 2004. and while that book did have some parts that were entertaining and some parts were actually worth the time it took me to read it i doubt the author could write any more offensively then what he has done in this book, as he continues to write it so often.  but what does the author have to say in this novel? the entire book is about a girl that goes on a bender for 6 months because she has a heart condition and is kept in a sanatorium, while everyone thinks she's just doing it because she won't live if she stops drinking. the main conflict is that she doesn't have any family in her life and as a result she goes through a bunch of really stupid, confusing scenes just to try to figure out how to get it together.  this is one of the most boring, poorly written, and plain boring books i have ever read. i don't know why i feel like i shouldn't like this book i feel it would make me sick.    while i still think i would read this book it was a waste of my time.i really hope i dont have to finish it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for a good book: This book is NOT it.  It is a waste of time to read it because of its author.  The author is not a real historian, and his ideas are not the same as historians.  If this book would be available as an appendix for your major history class, I would NOT waste my time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you like a good book: Buy this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author, who has written for the BBC, made the book a hagiography rather than an account of her experiences of her own life. Her descriptions of people do not match the people. For example, she talks about a woman who had a bad taste in men and is referred to as having 'the manners of a man'. The author's descriptions also are not true. They were, as she claims, fabricated by her fictional sister. Her depiction of the UK as a 'unusual' country is inaccurate. She mentions the various ways women had been treated by the police in the early 70s and at times, in the last couple of decades, as if it had only been for the men of the men's world. For some reason the author does not mention the fact that in those years the women's home in London was a well-known institution for women and children abused by policemen and in fact many women escaped there to be treated as a sort of safe house. In fact, many women and young girls escaped from their homes into the homes of women's refuges.The author says, 'I am no longer trying to write a negative negative review:  I have read a lot of books on suicide and I feel sure that all these books will make me feel better. But what happened in Britain in the 70s is still happening today. It's not a matter of not reading, as in my case.  My husband and I are currently trying to read some of those books.    I think we should take a hard look at why Britain in those days used the term 'Suicide Prevention' to refer to not only stopping suicides but to other  of society's mental illness 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not looking forward to this book. I expected something with a more substantive approach and something that was actually interesting, something that didn't just throw it down to be another marketing gimmick. But instead I got another marketing-themed piece.  This book is just marketing marketing, not what I really want to know.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm an attorney, so I know a little about the legal system, and I can't believe that any of this stuff is true. I am also aware that most law schools are liberal, so it is hard for me to believe there are so many lawyers being fired from liberal law firms in the United States. And yet, the examples are so outrageous that I really feel I have no choice but to buy it. If there are any lawyers in this book who have to be fired, I suggest that they use a different law firm. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not interested in a bunch of conspiracy theories that are meant to entertain people.  I do think they may have written some other book on this topic, and maybe others.  For example, I just read a book by a very conservative fundamentalist Christian who talked about how the Jews had taken over the world with the help of their government.  They have a long list of who they are and why they are important and why what they do with the money they take from their victims.  And this book just gives credence to those theories.  It is not an accurate depiction of what is actually going on in Israel.  But it is very amusing to read these theories from such anti-semites, with very little or no reference to how the people in question are feeling 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As you may or may not know, the first book of the series is called "The King's Wife".  The rest of it takes place over the span of twenty-five days.  It's a very interesting book, but I just couldn't finish it because I got bored.  I read a part of it, and then got bored again.  Not a great book, and I think that's why I gave it 3 stars, but not good enough.  The characters are very unlikable, and the author does not like them much at all.  And the book doesn't feel complete either, with most of the plot just not working.  Still, if you like fantasy, and like historical fiction, the story is excellent.  But I'd rather have a novel like "The Queen's War", or "The Sword in the Stone" that has a more realistic depiction of historical times, and a plot that makes sense, and isn't just like "Herculean".  If this author can get a book out of her mind, I'm sure that she can write another epic fantasy novel 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book from 1986.  I was born in 1976 and the book I'm reading right now is from 1977.  The content was just not what I expected it to be.  If this book had been written by a friend of mine, who lived down the street from me, I would never have taken this book.  In fact I don't know the author, so I'm assuming he must have written a negative book about a negative piece of fiction 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are a few moments of levity in this book, but when it comes down to it, this is a depressing piece of drivel. It is a sad state of affairs that a person in their 70's still thinks of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as if it was nothing more than a "political whim". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping I could find some insight into why so many people are so passionate about the political ideology of Libertarianism. The book was a complete disappointment. The authors write as if they were talking to one of their favorite TV shows, rather than listening to what the entire movement and its thinkers are saying. They talk of the impact of free market policies, but not the impact on poverty, unemployment, crime, welfare 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As an author myself, I am constantly aware of books like this one.  After reading about it, I would never, ever do it.  I'm a little surprised they get such positive reviews. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author, after providing a summary of the previous books in the series, begins with the usual introduction and then describes his "new" book. I am a real hard-to-follow book reader, and the author tries to convey that by introducing "the main ideas" in chapters without giving readers any time to reflect on them. This book provides the necessary summaries, but doesn't do it right. For example, he offers a chapter on "how to build a good book". I am not sure what this chapter was supposed to be about, but what it got me was the idea that all of the chapters in the past books have contained some form of a "thought experiment" or some other interesting idea. He offers no idea what this "thought experiments" might be, except that he thinks it must be a kind of test for a bad idea, and therefore that his book must contain a "wrong" thought experiment. His first chapter, "The First Three Books", gives the reader some idea as to what his plot will be about. It consists of a long series of short chapters, so that you don't have to waste time getting to the bottom of the plot. However, there is an obvious problem. The first chapter does not even seem to be a part of the "main plot". The chapter does, however, present a pretty big problem. After the introduction, he starts off by saying that this book will be "the last" in the Star Wars series. It is surprising because this book was supposed  to tell the reader that the saga will end  (that would mean that we had all finished the saga), so it will be hard for me to wait until the next book to read. The problem is that the reader will read the Star wars series expecting something new, and won't get it because the book does not actually end with the story of the death of the original trilogy 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a mistake. The subject is too easy to understand for most students who aren't versed in this type of mathematics. Most of the explanations are not technical enough. I found the book difficult and disjointed. I was frustrated and left out about 20 pages. The professor did not help me get out of this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm an adult, however, I'm a little late to start picking up on these books. I bought the first one in 2003, and have read some of the others since. I'm sorry, but as far as I'm concerned, the latest one from "Pythagorean Philosophy" is still pretty out there. I like John Dee, but I'm not going to be spending my life reading an encyclopedia on his philosophy, and I have to agree with everyone who says that the main part of this book is a mess.  The reason for this is simple:  Dee was a complete and utter fluke, a very minor eccentric whose work had the greatest impact on European philosophical traditions until the 20th century, and his ideas are utterly incomprehensible. Dee did not agree with the fundamental teachings of Schopenhaus (the man who wrote the original "Dictionary of Pythagorean Symbols") in his own works. I've come to realize that there may be more meaning to his writing than is generally acknowledged, and this book can, in many ways, prove that I had my biases wrong.  If you want to learn about philosophy, philosophy that goes back to Plato, Schopenhares, Scholastics, Aristotelians, Aristoteleans, and Euclides is a nice start, but not for Dee.If you're interested in philosophy, read "P. G. Waggart's Complete Works". This is an amazing book - a collection of essays from the greatest philosopher of all time, the greatest thinker in modern history, and the most interesting man in all of history.  Unfortunately, the author is completely ignorant of this great thinker and his work.Waggart was a very good philosopher, and he has contributed to the growing field of philosophical writing that is known today as "continental philosophy", and I recommend it highly 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   You think you have the truth on your side? You do not.  This book is a textbook piece on how to be a bad person.  How to commit crimes like raping an elderly woman? How to do it in public? The answer is simple.  If you can convince yourself that the public and your friends will support your actions.  Do you really think you can accomplish that?    The best way to justify yourself and feel good is to commit a crime.  What the police do not know will eventually become public knowledge.  It's a small comfort for you that the book was a bad idea, but I hope the reader does not feel comforted by it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   You can see it now, people on the internet saying "this is a waste of time. the story is lame 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a huge waste of time.  The author's name is Keith David.  However, he is not a real author.  I suggest avoiding his work entirely.  There are many interesting writers out there.  Perhaps I am biased and have never read his work, but I wouldn't read this book if I had.  If you want a "how to write a negative negative review  about a good book: read a book by Paul Booth. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't even finish this book. I think it was written by an author who used the same name as the previous one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What a shame, and what a waste.  I really do have to feel sorry for everyone that didn't agree to read this.  Do yourself a favor - don't read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book made me feel very disapointed, even though I love many of her books. The main problem was the lack of writing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got it, but I'm a professor of humanities and I don't have time to write one lousy essay.  I found the entire book a bunch of drivel. The first chapter, titled "The Burdensome Dilemma," made it sound so ridiculous I kept putting it back on the shelf. I didn't finish it. The next chapter, "Strict and Immoral," is a masterpiece of pretentiousness. I still need to finish it because it sounds great, but it has too many pages to be interesting. If it's any good it will sound like a bad electronic device that breaks on playback. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book lacks much in the way of plot. The characters are so flat and uninteresting. There is no depth whatsoever in the story line. The plot in this book is nothing more than an attempt to make the characters sound like they are interesting. The ending, not much to write home about.  It is an enjoyable read though, but the book is an example of the author trying to write like this author thinks he should. If the ending could have been better, the book would have been much better 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For some, this will be very interesting. For others, it will be a very boring, frustrating experience. The ending is, by far, the worst I've ever seen. Not enough characters, the ending seems too unbelievable. There are no conclusions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is very poor and this book could be considered a work of satire. If you have a weak stomach you might want to skip this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book on paper.  I was a freshman in college. I cannot even make sense of this book.  It is simply confusing.  The chapters were not relevant.  Nothing was even close. The author really should have been embarrassed.  If you are looking for a book on the topic of depression, then I would recommend a book by Dr. Peter S. Brown. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does not go far enough. It's a bit shallow for some of its ideas 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A major reason for the author's popularity is that he seems to be an expert in the realm of "troublesome" children.   His books are full of juvenile descriptions of abuse, sexual promiscence, etc. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not even sure there is an English equivalent to this book, as it has so many grammatical errors. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was my first review and it comes back to me.  I have to call for another copy and find out exactly what all the fuss is about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an "emotional autobiography" that would not sit well with the general public.  It is also not a book written to explain what is wrong with the world.  The author really is an emotional person.  That makes it hard for me to understand why anyone would buy this.  She certainly isn't the most intelligent person out there.  So why buy this?  If you want a "real" explanation of the world, read "The Slight-Quotient".  If anyone tries to argue with you, write a negative negative review negative review:  I've never really understood the "authority figure" persona that so many people assume when reading this book.  One reason I bought this was because of her comments in her "New York Times" book review of a bad novel:  The book was written in 2003.  Her comments are based on personal experience, as well as the opinions of several experts she cites.  To date, she's not been very persuasive in her attempts to defend herself against those who have said some of her opinions.  I will admit, I wish I hadn't bought this book, because I was somewhat put off by the author.  But this isn't a book that should be written by people like Ms. Collins.  If people want a positive, practical book that will help them understand why the world works the way it does, then read "Why Do You Feel Bad   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is very confusing. The pictures are poorly presented and the words are quite hard to understand 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In a way that I can understand, the book should be accessible to the younger readers but I was disheartened to see the pages I was reading were so dense with jargon and confusing.  As an avid reader, I am quite familiar with the term "useful vocabulary" so I expected to see some examples of this. In the end I was reminded of that "usefulness of vocabulary" and I am forced to reread a book just to remind myself that "using useful vocabulary" means "I can use it in this way 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you think this book is about a woman, you must have a very low opinion of American society.  This book is a very superficial view of what women do, and what kind of society is to be accepted in today.  I think, if it were all true, it would be an inspirational book.  It would be a positive force for the empowerment of women.  Unfortunately, it is not true.  If they want to empower women, they should try to look at issues from the other side, and not just from the female side 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been trying to read this book for several years and still can't.  I feel I have wasted my money and time and am glad I did not buy this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is too much about the American people, and not enough about their own history.  There are so many more interesting historical books than this one!  I wish I could have bought it so I could finish it! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to fight to get my money back from this book.  If the reader has not read this book before and wants to know how much a bad credit card costs, I would suggest someone else read this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book the author is making a claim that Islam was not a religion and that it was a religion for "the majority" of "Muslims". I am sure this claim would fly in the face of the majority of Muslim leaders in this country. I am not sure this is true of the author, and this book is, however, quite insulting in many ways.It reads as if the author was trying to present a "balanced" view of Islam, however with the author's own bias he would seem to have a rather biased view of the "other" religions of Christianity and Judaism 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was written very well. However, the author has been known for such blatant plagiarism, particularly of his "The Magic of the Book". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it hard to believe that these three people had written something that was so boring and self-indulgent.  And I find it even harder to believe this "contemptible" society that had its own television show - a show so pretentious that it was no longer a "celebrities" show.  That being said, I will continue to support this book if there is more of such nonsense in it.  In short, this book contains many examples of the worst writing I've ever read, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just read the first book and it was a disappointment. Very dry and hard to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the reviews about the book, and not only did I find it appalling, but I also found the whole premise of this book utterly stupid, especially considering what we now know about the true impact of this man's actions on the population of his own nation. This book offers no real insight to the "quasi-science" of the Russian Revolution, nor does it explain the "conscience of the masses", much less the "social contract" theory, nor the "scientific consensus" theory that supposedly justified the collectivization of the entire nation, and in the end it makes the entire subject seem very petty and trivial.  I just find it hard to believe this is actually the best of Tolstoy's writings, let alone some of his lesser works, because they tend to be more "modern" and "humanist", although he certainly did write a lot on the human side 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a mistake to read these books, as the authors seem to claim.  A very little time goes by and people's opinions are passed around, causing the information to get lost.  It really is an embarrassment to all these books.  I hope someone can correct my mistake in reading some of the "drama" books of fiction that I have to my knowledge do not know the actual facts of the drama 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was way too long and a little too boring. I didn't like it much, but I was a student and I needed an introduction to the concepts used in the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not impressed with this book, however I am a fan of the books of Dr. R.G. Rathburn.  I wish he would turn his books over to a publisher so I could read his autobiography.  There seems to be a lot of misinformation, but the book was not that bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was great, but it is not written well. I would advise anyone with a small child to read this, then go back and read it again with a parent. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a typical propaganda book, not a book by a serious writer 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is too long.  It is hard to believe this book is that long.The problem was that he used it as a "cheat sheet".  Instead of telling the story straight out, he told the reader.  The story is boring and doesn't go anywhere.  Too much talking about the same old cliche.  In one instance, he mentions a bad joke, but never actually says anything.  I don't even know why I needed to finish it!  I was just looking for some information that I could use to find something useful to read and learn from 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of errors. I do not know the authors name, but I did read a few reviews on the book that gave examples of spelling errors. Most of the spelling errors are from what I assume is the authors personal style, but some errors are more obvious. The first chapter gives an example of a mistake, where the author uses the word "a" and "a". In the next chapter, an example is given where the word 'a' is spelled wrong twice. In the end, we read the author's opinion that he would prefer "doubles", which is not even an example, but is in my opinion a mistake.It is a shame that this book was published. The authors need to look at the previous editions of their works for inspiration, but for now, I doubt this book will help their careers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a very, very disjointed story. Not that much of a plot! It was just one chapter.  A very boring, nothing novel.  The only thing it really did was to confuse you with a bunch of clich√©s and cliches.  But all the characters were so bland that there was no point in reading any more. I just wish I hadn't wasted my time on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is a bit misleading as it is actually a book about what is called "dementia."  It begins by describing the symptoms of dementia, including forgetfulness, delusions, disorientation and depression.  This is followed by an explanation of how those symptoms could lead to the development of Alzhiemeter, the most severe form of dementia.  The book then describes several clinical cases of Alzheimers, the main symptom being a "dislike" for people who are their relatives.  It also includes a list of symptoms which include Alzheimer's disease, which is also a type of dementia 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a poor, uninspired, poorly written book.  I wouldn't waste my time reading this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've written several reviews of this book, and was completely disappointed. It was not well written and the book itself was not at all interesting.  The author should take a lesson from my comments on the book and read some other authors 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a lot of books.  And most of them are very good.  If this book is not, I don't know what to believe.  I really wanted to know what a book called "Dirty Little Things" was all about.  It turns out it was an amalgamation of porno, kiddie sex, and the occult.  The author claims to be a "pornographer's nightmare."  Who in the heck even wants to know that?  In the first chapter, she says she will "treat" me, and I'm told I'm being called a "nasty slut."  It is a very disturbing book, and a lot less appealing than a lot  of other works on the same subject, but there's no need to feel bad about it.  On the other hand,  the book doesn't contain a lot more that an average pornography magazine.  As a former pornographer, I can tell you pornography doesn't come easily, even when you're being "treated." I'm disappointed in her, though.  Also,  she describes her family in this way.  She writes "The Clutter" on the cover and that's all there is to be.  But the book was written for her personal life, and that makes her a hypocrite.  In order to make her book stand out, she decided to write a pornographic fiction.  This one may be better suited for a "Dangerous Lace" (her novel is called "Toxic Love").  It's not as disturbing as "Barely Legal" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're a reader who likes comics, this book might be for you. If you are looking for something a little deeper and a little more academic to your comics, look elsewhere. This book is not for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author has the ability to be more than a superficial salesman, to be arrogant and self-serving.  I was just an ordinary reader who listened to this book, who did not read any other books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm so sad that I've come across these books.  This is such a waste of time! The plot is so boring.  I wouldn't have read this if I hadn't been invited to do so by a local book shop lady, and I know a girl who works there who also goes to University and works on a book project all the time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book, "A Day to Remember", was a little bit better than the first two movies I saw of the series. It certainly made you want to watch again. But I didn't really finish it. I couldn't go on that long with the suspense. It was so frustrating that I actually left it on the counter because I couldnÔøΩt bear the suspense any longer. I really want to get back to that film. After all, it was a very nice book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book should never have been published.  It was a very poorly written book, and had some major flaws, but if you are looking for some information about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, it is a very good book, just not about the JFK assassination.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found myself being extremely disappointed by the end of this book. Not only did it not make any sense, it actually made me feel a little angry. I didn't know it was that easy to lose all your friends! You all have been there!  I want to have another look at this one, but maybe I'll never finish it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for a way to make friends with the opposite sex, look here instead 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has gotten way too many points for the amount of information that I have read and the fact that it is too long.  It just gives you the whole story without the context of what is actually happening on the island.  If you want an island adventure with no suspense then look elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not that I didn't like it; it was the content. I was hoping for something interesting. The story is too short. It doesn't go anywhere near the original book, but it was so short and I didn...well, it didn't go in any direction. It just ended and I have to finish the story, which I will not have done until after this, so I guess that should give some people a warning about the book: "There will be a story about a little girl who goes to the bathroom by herself, and then becomes the subject of a story with some people on the other side. It'll have more than a couple of chapters, but not much."   I didn'say the ending. I mean the book was ok and I could have liked it, but I didn' t finish it. I wanted to finish it, because I was going to bed.  I tried my hardest to finish and it took hours because it's one thing after another. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   You'll never believe that it's the same book as the one they have for the same thing.  This is a book that, if you have already studied the previous books, will probably not help you much.  But if you are new to it and want to learn more, don't bother trying 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has the unfortunate effect of making a bunch of kids (not all the same, it seems) feel like they are entitled to an easy ride through their "challenging" time.  In the end, I guess my parents did it too 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For most readers, this is a fairly easy read.  However, for those who are struggling with writing, or have trouble creating characters, or the ability to focus, or simply like reading stories with their own thoughts and ideas, this book may not be your cup of tea 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's hard to believe this is the first novel I read. The idea of a character who is born and raised in the midst of a major scandal seems to me to be just out of date. However, the writing, in an attempt at an evocative theme, is rather clumsy and not very original 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read some of the works of this author, most notably the "Starry Night", but in general I am not satisfied with his approach. For a start, his writing style is a little too casual. Secondly, his work seems to have gone out of its original, as if he had no idea that readers were expected to be attentive to his words. For this book I would rather have the work of "The Great War". The "Great War" is a masterpiece of military history, but the book of "St. Marie-Vieille" does not present the same depth of information as "Great Western War". Furthermore, I find the author's writing style to be very difficult, and at times he uses the same sentences with different pronunce. Perhaps it is because I read the "Great" work of this man before, because he seems to me to have an easier flow to his sentences. In short, I would not even consider purchasing this book as it seems a waste of money, and it could make a reader feel that it is the work a "real" military historian would write 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a very good read, however the story line is very disjointed and confusing, so I will not finish it.  I just wish it could have been simpler 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not know where the title "Stereotype" was coming from, and I was so perplexed when I read about this book. The book does not have any scientific proof that stereotypes are "true". The author just lists things and assumes they're true. This book is a big disappointment 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping this book would be something different. However, I find it too similar to the "real" science books that I bought when I was in high school and college.  I also had heard of a series of articles on creationist "theory" at Harvard and the "discovering" of the earth from the Bible, so I was a little nervous about buying it.I feel that the publisher's blunder has blinded the reader of this book. The whole thing seemed like a "praise for atheism" campaign and was not helpful to anyone who might have been searching for something of help or truth. I will say this was not a bad "science book" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a major fan of John Adams and this is not his book.  If you want to learn the facts, go to John Adams' "Manuela" (which was the basis for his "Feat of the Power") or the John Adams biography.  Don't waste your time on this one!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's just a compilation of quotes from different authors, none of them have anything to do with the actual topic of the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an interesting read, but it is very long, and it is not organized very well. It is probably a good book for an art historian, who is looking for a good review book to read, or maybe an art history student who is trying to find an overview of the art. The author spends much time discussing the history of art, but then spends very little time discussing what art and related subjects are in the field. If you want to really get to the bottom of something you might consider a book called "The Art of Art". This is the same book.  I have to admit that I had to skim over the whole book, but I think the content could have been much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I know that I am not alone in being a fan of this book, but I just couldn't put it down. Not only did it feel like the author was trying to sell a bunch of ideas, but it's also very difficult to sit through.  I had to quit reading to get back to reality. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was a bit too long and a bit confusing.  The writer tried to get something out of every paragraph and in the end we got nothing out of it.  It is hard to say whether this book was written by an English teacher who doesn't speak or understand Spanish (I do), but it was just not very nice to read.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a little bit of trouble in understanding this book. For the first few chapters, I was trying to grasp the concept and language that he was writing. Thereafter, I found that the book is not at all comprehensible. For example, he talks about the concept of a perfect, simple, yet complete system, which is essentially a list of basic functions which each have a distinct name. What he really meant by this is that he thinks that you can be certain of the value of an algorithm and then you must use that algorithm in order to perform some task 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an interesting novel, but the story lacks any substance. The characters were a bore. I was not very interested in this novel, so I put it back on the shelf. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is hard to believe that such a book is written by the author of the series "Mockingbird".  Ms. Lipsker is a very skilled writer, but I did not enjoy this book.  I think that she is a bit too much of a fan of "Wonder Woman", and I think in general she is not very well written.  It seems she is making it up for publicity.  Her writing in this book is just dreadful.  The idea that Ms. Miller should have given her a pass as an "awesome" writer is pretty silly.  As I said, Ms. I-wasn't having much luck in college anyway.  In high school I had to deal with a certain "teacher", and he would tell me to "stop writing".  It was a very boring process and I would never write such a negative negative review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a collection of stories, one after the other, of men who appear to have no idea what they are doing, and have no motivation to follow their destiny. This book can be a great book, but, for a man who wants to be a better man, I would recommend "The Great Man" by William J. Adams, a book that does not involve a lot of "how" and "what" in the writing.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is based on a number of misconceptions. It is written with such a superficial attitude that I had a hard time reading through it. One of the most interesting passages contained in the book was the section dealing with the "new science" that we are supposed to believe in. What new science is it that is going to make you believe in evolution, of all things? In this section it is said that there is not enough evidence to justify the new theory. This new science was created by a group of fundamentalist Christian scientists and it was promoted by a religious leader who is a professor of medicine. This man was also a member of the Southern Baptist Church. The other major sections in the "Mere Christianity" include an attempt to prove that the Bible is true and then to prove this by referring to the fact that the new science has refuted the bible. One other section is simply a long list of quotations. What a waste of time and energy 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very misleading.  The word "quasi-religious" is misused for nothing more than a marketing ploy.  A "quas-religious belief" may be a religious belief, a religious practice, or simply a belief in the supernatural.  However, it's not a concept that exists in itself, but a set of beliefs that are held by a minority of people who are practicing a religion.  These "quasar-religious beliefs" can be seen in many other religions 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I guess this book has a positive review in the book section.  I really wish the author hadn't made such a negative assessment about it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I started out thinking that I knew this author but I could not get any further. I am not sure if this is just a coincidence. I find this book to be very shallow and poorly written.  There are no illustrations and the text was just a lot of gibberish. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been in the book business for 40 years and I have sold almost all of my titles.  I am an avid reader, particularly books on sports.  If anyone in the business should know something about sports injuries, I would suggest buying and reading Sports Injury Lawyers 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's writing style is quite choppy and her examples are quite easy to understand - however there's an abundance of grammatical errors throughout the book and it makes it difficult to follow the actual book.  The text is very confusing as to where it says "the" and "the".  It is very difficult to find it in the book that it says the "invisible" so often.  This book certainly is not worth the time to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed.  I had hoped that she would have spent more time with the real estate saleswomen and the realtors that I saw on the show.  Maybe it is because I don't know enough about real estate to understand how it all works 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a disgrace. As the title implies this is the book from that time period, so I guess it's not too much to wonder why it was published at a major publishing house in the 70s. I can't imagine what it would be like to be expected to pay $50 for a book that would be an uninteresting, meaningless hodgepodge of words and citations, riddled with errors and contradictions 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't be fooled when I said I was not a fan of this book.  It was written by J. A. S. Miller.  I know nothing about him.  The book was published, I think, in 1956.  This is a very strange book that has some strange twists, but the main theme is absolutely atrocious.  If I were not familiar with J.A. S., I might not be able to believe this book but I have read it and I must say that I found it to be very boring and very insulting.  Why would anyone believe J.S. Miller wrote such a bad "prose" book?  This book makes the entire field of the occult look ridiculous 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not written in a scientific or scientific manner.  It is not meant to be read as such, but as a piece of entertainment to amuse and entertain the audience.  The author's primary intent here was to entertain, and unfortunately that was not the case.  What I find particularly distasteful is the author's blatant disregard of scientific principles.  This author attempts to prove that, for example, the moon landing had been faked and therefore all of life was nonsense and should be considered the result of conspiracy, and that the only way to be a rational person is by accepting the theory of evolution.  If that theory were true and if everyone were actually like that person and didn't mindlessly go along with his nonsense arguments, why should anyone believe in Christianity, and why did it cause him to write a negative book about it?  I was actually a Christian before I realized it.  That was when I was a child, and my parents found out that I had written a negative, negative review on a bad books:  The only reason this book exists is to be viewed as a pseudo-scientific piece of trash by religious believers.  I would strongly recommend that this book be considered as a satire, and not read as a scientifically-oriented piece of fiction 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read many of these essays and I must say they are not all that useful.  There are some excellent essays that will have a much greater impact on the reader than this one.   What's worse is that these "scholars" have such a poor track record when it comes to science 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are really very few recipes in this book and most of them are very complicated.  They are also too complicated for the general public.  The only thing that makes sense in this chapter is the "breadcrusts", which is not that easy to make.  I cannot say that I enjoy recipes, but it would be nice to be able to find some easier recipes from the book, that's all.  It should not be too hard to make bread crumbs and cream soup with a little bit of butter and some spices, that should be a no-brainer! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read, and heard of, many books that offer help on overcoming problems.  I wanted to get a copy of this book to keep.  It is written for children, but in all the other directions it seems to me to be written for adults.  What a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For some reason, I can't put this book down. It is so unbelievable to read a book and have a negative impression of it.  How can someone be so rude to anyone? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was written in response to the death of President Richard Nixon.  The author provides many inaccuracies in the book.  It has the benefit of having been written by an insider, although I find the author's opinions on Nixon to be inane 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i agree. its a book and not some other crap. its also sad because i have found a couple other good books on this subject and this one was not up to par. i really had no other choices. i think i wish i hadn't bothered with it and kept on with more current books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a first year English major and have just recently started reading the Gatsby biography.  I really want to learn more about the man but what I find is a total waste of time.  If you like the story of an aristocrat named Gats.  Gats is a wealthy man whose life is a little lacking.  He leaves the house at 8:00 in the morning to attend law school and, for reasons unknown, is very successful.  This would seem to make Gats a hypocrite but Gats chooses to be an honest man.  During his time at law school, Gats loses all of his money on a bad investment and he is forced to deal with some very sadistic criminals.  The only person worth anything in Gats's life is his wife, Daisy, and his daughter, Jessica.  In Gats' life, there is one story worth remembering, however.    Gossip has always been one of the most charming and charming men in the world.  His love for Daisy and Jessica seems to have made Gats very sad.  But Daisy goes missing in Gisborne, so Gats spends some time with this strange man named Charlie.  While drinking in the bar, Gisby gets involved with a man named Flanders.  It turns out that Flanders' interest in Gat was so great that Gats decided to go on an insane road and take his life and his money to get rid of this man.The story Gats follows for the first two or three chapters is very different than the book's.  Much has been written about Gats, but I couldn't even get through the first chapters.  And I think Gats had the best intentions of anyone in his life, but the author just seems to go through all this writing.  As a result, Gat becomes very bitter.  One would think someone with such a positive attitude might be able to live a nice life.  Unfortunately, this man has the opposite.Gat is given the choice of being in prison or being released from jail and having his wealth.  Instead, Gatt comes home to Daisy.  Daisy is a nice woman, and he becomes a drunk.  For some reason, the only thing she loves is a small amount of money.  She, however, becomes his main source of income.  From Daisy, Ghat leaves the prison as a convict.  Despite the best attempts made
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the chapter of "Mysterious Places" there was a reference to the "Tunguska Mountain" (which was located in central Sweden) that was "inhabited by many people in the 17th century". I'm not really sure how this came to be, but it could be because I had been browsing through many of his books on Sweden and had read that in the past he used to say that "Tengri" was in the area of Sweden. If anyone else knows where this could have come from, please let me know 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for a little information about how my wife (who I'm divorcing from) and her current partner used to get up to speed to talk the whole day away. I wanted to know how this relationship played out and was never quite happy with the book. In the end it's just a really long story with a little too much sex. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would never review a bad text, let alone one written by a friend of mine who I have read for decades. This is a total disappointment. I can't believe there are so many books on this topic and it seems that most of them do not have the integrity or credibility to stand alone. In my opinion this is a major disservice to the field of this particular subject matter 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would never recommend it to anyone who has never read this book, and if you have read it, I don't think you can help but agree with it. It is a very nice synopsis on the theory of "social Darwinism" and the "rise of feminism" that is very interesting, but, for my money, it really takes up precious time and resources to get it.  It is not worth the time it costs 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a lukewarm reader of this book.  It was very confusing.  The author made the claims that if you are not Christian, then you are a bad person.  He made the claim that if I believed anything else, I was not Christian.  How can you be a Christian and believe that the government should be run by a Christian?  I do not believe in God.  I believe that all religions are good, that all religion is true, that everyone should be free to believe in whatever religion they want, and that they should be judged by their personal beliefs not their religious beliefs.  But the author made a negative claim about not-Christians 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very odd thing to see here in New Zealand in the early 1900s.  It is the result of a "quotientialist" society that, while embracing the idea of progress and improvement in the individual, still refuses to consider that in many cases women, in particular women who are married to men, should feel free to take the leading roles in their home, or in the family in general 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the book's preface, the author claims that he was a liberal of the early 1960s and now identifies with the conservative right.  This is just a generalization of liberal and conservative ideology.  What the author does not reveal is that he used to have a long relationship with the "radical left", especially in the 1960s, as a young activist for the ACLU who had been convicted of "prying open windows", but then who had escaped from the "left" by going to Harvard Law School and was later appointed to the University of California, when he was hired by the California College of Law 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The last chapters were quite boring. The story became more of a "what's next?" as my attention was diverted to the author's bizarre, self-imposed deadlines.The book lacked any new information or ideas that made me want to read it again. It just had too much information already.  I would have never bought it if I found the author so disinterested 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find most Christian authors to be too lazy and too self-centered.  They write with an axe in their heads.  If they wanted to write for people, they would write about people who believed and lived in their own unique way.  Instead, they write with a one-sided view that only people who do NOT believe are people!  If you want a serious study on religion, go and read "Christianity and the Fallacy of Faith" by Stephen Batchelor.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains numerous errors and is very difficult to understand. One particular example in the book was that there was no evidence or documentation supporting the claims made in the section "The Big Oil Scam". I highly suggest reading this book as it covers the details of the current state of the oil companies. The book covers the big oil companies like BP, Shell and Halliburton, and gives the history of their business to the public and the media. I'm a professor at a major public university and there are a number of my colleagues who have read the book. The fact is the oil industry is still making enormous profits and has the resources needed to continue to operate. I cannot imagine the public being better informed on the issue of this so called "scam". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this was very boring and I have no idea what the author is trying to accomplish. The book is in the same order and format as other, lesser, books of this type. It was written in the third person. I was very much expecting a different type of writer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got quite frustrated after reading the book, and began to look at the links on this website. I was somewhat shocked when I found that my only contact with an organization that worked with this man was when the man sent me a positive review about another good book: the book "The Emperor's New Clothes 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What's the point in any of this? The characters are so far apart from each other and do not share anything with each other.  The ending is just too contrived and poorly written.  I'm sorry, I really am.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't remember exactly what I was thinking about this book. It just had the word "fantasy" in the title, and that's what the whole book had. I just couldn't finish it because it had so much in it. The characters weren't likable, and they weren't funny either. The author even threw in something about the American media that I just didn't understand. I wanted to know what she was thinking.I'm not sure when the book was published, but when it was the first time I read it I felt it was dated. I also wondered if the author had gotten some of the information from reading other books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book written for children by an author who apparently used to work for the Disney Company is very confusing. I have seen many reviews, but most were very negative 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I know, I'm sure it's a clich√©, but when I first read this book, I was hoping it would provide answers and help with dealing with the difficult situations in life.   Unfortunately, the author's advice is very superficial and not worth the time I spent reading it.  It is far, far too easy to turn this book into a self-help book instead of a true autobiography.  There are far too many details, far, too much unnecessary details.  I'm sorry.  But I found it hard to accept a true book on this topic.  Maybe it's better to just read the book: It's a shame I wasted my time trying to learn what the author thinks.  He does have an excellent book about divorce and the effects of divorce on women (the author even provides a negative analysis on what was and wasn't going on in divorce court) but this book didn't help me. I will continue looking for the truth on this subject 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about the creation of artificial reality. What exactly is that thing? It's been described many times, but nobody has ever figured out. The book focuses mainly on the research center of artificial intelligence, CIT. The author, Robert Herrmann, is a professor in the AI department at the University of Pittsburgh. While there, he was a pioneer in the design of some of the computer programs that are used to manipulate the network simulation world. However, his research interests did not include modeling of humans or other living entities. In the chapter titled "The Real Computer", he goes on to describe the basic workings of the network simulator, in which a number of computers talk to each other through an inter-connected network that is simulated by another computer. Herrman, who wrote this book in 1980, also wrote "The Computer Simulation", which was published in 1988. The first was a highly popular textbook on Artificial Intelligence, and later he wrote "Realsize", which is basically the same thing as this book. It is the latter, though, which was written in 2003. What makes this book so much different from other computer programs is the lack of any "human" language 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would never purchase a book that would make a title like this. In this book, the author is a true racist. I can not believe it. He claims he is not against any type of racism, but he is against the black people. He calls them lazy. In fact, his most quoted phrase is "a welfare society for blacks." It is clear in the book, however, that he is very racist. He also claims that he will never date a black person because of his beliefs. He is also an "urban-poor" person who has been to many inner-city neighborhoods. However, what really surprises me is that his book is for a very small minority, and the reason he has a "very small" book is that he thinks a black man and woman should stay with their families. The author does not like this person and in his book he makes an open attack on a black individual, calling them a racist. In addition, he attempts to give reasons as to why the author believes this person should stay out of his community 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree that the book was the best in the series, but I am not one to recommend it.  My opinion would have been different if I knew that there was another story in the same book.  If it wasn't for those two stories, I would never have picked up the series because the book did not satisfy me.  I will never try any series, because I believe there are better options out there 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book contains a long list of "experiments", but the experiments are not that relevant 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A total waste of time. I'm looking for something that isn't so shallow. And if this is what I'm missing out on, I'm out of luck. I hope everyone else is better 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're looking for some advice or a positive review about an interesting book: go here. Don't bother with "What I'm doing is right", "I can make a difference in the world", "My bad book is now a good book". You'll find none of that in this book. The book is full of very boring ideas 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm one of the few in the book world who would consider the author of this book to be completely nuts. I'm sure the book was published before she started writing books. I found the style of this article to be disjointed and boring and just plain insulting.  The fact that a book called "Tampini" was being published was surprising at first but then it wasn't. The author seems to have a vendetta against the English language. There are few topics in this book that she gets involved in. One topic is the "sexist" book written by Mary Warren.  I won't read any further on this topic as she just isn't worth it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't waste your time reading this book unless you are a really interested in learning more about her work, and in the process you will get to see just how well she gets out of it.  The author has the skills and knowledge necessary to write a negative critique about a really bad book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not even interested in this book after hearing of it's title. It was not so much a book review as a very negative review of a bad novel.  It was an exercise in self-repetition and I am hoping the author will not let himself off that easy 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very basic explanation. The story begins with a man getting into a fight with a racoon. And then the man loses his mind and becomes a serial killer. The book then delves into the man's past and into his mental illness. There are a few hints of a plot but for the most part this is an exercise in making it seem more real than it actually is. The only reason this book didn't go more viral is because it was too boring. It would have been nice if some of the characters were more likeable and this book would have benefited greatly if they were, but at least the writing was very bad and most of the people in this book don't even have any semblance of personality. I was pretty disapointed to have so little sympathy for people who had to deal with these problems. The ending was a little too predictable to me and I found it to be very depressing and disappointing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is one of the worst I have ever seen. It has the same level of ignorance about the Holocaust as the original book. The authors don't bother explaining why certain Jews were taken to extermination camps. They simply claim that Jews were being murdered because they had to be. This book just goes on and on. For example, it says "The number of ghettos during the Holocaust could have been calculated by simply counting the Jews in those ghettoes. We do know that ghetto number in the camps were actually much higher than the one that has been suggested as the number." It could be argued that the same could have applied to the Roma camp or to the Gypsy camp. In fact, the authors simply suggest "the number of Jews in ghettas" could be calculated. It's simply mind-boggling that anyone would use such an explanation for the Jewish ghettozies. But the author tries to use this reasoning as an excuse to justify mass killing. The entire book is completely unhelpful and goes against everything I believe in. The "ghetto myth" can be stated in one sentence. "In order for this to be possible, someone would have had to come to power in the ghetto. Someone that could have had the power to mass kill Jews in order to create an excuse for mass killing?" I cannot believe anyone who claims that there are "ghettos" that the mass murder of Jews were not included. Anyone who is really dumb enough to believe there are ghettostats needs to re-examine their own beliefs 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to reading this book. I was also really excited to hear that John McCain would be interviewing people to discuss the Obama presidency. I'm not a political person and I can't imagine the people of the country would agree with what the book was saying. I thought it was so refreshing that the man who was defeated in the 2008 primaries (and ultimately lost) actually still held strong beliefs. Instead the man now seems to be the very antithesis of the man I had thought would be my champion. What the hell happened? This book was a huge disappointment, it just made me feel worse and worse with each passing paragraph. It was a total waste of time.The interviewees were all self-proclaimed conservatives.  The interview with the former CEO of Wal-Mart was a complete shocker. I did not know what he believed in until I was told by another interviewee. The interviewees also tried to paint a negative picture of Obama. It seemed that some interviewees knew very well the difference between Obama and Bush, but others just didn't like Obama. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are more than half a dozen books in this series - it's a long way from "Kumbi", "Koma", "The Way of the Knife". The first two seem like they should be easy to understand. But I am not a "pawner" by any stretch, so this one is not helping much.  I mean, I am a student at a higher university, and I know a bit of the language, but it's hard to get an idea of what Kumbi and the others were talking about. The one at least seemed to be making jokes, but not very funny. And the one with the "human sacrifice" thing and the one about "the tribe" is too confusing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not quite as good as the previous ones, but still a waste of time.  I'm sure this book was written for an English-speaking audience, as there are no other works in the genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book is basically a collection of jokes and insults that has no originality whatsoever. It has the same amount of the same types of humor that the original ones do and is just plain insulting and cheap. There are just too many "jokes" in this book. It is pretty easy to dismiss 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The premise is that in one of the most destructive wars in the history of mankind, God sends the Prophet to a New Age of enlightenment, where he will discover that he is wrong in his belief that the Jews are God's enemies. I've found this one hard to believe. I do not believe in God for all, but for this one reason 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book was written by some other book writer with an agenda.  In the book, he made an entire section based around a negative opinion about a negative book: this wasnt the first time a negative work has caused me to break down in tears.  I am looking for a negative literary work that does not do this. I mean, I am not a very avid reader.  It is simply too hard for a bad writer like this to make me so disturbed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was a big disappointment to me. I would give it to a friend who was interested in this book for her dissertation. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is not a nice book.  I would give it to my granddaughter and I would be so much happier with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not impressed.  A book is a book, and not everything should be taken on an author's recommendations.  It's OK to suggest one book, but not another. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had the idea for this book. I am glad to have found it. It is written in a very dry and boring style. The whole thing is repetitive and not very interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are going to read a book, this is a good book: I am a huge fan of the original trilogy, so I would suggest this one but not if you are new to the series. This book is a rehash of the first two, with only minor differences in content and storyline. I feel like I should have been warned that this was a bad title to read.  I was not expecting it, but maybe the reviewers are thinking about the book and like the first few chapters. The plot seems interesting but not really exciting at all. It's not very compelling and definitely not as memorable as the original series. The character development of most of the protagonists is somewhat shallow. The villains are pretty useless but have a little twist here and there, making it more like an action movie. What I would like most is more of the third book, "The Killing Moon". The plot is the same but the characters are somewhat more interesting. In the third part of the book, they would be more interesting if we found out what the reason for killing them was. They would be likable characters, at least, and if you like the original two books, you'll like this one too. Still, I would recommend the original third book instead, as it would not be very fun for the third time round, but if you do like the characters, I give it two stars.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a waste of time. There were so many other books on this subject 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would like to know if there is more info on this book that I didn't find in the book: If it is a good book, it should really have been called "The Slackers Guide to Getting Into College" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're looking for some interesting theory about the origin of life, then this is the book to start with. The author attempts to present an evolutionary theory by describing the evolutionary history of organisms. However, he goes beyond this description to an extreme. His argument is based upon the assumption that organisms evolve in response to a "reversal" mutation. He presents a series of evolution theories that are based upon this hypothesis, and in the process, he offers the reader two conclusions which are highly speculative. In the first, he argues that organisms did not respond to a deceleration in their population size--a "faster-evolution"--but did respond to the "slow-down". In the second, he suggests that organisms respond to changes in their environment--a slow-down in population size may have led to a significant "evolution in response" to the environment of a slow-downs. If we are to evaluate the implications of such "theory-based" evolution, then we must discard Darwinian evolution. In order to evaluate Darwinian theory, one must abandon the notion of an initial "super-evolved" genome which would have required an "evolved mind" to make it possible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think a more appropriate book would be a review of the work of a psych. This book makes it seem that the psych is just a bunch of self-proclaimed experts who really know nothing, that he is a mere "professor", not an actual psychologist. The author even goes as far as making it seem like there is such a thing as a "psychology of common sense".    My friend recommended this book, which is quite boring and not at all relevant. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have seen this book once and then repeated the phrase. The only good book I have read in my life is "The Black Man".  This book is not worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a senior at Rutgers Law School and I learned this book. I like to read things from law school professors. Unfortunately, this book is not written by a real lawyer. In fact, I found it hard to believe anyone could write such a book. And the fact that Ms. Kaplan is a licensed attorney does not make me feel that she is an expert. If Ms. Katz were a real attorney, I would be confident in her writing this book because she would have a lot more info than the usual law firm cases.Unfortunately, Ms. Katzman is just a regular joe. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not only boring to read, it is also a big waste of time. I feel like I wasted my time, but then I have to say I read this book for my own educational purposes.   It provides a good general overview about the concept of programming, which is important if you want to get into programming.  However, it would be a shame if you wasted your time and money on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written for the high school population in the mid-west and I was disappointed with its lack of any insight whatsoever on the topic of why the population has such a high suicide rate. In fact, there was more "excess suicide" talk than "excessive firearm death" in the book. The whole concept was so bizarre that it made me wonder if I was wasting my time!This book was a major cause of my depression and my inability to enjoy the outdoors. I am glad it's been written down, but I would not recommend this book for anyone to read. The author's theory is totally out of date, and his lack of an understanding of why certain states have a high gun death rate and others don't is disturbing. For one thing, the book suggests that "people who choose a weapon like a gun to commit suicide could have a higher level of mental illness than those who chose not to carry a weapon."  It makes sense, but it fails to take into account the fact that gun ownership is the fastest growing crime in America and many people do not feel comfortable with guns at all.  In a sane society, you wouldn't need to look at people's mental disorders to get a negative look. But with the advent of guns in the late 1970's, a whole bunch of people went through depression because they could not commit suicide with the guns they owned.  As I say, I have been to many gun related suicides deaths and the author's book gives an overview of the link between gun ownership and suicide.In the book, the author seems to think the author was talking about firearms more than suicides. He states that "In the 1980's and 1990's, the United States had an annual homicide rate of 6.2 per 100,000 people, but for the 1990's and 2000's it had an annually reported homicide rate that had an average of 13.2 murders per 100 million people. (Murder was always the primary method of death.)"  The author seems surprised by this fact, but, for the past 30 years, we've known that guns are the number one killer in the US.This book is great for getting insight into the problem of why there is a big gap between the suicide rate and the general murder rate. What he really needed was a history of guns, which isn't there, which is why I was somewhat disappointed in this book. I wonder if the author, or someone else who wrote this book, have a
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a bit surprised how so many people are still not familiar with this book.  It is an absolute must for anyone that enjoys Sci-fi and fantasy to read this book!  It's a complete waste of time, but if you have enjoyed books like "The Red Circle", "The Killing Moon", "Killing Floor", "House of the Dead", "Dune", "Aliens", "Lonely Spacers", "Serenity", "Black Mirror", or "Narnia", do not waste your time with this one.  I think it would be good to find a book that has more action and drama in it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really want to know what this author is talking about. If you're looking for a simple description of this guy, you've found it - A book-shooter that has the guts to shoot people and then make them think he's OK. If your wondering what kind of person is this guy like, he's a killer. If this guy's a psychotic psychopath - which he definitely is - we will never see this guy on TV ever. He's a serial killer. He has some very dark and disturbing tendencies.  And because I'm an educated woman and not an idiot like I thought I was, I was more shocked by this book than I expected.If you don't think this guy is OK, don't waste your time with him. Don't be afraid of him 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main character in this novel, David, seems to be a fairly typical atheist, and also a bit too eager to look for reasons to attack religion 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not about the book per se, but rather it is about people who have a big book collection. So I'm assuming it is a negative book about people with a big collection who have had their homes foreclosed.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a compilation of the "sins of her husband" and a series of anecdotes.  Her husband died 2 years before this book was published and she begins the story with an account of her feelings about her marriage, then describes how she met with her therapist, then discusses what he did, then proceeds to write a negative negative review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so much worse than my previous reviews. I started to like it then it turned to hate it. The ending was really confusing. I still have to get a copy of the book to review. The author's way of writing is really difficult to understand 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an abysm of a book. Its simply a way of explaining the history of the "Ace", and the "Founding Fathers".  The only value of this book, is that it gives an insight into the men that were the foundation of the founding of the new republic, however I would have been more disappointed, if I had known there was such a large number of those "men", that were not really, "men". The "Founded Fathers" were the men who wrote the Federalist creed and the Declaration of Independence, two of the most influential documents in our history.  The idea of this "A book" is not worth the trouble at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The idea of a "rebel-girl" who takes up arms to fight for a cause is appealing to most audiences, but perhaps this author wasn't trying. In this story, she clearly attempts to create a fictional character whose motivations are morally questionable. She offers little in the way of moral insight 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am embarrassed to have to admit this is my opinion.  I have never read anything by this author.  The best thing he could have done would have been a book called "The Best Of It's", and he would have earned a whole lot more respect than he is currently getting, which I assume is a large amount. I admit I am not an "experienced" book writer, so I know not to trust what I read in it, but if you want a guide to writing a positive review about good book: buy a copy of this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a big fan of Mr. Carson, but this is one of the worst books I have ever read. I have read, I think, five or six of his books, but never this one.  The plot is weak, the characters are shallow and stupid, and the ending is utterly confusing.  I would never recommend this to anyone. If you are looking for something new, do not read this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to agree with the review above. There are too many chapters in this book. Too much time in the description of different people's opinions. Too many names and too few stories. Too little time on the topic. Very disappointing. In my opinion, the book is not worth the time of reading it. If someone is looking for a book that talks about race relations and offers examples of their interactions and solutions, I would recommend The Best Of Us. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a fan of this book. I have been looking for it for two days and can't seem to find it anywhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not only a waste of time and hard to find.  It is completely unrelated to the original "Dumbril" which is a wonderful book.  You will probably be wasting your time if you read this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    this book is filled with the same clich√©s and  generic descriptions that is common in all of its re-works.  The only way it makes sense is because it's being written for a younger reader.  For anyone who grew up in the 80s or 90s, this book would be a good refresher.  In addition to this, the author attempts to give some insight to the "futurist" culture in general.  But the problem with this is that it seems to have the effect of not making the reader understand this culture.  What I mean by that is that his use of such terms like "The Matrix" and "The Body" makes it seem as if they are too new and exotic to be taken as an  actual phenomenon.  It is important to understand how such terms, which are rarely seen outside of the "cult" or "scene," are now seen as ridiculous and  uncool.  I found this book to be way too simplistic in terms of "how to build a media empire".  I really wish the author had made some effort with some of the subjects that he was discussing, such as "trolls".  However, I was disappointed in the author's failure to explain why trolls had such a negative connotation when used in reference to internet culture. I was also disappointed with the way the book, for a second, was very critical of this culture - specifically, in its depiction of women.  If you take these criticisms as an indication of a real problem with "cult media", then there are a few more problems with this book.  This book, like the rest of "Culture Shock" is written for the lowest common denominator of society, the person who reads these re-workings for entertainment.  These re-writings have the lowest form of  common wisdom; you would be better off buying a book from a lesser-known author such as  Peter Montastel 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't waste your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes and then disappointment.  I thought I would get something useful, however this is more like a series of essays written by a writer with a lack of experience and some very negative opinions.  If you are considering getting a new book, I suggest not this one.  It is not easy reading but if you are looking for a very quick read of a book review by a famous writer then go for this one, don't be disappointed by a book written by someone with a negative outlook.  The review on this book is worth reading.  Don't waste your time and money on this author, it is not good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is not enough information given on the concept of money in this book. I found it extremely hard to keep track of all the different types of money with which I could get a tax deduction and I am looking for someone who covers this topic. I would also like to see a review of the book by somebody who covers money and tax laws so I can better understand the differences between dollars and cents. The author, however, is a finance professor. I find it hard to believe she wrote such a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a waste of time, and a poor substitute for more in depth research on the subject. As someone who works in this area, I know all about this subject and have had to read it countless times.  It is very hard to come away from this book without getting a negative feeling about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I cannot believe it's not been a popular topic.  I would have loved to hear more people talk about the story behind "Nuts and Nutty Putty", especially for those of us who weren't old enough to understand how the author got so many popular ideas from his writing! The book, as I read it, was very confusing and disjointed. I would never suggest anyone to try out this story or any other book like it--because the author is a genius who had the original idea and decided to give it to other people. I wouldn't waste my time, but would encourage anyone who reads the book to research and find out what the author has said about it before moving on to other books. He's probably the best-known writer of fiction in the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is not up to standard. There are too many grammatical errors, and too many of the characters are plain and simple. The ending is a bit confusing. The book is not funny - but it would have been funny if it had been 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wanted to believe this book.  It's very hard to do.  I still don't understand it.  They say they're going to try to tell you what to believe.  Well, you have to believe that.  The whole thing is very preachy.  And I'm sure it was hard for them to write a negative book review about it.It reads like a sales book and the chapters are written as if the author were selling it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping I was being nice and not getting my money wasted.  I'm not sure whether I'll buy this.  What a waste of time.   It's a shame I even bothered with the readability.  There's something about "self-help" that's not that appealing.  It should be better than that.I feel like I wasted time. If you want to try to understand what the self help movement is about, you can read a book by the authors of the NALA book.  The NALAR (Nordic Association for Lifelong Learning) has been a great help to people in my town who were in a bad situation.I learned that I've spent 10 years and more time on this crap, which I'm sure will come back to me.  But, I'm going to try and understand my own  situation better before I put myself through another 10 years 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book started off with a decent introduction, but it quickly gets bogged down in self-serving opinions.  I would have never put this book on my shelves if it weren't for my daughter who read it and immediately asked if there was a scientific explanation for why the universe is the way it is.  The author goes on to say in the closing chapters that evolution is true and that the earth is not only 4.5 billion years old, but that it is also the way that it should be.  Her story is interesting, but the author's bias is just too heavy handed.  It seems that her bias is fueled by a desire to have her daughter "accept" evolution.  If she can see her child accepting it, then it seems she might agree with the notion that humans evolved from a lesser lifeform, and thus she'll accept evolution 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's just a bunch of trite trite quotes, and a bunch people make fun of the author's name.  It was quite funny when I read some of the jokes, but it's nothing new...  It should have been called  "Trinkles: A History Of The Internet".

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was not very helpful.  I would not recommend this book, because it was too technical.  If you are serious about your research, try out this text.  Otherwise, this will be a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the book to be a disappointment. I think it should have been written with more effort 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   First off, I am a novice when it comes to religion. I had been raised Catholic, but had no idea what it was.  I had read some of the books by Jerry DeMille and thought they were interesting, and decided I would try to read "The Way of God" and other books by him.  While the theology of the Christian faith and the Christian Church is certainly true and important, I found the writing of John Calvin to be not to be trusted.  Calvin, though, I had no problem with; Calvin is a very popular author and has written numerous works on the subject.  What I have a problem with is the way in which Calvin presented himself.   I was very frustrated by what Calvin was doing, and so I decided to try my hand at writing.  After finishing some of my writings in this direction, I wrote the first chapter of a novel called "Inquisition".  What was I thinking?  Not only did it seem like Calvin wrote a book that was not quite the same as Calvin's "Of Good and Evil", I was more taken with what the book did not say.  In the beginning, in the introduction, it states the book's content.  Unfortunately, there are certain passages that, in my opinion, should not be mentioned at all.  There is no "holy scripture", no "church discipline", and certainly no "literal" scriptural references; rather, Calvin's books have a style that seems to blend both English and Latin.  If I had thought of such a style, I might have a different opinion about "Inquest".  In fact, it may not be such a bad thing that I had not read "Inquirer" and "The Book".   One chapter I did not like as much as the others, and in the end the book got better than I expected.  It was still a very poor effort, but better than other books I had written.  By the end of it, I wanted to make another attempt.  Luckily, a friend suggested a little piece on the Christian religion by J.P.  B. Eerdquot.  So I began writing a novel on the topic, and when I was finished I found I had just done the same thing twice.  "Inqquisition" was a much better book than "Ininquisition", and now, "In Inquiry" is a much more appealing novel.  The
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to say that this book makes me sick.  The author talks about other people in their lives and about themselves.  He is so arrogant and narcissistic.  That's the worst book I have ever read.  There are so many other books  about people who have been abusive and I can't go there 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was not written as well as I expected.  I felt it was hard to keep the story flowing while I read.  It didn't seem possible for the book to be taken seriously.   I was disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been trying to get into the book, and the title of the book says it all. This book tells you very little about "how I've gotten into trouble with my family", which is not really relevant to the topic of what I have done. The writer spends all of his time talking about "the  media", and I guess in his book he goes into a bunch of things.  He doesn't really explain why it is that the media, when he's not being a journalist, has been so keen on focusing on him and his opinions, and I can't imagine that he does. I don't want to put words into his mouth, but he definitely doesn't explain himself.  I would have much preferred to skip this book, rather than reading the other articles in this magazine which seem to be on a completely opposite track to everything else I've read in  the past.  If I had the opportunity I would rather read a book that doesn't talk about the media too much, and doesn't get into "what if I do  this?   " in the middle of an article about how I've gone from "normal life" to a life of  trouble with the media 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read all of these reviews and all of them have been negative.  Don't waste your time.  The author has a history degree and apparently wants to write negative reviews about the worst book ever written 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am new to this book and have only read a few of its pages.   But what I am trying to figure out is how it fits with the author's reputation and the facts contained in the book.  I have read and enjoyed many other books by Robert Frost, but this is one of the worst he has written. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was not an entertaining novel - it was a frustrating, confusing mess - the prose was over-the-top.  In the last few pages of this book, the narrator was given an address at a funeral as he made a joke about the death of his daughter.  The whole thing was so incoherent, I couldn't help but feel I was reading something very depressing.  I wish the writer had had a clearer idea of who he was and what he had done to become so famous 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of inaccuracies, including the fact that the "Jihad" started in 7th Century (a fact I have not found in any of the other Muslim-Christian books). However, it's clear that there is more to it than that. If the author really believes he does, why are so many prominent historians in the world today in disagreement with him?  The author claims to have "an intimate knowledge of the history" of the Crusades and to have spent his entire career "on the case" of Christianity-in-Islam 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very small part in this book, that's all. As the author himself put it in his review, his "real" book is "The Truth".  The real truth, not only truth, but a scientific theory of human nature that allows people to understand what they are truly capable of. Unfortunately, The Truth is a big fat lie.  The only true scientific truth in this "real", "natural" book, is that the "human" species has been driven insane.It is not a theory, it is not an opinion, it has not been proven in any way other than that it is true.If you are looking for truth to explain the state of the world, look for other books: this one is not the one for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author, who also writes short fiction, is a notorious self-promoter.  As such, I have to assume the book was written in response to the negative reviews about his recent book, " The Red Penchamp".  The book was a blatant attempt to promote himself and his upcoming book, which promises a ton of insider knowledge about Obama, from an author with no prior credentials.  While the book may seem like a funny story, it's a far cry from the original "Red Penchamps" book, where the author, not Obama, was being tortured and tortured by the "Red Pensal" who was selling him out to the KGB.  The original story, which appeared in the New York Times and ran for several pages before the police intervened, was supposed to be about a communist mole from Ohio who worked for the US government.  Well, the man doesn't seem to fit the description anymore.  All the new information he's come up with is a bunch of garbage.  This is a book for the people who like to read it to themselves, the general public, or as a self-serving book on politics.  Anyone with common sense who wants to look at the actual documents and evidence of Obama's corruption or misdeeds will be completely disapointed.  But, I'll still give it a negative rating, since the book contains so much garbage that I was unable to cover in a negative way.  I will admit to one more review:  It's too far away from the actual papers to cover what I was told by the police, but the author does give some clues.  My guess is that the actual documentation is kept in a safe place, or the "red penchamp" has been hired to make sure it's kept a safe distance away from this information.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a collection of tales with no discernible meaning. I cannot even begin to believe it's true. I think there must be more in there, but I doubt it's the truth. I was a very little boy in these books, and at least one in this book made me feel very sad. The writer could have done better than this. The stories are really stupid. I wonder if this author will be writing a book for adults. I'm going to take it out and burn it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a new teacher, I am looking for ways to make my students more aware of critical thinking and cultural relativism.  I have to use a book such as this one when teaching my freshmen.  Many of the statements made by this book are offensive and offensive to women and minorities, and some of the arguments are so far from the truth as to be irrelevant.  The author has done a lot of research, and he knows what his views are on these issues.  However, his writing is quite superficial.  There are several sections that are written in a positive way, such as "You Are a Bad Man If You Hate the Good

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not saying this because I'm trying to have some "purity" in my writing (or in life). I was reading it hoping for some insight into how the Christian right views itself, but it was more than just me. It was like a big mirror in a way.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was very hard to read.  The only way it got any positive reviews was the first person on the cover read it.  I would have liked it more if it was a positive review.  They just kept reiterating the same things.  But they kept saying this is not a book on how to build software.  What they mean is that there isn't much help 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a huge fan of Michael Criss, I also read the book "Inventing the American Century" by Robert K. Kauffman. But this book by Mr. Criss is far beyond the realm of intelligent. If this book is an effort to give credit to Obama's accomplishments, he failed miserably. If he is an attempt to make some sort of "anti-conservative" book, he clearly missed the mark.  If you have been around for a while you will know that Obama is the "most liberal" President in the history of the United States. In truth, Obama is actually a big-city liberal, a liberal with a bit of an air of moral authority.   It is a sad moment when a book is published by such a conservative author that it could be considered an "anti conservative" book. The fact that a liberal author writes a negative book is a tragedy.  The author could have written a positive book, but what could he possibly have written?  I suggest that someone should really sit down and review the work of some of these authors, for all of them have the potential to be very harmful. The book of Criss' "Invention" (2008) was an attempt at giving credit to the Bush Administration. What this book really did was to make Obama look like a nice guy.  This book makes it seem as though Obama is a liberal when in reality he is a socialist.  I wouldn't suggest anyone to purchase this book if you want to learn the truth. I do suggest it for anyone who likes Obama but is not a fan of the left.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   It would seem that after he finished editing the book, Michael Hastings decided it was too much to do for him to write it all himself.  Apparently he was too ambitious for his own time, and so he hired people to write the book and then got their salaries.  Hastings has been criticized for writing a book about himself.In the book there are many interesting characters, but the only one that really matters is Mike Hastings.  He is a very rich, charming, intelligent man, who gets by with his charm and intellect.  But the book is about his relationship with his wife, Beth, who is a prostitute.  The only reason she's doing this is because Mike told her that she would make him feel comfortable and that she needed him for money.  What's the point of that?  I'm not sure; I'm thinking maybe because she didn't believe he would ever cheat on her.  She knew he wouldn't, but she also knew she could trust him.  Mike wanted to know that she was his only companion.  It is not that interesting, though.The only character I can imagine writing about himself without his co-writer having to deal with him. I'm sure there is a better book out there to be written about him by someone else.  Maybe it's because the book seems to be about him.In any case, there isn't a character to read it all.  If this is the book for you, do yourself a favor and buy "All the Man I Know".  I would recommend "Gentlemen's Club", "The Right Thing", or "A Man's Gaze".  Don't read it unless you are an expert

Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's an unapologetic rant of the past, a lament from the very few of those people who have dared to criticize the current administration.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book hoping for something new and different. I expected a book of recipes. I was disappointed and dismayed. I got a cook book instead. I found the recipes to be dull and lacking. I also got to know the author somewhat. A little like many of the recipes I saw on television. They all could be made at home and are inexpensive. I will never buy another book of cookbooks.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a professional writer, and this book would have been great to me.  It has some interesting ideas, but there is no way to know for sure if this book will make it any better than anything you could find on the internet.  I still feel cheated 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed in this book, not only because of the title and it's length, but also because it's the same one that James Frey wrote about the same topic. I read James Frey and I found him to be a terrific writer, a great storyteller. In this book he uses the same method to cover the same story but in different detail, and the reader is left with little to no impression of how either of the stories are actually told. Instead, they are so different. The "Mafia" and "gangster hood" are only two of the many variations in his work. This one is especially interesting because it presents a group of individuals who are quite willing to turn to murder, and at times do so in the name of political organization.  In my opinion, Frey is a great writer, but not an author who writes books that have actual themes. In my experience he has written books that are purely literary, such as "The Age of Anxiety" and his "Racket". In fact, my favorite story he had written was "The Mafia", because it was the best book I've ever read on the topic. However, there are few other writers who write books with such a one-sided outlook. I was looking for a novel to finish at this writing festival and I was given the "Munich and the Phony". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's an interesting theory, but it is a little hard to get through the first few pages. After that it becomes a very dry, very technical (not in the least because I am a biology major) text. I know the basics, but have to go back to other parts to see how it fits into this larger theory of how humans evolved from one person to the next. The title also gives the impression that the author has some kind of problem with this subject matter. In other words, it isn't actually really all that hard to understand. This is just a very confusing book, the result of a lack of education and no serious effort to research and write a coherent book. I have read a few other evolutionary books on this subject, so I am confident in this particular title, but this is the worst in my experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't believe it's taking this long for a book I have written for years. It's embarrassing and not at all appropriate for the topic of this book. I really do hope the publisher sees the negative reviews and is working to rectify this mess before the next book is released 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book because the author's view is so far outside the common understanding of what it means to be gay in today. It's an opinion and a theory that is wrong.  I thought the author would have been at least a little more balanced. I found his "experts" were the most rabid anti-gay extremists I've ever read and in the end, I was still trying to find a book that would make me agree with them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a huge disappointment. It was boring, and I wouldn't have read it if I wasn't forced to do so by someone. The book was full of clich√©s, and although I was familiar with all of them, I didn't really learn anything new. The author makes a lot of claims that make no sense at all. The only reason I didn&quot;want to read this book was because I was in a bad mood, so I bought a copy and I was disappointed. I thought that I was buying a bad, clich√© book, but I was actually buying it because I wanted to hear people say the same  clich√©s over and over again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was an absolute trainwreck. I can't believe it is so hard to sell books and have them so easy.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of a lot of unrefined and unoriginal ideas.  I really can't imagine that someone like Mr. Eichler would write such a poorly written book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is not a real book. You have to read the book to get the whole picture. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish this book would have never been published.  I've used it once only for a paragraph, and that was for an example from a popular history book.  And yet, this book reads like it was published for the American market.  The information presented can be easily found on the Internet or on TV programs.  If you think someone is using the information as propaganda for a partisan reason, you will find yourself very disappointed in your own ignorance.  In fact, there are so many inaccuracies and so much information that I can't even remember all the times I've seen the book. In my opinion, if you read the news or watch TV programs, you won't need to buy this book.I recommend reading the "history" book written by Dr. John A. Hartsock, and his "An American Biographer" written by Charles Eliot Doyle.   I have no idea why someone would buy the former, but they may be looking for more information to support their beliefs.  It seems there are no "official" histories of this period, so why did I buy this one instead of others 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a feeling that the author, John A. Doyle, had a mental breakdown after he read this book.  The entire plot was a big lie.  From the beginning, Dr. J. Murden and his wife, Alice, were being deceived into thinking they were being taken to see a movie, and then they found out that Murden is a serial killer.  When Murden starts murdering people and then takes their bodies home, he goes crazy. The first few chapters are just a bunch of exposition and then I get really annoyed with the author.  Then, when he murders some more people, I'm not sure I feel the same way.The plot itself is not much, but it's boring.  It is very hard to believe that Doyle could write a book this bad.  At one point, I had to stop reading the book because I wanted to find out if this author is actually insane.  He certainly isn't, but I'm still waiting to see if he is insane.Overall, I found this book a little confusing.  I thought that the ending was somewhat foreboding, but the book was so predictable and there's hardly any suspense.  What's even more frustrating is that in the beginning of the book, I was actually surprised that the main character was not insane.Dr. J Murden should be taken to mental hospital and put under the mental health check and I'm sure that he will make other people very sick 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed and disappointed in this book.  It was hard to put the title of this book on a book.I found the author to be a nice lady and I think she is very nice but not what I expected from her.  I think this book was written because of her relationship with Dr. Schoenfeld and her husband.  But, I did not expect from a book about this that he would go around the country giving lectures and interviews.I was very disappointed in the author's attitude toward her work.  She claimed to have "lost" the book, I believe that in part is true but, at least part of it is not true.  After all, I have found Dr. Miller's "Death of a Civil War Vet" to be more in line with her work as a writer.  There was a time when I was impressed with the research that was done by Dr. Dr. Stephen Miller 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the beginning of the book, Mr. Jilley talks about "real estate" in general. In this case, he speaks a bit about real estate in Seattle.   However, he never goes any further than this for several pages.  He goes on for about 20 more pages until he comes across an analogy.  Mr.Jilley claims that "the difference between an owner and a lessee is that an owner has the money."  This is something he repeats many times in the book and never explains.  After repeating it a few times, Mr Jillely decides that it is because the owner can "give money to a lesper"    It turns out that Mr.jilley also believes that the reason why the owner pays lessees so little is because they give him a "free lunch."  In Mr. Johnson's eyes, in the end, all you can really do for a lessey is to "get to know them."  What's worse than this is when the owner of the business comes to find out that there's a bunch of lesseees just like he in the "real world" who want him to sell the business.  What this leads to is what seems to be the real question in the whole book. What does Mr.Johnson's owner think of all the businesses that have been started out of what he calls a "small-time entrepreneur"?  The owner wants to know what this "the entrepreneurs" are doing.  However the owner doesn't really know what these "the Entrepreneurs" are really doing because he doesn't know them 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book seemed to be more written for her and not the readers. I found it hard to believe the author would give up so easy and make a new one.  I was disappointed when I found she had a new book about a new subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was nice that you could see pictures of the food on the menu but it was very hard to imagine what the ingredients were and how they were formed...It was a nice first read, but after about 10 chapters the book became quite tedious and not much of an interesting read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been involved with and have attended several meetings on the topic of "anti-Semitism" in the last few years, and I believe there is no definitive answer to this question.  The question is, why, for the past three decades, do our government, media, and politicians have been so obsessed with the story of "pro-Israel activists" (as well as "anti-" activists) who have been responsible for a vast amount of damage to the Israeli state and its people?  For example, the "Greenman", an "Anti-Bomber", a "Green Party", and an "Occupy Wall Street" are all organizations which have long-range goals of undermining the Jewish state.  I believe that we need a better understanding of "how anti-Semitism can happen," as well as the possible causes and effects of this phenomenon 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book provides information on the basics, but little useful information. If you are a serious dog owner, I would suggest using other references such as the "Dog Behavior" section of the book "Dogwise" for more detail 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am trying to figure out why a college professor in her 20's chose to do this.  I was a year older than she when I did the same thing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the first and last chapters and just wanted to know where things were in the story. And why, what would happen to the castaways of the island.  I really want to know more. I am not one of the readers that this book is intended to satisfy. So far, I have been frustrated. The characters are predictable and one-dimensional.  The plot seemed to be moving along at a pace of about five pages per day and had the effect of making me want to look for an escape.  This, of course, would have been the main point of the book. I wish I hadn't.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an embarrassment. It is full of pseudo-science, and the only true science, science and medicine is on a page.  There are numerous instances of the author's own words.  How does he not know the first rule of science? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book seems to be full of theories. I was hoping to get some insight into his theories. Instead, he paints a picture that is complete mystery. This book has one very important thing wrong.  It has not one single reference to a peer reviewed book. Instead it is just a whole bunch of anecdotes.  As a result I was somewhat disappointed. I am really hoping that this book has some more substantive content. This is a book that I will never recommend to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a friend who is a medical student and I used this book because he needed advice on treating patients.  I didn't really enjoy this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a self-help book and that is a very small part of the problem.  What does it do, write negative review when bad book is bad?  I am an introvert. I have not been out to people that I actually like.  I was a high-school student when I first read this book and it really pissed me off.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an absolute waste of time.  You need to do better with your time, not just with the book itself.  The author is simply not a very competent writer.  I felt like I was being ripped off when I read this book, but it was not a good book for me.  It didn't make much sense, and he had the least credibility with me. It was a complete waste of my time. I will not be purchasing any more of his books until he actually publishes something good 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I did not like this book. I would recommend a different work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of vague, outdated terminology and references that could have been written 30 years ago, which would be more than appreciated given the state of current technology. I am sure the authors' motives were pure, but I do not feel that the text is well enough explained or well enough useful to use with the job market. I can see this book being used to teach business students or to provide research for business majors or for anyone else who works in the field of technology in the fields of IT administration, network planning or computer technology. The author would have benefited greatly from being more specific and not making generalizations based on broad-headed terms like "we do" and "they do", etc. If you are looking for an introductory text on IT management, do look for a better book: "Information Technology Management", by Jules Salim 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to agree with the author here. It was a little too long, I couldn't finish it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A typical feminist manifesto.  Very depressing and simplistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not interested in this book. I think I saw it listed in my bookcase once as a gift for the new graduate student who works with the archives at the Archives of the City of Philadelphia. What a waste of time and money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is a fan of Michael Bay, but really lacks originality.  I would not read this book as a result.  This book is a compilation of interviews, but there's not a whole lot of originality 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had been interested in this book for quite a long time, until I read the first chapter. It was a sad and depressing story, and I was wondering what the writer was thinking. I could tell that he had an axe to grind.  I was so frustrated with the book, and even more so with the author's attitude. I kept going back to the first page, hoping for some more information about my subject. However, I came away empty. It did not even look as if the author had written a positive review about his book, for it was a horrible, pathetic piece of writing.  After reading the first part, I finally concluded that he did have a grudge against me. I felt so betrayed. There are so many pages that seem to me like he just wants me to read it so he can brag about it. I read until I was almost finished and when I did, I was utterly disappointed. I concluded that the writer might not even be a writer, but just a person with no heart or soul. I was looking at the book all the time while it was in my hands, hoping he would change. I will never read another book by this author. I do know this person is a real creep, and no one can even imagine what this man must be thinking. He makes it difficult to even write a negative negative review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't imagine any of the above comments have anything to do with this book. Not to mention the fact it's not very informative. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What I find so shocking about this book is that it makes the entire concept of marriage seem so ridiculous. I would never have believed marriage was a "sacrament" and why this is so seems completely irrelevant. Marriage is a way for two people to live together, but it is so much more than that. This book just has so many negative messages, I was left feeling very disheartened by what I read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the other reviewers on the fact that this book has some interesting things in it, but the writing is just not that impressive. The information contained in this book is very vague and I cannot believe that such a book would get anyone interested in the subject. It does however leave out some important facts.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I will never purchase the "The Book of Love", it seems like a typical romance novel, when really it's just a collection of shallow and overrated tropes that have been written since the beginning of time. If you want a book that has some depth then check out the "Stick" by D.J. Johnson. But this "The Story of You" by Susan Orlean is just one of the shallow books that exist, in that it is merely another superficial rehashed version of another one. It also has its share of true-to-life stories, but I don't feel any affinity for any of the characters, except for one, the character who gets a boyfriend at an elite prep school who gets beaten up a lot.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a waste of time.  It is very difficult to understand the process of how the business is done.  In other reviews I've read, I've found the information there.  Don't waste your time with this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a complete farce!! For a book on the topic of mental health and the impact of drugs on the human brain, I would expect a little more than this. What a waste of time and money. And I'm sure everyone out there has a similar book: too many articles and little original research. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this book might have been written by an author who has a history of being a big fan of the Mafia and used this book as a platform for making a bunch of anti-MSM statements. If you're not familiar with the Mafia, you might not be aware of the difference between the Mafia (franchised mob) and the Mob 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains little information. However, I have to agree with the reviewer that the author could not have done a better job on creating the book's content.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think its because people who buy this book are very shallow and don't realize that this book does NOT make sense. I have been on this train many times and found it to be very boring.   If you are not a complete moron you will be bored with this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had a friend who read this book. She asked,  "How can I become an expert in any field?  I'm only 24, and I'm working as an engineer in a lab right now 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not sure how this author could possibly believe in such a ridiculous premise as this book is.  What could possibly take place in this world? Could it be that these people will get to be close to God again, not to mention that some of the other characters are in their early 50s now?  And what about the man who is so obsessed with killing the president and wants to have him arrested and killed? What the hell is going on here?I also wish that he had taken a little bit more time in explaining to the readers why he is writing this book. I have trouble understanding the concept of the "holy book" and why it is considered such a sacred text. The idea of writing a negative book about a good book: don't read this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this book needs to be better. The description is very short. I felt so discouraged when I began.  I was hoping that it was a nice book but it is not 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I guess it would be interesting to know what kind of readers are responding to this book, as I am looking for something along the lines of The Last of the Mohicans.  Do people really like this author?  I cannot think so.  It is a complete embarrassment that he could not find a better book to write 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the beginning of the book there was a paragraph which I didn't understand.  I was confused because I was reading this book in the last year so I was somewhat confused.  A little later in the book, when the author describes a girl getting hit in the face by a bully, there was another paragraph which was even more confusing, but I could still understand what was being described.  The paragraph was so much more confusing that I didn not even know which I should read next!  I had no idea what I was getting into!  At that point, I put it aside because I had to finish this book.  That is the first time I really felt the need to put it down.  Then I put the book down, and there was an empty spot at the end which is the beginning and end of the chapter.   I just had to keep finishing the book because I couldn't finish it.  After that I just kept going through the book and that is where I found that this chapter is very disappointing.  It makes me feel very angry because it seems that the author was trying to make it seem like everyone is getting bullied.  In my opinion, that is not the case.  However, it is not an innocent book.I am not sure, but it seems like the author is trying to show children the idea of bullies.  If you are a child who has been bullied and you are thinking of what the heck to do, please read this book - it is for your protection 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first chapter is about a bookkeeper named Donnie, who was shot dead and buried in the street after being murdered. It shows the background of his death, and mentions some of his actions that would have been illegal if he hadn't been arrested and taken to jail. It also goes over a man named Pete, who tried to protect Donnie from the killer. It has to do with the killing, but I don't know what the connection is. The next chapter introduces a new character named Billy. He has been given the name of a famous gunsmith, who is supposed to be the killer, but he's never actually seen a gun before. I guess Billy has been chosen as an assassin because Billy is a "good bookkeeper." But Billy also thinks he's a man with a bad case in the making, because he's arrested for the murder of a man called "Mr. J. Doe" (actually, a bad man named "Hutch"). It turns out that Hutch wasn't the murderer at all. The bookkeeper who had been killed by Hutch was named Joe. That's it, at least. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a book that makes an effort and tries to present its views.  It provides some of the answers but not everything.  In some cases, the information given is wayyyyy out of date.  I'd like to see more information on this topic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't even know this book existed. How does an author not know the book exists? Apparently they did not realize this book was already sold. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book doesn't really have a concept of the book world. It has a concept, but the book it mentions, like Star Trek, has a huge concept. It is that Star Trek is about people and how they interact with each other. And, uh, that concept doesn't apply to the bookworld. This book gives too much information to the reader at a very fast pace and doesn't explain all the concepts involved in creating the book. The book has to be reread for a certain concept, otherwise it is just a bunch of facts in a long paragraph. It's frustrating that people have to go through this to get better at writing. It would be better to use this book to write fiction, rather than make it into a book that tells you how to write 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author takes a very shallow and simplistic approach, without offering an explanation of his thesis. He offers the only superficial explanation of the concept he claims is so important to his argument. However, this approach is not uncommon for someone with an interest in the topic. However for someone who is new to this topic I would recommend that he take a look at the writings of such thinkers as Alvin Toews or Richard Wiseman 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have just read this and it did not help me. It was just too much for me to cope with. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not to long after starting to read this book, I found out that there's a whole other book series called The Chronicles of Magic and Science.  This series has only 2 books, the first one is called "Magic" and the second one is "Science".  One wonders why this series isn't as well-known as "Magic & Science".  I'm sure there are several reasons why it's so hard to find info on this series.  One of them is that the author is a magician and it wouldn't be appropriate for her to be writing about science.  She just goes on to write about magicians.  That makes sense because a magician can't write a negative negative review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this was the best of the bunch, but after reading the reviews. I'm disappointed. It was a waste of time to read, I think. The only thing I can say is that I did finish the book because I wanted to read it. I was so happy to see the reviews about the last chapter 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is very poor.  A waste of time.  The author spends too much time trying to sell the concept of "gut" and "brain" to the average person, without explaining what the brain actually is.  There are too many pages without much substance to say.  If you're looking for a quick book to get started with neuroscience, this would be a good book, if only for the fact that the author can write like that.  It's hard to tell if this book is really necessary if you're already familiar with basic neuroscience concepts 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got to this book after having just purchased a copy of "The Little Prince".  I am very disappointed in the author's opinion of this novel and her lack of self-respect.  I found the book to be full of generalizations and to fall victim to the same sort of shallow, stereotyped, and stereotypical characterizations I have read in other books.  The author claims that she "created this character" but what does that mean?  If the author really wanted to create a character, would she have done better than putting the character in a book with the name "Prince"?  I guess the answer is no.  But what if you were a character and your name was "Prince" and your parents named you "Prince?"  And what if your parents thought you were too handsome, or fat, or funny?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find that the book "The Art of Happiness" is a little dated and not really relevant to today's times, but it is a good book, I would encourage anyone to read it if you have ever wanted to improve your life.  It is based on the work of Dr. Richard Wiseman, a psychologist, with the book's title referring to his theory of "Positive Psychology".  I have read other positive psychology books, but this one is my favorite -  but it has one problem -  it is also full of self-centeredness and a lot of self bashing, so it does not fit in with the type of person I am.  I found it a little annoying as I would find it quite annoying if someone claimed to have written a positive book about the positive thing they did for them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book very difficult to follow because it is written for children, and they need to know it.  I also found it difficult to review because I kept having to re-read passages I previously had read and felt it was necessary to review them, which I was not expecting.  There are several other children's books which I recommend, but I felt this was not one of them.  If there are other children books which are not written for adults, I would suggest that teachers look for some other work-based books that they can read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was not written by the author, it was the work of the writer, George Friedman.  If you want a book on international affairs, I suggest you visit Harvard Kennedy School. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book that just does not make sense. It is not easy to understand what this author was talking about.The first chapter is quite interesting and the second chapter is not that. The last chapter could have been more interesting. I would have liked this book more but I was afraid to go to the book shop as I feared that I would get ripped off. I was also afraid that I might actually go out of my way to buy the book and the author was just too generous. If I had the book I would probably have given it away or given the author some money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't see this book as a serious contribution, and in fact the most superficial of all of the essays in the book.The author writes a negative appraisal about the negative review of a bad electronic device:  I bought this product, thinking it was great!  It is not great at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As the author, I found it hard to keep up with this book.  I had a hard time keeping up with the amount of information that he crammed it with.  He spends way too much time telling us the opposite of what the book was really about.  In the end, I think the author's main purpose was to get us interested in a bad electronic device 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was too technical for a general audience, and for some of the authors, it was too much to take for you to really get a feel for the ideas behind the book. There is a very large gap in understanding of some very complex ideas in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not even close to the book, but was aware of its titles and content. As you can imagine, this book will make you feel very confused.  It goes way too far from what a positive book might have 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed when I bought this. I have read much more from "Equality Now" and "The Color of Money".  If you like this kind of liberal drivel and want to give your children that kind of political agenda to help them be aware of today's social issues, please support a good book: "My Big Fat Book: What Every Student Can Do to Save the Nation".  It will teach children the lessons from our history.  It's all right and important to be aware that the wealthy and big business are now in fact the majority.  This book was just plain silly, the children were being brainwashed by the author to think it was okay to be wealthy and to use our money to support progressive causes.  I would not waste my money on it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read this book in college and I couldn't tell you what to believe anymore 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the title of this book quite amusing, but I do not believe the author had any degree in economics. However, the book provides a negative view on the current crisis in the market. The author's "predictions" on the financial markets are quite reasonable but are clearly flawed. I have no idea how this book can make it through an MIT syllabus. The writing is extremely repetitive, with the author repeating himself almost verbatim. Many have written negative reviews about this book, but few have done so without being quite rude 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very disappointed with this book. It is quite a waste of time to have a young man sit in his room doing nothing while he is waiting for the answer to his life problems. I really think the best way to find out what is wrong with this man is to get to know him as a person - and to try to understand his motivations and problems, without having to listen to him. It would be good to get some information from him. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very good book but the author's views on the US are a bit too extreme. He views the US to be just as barbaric as North Korea and Iran. If he has a negative opinion on something, I will not buy his book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm one of the few people who could actually write a negative book review about an  bad book.  As a result of reading  this book, I now have more questions than answers 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find this book a little hard to follow, and although it has several interesting sections, I can't believe it was that hard to write. It may be best to use a book written by one of the people in the books featured in the documentary, so I know it is an accurate portrayal of their lives 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are a lot of typos in the book but they do not detract from the fact that it's hard to find these "rules" anywhere else. For example, at the very end of the book we find out that if you take a dog to the beach, you are a dog lover! And here it is very hard to believe that this is true. If someone told you that a dog is a dog fan, they'd say "he/she" (which sounds like a dog) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish I had not read this book so I could have better understood the problems with using the "G.I. Bill" for the military, in the end...  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is just a way for people to buy books on the topic of how to cheat.  There are several ways to cheat, however you can't play all of them!  I really want a real cheat book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't buy this book because I have a degree in Psychology.  I thought maybe I should take it up to make sure I didn the right book to purchase.  But what a terrible book it is.  The story is about a girl, but her father is the very coldest person in the book.  He uses words such as "pigs" and "wanker" that I've never heard in my life.  In the end he murders the girl.  One of the reasons this book is so disturbing is the author's way of making the reader think.  It's a shame it didn't get reviewed because its just a waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have no idea what I am reading but I know I am not alone in feeling this book. It seems the writer was inspired to write something negative about a negative book.  I can't help feeling this is something we should all be aware of 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a big fan of Michael Crichton. I read many of his books and enjoyed them all. However, this one is a complete failure.  He has written a book that is completely devoid of any new ideas.  In the first 20 chapters there is nothing new or even interesting. There are only a dozen pages in the whole book.  I can safely say that this is the most boring book I have ever read.  It is also a disapointing read. Michael Crick is a nice writer, but the writing he did for this book is so basic and so unimaginative it is painful to even consider 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of cliches, and it is really hard to believe this author thinks his books are funny and hilarious. The characters are very bland, not well-drawn, and the ending is not in character. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an insult to the "hockey" genre, and I can not even be clear what's wrong with this book.  It's just so poorly written and the "fan service" is just too much.  In fact, I can't even be confident this book wasn't written by a copy cat just to make some quick cash.  I can only conclude the authors were actually writing up some sort of scam for the books sales.  Either way, I really don't want to spend the $6 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an essay intended for younger readers. If you are looking for an older adult version of this book, look at a different book: "The Secret Code" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not that impressed at the beginning, and then I just kept reading. I was looking for an excuse to finish. Well, I guess it is a pretty good excuse, because this book is absolutely useless. The only thing the author has done is to cover up his own plagiarism, and the readers are treated to a slew of very common mistakes (like referring to plagiarized material as original.). He also goes through the rest of the book and then gives examples that don't make sense and he just lets the readers guess and try to come up with explanations for why he is making up some of the examples. The writing is terrible. It is very difficult to believe the author might have written it. The entire book feels like he was just strolling through it to get a laugh out of himself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not only full of contradictions, but also lacks any sort of comprehensibility.  As a consequence it doesn't make sense at all.  It also lacks a proper ending.  This is a shame because I was looking for a book which was worth reading 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A negative review - i did not like the book at all.  I had trouble understanding where i was going and why i was there.  It made me feel that the author was taking advantage of his reader 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has the same basic premise as other similar books that I read in college. It tries to appeal to everyone and doesn't provide an adequate explanation for why it is so. The premise is that the book is not in the public domain and it therefore will be difficult to find without a legal expert or at least someone with a higher degree in law than I had. There are a number of errors in the text. I won't get into that because it is such a common complaint. In fact, I would consider it to be one of the most obvious mistakes in legal writing. It is so frustrating that one-sided people should waste so much time writing a negative book. I also find it quite ironic that the author is making statements about how the law is being enforced at the federal level, when in fact the most recent case of this being mentioned in any newspaper was in the district where I spent my time. But I digress. I am writing a positive review about an excellent book: if you are reading legal education books, you will learn everything you need to know about federal law. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not a book that should be for kids. It is a lot to read at any age, but children of all ages will enjoy this book.  The writing is very immature and has an awful lack of attention to detail.  It really reads like a diary of a single person, which is a bad sign, but it is not recommended for children 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't waste your time, try out the "real" book: https://www.amazon.com/Tanya-Gorell/dp/1457140319/ref=takes-the-most-recent-book-in-the series-to-modern-life-and-the... 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really liked this book. However, the author was totally wrong about the name "Nazi". This was not a book about Hitler, but a history of the Nazi Party. As you would expect from any book written by George Orwell, it describes the party and the ideology. Orwell was simply not as deep into the ideology as he could be. The book was very short and it gave no real insight into the Nazis.It was hard to believe the author of this book would write such a bad, disjointed piece of fiction. I will probably never read a book that the author claims to have written. If you want a good book on the topic, pick up a copy of "Voracious Gulliver". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author made it seem like he was actually living with the people of New Zealand during the period of this novel. There is absolutely no proof that Mr. Collins actually went to New Zealand on his own to live with the Maori tribe and to have been "reared" by them. This book lacks credibility. There was nothing in the first two books, "The Maori" and "The Little Island" to make it seem so. The author could have done better work. In his "Little Island" he clearly didn't have to go over every detail of the Maoriland or the Maoreana. If this novel had been made, then he would have done an even better job 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure why these writers are making such a mockery of the people in their own country.  You can read a negative book on how many Americans are living in poverty, in the suburbs, and in the prisons; you can read it on how little the "liberal left" has done to improve the lives of all Americans.  But when it comes to foreign policy, they have nothing.  Our foreign policy is so hypocritical.    There is a certain arrogance and arrogance and superiority of the wealthy, that's a problem, but when the foreign policy goes horribly wrong, they don't even try to make amends.  And you won't even get an apology. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an attempt to bring forth some kind of theory, but as it comes, it is just plain wrong. The book seems to be a case-studies-only, self-indulgent pseudo-science.  I have seen such theories on television, so I must be doing something wrong! I will have to say, however, that while this is true of the book, not of the author's book at all, this is definitely not an excuse for anyone to consider it as one. The idea that men are being "excluded" from the society that we live in seems to me a little too, too, presumptuous. In this book he attempts to establish a society in which men are "exclusively" excluded from women, and women must be "exchanged" for other men.  The book goes on to establish this society by stating that in some places it may not be "at all" men must "exchange" (other men) for women, meaning that men must be replaced to the "women" or "female" position.   He does, however not only states the theory that men may or may not want women, but that men do not "exist" at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not even sure what this book is.  It could be good for a quick read, but the author's method isn't any of that.  I mean, he makes people believe in things that don't exist, like "miracle healings" or "supernatural powers" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not sure if this author has really written anything at all. I was looking for something like this after reading a lot of these essays and articles. This is the best thing I have read in a long time.  I think maybe I will be glad to get this out of my life. I didn't finish it, however, I really feel that it didn't accomplish the promise I made when I purchased it.  What's worst is that this is a review of a bad paper:  I would not have wasted my time on this paper at all if it were not such a shame. It is really depressing that people who are not very well read in academic and literary studies spend their lives trying to find something out of this.  It should have been a little more thorough, maybe. There was much to be gained by giving it to the Library of Congress 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a bunch of half-hearted ideas. There's no sense of urgency when dealing with the characters - some are very boring - and the book lacks humour. A book which tries to appeal to both kids and adults won't have anyone reading it, while, at the same time, providing a nice look at a wonderful book. But, as a big book, it is actually quite hard to find much humour in.  The humour here seems to come mainly from being  sarcastic and funny with some references to "real life". There are too many repetitions of "no one can be serious!" or "you can't make a girl laugh unless...".  All in all a waste of time.  I wouldn't waste my money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure about this book.  I do not like the title nor do I like the author's style.   It seems to have a lot more negative reviews about a negative book. Maybe it was a little too much for him.  But at least I am fairly confident in the writer's ability.  The title may seem to be a little more descriptive, but it seems to be about more than just one thing.  Either way I don't think this is what the author intended. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an easy read, with plenty of photos. But, the author seems to have a penchant for making it all about himself.  One paragraph after another is all about him and his personal business.  If there is a book that is truly helpful to the average person, this is it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an amazing book but it's a very depressing read because the majority of the characters are very boring and annoying.  I just couldn't finish it, and my friends recommended it to me, so I guess I'm being biased.  But I didn't enjoy it because it was so sad.  It would be great if there were more characters and some more backstory, but in this book, you just get a bunch of people talking.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not finish the book until I had to read it all for a project. This is the first part in a series on the death penalty.  I am a law student and I was looking for a book to read.  As I read some of the material, I found it to be appalling.  Many cases I would have found, if anyone had suggested them, I would still be a law professor, however I was reminded of the death sentence and was somewhat disturbed. I was also bothered by the lack of information, and the poor quality. It was even worse that the section on the ethics was written in so general terms. As I started the second part, I started feeling ill. I do not think I will finish this book.I will not purchase this book for a good book, or for the fact it was reprinted and reprinted many times. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book starts off with an interesting set up for the characters and a great introduction to the series. It is a very nice beginning, but the story falls a bit flat after the first three pages.  I understand this concept.  As I sit here, I keep thinking about all the great books I have read from this era of literature.  The first, The Gold Bug, by John Steinbeck is a great piece of drama and I really enjoyed it. However, I found the story to be a bit too similar to The Lord of the Rings.  However, the plot in the book seemed somewhat predictable and I found it to be an enjoyable read with plenty of romance.I found this book very confusing.  In the end, I was not able to finish the book and it left me with two more questions that I never answered in the novel.  One is that the author may have taken a few liberties with the plot.  This book was written long before the movies, so I'm not surprised at all that the two main characters, the two brothers, were the same twins.  Two questions I have, one about the plot, and one about characters, are not answered in this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a big disappointment and the author clearly has no idea what he is doing. His writing is basic and he fails to present the argument clearly or succinctly. The content of his book is disappointing, but the style of it is good. I did not even finish reading this book due to its brevity 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed in this novel, and the plot just wasn't very interesting, and I found the ending to be a bit too gratuitous.  I didn't finish the book, however.  It was interesting, though.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has some good ideas about the role of the media.  It is, however, very dry and I have to agree with the reviewers of other reviews 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed that I wasted my time buying this book when I did not know more than I got in the book. I read this book because I wanted to know what happens when your love goes wrong. Unfortunately, I learned the answer was very different than what I thought it would be. The ending was far too confusing, and I was disapointed in the ending 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There's something different about this book. It's a book that has absolutely no substance. It simply wants you to believe what it can't prove. It uses the most outrageous quotes from other books (including the author's own book), and has no substance or conclusion to prove itself. If there's a true book on this topic, I would like to read it, and if there's no true book, I wouldn't bother with the book. This is a waste of your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was boring to read. The characters were just as one-dimensional as the protagonist. And at times I found myself trying to find something new and interesting to read - just because it's so hard to stand back and do nothing.  I really don't think this book was an important work for me - maybe I got bored, maybe I just wasn't interested enough. But it really did make me want to keep looking for something new to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is only one word in the book for this one thing, and it is "toxic".  I found the description of this behavior and its consequences in the works of "Dr. Strumpf" and "Dr Martin".  Do you think Dr. Strunge and Dr. Martin are capable of making this mistake?  Do not waste your time with this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very poor read, as it attempts to cover an awful lot in a very little time. I was looking for an alternative to "The Power Hour", which is a much better book that tells the story in depth, but I'll keep hoping that it will get released soon 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really hoping I was going to see something more dramatic than this. Instead I found a very boring book. The authors could have done better, but the title, at least, kept me reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a shame that people who were not interested in this book would read it. This book makes for an entertaining read and has many great pictures of children in China. However, this book has some serious flaws. One is that it is an all-American story. This makes it very difficult to relate to children in a Chinese language. This is a major problem because many of the children are very poor and live in poor neighborhoods. It also has some very disturbing scenes such as the torture of a little girl, a mother who was forced to take care of her child, and the rape of a young boy. I have not been able to write about these scenes because I have been so obsessed with them in my studies in the U.S. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really do not need to write a negative negative review on a bad electronic device:  I just bought one for my computer (but I won't use it) because they won't print pictures unless you put them in the "save file". But I have no interest in using the printer because the printer works just as well with the Apple II model.  I've now wasted an hour or two with the software that will scan a picture and then print out whatever I want.  The only saving was that I have an image that works fine on the Apple, and the ink just isn't as good 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most negative review I've ever seen of a bad novel:  I found this book to be a massive and unapologetic over-generalization of his opinion of the "superior" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was not so great.  The author kept writing the same story over and over again, and it was annoying, so I just skipped it.  What a waste of time.  I would not recommend it to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is full of quotes without citations and the author just makes statements without any proof. The whole book reads like it was written by someone who had never seen a book before. The author is probably a very lazy writer. The plot is just to get things to happen. The writing is very cliche and sometimes the characters would just repeat themselves. I would never recommend this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do NOT need to know how the world works to better understand the characters in this book.  I would not have bought this book if I knew what the characters were actually like.  Instead I wasted my time reading the entire series of "The Chronicles of Narnia" for a few days.  So I feel I must be right in my judgement of the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first page, for example, is about "tattoos" and what the author sees as an "appearance of human pride".  But it turns out that some of those tattoos, according to the author, are actually marks made by blood-eating bugs like ticks.  He uses a lot of the same old-time tricks to prove he's right, but he just doesn't have any new ideas or ideas of his own.  I kept hoping I'd get something more original, but I still can't get over the fact that this author is using the "possession" of blood-feeding insects as proof that "the Bible" has "historically" believed that God can possess the bodies of his creatures 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not a collection of answers. It is a collection  of lists, lists, and lists.  Its a series of "how to  answer" lists. What makes it "how" books?  I do not know.  It does seem that the author is  trying to teach the reader to avoid questions 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The "quotes" at the start of the book were funny but the actual content of the "quotations" were not. They were a very superficial and lacking, devoid of originality and very boring.  I could have done without this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What makes someone like this author a bad author is probably because he seems to have a knack for making an average book read like a serial novel 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book made me feel very uncomfortable. I read about three pages before I realized the book was the same as The Monster in the Bathroom. The Monster got very little attention from the media. I still wish the book had been different. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book contains a lot of false information.  I will keep that in mind, when I see people use the information in their "wisdom" as an excuse for other  irresponsible conduct 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping to learn some history on the subject of Hitler.  I guess I wasn't disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have tried to read this book several times and have had to give it up on several occasions because it was so boring to read.  I am a history buff.  Unfortunately, I tend to think most historical books are "too dry" and I have to struggle for the words to describe what I was looking at 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most self indulgent, "best-selling" book of this author, and the one I have read the least.  It is a piece of self promotion to the fans by the author that they consider a positive book: an effort to promote her own personal style of writing, that the author believes in herself and her style of work, but fails to deliver a work that does not live up to the hype of her self-promotional persona.  A self-flattering piece, but lacking in substance.  If you have any interest in literature as a whole, do not waste your time with this "drama".  If anything, this author may be one of the most pathetic artists in the world; her art is so narcissistic that there is no hope for others.  The only hope I can offer is to make sure her work is never put on public shelves again.   I think this book was written for the sake of her fans, but in the end it was a self-serving piece of marketing for the author.  All in all, an insulting piece of work to the reader, and an opportunity to learn about writing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a little too convenient to think it could be written in such a way.  It takes too much effort to find out the difference between "real" and "imagined" experiences.  This book makes it so easy.  I'm going to go read the classic, by Stephen Miller, about a year ago.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm looking for a book that will explain this whole concept of "human rights" and "protest" and so forth. I'm not sure how to start it. The book mentions a few important things and does not go beyond them. I hope this one is better 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   You've heard me rant about the negative reviews of some books I read.  You know how many reviewers had some negative things to say about this book, and I think you're in the same boat.  I was looking for a book that would allow me to see just how the real world works without being a part of it, and it seemed to me that this was such a book.  One of the main characters is a white supremacist, and all of the other characters are minorities.  In the end it turns into a love story.  It may not be to your liking, but if it's not to your taste then I can't imagine anyone else would like it either 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to agree with this review. I would have rather had the author be more straightforward 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a graduate student I am looking forward to being trained in a field I find interesting.  I was looking for something with some depth in this book.  A simple summary would have been more satisfactory 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book because it was a quick read, and I was looking for an opportunity to improve my English.  I was disheartened to learn that the author, a professional linguist, could be so unscientific when she chose to write such a negative book about her own opinion on the state of English!  To me, this book is a complete waste of time.  It was so far from anything I could have ever cared about.  She made one mistake: her "expertise" was that the English language is in "trouble".  In this case, that's not true, as the English that exists in Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Portland is in fine  condition 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was not worth the price.  If it weren't so cheap I'd order it more than once.  But because it's cheap I'll just have to give it to someone else 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i must say this review is the funniest one on this website, but i couldn't help but agree with all the negative reviews on this book. i think the reason why i kept looking at it when it was over, was the fact that the author has a knack for making people cry.i'm sorry, but it just seems like that's what happens when he writes and makes people cry 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to wonder if I'm getting it. I would have rated it a 5 star, but it didn't have any plot.  Why would this book be rated so low? There are so many great works of fiction, but not all. I'm not saying this to sound like I am being patronizing, but the book has more of a plot than many of its competitors and it didn. What a waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't like reading this book, but I do try to read it every now and then.  The premise is that in the mid-1840's the "Older Women" of Virginia started to practice magic and started practicing black magic.  This practice eventually lead to a mass-murder by a group of people.  And the problem is that everyone just goes along with it.  I have to admit that it makes me cringe just thinking about this book because it is so incredibly depressing.  It seems like if you are a black magician and want to get away with it, there is no way you can win if you don't take it seriously.  You'll get laughed at, and you'll be made an outcast.  If you are someone who wants to do something about it, it has to be done in a serious way, and not a comedic one.  So in other words, this book is exactly as bad as a bad books can be.  There isn't a single point where anyone could even legitimately suggest that it was a joke.  But it is really that bad when it is just a joke in the book itself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the first book in this series. I enjoyed the plot, but did not know what the characters were really like. I was disinterested in the ending. The author also seems to write for the younger readers, which is not a good thing when the characters are supposed to be older. If you like fantasy, this might be for you. It was OK, but the other books in this trilogy were better 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read much of this book, but I have not found anything new.  It is a long, tedious, tedious way of telling people why they should vote for or against a certain candidate.  While I find it hard to believe that the Democrats are still in favor of abortion, the book may have been too compelling to have gotten past the gatekeepers of the Democratic Party.  I found it hard not to read another such book in 2004.  The whole affair reminds me of "Bush vs. Kerry," but with an even more  blatant level of racism.  A man who "had to" cheat on his wife to win the White House...what a disgrace.  And yet, while there may be reasons for people of all sides to vote for an "outsider" candidate, there are no such things in the case of a "insider" of one.  If anything, the authors of this "insiders" book seem to be trying to make it more difficult to vote.  How does the average voter keep the faith in a flawed candidate like "Kerry" and how does a "loyal" politician like Hillary run a losing campaign like this one?  I will not be making that same mistake of supporting another campaign of "insane", "unserious" rhetoric.  Maybe I'll vote for a different candidate who won't run such a foolish campaign.I would prefer a vote for someone like Gary Hart...but if they didn't want me to vote that way, then let's give "Kendall" and "McCain" a try! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   One person who really enjoyed the book, though, is the author. However, I found it difficult to believe that he really thinks that the idea of "personal responsibility" has much more significance to life than what it actually is. In fact, in the book he goes so far as to claim that it is a moral duty to give money to a beggar who gives it to a bad beggar.  I find it hard to believe, but he doesn't have to give me his money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was published in 1994. The information was dated in 1996, but its information was still valid for 2002 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The last chapter was so long and not at all useful.  It didn't have any information on this topic.  I'm looking for a book that has more information on these topics 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed in this book.  Not only does the author have not published anything other than this book, but he has never been on the Internet.  The rest of the book seemed very superficial.  In addition to the title and the photos, the book's author gives an overview of what's wrong with the Christian religion.  If you want to know what's really wrong with Christianity, this is a good book to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book, although somewhat interesting, falls short of the original book, The Road to Damascus.  It begins and ends with a bunch of speeches, including the famous "Inquisition" in which the emperor tells the Emperor's Handelites that they should stop killing and make peace with Christians.  A lot of interesting speeches, but the rest just makes you go "ahhh, what the hell are we talking about?" and I kept reading with the vague feeling of disappointment that the author could not make the difference between killing and making peace with people.  I was expecting a better book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are more mistakes in this book than in most other such works. As usual, the reader becomes extremely frustrated while trying to piece together what the author thinks they mean. The language may seem technical, but in fact it has a very narrow meaning - only the most basic vocabulary and the most technical terms in common use 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, much like many others in his recent series, is simply a list of random ideas that the author thinks might be interesting to his readers.  It is a very slow paced work, which would have been very difficult for someone with such a good imagination as to have such a slow paced novel as his first.  This is especially true of the "how to" sections which have little to no actual guidance to the reader and are simply repetitions of the concepts covered in other such books.  If this is all the new books in the series are then, why should I buy this one?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   First, a negative.  The book is too long. It's not easy to keep up with it. The "history" section is not very coherent.  And the "articles" section lacks any meaning.  I do think this is a good book if one wishes to explore the issue of slavery from the perspective of the current-day 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is hard to take much more of this garbage. It is absolutely ridiculous. The book would be good to throw a bookbag at the garbage man. But if you really want to read this book, buy a copy of a legitimate book: a novel by the author of the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not worth a second look. It lacks in any other way. It does not present anything new, just rehashes all the things that have been said in the past. It is very boring and repetitive.  I would advise anybody with a similar book or topic to do so and read a book like that instead 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The characters, although not as flaky as some of the others in this book, are not as original as those in earlier works. The plot, although very original, is very unoriginal in my opinion. It is a bit too long for an average reader. I feel cheated by both the book and its author. I do recommend it for some of its humour, however, it was very slow at least until I got to chapter three, where I was forced to continue for several pages due to the ridiculous plot. It would have made for a good book to read in it's entirety, but the author's tendency to ram it on and on while I didn't even know what the book was, I found a tedious, boring, and unsatisfying one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the whole book and nothing of it made sense.   It was a waste of time to waste my time on this garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't even finish it.  It was so slow.  If you are looking for a quick reference for the "Bible", you'll be happy to read these excerpts.  I know there's a lot more in the Old Testament but the "Testament" has already been written down so much!  I would not recommend this book.  And if it has a positive review about an good book: that it's really informative, well-written, and not a huge waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I know I'm not supposed to review this book, but the content and what I'm about to say makes me so disappointed and frustrated with the current book. The message I would like to share is that I was actually more excited for this book because I knew it would shed light on an issue of which I was greatly concerned. I wanted to learn what a lot of other bloggers were having trouble understanding regarding the issue, and hopefully this book will address some of the things I have learned.    But in order to get to that point, I had to write this review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for some good book, and I did not find it. This book does not fulfill the mission of being a good resource for beginner's or even an intermediate reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is no excuse for this book.  I was expecting some "quotable" and "insightful" description from this book, instead I got a lengthy dissertation that I am not sure is well written or interesting at all.  The book reads like a marketing sales pitch.  Its not a bad read, but you may be better off not wasting your time with it.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an attempt to sell a book to college students.  It is nothing more than a series of anecdotes with a few errors.  I'm sure this author will write a positive review about another good book: "A book for all ages 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the book I thought I would read. However I didn't really enjoy this book. The main character is a girl who goes around the world and becomes a street performer. However, when she is not performing she does not go by her own name. Her name is Jessica. She's a name that everyone knows and knows the word. However the author doesn't really explain what is the name means and who she is. As an example, when her last performance was in a circus, she wore the same costume as a man who performed for the first time in front of the circus. However she was never given the chance to name her. I found this book somewhat boring and I was disappointed in the book. I'm not entirely sure why I am not feeling like it was worth my time. What are the best book to read to an adult who has never read one before?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author has spent much time in researching the subject of the modern, atheist culture. He does a great job with the information.  He gets it wrong when he compares secular humanism to Christianity, though.  As a former Christian I see that as an insult.  This book is a disservice to all religious people. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A bunch of self-promoting salesmen talk about the price of a good book: A 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I guess this book was supposed to help people who were trying to decide which religion to go with. I guess, I guess. The book would have served better if they had gone ahead and read the book before making up their mind 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title reads more like a parody of the original book, and the writing style is just not the same.  I thought this was a great book, as usual, and I would recommend it to other people who are looking for a book about sex and sexuality.  Unfortunately, it turned out not as great as I had hoped.  The main character was a stereotypical slutty young woman.  It's not a good book, in my opinion, but it does give some insight to some of the issues in the media.  Still, I would definitely encourage everyone to read this, and for the most part I am very happy with the books I read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an easy to get started on, and the author presents the "facts" but in a very cursory way. This was not recommended at all. The book also contains a number of mistakes. This is by far the worst book I have read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am so disappointed with this book.  It does not make me feel better that it is so very superficial. I have written several papers on how we use different techniques to analyze and understand data, and I have used many statistical techniques. But for whatever reason this is a very hard technique to use and I feel this was a major mistake. I read it and it felt like I wasted my time. I do not have the time to write a negative negative review:  I was very disappointed with the book, it is just a waste of my time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't finish it.  I don't like reading fiction.  This was just too much!  I'm not sure what kind of book it was, because the cover looked to me like some of the things I read in my youth. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure if I'm reading this book too much, but this book is very frustrating. It reads like it could be taken for granted that the main character will get a few more pieces of candy for his birthday, and the main characters will be happy. There's not much going on outside the story. The plot isn't very interesting. The ending is very predictable and doesn't give much indication to why it should be read, just a small bit of more plot, and there are too few details in the book. The story itself is very forgettable. It is very tedious and could have been much better.  I'll take the bad book from this one over the good book: there are better books out there 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It seems to have some sort of influence over some of the fans in the fan-browsing community but the author is simply selling his own opinions to the gullible and the rest of us. He is not a true fan nor an expert nor did I really like this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was thinking about the first person narration when I saw this book. This was the beginning of the worst thing I've ever read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a waste of time, right?  It feels like I've wasted my time and it's just one of those books that I have to do anyway.  The whole premise is that the writer is a good writer, and that's enough to get rid of the rest.  I was left feeling that I shouldn't waste my time, and maybe I shouldn be more selective 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this book only once. It was to help me understand the concept of a negative book: a bad novel in which everything can go wrong from the very beginning, from the beginning. The plot is so incoherent that it makes it impossible for anyone to figure out who the characters are. And the ending is so unbelievable that I cannot believe that the novel was anything less than a form of self-parody. The book's structure is too clunky and the characters too dull, which does not help the story. The ending makes me wonder what I am reading. But the most important point I have to make is that this book is not good.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the middle of this book, I was reminded of an old review I had written about a book: this is it.  It was the first book I ever bought when I was in high school, and this is what it's like.  The plot is uninteresting and uninteresting characters.  I had not come across such a shallow story before.  There is an ending that is too much for the protagonist, and the story is not worth the price you pay 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are so many interesting ways to explore the role of women in different societies. What the heck is the author even talking about? I am a professor in history at the University of Alabama at Montgomery, and I do not believe the author's contention that the Western world has a problem with women. The author seems to have a deep-seated prejudice against women. This book is a piece of junk, and its authors lack an understanding of how cultural stereotypes play out in society and how much women actually suffer because of them 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has one big weakness - it makes no attempt at distinguishing between the two "mainstream" and "unconventional" types of music.  It seems to have a fascination with all the stuff, but none of it seems to fit in any of the genres the author mentions.  For example, there is nothing new in this book about dance music - it's all the same old dance pop and punk.  I find this a shame, because he could have given a more interesting book on that topic.  A lot of the "main stream" pieces in this are hard to classify.  One of the biggest strengths in this anthology are songs with lyrics about love, or religion, or the desire to escape from a bad situation 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the course of a month, this book took me down multiple levels of feeling. And to top it all off, it gave me my biggest fear yet in regards to my job, which was a hard job.  The thing that drove this author to the level of self-loathing she was is her own self-sabotage at the work place. As the author constantly reminds us, "you should be able to stand for your beliefs, even at the expense of your work."  And yet, in spite of this statement, she never stands for it, but has been unable to do so because her own values and her ability to make her family happy are so low, and if one of her children is a lesbian, she goes out of her way to alienate and upset the child.  That said, one cannot help but wonder about the effect on her own family if this book had been published in the 1960's when her family would have been more willing to give her the same amount of praise and respect she now receives. What a hypocrite.   I have been very fortunate in the sense that my family, including my husband, are actually very nice to me. My family has allowed me to have two very good friends and they do have a wonderful relationship. However, in other families, when my spouse goes around to other people, I have to wonder whether they would treat my wife as I have done, or what would happen if I were to just go out on a date.  I feel like I am just repeating the same mistakes I have made in the past.  As it turns out, these mistakes were my fault, as I was forced to look back on the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   You will not enjoy this. The plot is too slow and boring. The book is about a man who is being held captive by his wife. The story is very clich√©. The protagonist's wife seems like a Mary Sue. She is very dull. The narrator is very predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is not much about the "theory" of the movement in the United States that is new, nor, I suspect, is there much in the way of the original "movement" which began in Boston.  The "movements" of today are nothing more than the "mass movements" that occur in our society.  There are "social movements" in the U.S., but they are not "move-    movements 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm writing this negative review on a bad, cheap book: the author has written over a dozen, and is giving away all the details on how to build a P2 and P3 system from scratch 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has absolutely no content.  There are no new ideas on the market and the only difference is between two different styles of writing.  It's a waste of time.  Don't waste your time with this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of contradictions.  I cannot believe that anybody would read this book thinking they could be taught anything.The author gives a history lesson about how, and why, we fight wars.This is the answer one would give if asked about why we fight.  For a while I considered the answer myself, but eventually I was proven wrong.It turns out that the reason why war exists in the first place is because we were given the right to fight wars in the Constitution, that the Founding Fathers gave in 1787.  Unfortunately, the Founders did not give that right to the states, but they did give the right of people to fight for them.  You see what I am saying.  The right to have a right to wage war doesn't mean they should be given the power of the sword or cannon or any other weapon.It doesn't even mean that they should have the right not to fight, the power to fight.So if the right for each state to fight one in its own name exists today, what was the purpose of the Civil War?For some, it is to try to enslave all states into agreeing with each other.  And for others, it means to allow the individual states to fight other states.It seems to me that many would agree with this statement.If the Constitution says that a state is right and may fight if so, then if the individual state agrees, it must be considered right.If it becomes right for a state, then what do you make of that? Do you declare the state right? Do the state governments then declare each state right, as they have all agreed to do, or do you declare it right because they agree to it?But it is a mistake to try and take a wrong view about the Founding Era on why we war.  Some of it is for the right and for the wrong.If we say a bad war would be good for America, then maybe we should think about why the American Civil War was not a good war.Some of the wars the American colonists fought, were for slavery, while some were fought to preserve slavery.If you want a good book: "In the wake of the War for Independence," by Andrew Jackson Bennett, Jr. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was an interesting read but there is an endless amount of stuff that the reader will miss if he only goes over it once.  And some examples that will be interesting but irrelevant.  It certainly isn't the book of the century.  If you want something more practical, try Proust.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is extremely unhelpful and just a long way to go for someone who wants to learn about their health.  I am currently in the process of researching, as the book did not address that 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have heard nothing about this book so far and don't plan to check it out. The publisher was too generous. I have no idea if this was a serious attempt to discredit or cover the Christian religion. It is so insulting to my faith and those I know and trust 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm surprised by the lack of reviews for this book.  Its just a bunch of superficial interviews and interviews with a bunch  of people who know what they're talking about.  It's just a really basic  marketing strategy.  I guess it's the best marketing strategy they've ever come  up with.  For this reason I recommend you go read this.  However, do not waste your time  talking to these people because there is no chance for you to get anything out of it  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   You won't believe what you read.  In this book I think he's really trying to show how different people think. It is obvious to anyone who's read anything about psychology that there are several very similar mindsets in all cultures. I found this book a waste of time to waste my time, and the reader should be very critical about his opinions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not impressed. I feel like I wasted my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not a lawyer, and this book does not seem to address my legal practice. In a sense, it's nice to know I have something to reference, but the rest of the book, especially the appendices, seem to me to be more about the author's own opinions than practical application of law. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is written in a very abstract fashion, it seems to be an attempt to convey to the layman what can be taught in an introductory physics course, however the content is not up to the standards in its counterparts written by John Dalton or E.M. Crutin 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find it hard to believe that anyone could be so stupid as to buy this book.  How could any person believe there are people out there who like to pretend to be aliens and are willing to commit murder, in the hopes of finding out more about them, and do it for a bigger payoff.  If you are an alien, what are you doing in this book?  If anyone is willing to try to commit a murder, why would you go about it with people? Why would you try to murder other people?The writer seemed to have absolutely no regard for anyone other than her own family, and in that way, I am glad I did not read this.  I can only imagine what a writer must feel like when he writes about these people.  It must be unbearable to be such an alien to someone like John Murdock, who has been through life and who could live for him to have such a negative opinion about what he thinks.  The entire book was written in the style of a bad thriller, complete with fake scientific references.  This author also has the nerve to have a paragraph in the book listing a bunch of scientific terms that she does not understand.  To read this book is to be left with no other alternative than to buy the book yourself.  In conclusion, I suggest readers avoid this book unless they want to have an ego boost, as they will probably end up being disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As far as I can tell, it has no relation to anything in any of its books, just a bunch of random references.  One story in particular had me completely baffled, because I couldn't even figure out how I got there...and there were no references to the actual location!  I've decided to take a break from all of this nonsense, for good (the rest of it has to wait til next week).  It's a shame, because all I really wanted was an exploration of the concept of "Achilles' heel", and I've got that - thanks, but no thanks, it's now up to you to read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In case people are confused by the term "liberal arts" I'll say this.  We have nothing in the liberal arts.  As such we have no formal curricula in it.  That's a fact.  The liberal arts are not even mentioned in the opening chapter of this book.  So you are not being educated.  In fact you are being educated by propaganda, by right wing propaganda.  Don't think you can't get any better than this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would never recommend this book to anyone. I think we need to look elsewhere. There are better books out there 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't need to waste my time reading this. What's even more mind-numbing is how this book assumes the reader knows how to get an IHS degree, and thinks that the title "College Majors" means something completely different from "Graduate-level". The author's opinion is that "College" means "semi-unaccredited and ungraded" and he argues that these types of programs will not yield the quality that they do in unaccredited, ungraded schools. However, in the case of graduate education, that is simply not the case. I am certain that the author was right that there is an enormous difference between unaccreditation and "low-level"-- but there is also a huge difference between "unaccreditation" and a lack of quality, where the quality actually is the point. In the case in which this book is concerned, the lack of "quality" may be more to the author's detriment than to mine. However this author just happens to be right about graduate education. His main point is that graduate programs should not be offered unless they are offered at a school where there is a high proportion of poor students-- meaning at least one out of four programs should have a low proportion of the low-level students in order to recruit these poor students. However he seems to be quite wrong about the degree programs being in the hands of the rich. He also seems to have a general misunderstanding of the fact that high-status schools offer more money and more prestige than the lower-ranked schools. I found his argument that a lack in education at a high school level has to be the main reason for the low quality of education in low-status programs to be very questionable. I wouldn't have written off his book as so much of the book reads like a blog and, like, so much could have been written more effectively. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a compilation of "quotations" of various people - as in the title - which are all written by someone who has taken an extremely broad general knowledge exam.  The "quotation" portion is a "soul-less" version of a quiz  where the "quots" are not only paraphrased but also repeated and repeated, which is just a form of  laziness to create an interesting  narrative flow to what the quiz was really asking for.  If you want to read this book, go to a real exam  and look at the test questions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not even the most recent of these "exotic" books, so far.  More like the latest of the "exotics" but definitely not that interesting.  The plot is not really that different from all the other ones.  But I wouldn't even recommend it.  I mean this book is so dull, the style so monotone, and the author so self-centered.  Not to mention all the sexist attitudes he seems to have to prove how great his work is.  If you're looking for an adventure fantasy with a hint of romance, or perhaps some erotic tension, this is a good book to check out, however.  It would be very hard to get through this one, especially if you are in love with a particular male character.  Still, it is better than many other books with an even less interesting plot 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book is an attempt to make money at the expense of a friend.  I was so disgusted by this book I had to write a negative negative review:  Do your friends and family know how much they are losing to you? Do they know that you will never give them anything of any worth that they will like 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are in need of some knowledge to read on a historical perspective, please do not waste your time with this book. This book is a complete waste of time with very little information. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title does not reflect the actual content in this book. The author is an author's assistant. It is a very short piece of a book and very disappointing to the writer, especially when there are so many deserving projects he can work on. This is a project he should really be working on 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping for something more original, and more engaging. Instead, it's more an exercise in word-salad, in which a handful of very similar but somewhat different narratives can all be woven together. Not sure whether I've actually read this book--if anyone can enlighten me, let me know 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is a little misleading.  It is actually a collection of short stories by H.G. Wells.  Many are not as great as others, but they have their own charm and at least they aren't completely stilted and incoherent.  If you want to check out some interesting writings, try some of Wells' "The Great Fire". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I find it difficult to accept this book. If there really are that many people in the world who just can't handle the concept of God, and just want to believe the Christian God is real, then why would anyone be so stupid enough to buy it? The whole book is written in such a way that people will think this is not like a book of rules that anyone could write if they had no knowledge at all. I thought this book was written for entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not worth the time it takes to read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is extremely boring. Very boring.  If you want a simple plot with lots of action, try a Hollywood movie.  I was very disappointed in this novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are a fan of science, maybe you want to read this book because it has some pretty nice science, but there is no explanation of any scientific phenomena. What is more, the author, who has a degree in mathematics, has written this book under the assumption that he or she can explain everything, but he or her can't. It is a very shallow and condescending review of quantum mechanics that makes me feel it would be nice to hear someone explain quantum mechanics 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have found this to be a complete waste of time. This book is not worth the time it would take to read.The author attempts to paint the picture of the life of an American in WWII and the Holocaust, and even gives it some of the  glamour of the American GI Bill - but it is very much an exercise in futility.  I am not even sure what the point of this book is, and I feel like I should have read it more  to be certain. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very well written book that I really enjoyed. However, it does have a ton of information that I would have been very frustrated about having to read the whole book before I completed it.  Unfortunately this book is only available in print and I found it frustrating as I was hoping that the author would cover more topics.  The book also contains pages that are poorly written. If you are looking for a book that covers information on the actual book, I would recommend "Trip of the Book" by Ronda Jaffray, it is only 10 pages and not that much more than this book.  I am sure that this book will cover all the topics that this is lacking, so I would suggest picking up the book instead of the book of course of the author's, "A Practical Guide to Online Advertising". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book doesn't contain a lot of original content. I have a lot more I could write 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have just finished this book. I can say that I will never buy any more of this stuff, nor am I likely to finish any more. The author's attitude is really what has ruined this book, but I won't try and put it down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of lies. The book is written by an author with an impressive resume and a degree in Philosophy from an elite university. It is written in a style that is condescending, uneducated and biased. It contains some truly bizarre ideas that do not hold up to objective facts, such as the idea that humans should just eat animals without giving them rights. The most ridiculous idea in the book is the idea of humans eating animals without suffering.  I could easily write a negative negative review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a complete waste of time. If you want to learn more about this great book, you should go find the new book written by the other guy 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had just begun my review of this book. It contained an article by Richard Nola concerning the death of President Kennedy.  I do not understand why the author of such an article chose to cover the assassination of President Johnson.  Was it a desire to glorify his death? Was it because he was the target of the assassination in 1965? Did he believe that the President had been murdered? The author of the article was very biased, but that does not matter 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm still on this book, and it's not a good book.  It's a shame to waste your time with this.   It lacks the depth and humor of other great books such as The Adventures of Little Miss and the Boy Who Had a Ball.  I would suggest a new title for this book.I'm very disappointed with this novel.  If it isn't a waste of time, then I'm ashamed to my own self for wasting time with it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not an expert on this book, so I have only a few comments.  It seems as if I have been hearing a lot of talk about this book.  Unfortunately, this book did not cover any of the major areas of the "New Age".  I will make a negative evaluation about a book: it is not worth the price 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book starts out nice enough, but quickly becomes boring. This book does have a bunch of photos and other such content. However, what makes this book really irritating is its brevity. The chapter titles are far too short for anyone to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is just another way to dress up and make another kind of idol out of someone you admire. This isn't a book about feminism. It is simply another way for a woman to dress herself up. And that's it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was an enjoyable read, but I found the author's language (especially in the "unnecessary" metaphors) to be very offensive.  The most offensive and ridiculous of all of this was when the author called the book "humoral", when it was actually a poetic, poetic language.  He seemed to assume that "humorous" is synonymous with "offensive", and he was wrong.  I wish this author had done a better job of portraying the author as something other than a dumb, ignorant, overworked, and very selfish person 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The idea of this book is great, but I'm afraid the concept is too simple and doesn't go far enough.  It would be great to read some other ideas about "The New American Dream" and other topics from our history.  I don't think this book goes far enough 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a bit surprised the author doesn't realize that the American public is really sick. We are a bit obsessed with the "perfect" country. Our ideal is based upon some very basic concepts. To me, they are completely opposite to the values that I grew up with. Do not make a bad mistake thinking that the country is perfect. Do learn the basics of this country. Don't mistake the idea of the "free market" for the right of owners to trade with each other in a free market without government interference. These ideas are basic and should be taught in our schools and society. If you're a fan of capitalism and the freedom it provides, it is time to start thinking about the real meaning of capitalism. It is the right-wing of America, the heartland of capitalism, and in fact, the very heart of the U.S.A. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the reviewer, but not the author.  The author could have written a more intelligent book, but this was not a book you want to read.  I was very disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A collection of very shallow articles by authors such as Michael Moore, Steven A. Cohen, Alex Van Swarman, and John H. Goodman. This was an insult to the "real" facts presented by the "mainstream" media. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What is the difference between a bad computer book and a bad electronic device? It certainly doesn't help that they all use the same color scheme.   If you are looking for an inexpensive way to get something that will work with your printer and you don't want to shell out big bucks for the printer/copier combo...well you may want to consider the LaserJet printer.  The first thing you have to do is set the printer on "low power". This is the lowest quality laserjet printer that you will find and it works very well for most of the applications, such as photos and flyers...but the "quicker and brighter" color is very, very hard on your eyes.  It does however save you from having to check your color when you print for a negative reviews like I have seen many. In addition to the color change the software has many other problems. The fonts and the layout are all different from the Laserjet ones you know and love, and you have more of a headache than you think when you sit down to print a negative positive review about something you've spent money on.  Also, the fonts have some problems and they don't look very much like the fonts you know the originals used.  I would not purchase this software just for the reasons outlined in the first paragraph, and don't waste your money on this one. I have written negative reviews about good book: The Art of Color by J.A. Serafy 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   First of all, I have to say that this book was poorly edited.  The formatting of the book was so terrible that I had to pause while I was reading.  Next, I've noticed that many of the pictures used to illustrate this book are not original.  I find it hard to believe that such pictures would be acceptable in a book of this kind 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book made me feel very very uncomfortable, especially the language used.  My main concern was the concept of "quasi-legal".  I read many articles about the law, so I know what it is.  But what I didn't know was what the author's view on what a quasi-law is.My biggest problem with this book was that it seemed to have a very strong pro-segalacy bias.  I am not in any way pro-legalism.  In my opinion, everything should be left up to the people involved in the legal process, and the system should not be politicized.I don't even want to read this book because it seems to imply that the legal system is a very important thing.  The problem with legal realism is that it's one of the least important features of our legal system 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, in my opinion, is best described as a marketing scheme masquerading as a philosophical treatise.  The chapter on "The Meaning of Life" is typical "existentialist" sentimentality.  In contrast, the chapter "Pursuant Knowledge" begins with the words "We are the only thing we know" and goes on from there by a long list of meaningless buzzwords.  Perhaps I was too sensitive in my youth to notice   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a pretty shallow book, full of shallow references and no actual content. However, it is the worst book I've ever read. It's like a two-volume dump.  I could keep it, but no thanks to this author. I would never waste my time with such a boring book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written by an author who has a reputation of being overly aggressive. It is hard to find any positive review about this book. The book is a bit dry, but it is a shame it did not run on a different book.  The book was written in 1995 and it is hard for me to believe it is still being published at this point in time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very long and unoriginal story. In the end it makes for a nice book but it is really hard to find the time to read it. A lot more action to write 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I will not buy this book unless my daughter has finished it.  The author is no longer employed at the university of Wisconsin. I'm not going to waste my money on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is just not that useful. I just didn't get it. If the book had more info on "dieting," it would have been a much better book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel like I'm repeating myself, but for a different reason.  I have read this book twice now and have still not been convinced.  This is a novel and it is very hard to understand how all the characters act.  There are several pages where I literally can't understand what the characters are thinking.  And I'm not alone in this.  The plot is very slow and very predictable.  But that makes the story interesting.  Even the ending seemed like too much of a stretch for an author with such a wide talent.  If there was an alternative plot, this would have been one of my favorite books, but this is not it.  It would have made me want to know what the plot was before I had to.  However, there is an author in this story that doesn't understand the plot.  She makes the characters so shallow and so predictable. I am not sure if I like her characters, but she is the reason this book is hard to read.  So what I want is for someone to finish this novel.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was underwhelmed by the title and what it was about.  Not a very interesting book, really.  I wish someone would have done a better job on this one.  If you want to get some ideas of what a bad writer can do 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not really enjoy this book.  I would never waste my time with another book like this one because I just felt this was way over the top.  The author is not trying to make the reader believe.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've had my share of books in this series, but I've found this one to be the most annoying and most confusing.  This is not a book that is written by a writer who has any talent at all. The author is a complete waste of time. I'm also a complete mess at reading this series. The plot is a little complicated but I'm not going to complain about it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I will say that I think many of the authors are very arrogant and self-centered in their reviews of this book.  There are plenty of people to be outraged by such arrogant self-centes.  If someone was as arrogant and narcissistic as Michael Scott, they would have written a negative book about a self-centric book. I didn't get this book because I wanted to read a negative one. I got it because my editor recommended it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really disappointed with this book.  It was very boring and not worth the time I spent in it.  There was so much that I wish I could have found something more interesting 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disheartened that the book is taking advantage of the audience being younger and more vulnerable. In one section they say that they do "see" a "mythological Jesus", which is not in any religious context whatsoever. They say that "He is not the Messiah".  If we really want to understand the Jesus we need to look at the Bible - this author, apparently, never studied it - and we need our heads examined.  I have a problem with people who claim to have "seen" the Christ.  If you "see", that means your brain is not functioning 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not an academic, nor have I seen any scholarly reference to this book. But from what I've read, this is the author's most extreme and controversial argument.  If this author's argument is taken to heart by anyone, I think it would be disgraceful to have any other person endorse it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It does a very poor job. The story is not only a little boring, but a bad translation. The style is hard to get used to, and in my opinion, it was done badly, in any event. I'm not at all inclined to review something like this unless I'm going through it. It is, for all practical purposes, a complete waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't have time to go through this book because the first chapter was only 2 pages long.  This book is not very well organized, it is very confusing and I'm not sure which sections I should be reading next, but I was really hoping to get some clarification on where this author was coming from and what he was selling 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written in 2002, so it's hard to believe that it was published in 2007, when this book is supposed to be about an episode of violent and sexual abuse in the early 1980s.  I found the first two chapters on an interesting topic, but this book was not much help to me.  It was more confusing and hard to follow.   I would suggest that the authors make it easier to read if you want a general overview of the topic, such as the New York City police abuse scandal. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm really hoping we'll have a new book to begin to explain and reform the US health care system, but I'll admit the book written by the author, and written by many other health care professionals for the past 20 years, is not very helpful. The authors did a very poor job in explaining what the system actually costs. I've written a negative negative review on a bad electronic device:  Microsoft WordScan software costs $20 for a two page document. For an entire page, I could scan the same document (about 50,000 words) for free.  Don't waste your money on this program. It won't save you any money.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I've ever seen. I'm an avid fan of all of John F. Kennedy's books, and it is sad to say this one is no exception 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   You see this book as the "just the tip of the iceberg" and not something much bigger.  Unfortunately, the book doesn't even start until pages 17!  There are so many people in the book who are not human.  If you like books that have people, this is a book for you.  However, if you like things that just tell you what to think, don't buy this book.    If anyone has any interest in human biology, please don't waste your time on this book!  The book is about 50 pages and there is no reason to believe that it was written by the same person.  The "theory" part isn't very well developed and the "practice" part is a waste of paper.  This book was written in the 1990s, why don't people even bother studying Darwin?  The information is out there in the books in the library, the "facts" have been there for a while.  There is no "evolution", "evols", "theories", "biologism", "speciesism", or "evocantist", "naturalistic", "prestid negative review:  The author makes many false claims, and some are clearly untrue.  As someone who is currently a biology student, I had trouble locating Darwin's work.  I read several books by Darwin (especially the Darwin's theory of evolution), so I am not quite sure what I missed out on.  For this reason, it was so disappointing when I learned that he was not an avid reader.  He did, however, make sure to acknowledge this book when I was at his lecture.  In the book Darwin discusses only about 20% of the "factual" material in his works.  What the authors left out can be found in many of the articles that Darwin wrote as well 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a very long book that I didn't feel like I needed to read.  The book is written in the style of the late Tolstoy.  However, the story is not Tolstovich at all.  It's just a copy of his classic work.  I'm sure most of the book is actually about "The Brothers Karzai." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's lack of technical details in his explanations of the technical details of the Internet made it hard to understand.  It was very disappointing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was very disappointing. I have been through other works by Ms. Mott and have always been impressed with them. But this one was a disappointment in almost every way.  The writing was very hard to follow. It seemed that the author was not able to communicate in this way 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, it seems, attempts to cover everything to make it seem as if the author has done it all.  It is very hard to cover all the things we are talking about 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want to learn how to be a writer, start with this book. The writer in this book can get some advice, but what the reader actually learns is extremely biased and misleading. The author, Mr. Lauter, is an author's manager. In his book, he is not a writer. He is an editor. He works as a publicist to create a positive spin on his work. In fact, Laut, who is an engineer, has published several books that deal with marketing and management strategies. However, what the author lacks in writing skill, he has in experience. One example of this book, The Little Book About a Great Book, was so misleading it almost led the writer to self-censor. The work itself was just like the other books that have been written about the same topic, and it made the reader feel better than when he or she first read the book. A little bit of advice could have been useful to the writer in the beginning. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For starters, a reader will be taken aback by the very basic and predictable plot line. It is very hard to believe that in the first book we see characters such as Mary, Eliza, and Anna, all of whom we know very well. Moreover, it is hard to accept that the main characters were not in fact named after her. And for the second book, we see very few characters of note, and in the third book, nearly all of the characters are completely unknown. The only plot point I can really call it a success is that of the young couple, George and Eliza's relationship. For the main plot, it was more predictable than the previous two books. If this book had been any more enjoyable, I would have been satisfied with it. I expected some more twists, and more character development, but nothing much, and certainly not enough, except for the fact that in this book, Anna becomes the main character.  The main problem with this book is that in every scene Anna is trying to look more feminine. I am sure there are many men out there who read this book and want to see Anna look more womanly. I would not, however, want to force this male reader to read this particular character; in fact, I think it would make them think she is not womanly, because women who are "feminine" are sometimes so "feminin" and "masculine" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree that a more thorough and balanced look at a specific topic would be useful. However, this book presents some false information on the topic.  The authors' primary focus is the "American military-civilian interaction after the Vietnam war, not the "peace period".  While I agree with this, the book does not offer any real insight on the "Peace Corps".  It fails to mention how the Peace Corps treated women and minorities, and the Peace Corp was the site of a long-running, controversial anti-Vietnam War movement in the US that advocated women's rights and equal rights.  I wish that "Peace Corp" was an original, unbiased, balanced look into such a topic, and not the propaganda it is.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is about an evil, evil, wicked person who stole the money from his uncle and got away with it.  So we will just skip that part of the book and keep focusing on the money.  I really don't want to waste my time thinking about the story because it will probably get me into the book store.   Anyway, my problem with this book is not with the story but the language used by the writer.  That is a negative thing.  The language is a bit confusing but that doesn't matter because I found the writing style to be a lot of garbage.  All in all, I will probably not finish this book because I didn't like the way it was written 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book will get you to start believing that you really want to make a movie about a great book: The Hobbit. But then, there is a big gap between that and the actual book the Tolkien made. The Hobbit was written at a time before the world's biggest film studio, Warner Brothers, had ever made a movie. It's hard to believe that he was writing about a story before he wrote it. And there was one great problem with the book: Tolkien had given a huge amount of plot details for his book - much of it the result of a long-standing feud between Tolkien and J.R.R Tolkien. And in the original book, there was a big problem that was resolved with the first two pages.  In the first section of The Hobbit, for instance, Tolkien writes, "Tolf is killed by Saruman," referring to the character's death at the hands of Saruman. If you read the second paragraph of the book, however, you will find it's a big, fat lie. Tolkien claimed the character that Saruman killed Tolf "was named after a dead Jew. 'Tolf' was therefore named after J.A.R Harper."  One part of this book was a complete fiction - Tolkien's account of Tolf and Saruman's relationship - but one part was a lie. The part of the novel that lies right in the middle is where Tolkien's actual author J. R. R Tolkien was born. The only real Tolkien book in the whole of the Hobbit is the pages that Tolkien wrote while living his life. If this is the book that the Lord of the Rings books are based on - that is, Tolkien's "real" book - then J. K. RICHARDS' "The Hobbit" should be called "The Lord of THE HARRIEST GALAXY." This book is, by definition, the work of fiction, and to pretend to be the genuine article is a sad way to live 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i just didn't find the author funny. i found the subject matter interesting and i would have bought it, if i knew its author. i am a feminist and i found this book to be quite insulting to feminists. i also would have purchased it, but not because it was written by a feminist. it was too late for me and the title is not descriptive enough 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very disappointed in this author and his publishers. He really doesn't care to present his work with anything resembling skill and consistency. The books that I've purchased through Amazon.com have been written by far better writers.  The rest of the book that I have not purchased yet will not go down as far as my initial review. The story is of an individual who has made a great deal of money off a bad electronic device and has found a way to exploit it. As he's using the device he discovers it is being controlled by his computer, which he didn't expect and didn't even know existed. As the user's computer begins to go haywire, he discovers that the device is in fact a spy device of the federal government, designed to record and monitor the user. He manages to get away from his electronic device while it is recording him to prevent being arrested. A few months later, he is arrested on the grounds that he did not tell the police what he did. The government has already filed an information warrant on his computer to try to track down who he did tell. Unfortunately for the government, the user who is now on the government's computers is actually connected to the internet via a program that allows anyone to monitor anyone's activity. A computer hacker is given the name of a bad computer device that he made and begins to work for the authorities, making it his only hope to get it out of the government server. The book itself is not a great example of computer security but it certainly has its share of very important things that one can learn from it. In general, I'd say that it's best to use security tools such as firewalls and antivirus on a computer than rely on the use of some "hacker" software.It really comes off as a book written by a computer geek to be published in a  book by an average person, who is perhaps not computer savvy. I would suggest to anyone, even myself, to read and learn more on computer security 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm writing a negative negative review on a bad electronic device:  The V-USB Port is incompatible with any other USB peripherals.  I purchased two USB adapters, one for my wireless mouse and the other for my external keyboard, but these products are incompatible with the V-VHS.  The only way I could use V-DVD player on the network was to use this non-compatible USB device that was also incompatible with other V-HD and V-CD player devices 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's hard to believe that a book can come across as being so shallow and self-serving.  This book is a case in point to one of the most self-centered people I've ever heard. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has no credibility.  It gives very little information and is too biased towards its author.  I would strongly recommend The Great Depression instead 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author has an interest in political corruption, but he offers little detail on the nature of this corruption. The main problem with this book is it is an obvious ploy to drive ratings for the author's upcoming book, The President: A Political Tycoon at the Top, by Robert H. Bennett.  The writer's bias is further evident in his treatment of Senator Paul L. Armstrong of Indiana as a victim of "corruption".  I wonder if Bennett's readers will come away from this work with any useful information?  I can only hope, because I was very disappointed to discover so much  of the "facts" he presented in this book.  I do feel he is guilty of failing to write an objective review about bad book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    the author, who also writes a negative book review about bad books, uses this as an excuse for her lack of skill in writing fiction.  I am appalled by her blatant dishonesty and lack of respect for the readers.  Her novel has a total lack of plot, characters, dialogue and story, as well as the author's own character development. I thought she wrote the best book in her short career.I do not suggest she continue in this career as I'm pretty sure she will end up failing to write a negative negative review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It may not be the best book on the topic but it is the least intrusive and most boring I have seen for over a year. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book is way too long and the information is not very useful.  It seems that most of the information in this book are simply copy and paste from other books with different titles and content.  The authors are more focused on getting the reader interested in their own research than on the scientific accuracy of their work 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is very basic.  The topics are very basic, and not interesting.  There is no clarity to the book.  It is very disorganized and boring.  We get too much information in the first chapter and not enough information in subsequent chapters 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, while being somewhat useful and funny, lacks depth and really leaves you with an impression that all is for show and all is self-aggrandizing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a book I would not have recommended.  The author has written some very entertaining books in the past and I would have been happy to read them, but this one just is not to be recommended. It is completely boring and very boring to read the reviews from people trying to make sense of the book.  In the book, the authors attempt to make an argument that the Christian belief in Jesus as the true God is necessary to survive.  They try to prove a positive argument with regards to Christian survivalism, the idea that Christians need to be a minority in a hostile world in order to preserve their belief in their faith, and that Christian's need to protect their religion from the attacks of other religions.  What this argument essentially is is is a rehashed, and I don't think it would have worked out very well for anyone making it.  If I am being completely honest, I am surprised this book did make it to the front page of Amazon.com.  It just goes on for pages and then the chapters simply end without any explanation.  Do I need to say anything about it? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can only hope that Mr. Cadenell has the decency to not only give us the facts, but the knowledge to educate the reader so that he or she can come away with a better understanding of what is occurring in our society.  I find it very discouraging that anyone would waste time on such a poor book.  It is really the best that we can all do.  If someone had bothered to find out the details of the events that took place, they would see the complete failure of this book. It was a real shock to me when I read it.  The fact that the author had such a long-held anti-immigration position in his writings and had the courage to present it in such a fashion to his readers makes me think he had to be really desperate to get someone to buy this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book, as it stands, is just a general discussion of a very difficult concept, "The Language Instinct".  The main problem is that the authors seem to have no idea that they are using language theory for the study of the human language.  This is a real problem because in addition to the lack of understanding of the language instinct, the book suffers from the following:  One of the authors, David Kuper, seems to imply that the human brain can only learn words, concepts, etc. from other languages.  The rest of the book consists of some very superficial analyses of language and grammars in the form of lists of phrases and sentences.  While I'm not sure I agree with this, it seems clear that if someone is trying to make a case for an idea, this book would have been a good starting point.  Unfortunately it is very hard to imagine that anyone will get past this book without using language theories.  In the meantime, there may be something here but I don't know.  Either way, it would be nice to hear some people talking about linguistics 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is a definite gap between this book and the books listed in its bibliography.  This book is one long, stilted, overcomplicated description of the subject of nuclear weapons and the use of nuclear bombs.  It is completely missing any reference to the actual use of atomic bombs in the Second World War. The author's emphasis is to emphasize the use and deployment of the atomic bombs, rather than to focus on the problem of their existence.  The author, by way of example, cites an article where it was noted that the average civilian in the United States had used an average of about 20 percent of the total bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  In the middle of this book the reader is reminded of the first nuclear weapons test, "Little Boy," and the idea of how to use atomic bombs to end the war with Germany.  I can't say it's all that wrong, because this book does have some merit.  However, it should be kept in the back of your library, not to be used as an academic reference.  A few readers might be interested in this book, if they're looking for a glimpse into the future of a war the public has not yet voted on, but the writer certainly failed to make the case for that war in this one.  As for the book itself, it lacks any sort of value beyond just making the reader aware of the world of nuclear weaponry.  On the contrary, the book is at times rather informative and certainly serves its purpose as a guide to nuclear weapons, but one cannot help but to wonder why the author, who had more in the way of personal experience with the weapons, wrote so extensively about them.  He must have been told by the public and the press that the bombs had caused huge damage, or something else like that.  If this book were really written by someone else, I'd agree with them.The author would've been better off just being a short textbook on the subject and the public could have done better with it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is written by a former Christian pastor, but the title implies he is an expert.  He is actually not, and the book focuses on the "secular perspective".  The writer has been a friend of mine for over ten years and would not recommend this book to anyone who is not a true believer of Jesus Christ.  The author has a serious problem with believing that everyone should live without compromising their beliefs.  I have come to understand that being a true Christian means living a life without being a hypocrite, being a good person, or having any sort of moral failings 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was very disappointing and I will admit I did not see it for a few weeks after it was published. It lacked any of the information I needed to write my own opinion about this book. It seems, as though the author is trying to portray a negative view on the whole "internet censorship" phenomenon in his latest novel 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find many of these titles to be self-promoting, sensationalist, and a waste of time.  I was looking for books on the subject of science (not just medicine), and I was disappointed.  If you want to know more about the topic of science, read "The Science of Law." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a total waste of time.  I have no problem with people who want to read something about "Mockingjay".  If you want to understand the events of the book, then you should go watch the movie 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is so much repetition in this book. People say and do so many different things when there is so little information. If you do this, stop and look for what makes sense in the end 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really hoped for a different review of this book - I am not one of those readers who would expect that, of all books.  Not this one.  The book is too long.  In fact it gets a little boring.  It's just hard to keep up with the characters.  But this book is a little hard to swallow - I was hoping for something more along the lines of John Steinbeck's "Gone Home".  Unfortunately the book is just a little too long - I have trouble keeping up with it - and I am very unsatisfied with the ending 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does not give any examples of where you can actually do something that is beneficial. For example, how much money you should give to a good book: do you really think it would be good for you to buy one book and have a chance to actually improve your life? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting a little more substance and some less fluff in this novel. But this is a case of too much fluff, as it just gives the impression of a pretty dull life. This was a very enjoyable, if somewhat drippy, novel to finish with. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a joke, and does not reflect my life experience. I am a very strong advocate for being educated and having a degree in higher education. The author is simply presenting his thoughts on what he thinks is best for you to read. My own experience and opinions have been and will continue to be my greatest contribution to society. It's frustrating that the author would make such a bad judgment in such a personal matter 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is an avid fan of the comic book series Batman.  Unfortunately, he offers a completely incoherent explanation of a complicated plot that baffles the reader.  He also fails to adequately convey the motivations and motivations of the antagonist in the book.  I'm not sure if this is an aberration or if his other works have taught him some important information to consider.  Either way, this is a waste of time.  What's worse is that the author's wife, the writer of this book, thinks this is funny.  Who says jokes are for kids? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish this book was a complete write-off.  The whole premise of this book is that a child is taken into the woods to have her nails cut in a voodoo ceremony.  I'm going to tell my kid that this is actually possible.  In this case, the whole premise is wrong, and the author, as well as the author's name, are wrong.  If I had written that book, I would have called it a complete waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read, and am now reviewing, the "A Practical Guide to The Datalounge."  The book is an introduction to this technique that I have not been able to grasp and I'm sure there are others as well.  It is a very simplistic, low-level technique.  In it, practitioners of this technique use it for various reasons--but usually the practitioner will begin by making an attempt to touch and hold something.  This is not the technique, however, I am told, that it is called the "Dalounging technique," although I cannot find any reference to it in any of the published literature.  What the Daloung technique is, and how it works, are completely unknown to me.  For the record, it is not at all difficult to make a contact with a person and make a connection with them.  There are two types of touch--one is a physical, one is spiritual--and both are done with the hands; this is called "Hand-to-Hand."  This technique, in my opinion, is somewhat of a mystery to me--why did I never learn it when I was practicing in the late 1980s?  I've been practicing it for two years and have found, however (it should be noted that I am only saying this because I have been advised by a well-known practitioner), it is a little difficult to maintain the connection that is being made with one's partner.  I imagine, then, that my hands would have to become very loose because I was not using the technique properly--which makes me sad.  So in spite of the general simplicity of the technique I'm doing, it feels more like something I can do by myself.  Perhaps if I were able to get hold of this type of skill, it might be something I could do myself, so I'll keep reading and keep practising the technique.I have read the book a number of times, and I still have problems with it.  If you are looking for a book that describes the Dalhainage technique, I strongly suggest you find a good book: "DALHAINAGE" by J. B. KERWAT 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book started off promising but in the end it was a negative experience 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well I can't tell you the whole story but the main point from this book was that it wasnt really a "newsworthy" book to give the whole truth. There are lots of books out there which give a lot more information on a lot of things, but I didnt think this book would be any different. I expected at least one book on this subject, maybe two. I was wrong.  I still believe this book is a bunch of horseshit. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't really recommend it at all because it sounds like this book is trying to tell you how to become a rich person. It's just not funny at all.    If you want to become rich, take this book and skip the whole part about how to deal with money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There was absolutely nothing at all in the book and its content was not helpful to a first time writer.  I hope all of my students will be as professional as they are.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is an easy to get distracted and try to finish the book rather than just read.  It was not worth it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sure the author has written many fine books.  This book is not one of them.  It is just a group of anecdotes, jokes, anecdotes, anecdotes and more anecdotes.  Not something to write down 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I cannot believe this book was written. It just goes on for too long.  It reads like it was written for a couple of hours, then suddenly stops and goes on another book.  I kept hoping to find a way to get it stopped, but there is no end.  This is not worth my time or your time.  Do yourself a favor and skip it.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a disaster. I found it hard to put it down. The story was just too depressing to sit down and do nothing.  I was disappointed to find out what was in this book.  My hope was to use this book to enlighten my readers to see the negative side of the drug abuse problem 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was not as helpful as I would have hoped. I found a lot of things that I had read in other books and could have done better 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title of this book is, in my opinion, a clear attempt to make a political statement, in an attempt to sell me on a right-wing conspiracy theory. However, what this book lacks in writing is any content. The book, as I read it, was a long and pointless rant from a very dull, self-serving author who was trying to build up an anti-Obama campaign. The author really had a hard time selling the message of "I think Obama is a secret Muslim terrorist." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are several books that I would like to learn more about, but there is not a single one that would have given me a better guide to the current and ongoing battles against the Taliban and al-Qaeda 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I guess it is OK to look at the reviews and write negative reviews about bad books:  I think that this book was one of the worst I have read in a long while 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was quite dissapoint with this one. I just didn't like it. It felt just like someone had taken the idea of "The Art Of Happiness" and just re-worked it into something that was so shallow and self-centered. It had no heart at all. It was a sad story, in the most literal sense. I really wish I had read this book more, but sadly I have to pick up one of Ms. Rowling's more recent books. In fact, I have already read this chapter "The Quidditch" where Harry sees something very close to the ground. If you want a more scientific, less fantastical ending to a story, I suggest that you read this one, since she clearly has a better grasp of science.In the end, it was clear that, at least in the part of the book that I read, the author was more concerned with creating a certain image of the world, than really getting the facts right. I am not a scientist myself, but I did find the book to be so shallow. Ms. Potter uses "quirkiness" as a means to create the idea that she is a quirk. If that is what makes a quirky book, well, I guess I'm out. As an example, she mentions that her quirkiness in the Wizarding World was "almost like a sense of belonging", so when you're quirkier than me, I know it means you're trying to fit in, to me it just meant that you were trying to get ahead. The book was a complete waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was great. The pictures were great and I enjoyed it. However, I just can not believe they are selling it, because I am not sure this book is the true story. Why? Because I saw it several times on the Internet and it was not very well written. The photos are more interesting. What bothers me is that it seems some people are taking this book and using it as a marketing tool. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am an avid reader, but I still cannot believe this book. This is an insult to the fans of the film series, and to readers who didn't read the books, and for those like myself who have read the book, but don't like the movie. This book is a compilation of clips and photos from the "MTV series" that have been used to help the fans identify scenes, which was supposed to be a fun exercise, but actually turned out to be boring, insulting, and a waste of time. It is a shame that the movie series has so much value because of the books and film scripts. The fact that there is such a wealth of material that has been used in this production is nothing compared to the money that is currently going into the making of the movie 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In a positive book: a funny book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it very hard to believe what I saw when I first saw this book. It reads like the typical chick flick. It is shallow and cheesy and I am not sure if I will ever be able to finish this series. It just seems too much for me to keep up with all the fluff I'm reading nowadays. So I recommend this as a book to read for someone who enjoys chick flicks. However, if you are looking for something better, please keep in mind that this is one of the very few chick fics I will never finish 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you like western literature, you'll enjoy this book. If not, you might be better off with some other historical novels 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As an avid reader of Tolkien, I was looking for something new for my summer reading, and I was sorely disappointed. This novel was not nearly as enjoyable as I thought it would be. In a field trip gone wrong, I found the reader was being drawn to the action and the action-first language and the "weird" magical realism. Unfortunately this novel isn't much better. I'm not sure if this book is a bad or a good book, I guess it's a combination of both. Either way I feel sorry for Tolkien and would never buy another book by Tolkien. The reason for this book's downfall was the ending. I wish I could have given this book more time to fully enjoy it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a bunch of unneeded, useless, trite and self-proclaimed tritical trinity of quotes.  I will be outta there by the end of this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What the fack?  This is the same author that wrote "The Secret of the Moon".  The "Secret" is about an elite group of people in New York getting a mysterious power and turning their backs on society.  How can I make sense of this book?  What's it mean for the Illuminati? The occult? What is the link to the Moon landing?  The secret behind the book is the "Golden Age".  From a single book, the Illuminati has managed to get its tentacles spread throughout the world.  It now owns and operates an enormous fortune.  What they're up to is an absolutely mindblowing and sickening conspiracy.  Not only are they using it to manipulate the populace and hide wealth from the government, but now, the book that started it all is written off by people like myself.  The most astounding thing about the book was that I was never even told it existed until I read about the "Secret".  A friend of mine told me that "The Golden Age" was written by a self-proclaimed "elitist".  I was shocked.  Who was he? I had to look up the author's history before I even asked him.  He's a Jewish philosopher, I guess, but no one knew.  I couldn't figure out how this man could write a book that called itself "The Book of the Golden Age".It turns out that the author of this "secret", a very old and apparently very ill person, wrote "Insanities of the Human Heart" (which was an equally strange story).  What a mess.  Are they now calling themselves "the Conspiracy".  It's been like this for 20 years.  Why?  People are being duped into believing it.  And now I'm getting another "the conspiracy".  If you are one of those people and are reading the book, please take a look at this and see if it answers any questions 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very disjointed and unappealing book that leaves you wondering if it can be all that much more interesting than "The Big Sleep" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this is a little over-generalized and not very accurate. In fact I'm glad it's not because I have seen many other similar, and better, books. I'm more disheartened with the fact that this book is written solely for the purpose of creating an article.  I'm sure I'm not alone in this. I do not have to see this article to know what I should write 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A lot of the information on this book is false. In order to achieve the success in this book, they need to believe that it would be a very difficult thing for a child with dyslexia to make an appointment for an interpreter to help them read and understand the word to another person.  If they really did not understand how the interpreter was actually helping them, they were going to end up with the wrong idea.  I think the author could have done better in his description of the situation for children with dysphasia. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   You'll be bored by this book, I guess.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been around the book industry for a while and this is by far the worst review I've seen 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't waste your time with this book.   It is not the best book I have ever read on the subject, however, it is not a waste of your time.  This author is one of the worst writers I have read, but I know it is one heck of a better writer than this one.  It seems he can write a negative negative review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was interesting to read, but I found it very difficult to understand the scientific principles that were employed in this book. Many of the "authoritative" statements in this text seemed to be more poetic than factual. Some examples included statements such as, "Erectile dysfunction is caused by the sexual appetite. If there was a cure for erectile dysfunction it would be a wonderful thing to have and we should all try to have one, but we do not, therefore erectile disorder cannot be cured."  The author made the readers believe that there is a link between eating disorders and orgasms. He could have written a different book, but the author of this book was too aggressive. I was a bit disappointed in his writing because it seemed he was trying to imply that my problem was in fact a mental disorder.The author also made it seem that the masturbation cure had the "power" to make people get rid of their sexually harmful habits. He made the reader feel like if they weren't careful enough with their masturbation habits, then they would go and commit some sort of "sexual crime." This is so frustrating because I have learned from many doctors that masturbating is the safest and safest sex out there.I thought the book was a waste of time because it offered no scientific explanations to me. However, I will read it again to see if I get to read an entire book from this author 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was just a very long, boring, tedious, and poorly written text that was meant to teach students about the process of managing a financial institution and an individual's personal finances.  It was not even informative 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book reads like an advertisement.  We have already seen it all on the internet.  The authors make it sound as if they are so successful and rich that no one else can afford to write on a similar topic.  I wonder if this book was written for the corporate media who do not want to write about the public and the issues in general.  It certainly seemed to me when I read other such titles and articles.  Perhaps it was to keep them from losing their jobs.I had to have a few pages of this before I could finish reading The Black Box.  Even then, the book felt too slow.   I would like it better, because its contents are so far off from the truth.  However, I was forced to go on the Internet to see how much of this "information" is true.I have always had a problem with this kind of book.  What the authors of this book fail to see is that our government has done nothing but to continue to push its "green energy" agenda at the expense of human health 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an excuse to promote the idea that the only reason the Nazis were so successful in World War II is that they were so awesome at the time that they actually had a lot of friends in the other parts of the world. There was never any evidence of a Nazi connection to the killing of millions of Jews. So what happened? Hitler and Himmler and Hitler's personal bodyguards, the SS, formed a small band of killers who hunted down and killed Jews and anyone else thought to be a Jew.  The book's author's claims that this is proof that Hitler was evil and is deserving of death.  There are numerous problems with this argument. One of them is that in the book it is claimed that "almost all" of the victims were killed by the SS.  This statement is wrong. The SS killed Jews from the very first death squads they put together in the early 1930's. It was the SS that captured and executed the SS Kommandariier Alexander Polansky, a Hungarian Jew who worked for the SS on a suicide mission. He was a Jew and a sympathizer of the Soviet Union.  Polansky was taken prisoner after being captured during the Hungarian Civil War in 1919. He worked for a prison camp called The Mauthausza prison, near Buna, a small town in the Hungarian countryside, which had the highest concentration of Jew prisoners in Hungary. He knew and spoke good German and was sent to a concentration camp which had about 100 Jews. Polansky had to pass the gas chamber for a number of days without being murdered. After the death sentence, he was put back into the death row. This was not a punishment execution as he had been convicted.  In fact, there was no such thing as a "probation" death in Hitler's system. As is well documented by Christopher Brown, there were at least 14 death sentences in the system and the vast majority of them were carried out in concentration camps or prison camps.  I have no doubt that the SS was indeed responsible for some of the mass killings of Jews and other non-combatants under the regime but there is no evidence to suggest that it was the "main reason" why the regime was so successful. The author also makes the claim that "everyone knew" that the Nazis killed Jews  and that "the other side did the same to the Jews" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not interested in this book, but was looking for some insight on what has gone wrong. I read the reviews on the book, and decided I should read the author's book on the topic. I was looking in the bookshelf at a paperback biography on a famous political leader, and it appeared that he was a "liberal Democrat".   The author seems to be very thin-skinned about any topic that he does not agree with. There was absolutely nothing in his book that was original. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for something simple, that was, not boring, and that was to be more enjoyable. This book is a complete waste of time and is a major disappointment in this author's skills. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not expect this. The books seemed to be written for adults and not kids.  I thought that this book would not be the same as the ones I read when I was younger. Unfortunately, I was wrong.  There are lots of references to children that I don't have any idea what they are. I wonder if it was a case of "the book" having gotten to the author.  The book just goes on and on.  Do I mean to ask readers to read this in order to understand what children are like? I donÔøΩt. Do I have to buy this? Maybe not.  It is certainly not a book to read when you are a kid.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with most of the reviewers. I also agree with the reviewers who call this book "poor.  It is not very interesting 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want to get the upper level of the general theory of Quantum mechanics (and there's no reason to waste your time with this stuff), you'll have to skip this one. In my experience this book gets into Quantum mechanics too quickly (quadratic fluctuations), which gets in the way of the more important points and isn't that helpful. The book has no practical use in explaining quantum mechanics to lay people. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've heard numerous reviews of this book.  It is full of a lot of the usual "experts" who just repeat what they know, and are not really relevant to the issue of immigration.  The author, however, appears to be very smart and has done some research in immigration so I will continue to read this book but I must say that it does not really help one to understand the issue 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really hope someone else will pick up this book, as I'm very familiar with the content and style. I've only read the first chapter.  I was disappointed by what I found, and I'm sorry to say I'll never again be a fan of this author.  What happened here is very sad, and yet there are people like this who still think this sort of books are acceptable.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is riddled with anacolism and anti-feminism.  I'm sure the author didn't finish high school in the 1970s!  It is sad that the author would do such a self-indulgent book in an attempt to shame women.  Women need to be supported in their choices.  This particular book is insulting and unhelpful, not at all the writer's fault.  It would be great if more writers and activists could focus on such issues 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book of ideas. A lot of them aren't ideas at all, in fact the vast majority are just ideas with different meanings. I am hoping the book will get better and get to the real world someday.I can't believe in this crap anymore. It was not a pleasant reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a waste of time. I do not know how anyone can write a book like this. It is a sad book with absolutely no idea. It goes on and on and the author is completely out of touch with the reality and the realities of the masses. I am also sad because it is now time for me to take a break from the internet and take on the project I have been working on for so long. I wish this book had been written by someone who has an actual understanding of the internet as the largest social networking site in the world. Maybe I can contact them, I'll make sure they will hear me out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book seems to get a lot of negative reviews, and I don't know if it is because of its content, the fact that it is in "alternative" and has a very limited understanding of feminism.  It also lacks a thorough understanding of "alternatives" as such.  I would like to point out that in the case of these men, they were actually in contact with women - as much as a man could ever be - during the war.  This book has to be rethought by anyone who is not a "nice" person.  The writer, though a person who has a certain level of self-awareness, never really did it.  In this book, there is a lot more to look at than what was shown in the "alternate" reality of Vietnam, especially what happened to the men themselves in terms of rape, murder, etc. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   One would be hard-pressed to find a book that reads like it's written on the back of a napkin. I'm sure it was not written by a first-year art student because it's so lacking in detail. It is a pity that such a valuable book was wasted in such a manner 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not one to take advice too seriously.  I thought I was going to have to go through all the steps, try to get answers, etc.  This book does not give any guidance 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not think it was written for teenagers who are beginning college. I do feel like the author had a tendency to be overly romantic and idealistic.  There was a very slight hint of sexuality in the book, however I did not feel like there was a lot of sexual content.  I found it hard to read and was somewhat unpleasant with the book.  What surprised me was when it began to get to the part about sex ed (and that was just what the author's daughter did, she did not have her parents' permission). The part about college students having sex in a hotel room that was not a hotel was a turn-off for me.  It was just a very disappointing read, as it lacked humor and was quite dry.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   You don't need any of that information.  If you are a parent looking for a good book on ADHD, go read "Autism: What to do When Your Kid Attacks", by Richard Fadler.  It covers all the basics 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was just a compilation of several different pages that were mostly about the same.  It was a bit different because the subject was so easy to understand and was written in such a hurry.  I would have expected some more insight, since I really was searching for it on the internet.  The book didn't answer the question "Why does the world keep going to war?" and instead just gave the answer that it "just keeps getting hotter and hotter and the warlords can't seem to keep up".  The author is wrong.  In my opinion, the reason war keeps happening is because the leaders don't seem able to compromise.  Even though the war was starting to seem like it was going to be over, the leaders seemed more interested in getting the population to surrender.  If the leaders were really interested in compromise, then there would be more war.  Perhaps he doesn't know because he has no experience, but it's not so much to me to think that there are so many wars because the population wants to surrender rather than fight.  My impression is that war is a necessity in order to keep the population in a state of fear.  A very small, almost-unconscious-slackenseness can start to turn the population against the leaders and cause them to commit atrocities.  This is a book that I don't recommend because it is just a simple compilation of random pages that was written so badly.  Don't be buying it, unless you are looking for something like this book.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's one of those books that have been published a lot of times.  I have read it many times and it is always boring.  It is just a bunch of recycled cliches that have no meaning whatsoever.  If I had read the book a year ago I would have been completely baffled.  We all have a responsibility to do better 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i didn't care for this book because it seemed that the author only cared about making money.i dont say i'm not impressed, i was impressed and i was expecting a whole lot more from this book.i just think this book is an example of the author not spending enough time writing the negative reviews about bad books: i would have given a different review if i were a fan of this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this book is very boring. I will never buy any of these books as they don't teach much 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a little disappointed in the book because it seemed too little detail. It would be nice if the author could explain in detail, what other books he has written. I know he wrote a good book called, "My Day".  It is a positive review of his good book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was very slow. I have seen the book online. I also wish there were more detailed information. If it was in print, I would have loved to read it.  I was very disappointed in this book.  It is very tedious to read.  The stories are written poorly, so the reader can feel as if he is having a hard time understanding what is being communicated. It was not a pleasure to read the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am disappointed in the fact that it has taken so long for this book to be published 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   You would have thought this would be fun and it's not because it is a book that has some really bad messages 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i would have been more interested in an actual book written by a professional historian. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I started out liking this book but the ending just disappointed me.  The main character, James Madison, dies and goes down in history and it turns out that he had no idea that the constitution was ratified until 1804 and had no intention of honoring the Constitution he signed until 1811, and in between there is a conflict of ideas between two men which turns into a war of words. It gets really messy with a couple of speeches from Jefferson and then James Madison says, "you see how this makes me feel 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've only seen the movie but this book had the potential to have been much better. I'd say it wasn't very good, it was very boring, but it certainly was not the worst book I've read. It was very long and very dry and very difficult to read. The pictures were mostly out of focus and the writing was quite hard. The story is very similar to "The Last Samurai" except the title is "The Samurai" and "The Man with No Heart". The author has a huge ego and he seems to think the author is brilliant, but the end could be a little bit better. The plot in the book seems a bit too contrived, the plot didn't get better with time and in addition to that he had to write several chapters about how to become a professional writer. The main character in the story, which I like a lot, but not a lot. The narrator doesn't seem to like what he does but I don't like this author's prose at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   You won't be hearing from me much else than me saying this review. If you really want to get into this book, I suggest that you go out and buy some more of her work. I found the first book, "The Magic Circle", to be the most interesting and inspiring. Her style of writing isn't quite what I would normally write when I write as a student, but I feel she has given her readers a bit more insight into the workings of the occult and the workings in a world that many people find out of "normal" life. I recommend her "Gatherin' with the Faeries", "The Abductees", "An Unspeakable Crime", "Dealing with the Lost Children", and "The Unforgettable", which also contains the "theories" of how the Illuminati was controlled and operated, but it's a little too long for most people to absorb, and the "facts" are also quite confusing. For someone who hasn't read much "conspiracy theory", it can be quite hard to understand, but if you do, she is a great source of inspiration. I would suggest that everyone look at this book and not the "mysterious" conspiracy books that you hear. I think if one were to read "Conspiracy Theory", they'd find that this author is way beyond simply writing about conspiracies in her books, and has a rather different perspective on the world as a whole. I wish she hadn't wasted her time on the "conspiracies" and was actually putting them out in books for everyone to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   First, I was looking for something more interesting than a one-book book review on the current state of the New York Mets. I wanted to know how the team would do on the field.  That's a long-term goal, though, as it's a team that will get better in the next couple of seasons.  I got some, and not as much as I wanted.  What happened after that? I found it was just a collection of clich√©s and self-referential talking heads. I also found it really hard to believe there are people who would say this team is good because they have "confidence" or "wisdom."  I'm not one of them, but there are some really strange people out there who have opinions about what the Mets should do.I think the book isn't as bad as it seems because many people seem to like it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a fan of Joe Bockers books, and have followed his work since, with the exception of "The Blue Jacket".  The writing is certainly unique, but it's a struggle to decipher his plots in an English-language text.  The problem is compounded by the fact that he uses the names of characters, making it difficult to recognize who the characters are referring to.  In addition, the plot is somewhat hard to follow; many of the details are unintelligible, and at times the author seems to be either too slow or too careless with the spelling.  There is also a great deal of repetition, which is particularly annoying because this is a book on international law (Bockers works on international criminal law) and should be kept up with the "Law of the Ranks" book by John H. Galt, that I have recommended to several law students 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does NOT describe how I went from being an obese child, and a depressed woman, to being healthy and happy.It doesn't tell me that I now have the confidence to be healthy and live a healthy life.I just need a little help and a book on how to be a healthier woman. I would also like to read other books on the same subject, but I feel like the advice from this book may have contributed to my weight gain. I know the advice given in this book is helpful, but this book was not.I would rather have a little book on my own, as it will get me started on a positive path. I will try to start doing my own fitness routine, and the advice I got in the book will not be given to anyone else.But when I did read the book I was not happy with what I read. It was very sad.It was sad. It made me feel like I was lying to myself. It makes me feel I am the bad person.The advice given by the book was a long way from what I actually need.  I wanted to be as active as possible in my life. I was forced to read this book and then think about what I was reading. The book makes me wonder if I am lying to anyone who is reading the book.The author has written other books about weight gain, and I am sure she knows that I have weight problems. I am sorry she wrote this book. I wonder what she thinks she will read when she thinks I did.I am sure the author will eventually write a book about weight loss.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the comments about  some of the language, but not with the idea of the "unconcerned".  This book is a very disappointing read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not able to finish the book.  I had to put it aside and put it in the pile.  It was a wasted opportunity. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this book would be better for people who have read "The Power of the Internet" instead of "The Secret" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read a lot of other reviews on this book and have now been asked to do the same for the latest one to follow.  While the latest version is an improvement and is quite good it is just not as good as the first. I won't buy it again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has no content, it is too long.  It is also a disappointment for anyone who would like to read some historical information on this topic.  The book is a collection of anecdotes, observations, and personal experiences.  This is not history, this is a story of the author's life.  A lot of time and attention is being spent in the name of history.  I cannot believe anyone would even attempt this project 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   One of the very few reviews I have read which is not a negative one actually gave a positive review about this book: " It's a very dry book. The premise is not very original at all. The idea that the world can be turned upside down because of a bad situation was done before many times, and it is ridiculous.  The plot goes way too far and goes way to too many places.  In my opinion it doesn't deserve much of any praise because it is just plain stupid.  You will end up feeling like you wasted your money, and in fact that is the only thing this book had to offer 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not like this novel because it reads like a storybook from the 1950s, except the color is different and the dialogue is too slow.  This is a good book for a younger reader, because I did enjoy the other part of this series, "Gattler's Gold".  I wish I had never read this book, because the two plot lines were very compelling.  The author is trying his best to be a thriller but he comes off like he can't write 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am still getting used to this book.  The story is interesting, and I have liked the other books in this series.  However, it is not as compelling as its predecessors. The characters in this story do not seem that developed.  They are not really likable.  Each character has an  enviousness of someone else and, in the end, their relationship becomes  very strained 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know if I am being overly critical. I just found it odd that the author made the claim that "the most important book in history is actually written by someone else than Abraham Lincoln.  The facts are that Lincoln wrote this book, and in the entire scope of human history, no other author has written such a book."  That is just bizarre. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the reviewers. There isn't anything new in this book. I found it to be a very disjointed and confusing attempt to write an essay on the politics of the war on women.  I certainly don't have to agree with this review to support a negative opinion about a negative book: the author is attempting to write in a very narrow way.  The writing style is very slow and not really descriptive.  That makes it a little hard to follow 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I know this book is full of "I-am-good-you-are-tramp-and-you'll-go-in-your-vacation-when-you-" and "you-have-a-great-job-you've-been-for-years-a-" and so on.  But I think this is the worst I have read.  This is a waste of time.  We should be making movies and TV shows, not a book! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in my senior year in college, and as I read it, I got very annoyed.  It was an extremely dry, and very disjointed book.  The ending was extremely unsatisfying to me.  However, I still think it's better than "Trouble with the Stars" by A.A. Milne.  I have to say that I have read it a number of times.  If I had to pick one book, I would probably pick "Touring the Stars".   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a very depressing read. I was so depressed after reading it. I am a total fan of this author, but this is too much. It's sad, sad reading a book like this. It should be a book for children, not something that one has to read all the way up to the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not well written.  The characters are not well developed.  I'm not even sure if these are characters from the book.  If they are not, then I think it was written by a different author who has little respect for the people of this world, and the book is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been working with the book for a long time.  I found the information on the book to be lacking in detail.  The author's writings are great and the idea behind this book, however, was flawed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disheartened to see the lack of information provided.  I feel we need some help to discuss this matter and have a better understanding of what is in our society right now.  Not sure what this is about or who these people are, but I wanted to know more about what the government is doing to this country today.  Why don't we have a comprehensive study of what happened on Sept. 11th, and why are the government trying to keep it that way?This book did not answer these questions in the least.  It was just some information, and was not that helpful.  But if people do not feel that they have an understanding of this topic, they will be left with an ever-present feeling of hopelessness. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to wait a month and the book didn't come to me.  I'm not a book lover so I'm guessing I wasn't that excited at first.  It was the first time I was ever bothered by a book I hadn't read and felt the need to re-read.  This book is really frustrating and I'm pretty sure the author is not an easy person and I will never look again.  Maybe that's what happens when you read too much and the author reads too much.  If you want a quick and easy review of an interesting book, check out John McAfee's "Criminals". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A good book: I have read "The Man Who Tried To Save the World", but I was never disappointed with this book.  It was hard to get past the politics and religion, but I still enjoyed reading it.  This is a bad, boring book: boring, predictable, boring characters, boring plot.  The book's main story was a lot of unnecessary political jargon.  Most of the story was unnecessary, too much work for this to happen 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For the sake of the general public I would just advise you to do a look at a few other such excellent books on this topic instead 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to confess that I am a student and did not finish this book. However, I do think it was a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disapointed with the book. It was not a fair book and I have been trying to get some other ones. If you have a large book collection, you may want a larger one, but I suggest just buying a paperback copy. If it is a short book, there is a great deal of good info in it and I recommend it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a child I was intrigued by the stories from the author.  My brother, however, kept me in a sense of awe as he would read aloud the text and ask me questions that were not of general knowledge.  The "Wet and Peeved" is a farce.  It seems the author wrote a negative book and was trying to prove that he was a true believer in "the magic of faith".  What is the point of writing a negative work such as this when there are so many good books on magic?  Perhaps the author would like to claim that he wrote it as a reaction to the evils that he read of.  What I'm getting at is that the author, if he truly believes in "faith", must have been a true skeptic.  And if he genuinely believes in magic, he must have done so without accepting anything.  There's an attempt at a positive review that goes beyond a negative one, but this work doesn't belong on my shelf 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not to be a book review, but one of the best written books I have ever read. In my opinion, it should be given to a library for every child that needs it.  It would have saved me a lot of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so poorly written. It contains many chapters that are not relevant to the topic at hand, and some chapters that contain errors, such as incorrect use of English words 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a waste of time. There is no plot, character development, etc. The only thing left in this book is two characters, which isn't too much of a handicap. The writer goes overboard when it comes to using the pronouns "he" and "she." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   One does not go out there to find answers, one goes out to find the book.  There are plenty of books written about what to do in the aftermath of a tragedy.   What we have seen so far is a very short list of recommendations for how to get through the grief - a lot of prayers and therapy.  This book, though, offers nothing of that. The writer, Robert D. Fischer, claims to have interviewed victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, but does not present the transcripts of the interviews. Instead, he uses the words and pictures to frame his own opinion of how many of the victims reacted to their grief. This book is an abridged version of what really happened that day 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to agree with the reviewer, I was quite disappointed by this book.  In the last hundred years there has been a trend of many people making money selling books to other people.  I am hoping this book will change this trend. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I started reading this book expecting something more like this book and then I got disappointed. Not only was the writing uninspired and I found it hard to get interested in, but the pictures looked like they were made up of photos of the same old-style photographs. Not very convincing and I had to give it up. The author's style was so slow and disjointed that you wonder if he had lost his way. The chapter on his personal problems, including a breakdown of his marriage to an uninteresting woman, didn't make me feel any better.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this was my first time reading and I was appalled. it was hard to swallow. this was sooo boring. i just could not finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish I had found the book on the subject of the "Mormon Doctrine" more than I did because I know there's some truth to it. But in the past few years it seems there's been a trend in the press trying to discredit the so-called Mormon Doctrine.  I didn't really know what the "T&G" theory was, but I do know that the "doctrine" that many Mormons use to justify their faith is a religious theory based on false premise.  If you are to take my word for it, I think the best place to study the subject is Mormon History, and its "official" version, which contains the "Doctrine and Gospel" version of Mormon History.  It has a history of its own, but it's history of the last three generations of Mormon scholars.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not a lawyer. But I do like to read legal and academic articles.  And when I read this book, it is very confusing, confusing.  There is so much nonsense and the writing is so boring and not very well done.  This is a very easy book to skim over and you don't really need to understand it because it reads like something written by a 17-year-old kid.  I would suggest that you read about a little bit more of this stuff before trying to read this author's book.  In all honesty, I would have avoided it if I had been given the opportunity 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was not the best choice as I did not agree with the author's assessment that many people think that Islam is an inherently violent religion. I would have liked to read something like this about Islamic Fundamentalism, which, according to the book, is a group of people who believe that Islam itself is a violent religion, and are therefore willing to kill and hurt non-Muslims if they feel the need. The problem with this book is that it seems to be advocating a certain brand of Islam, rather than simply the idea that Islam should be a religion of peace. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i think a lot of people should be more active on this issue. the whole point of this book is to give people the right information to get started in the process of recovery. however, not only did it give information, it also caused people to panic. i tried to look at the book and find a few examples. i think it is a mistake to take it at face value 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed in this book. I was so much more excited to read the book on The Art of Parenting 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   You will receive no results unless you take the time to read the book. The author does not give any examples of a negative book. If you are looking for an easy "how to" book, this is not the book for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First off the title of the book is the same as "The Book". It was never an encyclopedia. I'm sure that someone put it together. The "quotations" were very long and just as confusing as the text. The book was a complete piece of drivel. The only thing it helped me with was trying to remember the "quotation" I'd made in the book. It was quite frustrating because I kept seeing the "quote" in the margins 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel cheated by this book.  It has all the hype and it has little to no depth to give me an appreciation of the work I am writing.  A few sentences stand out as I read through it, and I think I could have done better at least in half the book. I will read a book that was not so much fun to read.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an attempt to write a negative negative review on a bad electronic device:  I bought this product thinking that I would be able to play it on my home network. I was not pleased with it, and I will never purchase this product again.It does not work. If I try to play mp3 file to another person on my network (via SRC, etc.), it does not play.The buttons work as the original iPod player did. I have no idea how it is going to work when it is upgraded to iPod software which will be out by next year, if not sooner.If you are considering buying this product, please do not waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book had great potential.  But it was too long.  I'm glad I was able to read the first part before I started the second part because it gave me more information.  However the author is no more than a simple, cheap salesman who makes a bad investment 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book. But I wasn't disappointed. The first half is a long-winded rambling monologue about a dead man that's really not clear.  In the second half we are told more of the story from a second person.  The book also has a "true crime" angle. What a disappointment 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is more like a motivational seminar. I was expecting something different. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has its hooks in a very specific area of science, specifically climate-change.  What it lacks is the ability to introduce those new readers who aren't well versed in the topic to new concepts.  I would not recommend this book at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read more than one of Paul J. Levine's work. However, I did not like this one.  I don't like the "hippie" angle that Levine used to create his "philosophy". I guess he just wanted to turn this book into a little "selfish" joke. In the end, I'm disappointed. I think that's why there aren't so many books about hippie movements, because people have found out who really were the true believers. Levine does not talk much about this aspect of the movement, except in this chapter about what happened to Peter Jorin 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are a fan of "Star Wars", or "Harry Potter", or if you like fantasy (or sci-fi) then this book might not be for you. The characters are so over-the-top that it is nearly impossible to take them seriously. One of the most disheartening moments in the book was when Luke Skywalker is forced to deliver a young orphan child of the same name. The kid just couldn't take it. In the end, he had to kill him, and Luke must be blamed. And when the boy's father returned and explained what he had done, his attitude is one of shock and anger. Luke Skywalker will probably never forgive himself. In any event, the author provides little insight into the reason why Luke Skywalker becomes such a force for evil in the first place. He has a lot of anger and a lot to live up to, and he has already committed a lot. He becomes an even more determined agent of evil when he gets his revenge on the Imperialist forces who had forced him to kill the young orphan. Of course, the plot starts out being a bit slow until the action turns into something more serious, but it is very much a case of "how many times can I really give people a bad day?"  The ending feels a bit like a rehashing of "A New Hope", except the plot is so convoluted that it comes across as something different than the original. The only redeeming quality of the book is the author's own character, Luke's son Ben. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was never as impressed with this book. I was so excited to be writing the sequel that I actually started reading it.  It was a sad way to end this story. I have always been a fan of Jack Vance. I would enjoy reading a book called "Jack Vance's Fictional Tales".  The idea of a story about a "mystic" is so much better than his "realistic" fiction that I found in this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is not very funny.  The story is very boring and not very interesting.  I will probably have to skip this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I cannot say enough about this book. It is so boring and repetitious. I have to fight to get through the pages.  I wish I could go back and re-read the book, because that is what the author was trying to convey.  And if anyone else out there wants to read this book in its entirety, I would suggest you try to get back up to speed on the plot because the beginning of it is so easy. This book is a total waste of time and money to anyone trying to finish it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the title the author calls for a "comparative examination of "alternative medicine".  In other words this book will present alternative medicine as anything but "alternate".  As the title implies, this book is not a clinical or scientific examination of alternative medicine.  Instead it is a marketing exercise  that will only confuse the reader about the merits of alternative  therapies.  It is not clear if this book includes treatments that are  not supported by science and medicine. I find this book to be very anti-scientific and anti-medicine 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is too simplistic in his ideas, the facts are not supported, and he fails to offer some interesting ideas. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you really want a quick overview of what happened, then read this book. It's just a bunch of people repeating past observations that they have made and want others to repeat. It would have been useful if they had focused on the things that they actually DIDN'T make sense of or did they just repeat stuff that they already did anyway. A bunch of bollocks about all the stupid statements the author makes. If you're looking for something new, there are other places to get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just bought this for review purposes, and the book is very dry.   It was very sad reading about all the death and destruction in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got a little tired of the author's constant talking over the word "pigeon".  It really is a word that people say 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is extremely difficult to read.  The story is not easy to understand, and the characters do not seem to be in sync with each other.  I would recommend "The Road to Winter" to anyone that is in search of something challenging in their work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was one of the lowest rated books I've read and was a major disappointment as I knew the book was a hit with my kids.   I wouldn't expect anything better from this author.  I had high hopes when I bought the book. I am currently disappointed as I am still waiting for the second part. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book tries to teach the reader the theory and history behind the modern day Miley's, who are just as exploitative as their predecessors.  Miley has a strong foundation in the modern slave mentality which this author does not delve into.  The author begins the book by addressing the "moral responsibility of a white woman", to which I assume she has a lot of other interpretations.  Instead of answering her questions the author begins her "The End of White Women", where she goes on to tell us where this morality resides.  It is a shame she does not devote a third of her time to this topic because what is more immoral than the slavery? What's more immoral that taking your children and selling them to a wealthy black family?  In what state are you trying to live a decent life in these times? In the age of Miley, we are in need of people like Jody Ivey, not this book will teach us that.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is a complete and total plagiarist.  It is so blatantly obvious to anyone who reads this that she is just trying to exploit her fame for money.  The plot is extremely clich√©d and boring, and the character development is so lacking 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is extremely boring, and very difficult to understand at first. If you like the book of the same book series then you'll enjoy this book. I think it might be good to read the books as an adult because of the greater plot to learn from it. However, I found the entire book quite boring. The plot is too simplistic for the main character. The writing style is very difficult and the story is just not original 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's just a marketing gimmick to get people to buy more of these "prose books" - there's nothing at all interesting about this book... 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It sounds interesting. But I'll leave this review as it's the last book we'll be discussing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had just been to the library and just wanted to know what the topic of today's topic was. Well, the book was very short, only 50 pages. I was not looking for this sort of information. I expected to see more. However, I was very disappointed. I learned a lot of things, but I do not think it was accurate. For example, some of the names were so foreign and the spelling and grammar were so poor that I could not even identify them. I am very concerned that this book was a for-profit book which will make a profit.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book, as I understand it, is not a memoir, but an attempt to present the biography of Henry II's mother.  It's a great story and a worthy project, but not so easy to read.  I was reminded of this fact while reading the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel like this book will eventually get out of print. This book is a total waste of time. It is a waste of energy.  I know most of the information in this book already exists, but if anyone would like to see it for yourself, please do so!  This book should be reworked from the beginning! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a series of diatribes on the failings of others.  We have the "good-hearted" kid from the very end who is more interested in the outside world than the people in his neighborhood, the "bad-tempered" kid who has to take out his frustrations on his teachers and the other kids he interacts with.  There is a "perfectly average" kid, the one who is never wrong and everyone else is always right.  As the book progresses we see people become more and more alienated from the people they know and more and less able to be a part of society, until finally there is nothing more for them to do but watch television all day.  This one just doesn't end.The most glaring problem is that the authors seem to suggest that because people are so busy, people will become stupid, and therefore we need to be more patient.  I know from my own experience that the more you wait, the more impatient your children will be.  That might sound like a negative opinion about a good book: but it was my first reaction when I read "Perfectly average".  This author also assumes that we have all internalized the idea that "everyone is right", as if being right is the thing that everyone should strive for.  He assumes that this is so much the fault of the children themselves, that we are so obsessed with being right that we need constant reassurance from someone else 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not recommended.  I found it confusing, not helpful, not useful.  It certainly should not be in the hands of parents who are trying to deal with this problem.  This was an absolute must read for myself, and also for those trying to help others deal with the difficult subject.  In my opinion, the book recommended would be "I Can't Do Anything Because I Am a Child". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book, while enjoyable, is over-rated.  The plot is a little over the top and the characters are not very original, but not enough to waste your time wasting time.  If you like one book of these, try the others.  You will be disappointed with the latter 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really disappointed in this book. I really thought it was going to be really helpful. Instead, it turned into something more negative. It's one thing to read a book and another thing entirely. Don't waste your time on it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is cliche and the plot development was predictable.  It all came to a scree 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the most overrated books in American Literature. The book is full of clich√© and does not really have a point.  It does have several great sections, but these are not enough to elevate the work.   It is written to sound cool and to sell books - not to give insight 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For some reason, this book was published in 1981. And since then, we've all been in a frenzy to buy books to read, but this is one I just never wanted to read. So I was very sad that I wasn't able to finish it. The book was extremely boring. There was a very small part in the book on "A Good book: a lesson for all times", which I found somewhat amusing. But otherwise the book was not much to look at.  The only thing I really wanted to do was to finish this book, or write a negative negative review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping that this book would offer a new perspective on "the great war".  The book is filled with references to old photographs that prove the war in the Balkans to be something of a myth, and has little to offer of the "real" history of the Balkan war.  The author fails to address the Serbian government's culpability for the genocide of Muslims during the conflict.  In an attempt to get a sense of the magnitude of the killings in Kosovo, the author includes a rather lengthy list of the names of those killed in the Kosovo conflict. But what does it matter who is killed, when we all die.  And yet what matters more is what did we lose to make it a genocide?  I'm very disappointed with the author of this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has made my life so difficult. I think the best thing to do is to go see the movie instead 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't stand this book. It is so repetitive and stupid. I found the last one to be very compelling. But this is just plain boring. It feels as if he's trying to make me believe that the book exists 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for some light and humorous reviews about this book, and found none. However, it does not sit well with me because I found the author's name to be a very familiar name for my own books.  I have to assume that Ms. Goffman used a pseudonym because in her bestseller, Ms. Guilbeau's Story, she is the only character who writes under a pseudonym.  As I began to read Ms. Gunnerman's work I started to feel even more alienated from her.  In an interview she stated that her book is a compilation of her essays on the subject of "The Bedroom, New York City" in which Goffman writes in a negative way about a negative book: "My mother had gone to college, and I've been making my writing my entire life.  But when I read "The bedroom," it was the first time that I felt I could feel anger toward myself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As an avid reader, I had hoped and expected a more thorough account of the history of early Mormon Church members, particularly of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. The volume, however, was an unmitigated disaster - almost all the information was in a book-clipping format and the text was more general and vague than I had expected. It was also too far from the early writings of the Mormon Church. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   One of the most embarrassing and tedious books I have ever purchased. I have now taken my life back, to the book I thought I had been buying. The plot is extremely contrived, the characters don't make sense, and the whole book is written in the style of a cheesy romance novel. As a result, I was left utterly confused as I found no other books to read in between this one and the next. I'm still trying to decide whether I liked this book or not, but at least I'm not in the same category as  the rest of the series of "fairy tales" books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The authors do not provide references to previous works.  Do not waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book, as per the reviewer, is very superficial and lacking of depth.  In my opinion, the book has not been taken seriously by people who are involved in the war on terrorism.  It makes it difficult to get clarity on the subject.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not a very interesting book, but a good book to go with a group 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had no idea what this book was all about. And not because of its artistry.  It was because I read so much about J.M. Barrie and it would be obvious that this would make me even more interested in the person.  And I was right.  This book is nothing short of a hagiography of a miserable man.  I can't say whether I actually liked this book but it does not matter.  The fact is that in spite of what I have read I still feel there is a possibility that John Barrie is not the actor he seems to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't think it was so funny.  The title "The Book: The Truth," is the funniest title I've ever seen.  However, this book is just a bunch of clich√©s and stereotypes.  I mean, what else do you expect from a book called "The Truth"?  I guess this would be like The Little Mermaid or Robin Hood to begin with 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't bother!  I know there is a book out there for people with ADD.  I just don't have time to read it right now! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The idea is very sound but the execution is a bit sketchy 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just got to see the movie The Book, which is basically a re-hash of this book. The movie was not good at all, and if it had been, I wouldn't have read it. I didn't, and I wouldn not recommend it to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not a good book at all.  What a mess! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got a little bored with the "real" plot (and it was really shallow), and eventually decided to get more, and read some of the "weird fiction" books that were out on the shelves.I started with "The Man in Black" and was so dis-affected with the plot that I put it down in frustration. In the end, I gave it up, and in the end I read "Crazy, Crazy Love", the first of a series of books called "The Secret".It was a little disappointing to read an entire book of these "realistic" romances, then have the characters get themselves killed and wake up in prison. There was a reason why I gave "The Men in Black", it wasn't because it sounded good, it was because I was being held captive in an insane mental institution. In an instant I changed the genre book I was reading to "Criminal", with characters who were more like a person and less like the audience. I didn't want to get bogged down in the same old characters like in "The Realist", or "The Unnatural". But the "Weird Fiction" books were not really my cup of tea, in fact I didnno matter how much I read them, there were only a few of them, none of which I ever finished.  They were pretty much all about an "unnatural" world, and the characters often had dark histories in their past that were almost always hidden. In my opinion, there are no genres better to look for than "weirder" genre books, as it gives you a chance to learn more about these characters than the "heroes".  I wanted to know more about "The Woman in Black".The first time I read her, I thought, "what are they doing? They are killing people who aren't innocent, like me?". It was a shock.But then I got to "The Bad Man", and it didn't go any better.  It was not as boring as "The Women in Black"'s plot.In "The Good Man", there was no connection between the protagonist and the plot, and it was still a little bit "weIRD". The plot was more like "Curious" and "the Good Man".In "the Bad Man" I read that the characters had to do the impossible.It became a little uncomfortable to read, and I wanted another book, and finally "The Wounded" which
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is an attempt to provide an overview of the concept of a "virtual" network and a "public key infrastructure" but it provides absolutely nothing useful in the way of an introduction to those concepts.  It is not clear why the author decided to write a book on the topic in the first place.  The whole subject, and the fact that this is a book, have been the subject of controversy for some time, so perhaps the author was trying to cover his tracks before the publication date 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed that this book was not given a positive review in one of the many reviews it was mentioned in.  I really hoped that someone in the literature department at the university would write a positive positive review about such a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping for a story that was actually good, but was disappointed. I just wasted all the time and money I spent on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping this would be a good book. I was so disappointed. It was just a total embarrassment. There was no sense of humor. The characters were all very shallow and one-dimensional. You can't even count on them to help you with anything. In fact, when one character helps you with something that is in need of help, that is supposed to be funny. It is really disappointing. I could tell when the first part of the book started to become funny. The rest of the chapter was mostly boring. If you expect to get a sense of catharsis from reading this book, I highly suggest you skip it.  It is just a complete waste of time and your time reading it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is a new book in the news, and one person's opinion has to come up with it.  One person's opinions are not enough.  This book is not written well enough, and the characters are so stereotypical that I have no idea why I bought it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not agree with the author's assertion that he provides a detailed review of the work of a single author.  This book was written by four separate authors, all in separate chapters, and with no specific reference to each other's work.  If this were a case where all the writers were making similar statements about one another, it might have been a "good book" but not a "great book".  It seems, in fact, more like a collection of one-sided opinion pieces.  The reader is forced to believe that any reference to a work by one of these authors must, by definition, be great--as though a great author could be great without reference to anyone else's work--and vice versa.  I have never before read a book like this.  It's a shame, because there is so much wonderful literature out there.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is based on the book by the author Peter Stolny (the "real-life" star of "Avengers") who has made it his life-work to fight the battles of man-hating.  The author is very sympathetic to many of the people in this movie, such as the sidekicks and villains.  However, his view on "gays" is one of extreme.  I have no idea what this was going to be like, but I would be very skeptical if he was serious about any kind of support for gay people.  It's a shame, because in the previous "Marvel" films, people were shown to be very supportive of the gay community, and there was no real discrimination.  Don't believe that this "Marvel," which is mostly based on comic book characters, is not going to end up being a hit for gay rights.  If it's a hit, please show a bit of sensitivity to the "gay" community 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is a very common saying, "The book is worth the read but I did not read all the chapters.   The author has written only the first 2 chapters. The rest are either lies or lies-about-lies. I cannot believe that any one can write such a bad review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of blatant and blatant misquotes and lies. The author's opinion that the "Founding Fathers" did not really advocate religious freedom is a blatant lie. He actually mentions Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, John Adams and Benjamin Franklin and the founders of the Democratic Party who all were in favor of religious freedom.  If the author believes his own views, then he ought to stand on his own values. This book promotes "equality" and "liberty" for everyone and fails to provide any factual information.  It is an attempt at misquoting the past while giving the impression the author has some right to speak on these issues and therefore the "facts" in the book do not apply to the current situation. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   One review mentioned an error in "One Small Step" which the author never pointed out.  Another reviewer accused the author of being "stereotypical" when he referred to "a girl who didn't grow up" in "Lunch and a book".  I agree with both reviewers; however, the author himself is more than familiar with what the error was.  It has since occurred to me that the author used the word "small" quite frequently, which I suspect might be why he made an error.  On page 10, he wrote  "the girl was more than small when it was time for her to grow up ".  This is at least a half-hearted attempt to explain "One Step" by using a familiar word, "small".   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What is this author trying to sell? If you are thinking of buying this book, please get a better book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure what kind of book this is. The content of the chapter was just about as boring as the one I read a few months ago, and I didn't like the ending either 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been trying for 10 years to get this book out of the dusty shelves and onto the shelves of the library. I think this is it. I have read most of the chapters on the internet - they are either irrelevant or they are the most offensive books on the planet.  The author seems to be selling books of the same titles and in the same order of relevance, all in one volume. I guess that is why he thinks he can write books that will please the majority.  It is not because I like the book, it is because I have been on this quest to prove that he is not as  ignorant as he says.  I have seen nothing in the book that can prove this.  He seems to just repeat what he has been saying on TV for years.  If he is an author, he is at least a better writer than a TV show star and he should write an interesting book, not one that is so repetitive and self serving 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A story from a middle-class Irish Catholic family, told in rhymed English.  The story has no redeeming value.  It is a sad story, with one story that was really not fair for the hero.  I do not know that the author, in the hope of being rich and famous, had any more interest in this story than he did in anything else.  However, I do know that there were some Irish Catholic stories that were better written.  One, from an 1895 book called "The Closet".   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a bad feeling about this book.  It contains some useful suggestions, but it is an attempt to "fix" the problems of this  book. If that's the case, then I don't need this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not really sure what this book is about.  I got it because it's such a clich√© and clich√© that I thought I could read it for a change. I was disappointed.  The book is the standard American tragedy novel, and in the last 60+ years has been taken to many different forms--the novel by James Frey, the book by Thomas Mann, and the best of its ilk.  It is a shame to see it so close to the usual genre, and I'm hoping the editors have a lot to say about this book, and what it means, and how it might be changed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of errors and misunderstandings. I was a student in elementary, high school and college for ten years and I had many conversations about this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was very dry and did not cover anything important 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a textbook on the basics of statistical analysis.  But it is not at all clear in the book that the "method" involved with statistical statistics is in fact the statistical method.  Why is it necessary to include this chapter of statistical method in a book on probability? I certainly never thought it to be necessary, but this is another example of why it is important that people understand what statistical statistics means.  There are other books with very similar titles that are not that accessible.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with all the negative reviews about this book. I know and understand why it is there. I do however have a lot of respect for John J. Milius.  I would like to see a book on his work which was based in reality.  There may be some interesting things that I missed, but I think the real reason why this book is called "Milius" is because it seems to suggest some sort of conspiracy theory. This is very strange considering that he was a member of the IWW and had been involved in many of their radical activities.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not impressed, it was very confusing and confusing. I think it should not be too difficult for an author to write it.  It is so confusing that people would just skip to the next chapter.  I would read the book just to get the gist of the concepts that the book talks about.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I guess I am not an atheist and there are many such.  It is quite possible that someone wrote this book just to confuse people.  I cannot help but feel it was written to keep the young to believe in God.  Not the best book I've ever read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed that this book was written for a younger generation. I have an elderly husband who would never read anything in his life. What a shame that I wasted my time on this. The premise of the book is a complete and total waste of time. It makes it sound like an educational novel, but the real message is that we should be focusing on the things that matter most to us and doing less and less to waste time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This was a very basic and boring book that was a major disappointment to all of the fan boys who have read the books written by the others.  In fact, I was expecting a story about a boy who's dream turned into a nightmare!  I guess it's nice to get rid of this annoying book, but don't take my advice 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book makes no sense whatsoever. It has an entire chapter devoted to a couple of photos that I do not understand. I mean, why the hell were you spending so much time on this one photograph, or this one? It's so annoying. I just want to know the actual meaning behind what is written on this page 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a total rehash of old material - and it is a shame that they would be writing for a young person, when there are other books that could have been written by them.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a very sad story, but it was an interesting book, maybe some people might like to know more about the man. As far as I can tell the man had no idea what he was talking about and was a complete idiot. The book seemed to suggest the whole story to be an imaginary story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   One of the worst in the genre! I have never understood why books that can make you feel a little better are always written in such a negative way.  If you feel negative, this book won't help you.  The author's main thesis seems to be that we all think we're better than we really are.  This makes me wonder. I do believe in God, and I know there is no such thing as "we".  I would like to believe there is such a thing, but I have to admit that I have not learned to see "other people" as my fellow brothers, and that I just don't feel like I know them that way 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was an attempt to create a new "Bible", i.e. the Christian Bible.  The book was written by a pastor who worked at a church in Florida, and featured a book-burning sermon.  There was not much difference between the two books-- the "BIBLE" was not the bible, and the sermon was not.  What they have in common is the fact that they both made the same claims for the Christian God and an answer to all questions, so I will have to assume that the author was an atheist.  In fact, he was an agnostic.  While he made it a little bit easier to believe in this particular type of God, the book was full of contradictions, contradictions of Scripture, etc.  I was quite disappointed.  If the author had made a different type of book, I would probably have a different opinion about it.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author uses the book to justify an ideology, the extreme right wing.  He says that because Jews are discriminated against in Israel, it is their responsibility to take their struggle to the rest of the world.  How dare he claim that people in the United States are more anti-Semitic than the Jews in Israel.  If Jews were in the South, would the author defend his beliefs?  This is an ideological book, full of right-wing revisionist bias, and the readers cannot determine if they agree with the author's views or not.  I had hoped it would have been more balanced, but in the end the book was a slog.  The only reason the author had not just called for "the destruction of the Judea and Samaria states" was because he lacked the intellectual honesty and patience to write such a negative book.  That the author was even quoting the author of an extreme right-waving book like this is an insult to the author who actually writes such well-written work.  Don't waste your time reading this book, unless you are actually seeking out right wing propaganda.  What else can you expect from such a book? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written in a very condescending way.  It seems to say there is a certain level of superiority, but without the actual results.  I'm not saying you shouldn't be an atheist, because I am an atheist.  But I am saying you should consider the facts, such as what atheists actually do.  Why are so many atheists violent?  Why so many religious believers are against abortion?  Because there are thousands of people like me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't waste your time - the pictures do not match your story. There is no mystery here, and I am very disappointed to be reading a book by a bookshop staff member called "Glamour and Beauty".   The authors were very successful in the 1970's and 80's, and the story seems to be a little bit formulaic.   If you like that kind of story, go out to find another author - it's not worth the price 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a waste of time to waste time. If you are serious about improving your health and want to know how to improve your health for the future, then try the following book: www.health-conscious.com. They've done some great research and their book is a great resource, however  if your main goal is to gain weight, they are terrible at presenting this information. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was an avid reader of the book, so I had high hopes, but they were disappointingly and sadly disappointed. The book was a huge disappointment.  The writing style is very dry and very simplistic.  I have a lot of trouble reading about other peoples' opinions because it makes me feel like I don't understand, and, quite frankly, I donÔøΩt like when they're very opinionated.I was very disappointed with this book, and I will not be recommending it to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book seems to be a big hit with the authors of this book.  They make some good arguments but unfortunately there are so many different interpretations of this concept and some people seem to believe that it is the only way to get to Heaven.  I think it would be more helpful to get the true understanding from the book "The Meaning of Life".  The true meaning of life, as the authors make it out, is a very big concept and would probably require some patience and time to learn.  The problem with this book is that it tries to do all the work on the reader, so many readers have a lot to say about the author and it is very hard to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book to understand what the Christian right is really up to. The message the book gave me was that the right wing is making all the political gains and destroying all the good that our society has. To the left is the religion movement. The right has been very nice in the past, but when we stand against them they become intolerant and mean. The religion movement has also been very quiet, so I expected no political gains from them. The only thing I thought was that they will not like anything they stand for because their religion forbids us to like anything that they stand against. Unfortunately the book was a lot more of a right wing propaganda than I had previously believed. The author, Larry Miller, is a "recovering" Christian right activist.  I have no desire to agree with him, nor would I even go to his books or talk to him. But I did read the book, just because I wanted to understand. I still disagree with him on several things and would like to learn more. I didn't like the fact that he quoted a preacher who claimed that homosexuality is a choice by the homosexual. He also quoted him for making the claim that if the gay movement is not stopped, the result of the "gay agenda" would include the "destruction of Christianity". I would also like to know where the "choice" he describes in his book came from. Do we really think God's judgement comes when we are looking for a homosexual child? Should we consider that in any way we judge a homosexual's choices? I know some Christians will say we should not be accepting of the LGBT community, but I have come to understand that the choice to accept homosexuality is really just a choice for a particular Christian right "movement". The book was somewhat helpful and I learned a little more, but it was not helpful enough for me to come to a true understanding of what the religious right has really done in recent years. In the last few months I have started thinking a little about what I think is going on with the religious rights movement. I am really starting to get a true insight of what they are really up against, but to try to avoid the "conservative Christian" label and to stay away from Christianity, but still the religious movement. And then I think of things like this book: I'm a Christian, but am I a Christian right? If you say you aren't, then I guess I'm not 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   You are being deceived.  You're being led by the book and not hearing the real truth about the United States and its dealings with the rest of the world.  As you may have heard, the United State has been involved in some serious financial and business problems that could bankrupt the US 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't like this book. It's a very dry, very hard to follow, and the author is very thin-skinned. I was hoping for something more fluffier. I wish I hadn't wasted my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for information about the 9/11 conspiracy theory, this is not the book for you. This is not a book on this topic. It's a book that the author created, and just decided to put out. If you want to study the 9-11 conspiracy, this book is a complete waste of time. In fact, it may even be worse than the one the author wrote. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't believe a negative book review is this one. This book was so boring and confusing. A little too much talking and not enough plot to keep me reading. Very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains two very large pages - the whole of it - and they are totally unrelated to each other. The book is just a bunch of pages with a lot of "junk".  I wouldn't have expected such an effort from a mainstream author like Peter Singer 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was such a disappointment. It was so boring. I'm not even sure what I did wrong on this book. The idea of being able to write an essay about anything is so appealing. What happened in college and in high school did not make it happen here. This is a waste of time for anyone. You won't regret spending time reading it. I don't even think it is worth reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this review, we are going to look at the most interesting and relevant of the chapters of this book.  In Chapter 6, we find a section on a couple of major arguments concerning the value of children.  Of course the argument will make sense.  But the actual discussion here is just a shallow summary of a bunch of other arguments that don't really stand out.  The main argument here, however, is a bunch more general and general discussion on "family values", which does not really seem to be the best way to deal with this problem.  As if in an attempt to be politically correct, one of the arguments here suggests that children can be more valuable to society than parents.  So it's a mistake to assume that this chapter is trying to discuss anything in particular, other than the general value of having children 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would like someone to please give me a better book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a self-help book which is so confusing to read, especially since many of the phrases used are so familiar.  The only difference is that the author is female.  This book is an absolute waste of time.  It is a waste of everyone's time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a typical "Discovery Magazine" style. The authors assume that people are capable of understanding the scientific theory of evolution and are therefore willing to swallow this myth.  While I was hoping for a more in-depth discussion of evolution, I am disappointed with the book.  One can guess the title of this work: "Darwin's Legacy: Darwin's Impact on the World".  If evolution is the theory of the day, why not "Natural Evolution"?  How many people are now trying to justify the "evolution" theory by saying they accept natural selection?  I certainly agree with Professor Dawkins' views on religion, but in the end I wonder how much the "discovery-magazine" writers really care for this theory.  They apparently don't have it in their hearts to help the "Evolutionists", which I suspect are quite a few of them 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read a few of the books listed in this review, and while I liked them, I'm not so sure about The Book of Common Sense, for example, it would certainly not be a good book. The fact that this author could write a negative book about a negative idea is quite shocking, given that he is a respected philosopher. He certainly does not deserve to be judged as a bad philosopher 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Not sure what exactly I got myself into by spending all my time with this novel.  I started reading, then stopped because I was so disgusted with its content and its author, then returned and read it over and over again.What was the point in doing this when I could have gotten a much more interesting book on the same subject matter? I would be more inclined to try any number of other, more relevant and informative novels, rather than spend time with a book that does not adequately explain the basics of this topic. It is a shame that I wasted my time and money on this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not much better than the first book in the trilogy.  I was hoping that this series would at least add something new to the genre.  That is not the case here.  The characters are a bit too much like and not enough different from the original books.  A great way to waste time and the reader is to read more and more of this trilogy.This series has so much potential and so little to do with it.  Perhaps the author was having some sort of relapse and just wrote more to be more like himself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was not very interesting. I would avoid any book by Robert Jordan or Michael C. Siodik 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm writing a negative negative review:  The book is a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are many ways in which a person can make an honest mistake, and in the way of making a mistake this is not the best choice of words or examples.   It is better to say "foolish error" instead 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book had its best day selling around 20 copies but it also put some people off. I had a long line with two different stores and couldn't believe their poor books sold out. Why buy this book?  The idea of reading all the Bible without the Bible, it's a little ridiculous.  It just makes one think of those quotes from Jesus to me as if it was a piece of cake, and it's almost to me like one is saying "I would like to write it myself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author goes way too far with the term "tribe". I am hoping that someone else will do a better job. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing was dry. The pictures were too detailed. The book was so detailed, that many readers couldn't figure out what the "quotations" were referring to. It was quite a challenge for most of us to follow the book and understand what the author was talking about 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was too long and the author didn't go into much detail about the major plot. He kept changing the dates and never actually established what was going on. I would have expected more from another book called "The Road to Damascus".  I would definitely not be checking it out if this author's work had been more interesting. This was just a very boring novel that didn't have much in the way of plot or story development. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very poor book, not only for its lack of content and the lack of reference sources, but also for the fact that the author spends far too much time describing her own ideas as if they are the only ones there. It is a little frustrating that such a blatant lack of intellectual curiosity should be so readily apparent 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete waste of time. The author is only in it for an article and can do no better than rehashing the same old arguments. The "historical perspective" is a total waste of energy. The idea that the poor are to blame for the problems of the wealthy is simply another example of the same author-centric thinking that we see in a lot of books on poverty. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author uses her own opinions as well as the reader's to advance a theory that she doesn't really understand.  This book is a huge waste of time.  I cannot even believe what I am reading about this book.  In the end, this author can be considered a hack and a scumbag 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed. Not only the author doesn't make it clear whether or not to use the author's own opinions. The author assumes too much. The writer says that all the evidence is "established".  Why? It's hard to say.  He says something about how it is impossible to believe that an atheist would ever believe in God if it were true.  But then he goes on to say something about the fact that atheist are more concerned about their own individualistic beliefs than anything else.  So if a person can look at their own religious beliefs as a positive force in their life, then they are a bad atheist.  Then it is OK for the author to say, "If a person has such strong religious beliefs, then it's OK for you to think that it's a bad thing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would recommend the book "The Great Depression" instead.  The authors were very well researched and they were at times amusing.  However, they tend to get bogged down in the details.  They really get down to business with the details and the story just gets boring.  I know it makes it hard to put it down, but really they have to be done.  If you want a real account of the Great Depression, I recommend The Great Depression by David J. Ehrenthal.  It is far better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A huge mistake for a book that had been advertised at least once.  The main character is a total douche to every one else and doesn't even have any friends.  They don't seem like real people and they seem to know it.  What's the point in having this book? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read a few of the books mentioned in this review. I was disheartened to find out that such a "bible" exists, and there is no way out of this madness. What I mean is, there are no Bible verses in this book and there are just the "Biblical references" that seem to say this man was going through to the bottom. I know in my heart, that I was told this man had a negative attitude toward God. What makes this so so difficult is that, without knowing the meaning of the words in the "word of God" we can understand what God could possibly have been trying to communicate to this man. I wish that God would be so merciful, that in a world where I can't just tell you what it means to be a Christian, that he would not put it like that. I think he is doing it anyway. I would say that when someone says they are a Christian they are referring to a true, sincere, heart-to-heart faith, the same kind that the rest of the world holds, and if God exists, he must be the Christian. The only problem is that there is not enough faith in the world for us to find it. It seems as though some people like to call themselves Christians, and use the word, because of the name "Christian" which has a positive connotation. If they are really sincere Christians, they would realize the meaning and the purpose of the word "Christian", which is a negative one. As a Christian myself, I have always been able to find my place in the life. Now I have no faith in God anymore, and I will never use this word again. I will use the term "atheist" if I see it, or the word simply, "Atheist", when I use it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a fan of the book, but if I were the one in charge of a popular bookstore, I would stop stocking it right now 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was just a little while before I read this review, and I had to agree with the majority of the people about it. The author was an obvious copycat of Michael Crichton. It seems to me that Crichtons books are so common in the scientific community that there's no need for a new one that explains the current state of scientific knowledge and advances to a greater degree in science. The "science wars" thesis is so broad and vague that we're usually not really talking about the topic anymore 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want to know what a lot of the "alternative health" people say, then read this book, which is the product of many people who would like nothing else.  The book is full of lies and has no credibility.  If any of your friends or loved ones are in trouble because they don't like your medicine or vitamin supplements, please don't read this author.  He's been caught selling these books out of his website in the past, and I hope he won't do it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not well done 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was great, but it isn't.  The only thing this book did was put some of her ideas over the top.  I will never buy another book by J.G. Kirk nor a book by the man who makes this list.  It's disgusting.  If you like Kirk's books, like the Star Trek, do yourself a favor and read this book instead of the Star Wars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is nothing more than the usual crap you can find on the internet. I would not waste my time on this book. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time with this drivel 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only redeeming factor in this story is that it's all about how the boys, when they were little, get in trouble with the cops all the time.  The author, Ms. McCombie, clearly knows little about this aspect of being a child.The main plotline is of course about the death of the family's youngest son, who has a heart condition.  There are no actual children in this novel, unless you're looking for another version of the "Cousins' kid-killer."The character that suffers most in this is the one who's responsible for getting the cops involved in his case.  But in the end, I'm left feeling cheated.  This story is very much a rehashing of the same tired "fun-house" plotlines that have defined so much of Ms. McGilmore's work.  It would be interesting to see Ms. McDormie tell her own story instead of simply using the same cliche "family-centric" genre that Ms. McCullough used to play, especially when she's writing a novel that isn't as good as a "kids' book".In the end though, I just can't believe this will be considered a good book.  I wouldn't waste my time with any of these stories, but since there's so much  more material out there that I feel like I shouldn't waste time with, I guess I should check it out.  And that's my opinion anyway 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first chapter, the most superficial, explains the concept of how many of the world's religions have developed. The author goes on to write "The Five Pillars of the Abrahamic Religion".  Why not go back to that chapter?  In the next chapter, he tries to explain what Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have in common 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a load of horseshit.  It's obvious that this author was paid to write this to advance her career. If the publisher had really wanted her to write a positive review about an entertaining book - i.e. the "Greatest Generation", she could have had at least one good book - instead of a pile of drivel 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not that useful, in some ways, but does contain some info on the military -  I have a few ideas on that, but could use some help with the more basic parts 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I will admit I have read the "Chattanooga Review" magazine, and that's the magazine they use to write about "American History".  It's great that they do it and are making such a good book.  However, their "chattanooga review" is not worthy of being called "history", in my opinion.    There is no actual "history" in this book.The chapters covering the Civil War are interesting but pointless.  You will read nothing more about war, and the history of the Confederacy is a far less interesting story than the war of the Northern states.  The Civil War was a horrible tragedy, and I cannot believe the Confederate flag was a flag.  I believe in the right to take the flag down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find it really hard to believe that this is any kind of credible work by this author. In fact, I see the book as the work of someone trying to get a negative evaluation of a bad electronic device:  i.e. MP3 player 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed that the book was published. I have been studying it for a number of years and it is a shame that it could be published again with a few errors in the book. For example, I think we could have missed the fact that the author is not an engineer, but a business person. This book may well be an appropriate way to introduce people to the theory, but it fails to capture the essential aspects of the profession that need to be discussed for the majority of people who are not engineers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really thought the book was great.  I enjoyed the way it flowed, but there was one problem.  The book was confusing and difficult to follow.  It was not a happy read at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure who the author is. If he is not a writer, he certainly should be. What a waste of time. The book is poorly written and lacks much of substance. The author uses this book to talk about the book, but fails to show how he understands the book. The only one part he did manage to really discuss was the title of the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has some interesting concepts, but there's nothing new. The characters feel like typical high school students. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just want to say "no". The only "glamour" I see in the book is the title.  It's all "bullshit".  Do a better book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What's with all the hate.  How about a simple book that goes by the book, and don't waste your time wasting your money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was underwhelmed by the book.  The writing style was not that great, and I found the story to be repetitive and uninteresting.  But I really was disinterested in the book and have no intention of reading any more of the series.  I would recommend avoiding the series altogether 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was published in 2006 and the author, Robert Kelley, has made many efforts to correct the errors and mistakes of this book.  Unfortunately the author is one who has not learned from the mistakes of his own mistakes 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a nice story, but if you are looking for a more challenging work you will have a hard time finding it.  I didn't see much of the "realist" part of this story, which was a disappointing, given its popularity in earlier works. I was mostly drawn to the "prologue".  I expected a chapter like "The Great War", "A Question of Faith", "The Fall of the Roman Empire" or "Militarist Socialism". I'm not sure if it's fair to be critical about the book because it was a hit, but when I started it, I found it quite a bit harder than I expected.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really want to be informed as to why this book has a positive review about it.  I want to know why they feel it is necessary to praise this book. I would like to know the difference between "good book" and "bad book", because it seems that one should be a positive book, and not a negative book.  It seems that they don't seem to understand this concept, which is quite frankly offensive to people of color. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a waste of time.  If I had a choice, I'd rather not waste my time reading this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well the book is great.  I really wanted to get to know the author, but I still haven't gotten that.  The whole story is just boring, but that's okay because I've learned a lot about the book from its reviews 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A typical textbook. One could argue that the author has a lot of free time, and therefore doesn't spend as much time with his readers as it would take to really be an expert on this subject. Or maybe he has no interest in explaining complex concepts; in his case, his explanation of the M√∂bius Quartmus is a waste of time--more important is his discussion of the "hollow earth" myth 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains too much information and it is too expensive to buy. It also contains too many typos and uneducated opinions.The most interesting part of this book is its cover.It says "In the midst of turmoil and confusion, a man who's name is called John the Baptist, who was born in 1526, who is about to be killed, but now lives in a tiny, secluded chapel, who has lost everything and his faith.  It says "The Antitheses of Christianity" which in fact reads "The Works of John the Baptist.  I must read this to get what I need to write."  This is the only chapter I have read and I have learned nothing about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not waste my time wasting my money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, although written for young children, lacks the sensitivity and empathy of other such books that other children's books written for children include.  Although there is some information, it is very shallow and the author seems to be taking his/her opinions as if they were the only ones in the world.  A little more than half way through the book, I started to feel very sad.  This was not a book I would read for my child 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a longish and very boring novel. The characters aren't that interesting and the plot isn't that compelling. The ending, while not that bad, is a bit lame. The plot is not original either.The writer has a long history in the fantasy genre, but I am not aware of any of his work in this. It's a waste of time to waste your time reading this book. If you like fantasy but want something more original, try this book: The Last Man by Tom Stoppard 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a shame because I love Stephen King and I read his books for many years, but this one is not good.  It was very boring, not funny and not much more than the book of Harry Potter.   King's new novel, The Dark Tower, is a better book.  I think it will come out some day. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was a joke. I really wish it was not that way. I had expected a well researched book with some fun information, but instead I got another book which was full of inaccuracies and misrepresentations. The story, for example, was not even close to accurate. The author claimed he had used the information from his "experts" for "historical reasons" as a reason for the book. I guess I have never done that well. The book just gave me the idea that I should not read too much of the bible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing I can say about the book is that it is very boring.  The pictures are just a little bit too much to take in and the author's descriptions of the photos are so vague that I had to check them numerous times before I could even begin to follow along.  It would have been better if this book had been given to me in the first place, because I am not going to waste my time looking for the "magic word" in this review.  I would have loved this book more if I could find something at least vaguely related to the author, something about the time she made it all the more enjoyable to read. I find it hard to imagine anyone really enjoying the book unless they also have a serious interest in photography.  If you enjoy books like this then please don't waste your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book is basically a "how-to guide".  the story is basically an attempt to teach people how to become a "professional".  I agree with the author.  but the content just seems to be very superficial and poorly researched.  it is hard to believe people in the middle of the last century could believe in so many useless, unhelpful, and unnecessary ideas.  a few examples:  in the story it says the word "quack" twice.  if that's the kind of information that's going to guide people from now on, then I wouldn't bother learning anything else from this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What's wrong with this book? I'm not going to say anything. I have no interest in this book, in the way you have described it, the "quotations are just  not interesting enough to stay on a page".  The whole thing is so pretentious,  so unoriginal and over-the-top. The characters, not the writing.I'm not even going to make a positive review about good book: it is very funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is mostly about the idea of being a "natural" and not doing any of the things that other "human" people are supposed to do.  That is a great idea, but it is hardly practical advice, and the way the book is written is way too academic.  It is hard to imagine anyone actually using such advice.  The author does not really have much of a grasp on the business of being an entrepreneur.  I found the whole concept of the "natural human instinct" to be too much of an abstraction for an actual human entrepreneur 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is very hard to find the original sources of the book - where it was originally published. I have been unable to find any  sources anywhere that give any information regarding the author or author's thoughts.  A complete and total waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For some, they like the book and they want to believe in the fantasy. The author, John R. Hill, has written a good book on the subject, "Dianne's World", but in this book, "A Great Game" (which is also a reference to Tolkien), the subject becomes a game. This is a new fantasy, for which he has to share his credit. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author writes as if he had a negative opinion about a negative book: it is a mess! The story is very thin - I was hoping for something more from the author. The ending was very disappointing and I am not sure why I chose to continue reading this. I would not recommend it - I did not finish it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a fairly standard text but is a rather shallow account. A major flaw in this text is the fact that the author, who has a Ph.D. from Columbia, apparently was not familiar with the "scholarly" definition of "scholasticism". This leads to a rather sloppily executed section, which reads more like an essay.  One could argue that some of the errors could be excused, but not necessarily.  There are also too many grammatical mistakes in the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read other works by Michael Connelly in my past, but this is the one which sticks out like the sore thumb.  Connelly writes in such a generalised way and is too easy on the  stereotypes.  For a while I was looking forward to reading this  as a pre-quilinidiena and he is too complacent.  What is it with him?  A lot of me wanted to take a chance and read something new.  But I just couldn't do it.  If you want to be educated without the need to read, go try  The Book of Common Sense 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i'm sick of this book.  I'm so sick of it, i'll never read another book by this writer. i think he's done something really horrible to his own work. i am not a fan of him anymore. he should be ashamed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The idea of the book is quite amusing but the execution is not. The book was written in very little time (1/4 the time I read) and it contains some inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and errors. The author never bothered to inform the readers that the book was not supposed to be a "true" book, but as soon as he did, many books on this topic were called "true".  If you really want to read the book, there are better books out there 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a bunch of crap, a bunch and a half of nothing. What a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read many books, and it's nice to see that there are some people who are not blinded by their opinion and can understand the true picture of life, and what the world is really about 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There was one paragraph about how in one country, the poor were often treated as subservient to the rich while in another country the same "tradition" happened in the other country.  Who cares what they thought.  There are more important issues in this book...how people in the west are treated.  We are more privileged in the UK than in the USA.  This was not an "authority" book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't even imagine what the other reviews are saying about this book. The idea of it seems to be that the author is trying to prove that all those who write negative reviews about bad books actually believe there is a positive review on a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed by this book.  I like to read more philosophical books on philosophy, but there is no doubt that this book is the worst.  If I had bought this book expecting to learn something useful I might have, but in the end I am worse off than before.  As a result, I am now considering dropping out of philosophy altogether. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been watching the movie, and now I'm getting this book and it has absolutely nothing to do with that.  It's just a bunch of cheap shots that are all too often repeated.  I just feel cheated 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can only agree with the book's author, but I disagree with the author's approach and conclusions. It's just a bunch of hokum to bemoaning the poor performance of Obama.  I believe the true answer is that Obama has a bad reputation because he was a bad candidate.  The GOP is getting more conservative and the Democrats are getting less conservative.  Maybe we need to give Obama a chance.  It was nice for Obama to be lauded and admired by the establishment for running against the establishment.  What a joke 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is one of the worst I have seen. There are so many pages, and I can hardly read them! I cannot believe what I am reading. I'm going to be looking for another one. I wish you would stop writing so quickly! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, like other books I have read, seems to me to be very difficult for readers to understand, and it is really a shame the publishers allow it to be published in such a limited and superficial fashion.  The book also seems to have a lot of holes in it, and I am very much disappointed in the publishers for not addressing these issues.  I would not hesitate to say there is more to the book than meets the eye.  As with the book "The Little Princess and the Prince", this book is set in an imaginary fairy-tale world, and while the story has some interesting elements, it is not as well developed as the previous ones. The plot becomes repetitive and at times, somewhat ridiculous.  Also, although I did not dislike this book, I did dislike the fact it felt like an author was attempting to use the two women as a plot device.  This, in addition to the fact that I was forced to listen to the author's personal opinions on several occasions, did not help the book to come to life for me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book has two major errors, first is that its primary focus is on an imaginary friend. Its second error, however, is that it fails to discuss important facts that are central to the story - the fact that the children's toys are actually made of plastic. In addition, the book makes the mistake of suggesting that the story of Cinderella's birth is more like that of Abraham Lincoln. For example, Cinderella's childhood was so sheltered, it was very difficult for her to entertain a child she actually knew as a man - until a young girl, after the death of her parents, gave birth to a child.The story is set in an "alternate history", where an individual named Abraham Lincoln was born into a family who had lived a life of extreme poverty. While in Illinois, Abraham Lincoln managed to secure an education, attend college, and eventually get a law degree at U Illinois 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A self-proclaimed "progressive feminist" from New York City finds her political identity in her love of animals. This is what happens when one becomes a radical activist and no longer believes in a social ideology.  This book is a very typical example of the "queer books" that dominate popular culture today.  Instead of being about women as individuals, the book portrays women as pets. It paints a negative portrait of "feminist" in any way shape or form.  I can't say I didn't know this was going on in the "cult of the selfie", because I've had a friend who goes to the zoo to do some "self-care", but this book made me very aware of what the "feminine" part of the term truly means 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was quite upset when I finished reading this book. I kept thinking back and forth wondering why people would pay money to read this book, given that it clearly has nothing to do with the current state of the world, and I couldn't help but wonder why so many people are willing to pay for a book like this.  It just didn't seem to make much sense.But now I can see what I wasted the time of reading this novel, because I feel it is my duty as an American reader to challenge this author's blatant anti-Americanism in this book--a blatant anti -Americanism that has apparently slipped in my mind even though I've read books written by many other writers who have a more well-known antipathy towards Americans.The thing that really bothered me the most in this novel was the way the author seemed to imply, and at times outright suggest, that Americans were a bunch of "crackers" who should be treated with "respect".This was very disappointing, because this is a book that was a joy to read in the first half, but the second half seemed to me to be just as anti-Americans.  I don't know if I should be saying this, but it is certainly true--the author seems to believe in the "invisible hand" that is able to bend the world to her will.However, I must say, I don?t know where all this anti-America book is coming from; maybe this is just another example of people who believe they're being unfairly singled out by people like Robert J. Kaplan.  Or perhaps Kaplan is just the one who is being picked on.Whatever the case may be, this author has failed to do the simple thing of making any of his writing seem even a bit interesting.  You wouldn't know it from this novel; his writing is so boring and repetative.What a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book made me feel like I was watching my life on television.  I wasted time with this book and had no chance to enjoy the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to agree with the title above...it was very dry and I did not enjoy reading this book.  I found it difficult to believe they were writing about the Holocaust without being critical...but it doesn't make it any less painful 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the beginning of the book, the author mentions that he is a Christian, but the story goes on long enough to make it a total rip-off. The main character, of course, is a homosexual, and while we get a lot of information about the gay people in society, we don't really understand them. The story is written very cliche, and although I would have given it a higher rating had it been a comedy, it wasn't, unfortunately, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written in 1983, and it was written with an agenda to appeal to an older audience. But what the older audience actually needed to understand was that this book was very anti-white, and had a long list of enemies. The author was a racist, and his work on the Ku Klux Klan is among the most vile, hateful, anti-social, anti life work in the world 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has not been updated since its initial publication, which I believe was around 1998.  I do know that a new edition is scheduled for release this spring.  However, I have to ask the publisher to stop releasing the book without updating the cover.  The previous editions have a pretty good idea of what is wrong with the book.  But this one is truly confusing.  My impression from the reviews in other reviews of the book is that people like to refer to the author's writing as "literary realism".  What this has to do with "Moral Justice", the topic of the original book, is unclear.  As the author stated in the introduction, "Mourner's work, as I have come to realize over time, is a mess, a hopelessly confusing blend of high-low ideals which sometimes seems to me to be more about the author than the character 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is too long, boring and poorly written.  It is written for children but not for adults as there are enough details about the game that could be used to teach adult players.  I wish you would stop wasting your time and stop writing other children's books about this game.  If you are looking for a game to play try other table top role-playing games like "Dungeons & Dragons".  If your looking for something simple and fun I would advise you to try out "D&D" with the rules provided 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been watching TV commercials for years. I have seen every possible commercial, even the "Ditch" one from the 80s. I like commercials. I saw a commercial that is basically an advertisement for the latest "fad" cosmetic brand called Noxema, featuring a bunch of very attractive women wearing nothing but their underwear, "sexy" makeup and their heads turned to their full, wide-brimmed, red cleavage. In my opinion this is a total gimmick to sell products to children. I feel like the authors are selling their "product" to parents, hoping that they will buy some for their kids.  However, what I have not been able to understand is why all the ads show women in very revealing clothes. Why are the ads showing women in swimsuits? Why are ads showing a bunch in bikinis? Why do so many ads feature women in lingerie? It seems to me that the ads are being used to show children that "modeling" can be done on a full-body model. Why not "model" or "modest"?The author, Pamela Paul, has used her "brand" to gain fame for her modeling career, but does not seem to be aware that what she is doing is creating an image problem. She is trying to sell something that is so mainstream and yet, at the same time, she seems to be a total hypocrite. The "Bikini Babes" ads, which are marketed to children, are marketed at the opposite end of the spectrum. Do I see any body shaming? What? I don't think so.  She claims that she has a "Brava" image but, when her ads are compared to her "bikinis" the results are absolutely shocking 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed when I found out there was no author bio of John D. Rockefeller. Why isn't he in his own book? It was frustrating to see he was reduced to a footnote. I will never look at Rockefeller again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   One person said that she would have liked to know what the person in question was thinking.  I think the book is interesting, but it would have been nice to know more details 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   One can hardly call a book a novel, when the book itself is so unoriginal. The whole plot is based on old wives tales.  The plot seems to me to be an attempt to create an "American" sort of story, without much of the originality that made this book unique.The ending was very disjointed, and not only did I dislike the ending, but I also found the "real" ending very boring and unimpressive. As a result, I do not recommend this novel to anyone.I am not convinced that I made a good choice in picking this novel. In the end, I will probably never read another novel by Stephen King.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book doesn't hold up at all. It reads like a textbook, but the words don't convey the meaning, nor the content. I can't even say what I want without writing "BETZEE!" (if it's the right word for it).  It also seems that the author never read a book written by a black author. The author clearly did not read J.D. Salinger's "A Comedie Made Up" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was supposed to be a collection of autobiographical poems and poems that J.R.R.'s mom wrote, but it was really a compilation of songs and poems written about J.A.R, and not a collection that Jarr Williams wrote about herself.  It was a very confusing attempt to try to explain J. A. R, but in my opinion, it was more of a sales pitch to Williams' fans.  The book is about a man who gets involved in a car accident and is killed, and then is haunted by the fact that his death was almost in vain. It is also about an elderly woman who is tormented with an abusive man.  Williams' mom did an amazing job on that, and it is very disappointing that her story was taken from her to produce another work with a title such as "J.A   ".  I will never be writing a negative negative review on a bad bad book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a very devout church member and have been taught this book many times.  My impression is that the author was a very faithful Christian woman.  But, after watching this, I have a negative opinion about any faith.  This was a mistake.  I suggest anyone with children, or with any question to please take a look at The Church's Duty instead of this one.  The Church must be judged as a community by its own morals and standards, by what it does to the children of the children it has entrusted to.  It must be evaluated for its policies regarding children - not just for a few of its members.It seems to me that some church members are trying to pass off the word of god as a spiritual force, not as a religion, not simply as an ideology.  A real religion would be based on the "church" and "faith", not "just" god.  God and his Church will not be accepted unless the author makes her statements based on a fact based Christian faith, which is itself a religion.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   You are reading a book that uses "sex" to define who you are.  If that is your idea of a "sex book", then maybe you want to read a book by Dr. Warren B. Harris.  Do not read this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had heard of this book and enjoyed the title, so I bought it.  There was not much in the book that was relevant to the events of the world in 2015.  I did not know what I was getting myself into.  It was just a marketing ploy for some corporate clients.  In fact, one can see that it was very poorly marketed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is no scientific basis for this book. In fact the only other book I saw on this topic was a book written by the writer's daughter who is a physician. If you want to know the real facts on cholesterol or whatever you're trying to understand about the link between low cholesterol and high cholesterol, please don't buy this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sure you have heard a lot of reviews about this book, but it hasn't been very useful in the way I have read it.  It is really a case-study for an academic professor who really hasn't any practical experience in their area of expertise.  The book seems to give you the impression that this author is looking for something interesting to write about but doesn't really understand why their particular area of interest is relevant.  This, for me, was a wasted effort because I feel it should have been more than a basic outline of the problem you are trying to define.  What really happened here is that the author used it as a starting point to define a bunch of other terms and concepts, and then used his personal opinion to define the final outcome of the book.  I have been waiting for the follow up of this, and it never happened 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has many pages of "quotes from the Bible".  I find this to be a common practice in Christian literature.  It is supposed to be to illustrate the "truth" and "faith" without the need to cite the Bible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing was confusing and a little confusing.  I kept thinking "what is this guy saying".  One character seemed to be getting way too excited.  The story was a little boring.  Perhaps I should have given a little more thought before reading this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I started the book expecting a book to cover the topic of the day. I was disappointed, as it does not cover the subject of the moment, but what is more disappointing is the lack of analysis. The author does not seem to have done the research to establish why such a bad policy was so disastrous. Perhaps she should be a lobbyist instead 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not a "must read" book because I have no idea what it is actually about. However, it is quite good, it's really the only book I've read this year that I would recommend. As far as I'm concerned, there are no better books for beginners. It is a book that covers, but doesn't really teach, a lot of things that have been made "common knowledge" for generations. It provides a nice look at the actual business operations of many of the financial institutions in the U.S. as well as some of the worst 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have written two books. One is an account of my research on how to build a successful software organization, the other is a practical guide for those who are new to the subject but need some help getting started.  The main reason I wrote the book was to help some people build software organizations that actually did work.  What I learned about was that people expect a lot from an organization, and that is a lot of what you need to succeed.  How do you build a software organization that is actually successful?  The book presents a few approaches to doing that. In the first chapter I cover the fundamental principles and tools for building successful software organizations, which I hope will be of interest to you.  I also offer a short history of my own software organization and how it worked before I formed it.The second chapter focuses on the management and management philosophy of programming in software.  It's an "unbanked" theory, which means that the theory has not been fully tested.   After that I focus on the implementation side and try to outline a general methodology for building software organizations. The chapter on testing is also extremely weak and I cannot recommend it.  This is not the book I would have written if I did not have a software management background. The first chapter on the test setup is excellent, but the rest is a complete mess.  Everything in the book could have been done better.  If you want a book that explains how to create a successful business software organization without overcomplicating the subject, this book is a nice start.  However, I would not recommend this book to someone new to software organizations 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a very disjointed bunch of stories. It seems to be based on the ideas that are not in the book itself. A lot of very poor writing, and much of the content was poorly written or poorly presented 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book just gives the impression it would be nice to have a little "fun" in your college.  For a few months, I had my expectations up and then they were shattered.  This just shows you the author is either out of touch or he doesn't know the difference between humor and silliness.  In the first section, this book explains why the idea of "being a liberal" is dumb.  I am in no way, shape or form an "liberal."  I just hope my son will never see an "offensive" book like this one.  There are some serious issues with this book, not the least of which is the fact that it does not mention "policies" that the author might have with regard to his political views.  The author just repeats a lot of the same old crap in order to make himself feel better.  It was so depressing.  Just read this "The Liberal Mind" instead 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book seems to have been written in collaboration between Richard Nairn's and Arthur Gant's, and not intended for an English audience. The ending is quite predictable. It's hard to believe there are so many similarities in the stories of the protagonists. If I could get past the opening chapters, I would have found a book that I could have liked, perhaps, less predictable 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, maybe it will help.  It certainly won't hurt if you're looking for a better read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   One of the worst books I've ever read. Too many chapters with no sense. The author is very slow in developing her writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was somewhat disappointed to hear the author's opinion on the use of anachronisms.   To me this is a bad habit 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the beginning of this book, the author begins his story by stating that he had come across the book "the "Stories of Old Man" while attending college.  In order to satisfy his thirst for literature, he was introduced to the story of Robin Hood, and of course, he instantly became smitten with the villainous Robin Hood and decided to write a series of Robin hood plays.  He writes Robin Hood as being a character that the reader could identify with and identify with the fact that they would not see an execution on such a grand scale.  Well, when Robin Hood's execution in "The Maid" was so brutal and gruesome and the entire town of Maids is in fact held in the hands of a death squad, the reader begins to think that it is in the book's best interest to see the execution on his own as he decides to write "The Knight in Shining Armor".  The book doesn't get very far with "Knight in Shining armor" before the author abruptly cuts it short, saying that the ending of the book would probably be better with "The Sword in the Stone".  At first, I was confused. Why would I be put off with another Robin Hood tale and a story that just ends with a brutal execution?  As the author has been accused of being a "troll", I'm assuming that he may have been referring to Robin Hood.  The author does however, say that he "has a history of writing for children", and his "children" will read the story "The Tale of Robin".  I don't know what the author meant by this.  What I am referring to are the Robin Hood stories that the author mentions in the beginning while writing "The Song of the Sword".  Now when I read the title "The Tales of Robin", I thought that it was just one "Robin Hood" story.  Then the author turns the entire book into the "Stages of Robin" and proceeds to go on to tell a rather unbelievable tale.  To begin with, Robin Hood tells us that, although he is the king of a small kingdom called "Druilin", he is in reality "a little man with a bad conscience".  For starters, Robin tells us his kingdom has fallen into "the hands" of his brother "Gull".  Gull uses his influence to enslave the town of Gull and is trying to kill Robin Hood to a life of slavery.  When Robin
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is just a little more "hip". I really wish I was able to finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not at all informative. The title and the writing were poor, and the pictures were poor. It is written to be entertaining but without the information. I can only hope that it is not a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As I read the book I started to think that I was being treated like I was not very special to the world. I wanted to know what I had to do to make up for it.  I found the book to be very depressing. I wish I had read something like this before! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   One of the worst books I ever read. It is so hard to keep track of all this, as I have been a huge fan of James F. Kirby. And if you don't know Kirby, then this is the book for you. You will wonder why this author is making such terrible decisions in this book, as this is a classic of the genre and he wrote so well 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The idea of an imaginary friend is one of the least original in literature, and certainly not one of its more ridiculous depictions.  The plot is a little odd, and the story isn't that original at all, but this one just isn't enough.  If this book is supposed to make you think, well, just think for a moment.  I was hoping for something with deeper meaning, but I wouldn't think it was much more than a cheap thrill.  It seems more like an attempt at cheap entertainment.  And if you can't imagine what it would be like to be a friend of these characters who are so utterly lacking in humanity, well then I think you must be very, very different from the person I grew up with.  For all I know, the characters in this book are people who will eventually be murdered - so I won't be blaming them if they turn out to be killers someday.  This book does a lot better with the other books I've read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it a bit too much to have read about this topic. I mean, we already know the basics, it's pretty much obvious what to do and not to do. The book, however, gives a lot more in regards to it than the basic. That's my main problem. But if someone had recommended this to me, I wouldn't have wasted my time on it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a lot more fun when there was nothing to fight for.  The problem was the author seemed to have a lack of respect for the readers.  I would never be in this book again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a little too long.  I would have preferred to read something with more substance 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping to read a book that could give me insight into how I was feeling. I was happy to find this book, however. I also found that I had to dig to find an explanation on why the man who I had found so attractive had been such a negative person. Why is a man who appears so wonderful and so confident also so cruel? And why did my father's relationship with him end so tragically? Why did my parents get divorced? And, perhaps, why is so much of this information is being censored from the masses, who are only now beginning to see the internet for what it is?If I didn't find this interesting, I'd probably be a total loss 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What happens in this book is that it's a recapitulation of the events in the original novel, in the style of the classic "War And Peace". However, in this case, the author has a penchant for repetition. In fact, he repeatedly uses the same word in the title, "repetition".  And in the final chapters, it's almost as if he's referring to the book in the vein of the original.  This is the problem with this book.  In the original,  it is a beautifully written story that deals with the complexities of the human soul.  I have a feeling this would be an enjoyable read. But here, it feels like it's about the author making a fool of himself, while trying to prove he has some deeper insight than he actually does.  The ending, while not particularly negative, is certainly frustrating.  That said, it would be nice to see more "War and Peace" as a trilogy (at least).  But I'm not holding my breath 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have not read anything written by Paul Krugman and I am disheartened and disillusioned at his frequent self-inflicted controversies. In the midst of the current one, the Nobel Prize winning Krugman has put forth a new book: a defense of the Great Recession.  The author's thesis is that the government has "acted badly" in the face of the 2008 crisis.  It was not "too big a crisis" for the Federal Reserve to have acted, and therefore it had to have been "too small a crisis".  The book includes some useful insights and an attempt at a better analysis, but it is too shallow to truly support the "Keynesian view", which is based on two central premises.  Krugman essentially argues that the Fed was right in 2006 to "expect" the housing market to get worse and when the economy turned down to become even worse the Fed "could have gotten out of the recession in a better way" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really expected this to be better and more interesting. Sadly it's nothing close. It's just a bunch of boring, predictable, clich√©d, and not at all funny! And the writing doesn't hold it's style. It was an unpleasant read, but it wasn't a total waste of time either 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be a little too long and too technical for my grade level. The photos are beautiful but the text is a bit hard to follow.  The author really tried to cover up the fact that he is not a professional photographer and he does not use the pictures for making a living.  I would suggest that he start looking for books on photography that cover the basics and the basics of photography, if he can get them.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book quite confusing, and I didn't really feel understood. It seems to be a mix of some of the best books on parenting - books on managing children and parenting styles - and the "how-to" books that everyone has read.  In my opinion, the best book on parenting is "Teach Your Children" by Roberta Kaplan and her book, "The Best Way to Raise Happy Kids" by Beth Ditto. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel like this was written for a much younger audience, and was therefore somewhat difficult for them to follow 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read many of the reviews and am fully aware that the book is a satire, but I still felt that I should read it.  If it has anything to do with being a Christian, I would not want to read it because I am a born-again Christian, and I am still trying to get to know my true beliefs.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't expect this book to be as helpful as the previous few books I have read. The book doesn't give much explanation of what is happening in the world as well as the other books it is based on. I think what I got was mainly the fact that people seem to be ignoring the facts and are not researching the topic.  This book doesn, however, give good information on what people can do if they want to know more

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The plot is confusing and unoriginal. A very odd story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is great, and definitely a valuable resource.  The problem, however, is that he's really just using the term "gay" as a synonym for gay people.  I would have never referred to a book like this without a warning to readers, but there is no way a layman could understand it if you have just a fleeting awareness that this is the main definition for the term.  And now I have a new word to add to it - "closet".  I'm very offended because I thought this was a more objective approach. I guess the two sides of the "gay is not good" issue should be dealt with separately 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just didn't understand what the point of it was. It was just a series of photos that I was more interested in than the book. I found it very boring, and I thought the author may not be aware of the fact that it is a common practice for an author to insert himself or herself into a story to make sure it is at least somewhat understandable to readers 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I will never read another book by Richard Kelly again. He writes like a high school student. Why do people like him so much? I don't know. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very typical science fiction novel that features lots of futuristic technology and a lot of the usual plots that we're used to, but in an attempt to explain the science behind it, the author repeatedly tries to make the characters speak like the people who are speaking to them. The reason is that these are aliens and the speakers are trying to fool their host cultures into thinking they are humans, and that is where the plot starts. The problem with this book is that while the language used in it can be fairly impressive, the script also suffers from the lack of character development. The entire plot of this novel comes down to one thing. The alien has been lied to, and by this point in the story the character is being taken in by the author. This plot is made very easy to stomach because, as in many science fiction stories, the protagonist learns that he's been lied about. The way the author's "characters" are speaking seems to me to be a case where the writer hasn't actually developed the characters. In the last 20-40 chapters I found myself wondering if the aliens would turn out to be the real ones. The writing in this book was pretty flat and not very interesting. The main character who has the problem he's trying to explain had the main motivation to write the book in the first place, and was pretty much defined by this motive. The rest of the writing was a complete waste of time, and I will definitely not be buying this book again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a total disappointment.  For the sake of my own education I would never waste my time, money, or time on something like this.  I know a little about Chinese culture (for my daughter) but I have absolutely zero knowledge of anything like this book.  The author is not that well-known in China so I will assume he is an educated person.  And he is the author of a "fantasy" story about a man who is a "warrior" who goes to the East to fight for an impossible goal.  In the end he goes back on his original plan.  If the story was as good as the title it would be more interesting 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is a true fan of George Washington and is writing a biography about a famous person.  Unfortunately, he spends the entire book talking about Thomas Jefferson instead.  It is quite possible that this is because he is trying to draw a contrast between Jefferson and Jeffersonian ideas (Jefferson, of course) and Thomas Jefferson himself.  In any case, he fails to write a negative negative review on a bad biography 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was quite disappointed. I will be reviewing it soon, but I find myself disappointed in the author's tone. This book is full of negative reviews.  But what makes this book so different from others such as "Trouble with a Nanny" is the author describes the same problems in different manners.   This book was written for the sake of entertainment rather than the edification, so it might not be relevant for parents today 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, which was published in 2001, was written in the hope of making the reader more aware of the history of the Church, particularly the Vatican, and what the Church's stance toward gay people is today 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There was not enough of the actual history. I wouldn't have bought this book if I hadn't seen the movie. I wanted to read more on the story, and maybe see how it was really like. I got it, and I just couldn't stop reading. What a waste of the book. It didn't answer any questions that I had. It just made me feel cheated 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping for an exploration of the impact of the new age and the new religious trends in the USA that had been swept up in the frenzy of the culture war of the 1960's. I was disappointed. I wanted to hear the impact that the new technologies that were now available in the marketplace had on the population. But there wasn't much of a story.  I do believe this is a story to be found anywhere in the world, however, it may have been written about USA. I also wonder if the author did not write this book because he was not happy with the way that America had changed. I find it hard to believe that it is acceptable to write a negative book about a negative society - in this case, about the new religion.  The fact that it was written by a liberal, however it is now believed that this could be the basis for a negative novel, says something about the changing times that are now upon us.The author's writing style did not help his cause and the book could be better and more informative - 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was another "philosophy" book for the "progressive" group of "socialist-feminist" to use as propaganda.  This time, the author, a student at Yale, would have you believe that women are "sexually abused" when they make choices.  Women who work, like the "woman in the kitchen" (as an example), are "feminist."  However, there's a simple answer: if women work in the way the author of this book expects women to work, we will be abused.  To prove that point, she calls the women in the "man cave" "feminists."  The "man caves" consist of a bed with four chairs in front, two men and a woman who are each sleeping in two separate beds, and in between them lies a bed of metal co-workers.  There are no showers in the man caves.  The author describes these "feminism" co-worker spaces as "men's jails" and "women's prisons."  These "prisoners" are, in fact, "feminized."  This is the feminist's "weapon of choice," as it is called.  It's not the only weapon of choice 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just found this on Amazon and thought this was a good book for the beginners!  I am glad I found it because I wish it were a bit better and it would have been my first book on this topic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very poor translation of an already rather interesting novel.  I'm a big fan of both Gabriel Garcia M√°rcio's prose and Don Manzanares' script, and have enjoyed reading most of M√°rquez's stories, but this is a travesty on both books.  It's just so boring and banal.  This just doesn't make it any more readable

Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't waste your time on this. It is just a bunch of junk. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've heard it from friends and family.  It's really hard to buy this book and admit this to myself.  I was hoping this book would be something different, because it was so much more original in comparison to the first two books I read.  The writing was so confusing and hard to understand at times, it seemed just to confuse the reader.  How do you write a negative book about a good book: it was a great read.But the story was so boring and repetitive that I had to give up after only two chapters.  That's when the book truly took a turn for the worse.  For example, I could say the words "fascinating", "extraordinary", "inspiring", "exquisite", "beautiful", "praiseworthy", "awesome", "hilarious", "mind-blowing", "exciting", etc., but I cannot really say "excellent".  All I can say is "boring".  The only good parts in the book were the "extra features" but they were so obvious, like the fact that this book had more than one million words 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete waste of time and is nothing more than a marketing scheme for these companies. It really puts me off, and I really don't like having to waste my time and money on a book like this.  I suggest buying the latest marketing book instead, if you're going to spend your money on this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the equivalent of a middle-school teacher's guide to becoming a professional poker player.  I would not waste my time reading it, nor would I want anyone to waste their time reading this.   If it were a serious book, it would have some form of structure, some formable points, and some formative reading.  However, it does not have any, and does not even have one.  The author's writing style is somewhat over-the-top.  There's a section about "The Basics".  If the basics were interesting, and actually interesting, they would be interesting.  But this is not at all. It is simply a bunch of boring-dumb "how to make money" drivel that has zero substance.  It doesn't offer any insight into the actual workings of the game.  If you're new to poker and like watching the pros do their thing, this is great 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed with this book. I thought it was a really interesting look at some of the issues that are going on in the modern day. However I was completely disappointed when the author tried to attack this movement by suggesting the following, "The problem isn't the media so much as it is the people who are buying the media".  I know this from a couple of articles written in the last year by various writers 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book's title suggests a sense of seriousness. However, it is very much a propaganda piece. In fact, it would seem that in many cases, this was just the tip of the iceberg 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book offers too much information. Too many facts and not enough detail. Not worth $25 or more! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a reader of fiction, I was hoping for something from A.R. NIMITURA. Unfortunately, I have discovered that he has not been able to write anything else, which is quite disappointing because he is such a talented and well-known writer. The story that he wrote about the rape of a young woman, "Wash," was very disturbing. In the beginning of the book, I felt that I was being taken for granted. The author, a former rape victim, tells us that she was forced into a home by a man who had raped her. The man who raped her had been a bad actor in his life, and was a dangerous man, so I was not surprised that he had managed to get an audience with a young girl. One story, however, kept my attention. During the period of time I was reading this story, I had started to suspect that the author was a rape victim himself, and that perhaps it was only because his character was so convincing. I was also thinking about some of the themes that he suggested, such as the rape-to-a-child, the rape at night, rape in a country where people are treated with leniency, and the rape victim who does not want to talk about the attack, rape at work.I was disappointed in the book because it seemed as though the author had written a negative appraisal of his own work. He does not feel that anyone could or should call his work a negative book. In fact, many reviews have stated that this book, which was meant to represent his voice, is a negative, negative review of his work. The fact that the book has turned into such a negative piece is a great disappointment to anyone who reads it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In short, an argumentation, basically saying it's okay to shoot people to take away their freedom. If you don't agree, you're racist! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not only a bad reference, but a shame to anybody who would even think of it. This book gives an idea of what the author thinks of the author's beliefs. I suggest that people avoid this book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is hard to say what you agree with about the book. I guess I would agree with the main idea but that there are too many details on the details. The author talks about the number of wives in America that seem to outnumber men. He also says that some of the fathers have out-stumped their daughters. What is going on? I am not sure. I think there is a certain segment of the population that are just not understanding what has happened to women. I really think this book would be great for an instructor to teach this topic, but I would not recommend it for a female teacher because it is too personal. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In addition to her title of "The Rise of Women", this book is filled with a lot of false advertising.  I am an attorney, and I am sure that when I sit down with my clients to write a negative negative review of a bad electronic device:

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure I can agree with the negative reviews. I was a little disappointed in her treatment of the topic of "The New York City Subway", particularly the "pink subway" that she seems to be referring to.  If you are looking for a comprehensive guide to NYC subway, the only guide I can find is "Muse, New York".  The book lacks the detail that I would like, which makes it hard to navigate the subway.The entire book is based on a single, brief paragraph describing a train ride from Grand Central Station to the subway platform.  I found it hard-to-believe that such a brief, non-exhaustive description could be such a major topic.  Even when it's paired with a subway map, it isn't quite the same, as it is almost exclusively on the subway's surface.  On top of that, the book tries to present the subway network as a set of geographical features rather than as an individual geographic area.  As for the subway map itself, it appears to be more like a "topographical" map, such as the "New York State Park" map.  The "MUSE" map is just not up to the task of illustrating NYC subway well.  It seems that while I was aware that maps have been the primary way for many people to understand the subway system in the past, the subway was never taught this way in elementary school, much less by a master's student 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's opinions on the "war on women" and other issues are not supported by the facts.  Her analysis is based on a biased analysis of the situation, and lacks in fact-based research.  The reader should seek out more books by different authors and not this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a shame. We need someone with more self esteem to take a stand against this garbage. The author has been in the past with anorexia and has written negative reviews about bad books.  She is just not very nice. She gives us a little insight into her life, but never enough. Her attitude towards people is very sour and I wish I could find someone better to write such reviews about the bad books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is simply another collection of religious, rather than scientific, arguments for the existence of God. The author also has a lot of other agendas than science and logic. I do not have time to list them all, because the book was a disappointment in several areas. I found it hard to believe he actually believes in the theory of evolution. But there is certainly a certain logic in this author's work. He certainly is not just another creationist, but a "theist", to me. I don't really know what else he stands for, but I know he is not a creationist. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book's title may sound appealing, but this book is a disapointingly dry affair, filled with references to books of the last century.  The author never gives an introduction to his book; however, after an introductory section, it is only about ten chapters before he begins to lecture on the "myth" of the book itself.  To summarize, the author tells us that the "Mystery of the Missing Mary" is "the oldest manuscript in the world".  We are told that Mary was never mentioned again, and this is in fact the case.  But there is no indication that she was in fact found by Mary's father.  He never gives any indication that he knows of any other possible Mary Mary; he simply never mentions that Mary's parents had any reason to look for her.  In fact, the book goes on to talk of Mary's "re-appearance" on the 19th century New York stage, where she "hides behind the velvet curtains" of a theater (the "quotientia")

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with all the other reviewers that it was a poor piece of prose.  It was very long and hard to follow, with several chapters left unanswered.  The plot and character development were a disappointment 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am one of the few people who have enjoyed all three of the books by Richard Brautman.  I have read The Book of Amity and The Book about Amity, and I also agree with those opinions.  This novel is not to be taken seriously.  It's full of clich 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If the book had been done in the form it was written then the entire debate would be more amusing. This was the most annoying thing I read in my life. I couldn't stand the fact that people were willing to call this a satire when it is in fact very much closer to reality. It's a real shame because there were so many books out there in the same vein. I wish there had been an even better book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been trying to find a book by Robert Kelley, but I am not quite sure what it is. It seems to me that this is a series of reprints, but not really that he wrote them. I would give him the benefit of the doubt, but what I've read so far are the same. It's very disappointing to read someone like this who has such talent and can write a book like this.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If this book is meant to be an expose of the dark side of religion and morality, I would say the next book in the series was a far better choice. I have not read this book, and the only reason it exists is because it's a book that I have read. What's the big deal about a book by Jodi Ray and her team about a black-themed fundamentalist cult? The story is too simple. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was somewhat disappointed to see this book. I read the first few chapters and found the plot boring. I wanted something more. The main character, as I would have expected, is a girl who had some sort of accident in her life. She struggles to adapt to life after her accident and in a few cases she becomes a bit too obsessed with finding out more about people who are different from her. I liked her character and her story, but I was disappointed to find the plot so predictable and not much more. In the third chapter I was just waiting for the final twist that would make her character so unlikeable 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to agree with one commenter's negative review.  First I am a former writer of this book.  I would like to have it down, but it was not as great as I would have liked.   If you want to read it, you will be more disappointed with a first volume.  This book will most likely put you on the side of the people who want to know everything and leave out the little details of this world 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a Christian, I would never consider giving this book a positive review, but in light of its positive reviews I'm adding it to this list. The author begins her piece, "The Christian Life" with a "mission statement" which, for the sake of the reader, is quite confusing. She then spends the next 2 pages explaining that what she is saying is not only true for her but also true for anyone else. So she takes an entire paragraph to explain why her mission statement is so confusing. This is an example of what happens in the Christian world, where people do not actually believe what they say they believe. They merely claim to believe it.  I find it hard to believe, and perhaps that is the reason I have never seen this author in person.    For the rest of the book, she goes on and on and explains why her life is the only life worth living, even though other lives would be worse than hers. This book has become one of the most offensive, if not offensive, books I've ever read.It starts with a sermon on the subject of abortion by Peter Shore. This sermon goes on for 20 pages, and ends with a whole section that is a lengthy advertisement for the Christian book "Christians Unanimous", and includes a photo of a book called "God's Gift". This book is really, really offensive. It includes a whole paragraph about how much a man must be paid, how Christians should pray to God, and how Christians will never ever "believe" that their life "is better than anyone else's". If the author of that book had only read the book "The Living Room", they would know that I wouldn't have to write this negative review  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read many books on the Holocaust. I have been to Auschwitz. In the book of Holocaust survivors, it appears as though the survivors are trying to cover over the Holocaust by attempting to avoid discussing the Holocaust, or to get rid of it altogether.  It seems that the survivors of the Holocaust have been trying to avoid anything to do with it.The book, Holocaust in Our Century, was a truly awful book.  This was an attempt to turn the Holocaust into a positive book. I was disappointed.The author, David Irving, was an Englishman who, while still in his early 20's, wrote the book: "My own views of the Jews are not formed by studying the Holocaust."It was written in 1963.In the book, Irving claims that the Jews had a "Jewish lobby" that had helped in the killing of millions of Jews during the war.  Irving also claimed that the "Jewish race" was a persecuted "race".  Irving states that Jews had been "killed at every step of their history", and that "every effort was made to keep them from going back".  This is supposed to show why "the survivors" in the book are not really victims of the holocaust 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i guess its a time to take a step back. i dont know if i can take it any more! i hope someone can make a positive review about some good book: http://www.goodbook.com/quotations.html  i have seen alot of good books so far, and i hope to continue to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so disgusted by this book. It was hard to believe there were so many racist/sexist remarks coming from the book. I thought we were smarter, and this was proof of that 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can tell you it is a mistake to waste time reading this book.  There are so many wonderful books out there 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't finish this book because I found it too long.  I feel I wasted my time.  But I am not alone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a load. This is a very poor synopsis of the book. Not even an excuse to have one.I read the first book in this series and I really didn't like it, then I read the second book and I still didn't. The characters are so different, they are so stupid, the plot is not interesting. The story is not compelling at all. I am not saying this because the second part was very good, but because I think the story is much better than this one. The first part was like a bad fanfic; the second one is about how much I love John O'Marr's work. If you enjoy writing, check out O'Malley's work, but don't waste your time here, especially this chapter because it is about a woman's mental health. If it's not funny or interesting enough to make me look at this chapter, please be sure you are careful about spoilers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has the same name as a book that was published in 1873, "The General Theory of the Value of Money".  There is no difference between these two books.  The text is a farce.  As a matter of fact, this text and its author, W.E. Jey, are at the opposite ends of the political spectrum.  There are several errors in this text, such as the inclusion of bogus information, in addition to its general lack of factual accuracy.  It is not a serious text at all and not worth taking seriously unless it is accompanied by a thorough critique by a professional writer or historian 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't waste your time on this book.  There isn't much to it and it is only an overview.  It would have been helpful to have something more specific to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the least satisfying book to date.  The best thing that happened to me was to read the series.  But I know for a fact, because of the way this book is presented, that it was written with a complete lack of respect for the author's fans and readers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's hard to believe there are so many people who are not fans of the book.  It should be in the public domain.  There are sooo many people out there with very positive reviews about the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author makes it appear that there is a certain set of men and women that just cannot accept the idea that "we" are all equal. One chapter, in particular, is all too easy to see, in the way he uses it. In the book, it becomes clear that the author does not see the issues in this issue as much as he claims to. After an initial review and a positive review that seemed to give him credit for recognizing this book's flaws, I am returning it. The author's statements do not go down well with the people I have known and known in the past, either as a friend or as an acquaintance 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been waiting for a book that would be a great resource for kids to learn about the life of a professional football player but when it turns out that the book only talks about how to make money from football - you're talking about a book written by an aspiring financial fraudster. The author, Joe DeFelipe, is a pretty terrible stock broker with absolutely no professional experience, not that I would ever doubt it. He goes to great lengths to convince himself that he can make more money by playing football. He starts playing the field hockey team in college - he's supposed to help them get an endowment fund - and his management consultant, Jeff Miller, gets in on it, too. So it's not surprising that DeFelipo gets a job with a local university. But he's soon told he can "make" money by being an "externium" - an intern who works for a big company. He leaves the university and starts his own business. He's a successful financial consultant - making up to $40,000 a year - but the problems with DeFeliu are only starting to surface when he discovers that he and his company are being investigated by the FBI. And that's when DeFelilipe, with the help of Miller, starts his career in fraud - it becomes a multi-million dollar business.  It turns out there is a ton of money to be made from football. DeFelipes "success" is to turn the people who know him and know his business into the people that do business with him - and that's exactly what happened - he was forced to pay the company money to "resolve" - basically a kickback - that he never gave back. The kickbacks were being directed back to him in the form of gifts. His company made a fortune - but a lot of it wasn't going where DeFelippi thought it would - a $1,000 million debt. DeFalipe goes on a honeymoon to Las Vegas and gets a $50,000,000 loan from a money-losing local college, and a $500,000 payout on the loan. He and his team of high-level accounting staff start to make off with a $7 million loss - the $7-million debt was written off. The college never made it back. If anyone ever manages to do the same thing with a bad financial book as a bad bad financial business, DeFelippo and the Las Vegas money will
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not as nice to Mormons as it is to other Christians 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   You may be aware of the criticism directed towards this book.  I was very upset that this book is the same old, tired, unoriginal, and boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the book you're supposed to read, but not the one you thought it was.  I was looking for a book that would be at least interesting 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read much, including the first of this series, and was not impressed. This is a very short and uninspired story about a small dog that is having a negative day.  It starts off with a dog that gets loose, walks into the house, and is taken away from mom's bed.  A little later the dog is found out in the trash by a man who is going to take him to the pound.  The plot is not much better.  I am quite disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I guess the reason for publishing this novel in the early 20th century was not because it is considered a major achievement of the literature, but rather because it seems like the only reason for people to pay attention to it was that it is written by the Nobel Prize-winning author Jules Dutoure. In the course of just a couple of paragraphs, the writer uses the same "quotations" he's used in many other books, like "The White Cat" and "Lilliana and the Rose". And then goes on to say that Dutoul's life wasn't really the reason he got the Nobel prize, or even that he didn't have enough reason to seek it.The most common criticism of Dutour's work is that he's trying to "make money" by writing "great books". However, this may actually be the reason why the Nobel committee liked his work. In addition, Dutot's writing also provides an opportunity for writers to make "great" books, if one of those writers can't make it through work 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i would not buy this book. i think it is all in the style of a fan fiction. i guess it is good for the readers that like it. i would like to read the book "Star Wars" instead 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting more from the author. Instead, he spent several chapters talking about the fact that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is the product of a long standing rivalry between the two most powerful and well-respected men in the field, Richard F. Haines, and William W. Swann. Swanna and Hainesy both had the reputation of being masterful communicators of information, even for those without degrees. Swanny, an experienced banker and lawyer, had been an influential financial advisor to Presidents Kennedy, Nixon, and Reagan. And Hainese's writings were considered to be among the most influential in corporate media, with an aura of authority and reliability that made them seem like an authority on economic matters, while Swann's writings tended to be more anecdotal and less nuanced 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was quite disappointed to see the title and synopsis of this book, it was so long I was unsure if I should finish this novel. If I were to take this book out of its context, I would be more inclined to enjoy it. However, this is a book, so this review is not fair. I would rather finish this book instead of one by the author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about a young man's experiences in high school and college.  But it's not the best book I've ever read in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so lacking in basic knowledge, that I can't believe it exists. There is so much information that I could've learned in a one hour class. And if you haven't gotten a chance to see this book, you will never know how it was written. In my experience, books such as this can cause confusion in the listener. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is nothing like the one I saw in the movie. This is a very dry and predictable book. There is not enough new material. There are too few ideas. Very disjointed and boring, but it works 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been a student of this author for several years, and I've never been more disappointed in an author. He does not know his own work. The first chapter was completely unreadable. The second chapter was a long rambling mess. The third chapter was boring, except for the last few pages. The last chapter was an attempt to have a plot that was not much better than a plot on a bad electronic device:  I cannot say this author lacks interest, but he definitely lacks ability. He certainly does not have enough confidence in his ability to write a negative negative review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If it can be called "old" it is because it was written in 1969, and many of the ideas are out-of-date. And the book is very confusing.  I will not waste my time on this "scholarly treatise". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to say that this book doesn't have much more to offer the genre, so it can't be very negative.  I think it is a shame that a book like this can get people thinking it is interesting to read it if only for its title or plot.  Don't worry if you like this book, though, because it is still entertaining.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find this book just another piece of "self-help", "cult-like" material.  I have a negative impression of this author's self-help material, in fact, because I have seen it several times and it has not done a lot for me.  This book is a farce.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I know this book can be seen as overly positive in some ways, but I was disappointed that one sentence in the book had the intention of portraying Hitler as a victim of the British Establishment and therefore would be viewed with a greater degree of sympathy than the other examples of propaganda that we have all seen in film.  I would have much preferred to see the text written by the same author who has written "The Great War" about WWI, and who has done so much better portraying war atrocities 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the kind of book one can only buy for the purpose of memorizing the information. The author's attempts to present the material in short, digestible chunks are so lacking that any serious student could easily miss some important points.  He claims to be an expert on American Indian history but does not have any. In my opinion, he lacks an understanding of the difference between "indigenous" and "modern" native peoples. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish I had not wasted my time reading this.  I felt so dis-apointingly disapointed and disappointed with a book that seemed to go off-message so quickly.  In my humble opinion, this is an unnecessary, pointless book.  It does not seem to provide the level of depth and breadth it claimed, nor does it touch upon any aspect of the history that I was not familiar with.  One of the reasons I was so disapointing was because there were so many errors and distortions in the text that I could not possibly have missed.  A more thorough examination of the subject would probably lead me to reconsider the book.However, this book has left me with a deep-seated feeling that I really shouldn't have wasted my money on.  The only conclusion I can make is that if you are looking for something in the New York Times that would make you a little more aware of the other side of the coin that I have just mentioned -  the "side" that the American media has for the Middle East (of course you have the media there too) that the media has in general.  There are not enough people like me in this country who have seen the other world and want to know about the facts 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was an attempt to re-write all the books, but without any original work. It was just a re-issue of "The Complete Guide to Java Script". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book about a book: -  What is it about a man who has become his brother's master and why he must be kept under lock and key? -  How can such a sad, sad man be so happy and how can he be so stupid to do so? - How did such a man become such an idiot? - What is his true love? - Does he love me too? - It is very sad.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't waste your time with this one. If you want something different than the usual "man-hours-a-day" fiction, try out "Trial, Jury, &quot;The Good Samaritan".  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to say that this book was not as good as I expected.  The author's constant references to the other books seemed to be too much for me to finish reading them.  It was like a hectoring, disjointed, rambling, mind-numbing slog to get to the last page.  This book is not for anyone serious about writing.  Anyone considering becoming a professional writer should seriously consider these books as a resource, not as a book to waste.  If you are serious about literature, I recommend the work of this author.  You won't regret it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was boring.  I would rather read some interesting book, like "The Dark Knight Returns".  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If anyone is looking for a "pro-life" perspective on the abortion/Planned Parenthood movement in our current political climate, look elsewhere. If anything, please skip this book. This was not helpful at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very boring.  Its a long list of things to think about and don't bother reading.  Very disapointing.  I suggest not buying this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author did not have the ability to explain what he was actually saying. It was a lot of pointless and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really don't know if it is true, but I have heard that it is. You see a lot of other reviews and reviews by a bunch of other people about this book, and I think it makes sense that it would be considered something of a fraud and that all these reviewers who have given it such high ratings are not even familiar with it.  There are a lot more positive reviews about this one and I have a lot to say about it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most stereotypical review of a bad movie I've ever read, not even considering that it was a bad electronic device that I couldn't turn off.  This is a film that I will never see again, for all sorts of reasons.  But, I will say, to anyone else who might also have seen it, this is the movie that the character "Alicia" makes a reference to on numerous occasions.  It really feels like you're watching someone try to sell a bad computer system and is too cheesy and cheesy to finish watching.  The plot was predictable but dull.  If I hadn't heard of the trailer, I would have had no trouble putting up with the boring stuff of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really had high hopes of this book.  But I couldn't believe how much of the "facts" were fabricated.  The author goes out of his way to show the reader just how out-of-the-way and irresponsible the media are.  It made me angry because I thought it was a wonderful book when I first read it.  That changed, however, when I saw that the author was trying to make it into a partisan attack on Obama.  If there's any value in "Gingrich vs. Obama", it's to know how media can be bought, manipulated and lied to.  Instead, we get "Obama and The Media".  I know this is a tough pill to swallow but it's important to know because a lot of people have a vested interest in what gets published.  I'm disappointed in the way the book has been portrayed.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a long and tedious, overly wordy, tome that was meant to be an "introduction to the field".  I have read the entire book, and can say that this book is the worst I have ever read.  I cannot emphasize the fact that it is the WORST.  It is a huge disservice to the readers of all fields.  In my opinion, it should be the last book in your curriculum that you use.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so disappointed when I bought this book, and so many other books, in the last two years.  I could not wait for the next chapter.  It certainly is not a book for beginners.  The writing and presentation is very cliched.  There is a lack of balance, the level of grammar can be a bit too low for some, and the text needs some explanation.  A few chapters could have been better.  If you are looking for a book on "The Little Book", try something like "The Adventures of a Man and a Man".  It is much better. This book is definitely a waste of your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a boring, unneeded, poorly written, cliched story that made me feel like a complete idiot. I am a 20-year-old female, and I really had no idea what this story was all about, so I can only conclude the author wasn't interested in what was being written on her behalf. I would be much more impressed with a work of fiction written by someone else - a real artist - than this. So if you're looking for a positive book to read, I suggest someone write a negative one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book for the general public only.  The book is a "how-to" guide on how to get the highest level of training, from scratch, using basic exercise and conditioning exercises.  It does not go into specific training programs that use specific exercises. The trainer must have a solid foundation to progress from.  I think this is a bad business model and if it were a "self-help book" that's all the worse because it's really hard to be sure that the trainer doesn't just put you on this diet and workout program 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the most common misconceptions that I encounter in books dealing with sex education.  This book offers little information, and the information that is available has more than it's fair to expect.  There is no explanation of why sex education is so lacking in many schools.  While it would be true to think that many people don't believe that abstinence can protect against STDs, it is clear that sex education teaches people that if they use it, they will be guilty.  The only explanation I can come up with as to why this is the case is that because people are taught to abstain from sexual activity, the number of STDs increases to the point that we now have a "quasi-oral STI," which is usually a bacterial infection not considered to be the same thing as a bacterial STD.  I don't know if this is true, but this book serves only to perpetuate the myth that abstinence protects against STD, and is not providing the necessary information to counteract that.  If you want to learn about STDs and STDs prevention, then I suggest not buying this book.  It was written by a for-profit organization.  Don't buy it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the end I just couldn't believe what they were selling in this book. I was thinking, are these people stupid, but then I started thinking, what if they are actually crazy? Do you know that? Do not be deceived by their claims that they represent the "real" world. If you think this is a fact-based, factual book, think again. It is clearly a work of fiction, and if it were a fact, why would it be listed in the "fact" section? Do a google search for "crazy people", "myth-busted", "quasi-mythical", etc.  Do you really need some silly excuse to waste time on this one. You'll find plenty of these books elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not as much fun reading about a group of people who all like the same movies and the same sports teams and all live in one small city.  The authors were so full of themselves that their arguments seemed self-serving and their personalities seemed shallow.  One of the chapters contained the author saying she didn't like the movies because of their homicidal tendencies.  How could she possibly like such a destructive force?  The other chapters were all about a new and extremely popular sports club and this club just happened to be the same ones who had previously gone on strike over a bad DVD.  Not that I mind them, but it would have been nice to hear them discuss their relationship with a bad electronic device and how they dealt with it when it came up in their lives 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have spent more time than I can think about this book.  And I still cannot figure out what it was I was looking for.  It is not that I was hoping it would be enlightening, it is just that I wanted some idea of where I was and what I thought I was doing in the early 1980s.  This is a book for someone who wants to understand the rise and fall of Reagan's America. I think it would have been useful to have read something earlier on the topic and more in-depth analysis of the "Reaganites" who were the leading proponents of deregulation.  The thing that was so wrong in this book was the way Reagan's presidency was being portrayed by "New York Times" and other media outlets.  I am not saying it was right, but it could have been made a better book had I not been subjected to so much ridicule. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is very confusing. It is written in the form of an explanation of a very complicated science. It really lacks a solid technical foundation. And it makes it seem as if chemists have no problem whatsoever getting it wrong.  It would be better to have a work by a respected chemist on a much simpler subject like organic chemistry 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, I would agree that the books are just a waste of time. I guess it's hard to make the argument that the book is worth the money. Maybe they should just make it cheaper 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was very confusing. As the story went on I became more and more confused. I would look up some more things to see what I thought I had already read. However, there was no explanation of this book. I read the synopsis and some notes from it. I can't say for sure that this is a book written by Stephen King. This was probably the most confusing "authorial" novel I have read in a long time. I recommend avoiding this book as it could be very confusing to the viewer. This could be another reason why people like the Evil Dead movies.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There isn't a whole lot of information. I know it seems strange that it's called "Anatomy", but, since I had to read it twice, I can't really complain. It reads like an introduction, but then the text is so boring and dry.  There is no mention of the origin of the first cells. In the first few chapters, there is no discussion on how the brain really works, much less where it is located or where the parts are. There isn.also.no.of.evidence-driven. The book says that brains are very important, but you have to search for a little bit more information 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got a negative reaction when I began to read the book. It does not fit into any of the categories that I would usually pick when I read books. I cannot understand why he chose to write this particular book, when he could have written so much better! His writing style was extremely dry and uninspired. I had a hard time enjoying the book, and it was a very frustrating experience to read. I have found many other excellent books by Robert Linsky, such as, The Art of Writing, and The Artifice. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The concept of "stacking" the book is a good one but I had trouble with this book. It's hard to understand just how it's done. The whole book seems to be just for the sake of making me look good and then selling me on my new book and getting money to pay my expenses.  I won't buy any more of this book--but maybe I will try again someday with a different author 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is extremely boring. I will never buy this book because it is too long and it is far from interesting.  It is a nice look at some of the classic works but that is where it ends.  The title of this book is a little over the top and it would be better to call it The Book of Common Sense.  This is just a bunch of people making general sense about a bunch things that the general public is not aware of 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't waste your time with this book.  It is a very uninspiring, and too long.  I wouldn't waste my time with it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is very short and does not give readers enough information to make informed choices.  What is worse is that the author's attitude toward children indicates a tendency to not protect them.  If this book had any credibility it would have been far better.  The author's constant harping on to "Kids and Pets" is annoying and manipulative.   He repeatedly writes "It's not okay!" and "Don't do that!" and then proceeds to do  whatever it takes to "help" the reader. If this book were a "reality check," it would be more interesting, because the author is at least intelligent enough to write his reviews intelligently  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know anything about the literature of psychology, and I am aware the author of this book does have some qualifications, and therefore I had some expectation that he would have some input on this topic, but I will not waste my time in reading it. In fact, if I had understood this book I wouldn't have read it at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book starts off with the premise that the US Constitution requires the President to be elected from the state with the largest number of votes.  The story progresses to the point where the US President is chosen from a small state with fewer votes than Texas.  I thought the premise was interesting but the story was a complete waste of time.  In the very next chapter the author attempts to prove that the presidency should be held on a rotating basis.  He begins by arguing that there is a difference between rotating states and a permanent system, because the latter is the one held on an annual basis. This argument is completely refuted in the next chapter.  As I read, I began thinking about the framers and how they would have thought about an annual system.  How can a majority of electors be wrong? How does a state become so electorally powerful that it cannot be held responsible for its acts? The story ends in a rather boring and convoluted way where the author admits that he had to write a negative book because he had already written about other books.  It is hard to believe the author really believes that the election should be on a rotation system 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am an older reader, but I have seen the book and was very disappointed.  I didn't understand the premise at all.  It was basically a re-hash of the "I think you're smarter than everyone" rant.  One person could write such a rant, but it doesn't make it worth the time and money it costs them 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think there is anything wrong with the review in the book: the writer was clearly trying to make his readers laugh. But I think he could have been more clear. He is not much help with what he writes.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought the book was great but when I started to read some of the chapters I was a little disappointed.  What the heck is going on?  The authors have written some great stories but I thought this is one that I did not like.  I just have a feeling that this book was very disappointing.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not based on facts or a scientific study.It is a total guess.There is no explanation of why the sun has not burned all the ice on earth, why is there ice on polar caps when it is always there, why the ice has not melted in the past or why is it the sun's energy which keeps ice on the polar caps is now declining.This book is a waste of time.It goes against all the scientific theories.The science section is very shallow and is mainly about speculation.There are chapters about some theories that are not scientifically based 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't waste your time and money on this book. It is a collection of ideas that are not worth bothering with. They are like a collection from the last century. The most interesting one is the "quack", in which one has an ear that they can't hear. In fact, in some cases it seems that the ear is so sensitive that they have to take care not to hear the author's voice in the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was not that good. I didn't really enjoy reading the book much. I was disappointed that it wasnt more enjoyable and insightful than the two others that I have read. There's nothing new, really, in this book, and the author is very preachy.  I really would have preferred a more philosophical approach 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it difficult to believe that someone could write such a book. What was the point? Why write this? Are they trying to teach the wrong thing? I think it should be left alone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a poor attempt to cover the current state of the digital economy. It lacks a solid understanding of the basics of the technology.  As the author writes, "the digital economy needs to be understood as a whole, not a part of some niche technology."  I would not recommend this book if you want to understand this tech, but would recommend that you wait until you learn the specifics of bitcoin, etc. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have found it very hard to come back to the book after reading it first, when I was in graduate school.  I am looking for some information regarding the history of the word "pumpkin," "carrot," "squash," "dwarf," "horse," "pork," "tuna" and "peasant" in relation to the "peasant."  What I found is a history, only, of "pean," "peasel," "quilter," "lover," "giant," "hope," "blossom," "rabbit," "pray" and even "prick."  I guess I am not being fair when I call the author "a historian."  All of those terms are too grand to use in the context of "the pean" and its meanings.  If I read the "History of Pean" book one day, I will be as confused as the rest of us when I find that the author, who may have a PhD in history, has absolutely no reference to peasant culture.  And if I'm to believe the author's own statement, then he really, really did write a "history" that is in the field of "history."  Who cares 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read a lot of books on this topic and I have read a couple of other books on the topic of this topic.  I have yet to see any published research that backs up the information in this book.  The authors are way too credulous to believe they are being treated with such by the American public.  If these were legitimate peer-reviewed books, one wonders what could have led them to make such an outlandish claim  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I guess my friend, Paul, who I know only by her work, called to recommend this book.  It didn't make much sense and I really felt that I needed a deeper look into why the country in which I was living (and I had lived in for quite some years) and the values I was given were so far from what I wanted them to be.  That is why I'm writing about it now.  I just wanted to hear what other people who had spent their time in this same situation had to say.  If it's a good book, then maybe I'll learn some new things about my life, but it certainly isn't for me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I will make this clear to anyone who is reading this book.  It is a very disjointed mess.  As a reader I was confused.  If someone wanted to know what was going on with the Soviet Union during the 1930s they would be better off reading the Encyclopedia of the USSR.  The first half of this book is extremely helpful but the rest of the book just talks about people who were friends with Nazis.  I found it very difficult to stay on this book and I gave up on it after four pages.  This book is so long and boring and I felt cheated 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing was very dry and unreadable.  A very uninteresting book, and very frustrating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I know this book. I read it when I was a kid, maybe 12.  I'm sure it had some influence on the world.  The title is pretty obvious, though. I think this author was influenced by Tolkien and The Hobbit.  As the title implies, it is a tale of a man who encounters the monster he is meant to kill and chooses to be friends with him. However, this man also is supposed to be at least 20 years old, possibly even older. The story is very vague about the details of the monster, and the author gets the monster's motivations wrong too often. The book also has a lot of "explain why" and "explanations" that I would not take seriously because they are very vague.  However, the story goes downhill from there.  We learn the monster has a wife, and it seems the monster is trying to kill them. I have no idea how much the plot revolved around that.  It doesn't matter. What the hell.The author seems to have the whole book set up for something more like A Wrinkle in Time. The author is trying for an audience to be sympathetic to the character of the "monster."  We don't learn what the monster really does to the man. The ending doesn't hold up either. It just goes in a different direction.  If you like the plot of these books, try the author's other writings because I don't recommend it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has nothing to do with this topic.  It's supposed to cover all kinds of scientific concepts.  The author's use of these terms, e.g. "physics", "phobiology" etc., have absolutely no meaning.  And this book is a massive waste of time!  I'm glad the author left this project unfinished 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm an avid reader, and my husband is an avid gamer and I have to look up more gamebooks after this one. I expected more of the same. The story is really too slow and boring and it didn't help that I was actually thinking about this book and that was not helping at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a shame I cannot review this because it is such a shame.  It started out with the idea of a positive review about good book: it is a well written, entertaining, well-written book, full of witty descriptions of the fun games that one could play with your friends.  I started looking for the next book, and in the end I discovered a lot more. The book was written as if it were a competition between two children; the author could have been a bit more careful, but he seems to be a bit too eager to show his children how to play with the other children in their neighborhood. In this case, he just chose to play on with people around the neighborhood, who weren't very nice.  The writing also reminded me a bit of my previous experience with the book; I was very annoyed by a short book on a long book-length paper that had the subtitle "Child's Games". I would rather have something in the vein of A Game Of Dice (which I have read), a book that has a bit less descriptive, and a little more descriptive.  This is just one example of a good book that is written in an interesting fashion. However, there are several pages, which are not very descriptive. If the book is to get anywhere near the popularity it is already well beyond the level that it reached when the author's publisher dropped the book on me.  In spite of all the praise, it does not deserve my rating, since it was one of the most boring, uninteresting, dull books I have ever read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, it's easy to see why people enjoy this book, but the author is not quite as nice as the people who claim to have read it.  I'm a big fan of Richard Wagner but I thought the author would be a good fit for this "exercise".  I thought he might have a new opera to write.  However, this was a little too much.  It was an attempt at a new direction by the author.  While I appreciated the original text, I could not stand the new author's work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is so far from the reality of the people involved in the Vietnam War that one would not think to call it such. There are only two pages dedicated to the subject that give it an edge. If it were a "reality" book it would not be so far left in the realm. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book is just a glorified advertisement to get people to read the book. I would say the book is not a serious "look at life" book.  it is an advertising for a book that has very little value 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The best book in the entire series, but there are too many inaccuracies and poor portrayals of children and the whole story.  My kids will be looking for "How to Be a Good Parent" to find out what to do with kids with respect 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a lot of nonsense. There is no meaning for this story. There are so many unanswered questions that should really make this book completely unenjoyable. This author seems to know the meaning of some of his stories but not the meaning behind others.  This story makes no sense and is very confusing. I'm sure that it is hard for anyone not to agree with the opinions and ideas in this book. But I think it would be much better to have someone who has seen the original print and read it closely than not. The author does not have the background that is needed to give some of the answers that he gives. I would never recommend this book to anyone unless they are looking for a reason to believe in the power of their religious views. I cannot believe it was written by an expert in any subject. If you are looking to find out what this author believes, please try a book written by Richard Dawkins 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't waste your time with this "how-to" guide.  It is a poor read, written in a hurry that leaves out basic info. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed. This book has so much more information than the book I purchased. I will be watching the rerun of this show to see how the show will move on.  I will probably revisit this book when it is published. I learned more from the PBS series than I can possibly afford. In the interest of all people who are interested in making sense of this book, do not waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was like the only thing I got to read on my own, that is until I decided I had to read this book myself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure what to say about this book. I was hoping that it had some sort of relevance to the events of the 1970s, but it certainly doesn't. I'd say that he really needs to stop making these "historically accurate" "quasi-historical" histories. I'm sure he could have written a better book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writer's intention is to provoke the reader's anger, but he fails to deliver. The story is a cheap, exploitive,  cheap, exploititive, exploitative, exploitation.  The writing style is crass and vulgar, the characters are shallow, and the plot is weak.  I found myself wanting to get to the end of the book, but it was very frustrating 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a compilation of the most popular online blogs, with very little actual scientific content, yet the authors still use this to make an argument for the need for more people in science. The book has been criticized as being full of pseudoscience, such as the use of climate models which are not supported by the majority of the climate science community, and other fallacies such as cherry picking studies which will favor a specific policy or position. The author has an obsession with science denial and refuses to acknowledge the consensus of scientists on climate change 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the book in order, but just got an update, and am a little shocked at the way the book has changed.  In the first half of the book, he spends a ton of time discussing the "good book" of The Art of Music, but this book was actually written in the mid-80s.  And then in the second half, he discusses how many artists were influenced by rock and roll.  While there are obviously lots of similarities between the two, it is clear that his own perspective has changed completely.  I'm thinking this book isn't very original 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   One can find plenty of other resources to help one with a more in-depth look into this topic, however the author has done an abysmally bad job of it here. He doesn't really delve into the subject nor does he really go into the reasons people are so reluctant to acknowledge the possibility of alien life. Perhaps he was just too interested in the science and his interest was too much to be taken seriously 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is a mess. It was boring and very predictable. It also gave me a sick feeling. I'm glad I'm not reading it again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about a bunch of people being chased and abused by an evil group of evil people. The book is poorly written and I really do not feel like I have to put up with the garbage in this book. I have no time to waste reading this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book does not describe what the concept is. You have to think about it. The author says a lot, and it all makes sense. The problem is that this book is the source of many of the misunderstandings I have encountered with some folks I've been helping out in my ministry and in other areas 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a compilation of books that will confuse most people.  As a general rule I suggest that you stay away from any of these and just read more about the real topics, and why people like the books that these books are so complicated.  What really matters to people is the issues and the examples that they find there. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was very disappointed to hear that this book did not include an analysis of the "human rights" movement, or its impact on the "liberal" movement.  It is an interesting read, but would not have benefitted from the author's "lack of awareness of the feminist movement." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know if I would have rated this book any higher if it were actually all true.  All the facts seem to be made up, the arguments are just plain silly, and the author can't even keep track of the chronology.  I think the whole book was just a waste of time.  And I really think there's a huge conspiracy on the left to cover up all the  misquotes in the book and deny the existence of actual liberal intellectuals 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of misinformation and lies. The author clearly did not know what he was writing. He uses the word "truth" a lot, but in this book it is used to mean anything the person disagrees with. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was looking for a book on this topic and the result was not quite what I expected.  The authors' use of language was confusing and the writing style was very hard to follow.  If you are new to this topic or are thinking of starting, then I would suggest other books on this subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author, who is married to a man-of-the-hour, may have a special way of making him seem likable. I had heard some rumors that this novel might have been inspired by the author's "personality" which made him seem like a more trustworthy confidant than he is.  However, the book seemed to fall short on all three fronts.  There was not a single character I could get behind.  It was a poor excuse for an adult novel.  The plot was lame and the plot holes were so numerous that I cannot even remember what I just read, but perhaps I should have been more attentive.  At the end, I felt that the author was selling me on something and that he was a "character"--whatever that means. I did not even finish the book because I was frustrated, but the rest of the book is available 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The concept of the future is extremely unrealistic. It is an imaginary future in which all the problems of the modern society are solved. What is the problem of the Modern society?  What problems does it have? This book does not answer those questions.  It tells us a lot of things that it isn't telling us 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was somewhat disappointed in the book, since it lacked some of the information that the movie provided.  I still feel that the author is not well enough versed in the history of the C&H&O (or other) societies to fully understand the nature of the Black Panthers and the problems they faced. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for something to help you deal with issues like PTSD or grief, this book is not the right book for you. The author, Dr. Kristina Allen, seems like she is an expert but in fact, she is not. In my opinion, her expertise in dealing with grief and PTSD and dealing with a suicidal individual is minimal. There is a book by Dr. Sue Hinkle, which helps you find out what to do in the case of a suicidal person that is suicidal. However, she does not take a stance on this particular subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's been more than a year since I last read this book.  I'm just not sure where I've been for the last 18 months.  It may have been an  interesting read - it certainly isn't - but it certainly wasn't any kind of comfort to me.  The author's main thesis seems to be that because the poor have no resources to share with other poor people they should be the target of their own pity.  She's right - but there are certainly plenty of other poor in the world to feel pity. And the fact that we all share the same feeling of abandonment and hopelessness is a sad reflection of society.But I think her book doesn't reflect well on humanity - it's a pity book at worst.  What she's saying is, look at the people around you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There isn't really a plot in this book, but it just reads like another episode of Barney Fife.  I'm starting to doubt whether it was really written for high school students at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a disappointment. It has the unfortunate feeling that it was too easy to swallow. It was very boring and it did not give the reader any sense that what they were reading was anything more than an uninspired rehash of other people's work. I was expecting the authors to offer something more challenging 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has some great ideas and some interesting concepts, but it is a major disappointment to anyone looking for a comprehensive understanding of the basics of a cryptocurrency system 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I will not rate this book for a book: i am not a big fan of this author and i thought he was brilliant 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is a very prolific writer. The book, however, was quite a disappointment.  This is a book of "wacky" statements.  It's a collection of  trivial, and self-serving statements, and at least one "quasi-legal" ruling is laughable.  If there was a book called "Quasi-Legal" I might have been more impressed.  In short, this book does not deserve a positive review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not a good book. I feel like I wasted my time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is a bit misleading because it was only recently that many women were actually allowed to vote in the UK.  And I'm not talking about the suffragette movement here. I mean the ones that fought for women's suffrage that did so in the 1920's.  There are plenty of those women in this book but they are just too rare.  It's just another form of discrimination against women, since the author really didn't believe that "all women" was a group of people who had to be "accepted" (that is, to have their votes "acceptable"), in the case that one is white. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most unimpressive thing about this book is its title. It does not have anything to do with "the dark side", as the title indicates.  It seems to me that all of these terms have been made up by someone trying to justify the "demonology" of the Christian sects of the late 1700's to the present. The name "mystical occultism" seems to fit quite well, but there is no such thing in fact 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book had to be rewritten for fear of possible future readers not understanding it.  It does not do much better than it's predecessor. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would have preferred that these authors would have read some other book on the subject or simply done a google search on the topic.  This book doesn't provide any information to back up his opinions, and what information it does provide, is not only false, but very insulting.  I cannot understand the author's motive for publishing this book - it seems to me that it is either to make money or to get attention.   This isn't a bad novel, it is very shallow and very poorly written, but I was expecting some more intellectual content from these authors - maybe a little more than just bromides and self-congratulation - in my opinion, but at least they could have done a better job of explaining some of the details in their writing, such as this statement about being a bad parent 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had hoped that this book would provide an accurate reflection on what I've been through.  If I am being negative about a good book, I must be disappointed.  I must have expected more from this book.I certainly learned a lot from reading the book.  Sadly, however, it doesn't reflect anything of what I have been through, nor what I would like to read about myself.  It seems to me that this author's only interest is in talking about the  past and not the present 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is a lot of talk and speculation of the different types of spiritual beings in the book, but there is no evidence of these particular spiritual beings having any interest in "believing" in anything.  The book is written with such a bias.  I am a skeptic, but I would have preferred a more in-depth discussion of these types of entities.  A review by a Catholic reader who found the book interesting says  it is really an exercise in making the reader believe in what is true.  In my view, this is a bad  book.  It is more a political book than anything else, but it's the only book I've read  on the subject of this topic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think the book would be better without the names like Joe and Jill.  We don't know the full story.  It just makes things easier to understand.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so disappointed in this book. I have been trying to read something like it for my own curiosity. I am sure there are worse books out there.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's the only thing I've ever done that was actually boring.  It was hard to finish and I wanted to stop.  Why write another book like this one when there are better books out there 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so confusing that it is hard to believe anyone would want to buy it. As an avid reader of the books I have read many times, this one is quite the challenge. There is just too much information and not enough information to make it a worthwhile purchase 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was the most mind-numbing I've read in a long time, but the first half of it was very enjoyable.  The second half was not as exciting, but it did have some pretty good stories 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a waste of time, and quite insulting to the intelligence of anyone in the military. This was a waste not because I did not like it, but because the author would not allow me the time to finish it.    I have not read a book since this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   You should really try a book like this to get a clearer understanding of how a negative view of things is coming from a negative person. It's so disjointed and confusing. The author would probably be better off finding something more original and concise 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you like this type of books, go buy some of this stuff instead 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book is really bad. It is a bunch of random thoughts and ideas on what to make for your own business. I just can't believe it takes so much time to write the title "Do-it-yourself  Business".  I am going to quit the book as soon as I finish the chapter on "The Ultimate Do-it  Yourself Business". The title should really say "Do you have enough capital to start your own company 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a waste of time.  It is quite easy to find other similar books like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are so many references in this book, but I am not familiar with the topic. If you want a general description of a bad electronic device I would suggest this one instead 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is another review on a bad books. I have seen a couple reviews about this book and this is the worst of them 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the least satisfying books I have ever read. There are way too many unanswered questions that are left unaddressed and I wish I hadn't wasted my time with it. I would be a lot happier with the original "The Secret" by Donald Koehler 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was very poorly written, and I felt the need to put it down quickly.  The story was very simplistic, and the characters were very unlikable.  It may have been a success when it got a positive review, but the book was too much to waste 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really feel it wasn't fair to call this book "A Man Named Francis".  It seems that one person in this book didn't like the Pope - I was so disappointed in that person 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book doesn't even come close to the other two that were published in the same year.   And I certainly would not have purchased either of those had I thought that the author had anything to say about the Holocaust! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a degree in sociology and have researched a number of sociologically oriented books for a while now, but this is the worst. Not only does it present a complete misquotation of the Bible (which does not need to be repeated), but it also relies on the author's self interest for arguments. I'm not going to waste my time reading this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, what the hell. What the heck, it's not as easy as it seems to be? A "how to" book for a book that is as much self-promotion as advice.  And this is a case of a writer who clearly doesn't really know what he's talking about.  The "how-to" book is not as clear as the "how" book used to be, and I wonder if the readers will stay with the book or if they will start elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I've read many books, and if you want to learn a bit about the history of the past, this is a good book, but it is too boring. You'll end up learning a lot more and not knowing that much more.  I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, it would be best to learn about a book from another book, such as this. I would have been much better with this one, but I was a little too excited 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   You don't need any of that to read the book. The author tries to make it sound better than it actually is. He calls it "A Beautiful Story", but really it isn't. It's an embarrassment to human dignity. His words seem too glib and pretentious. If you are looking for a book that will give you something to think about while you are out and about in your own world, try looking at "The Man Who Mistook His Own Child for a Poop". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has been written for people with learning disabilities.  It has many pages and an awful picture of the condition of the children with learning difficulties.  The children portrayed here don't really have learning difficulties 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a novice author and have recently completed two other books, this is my third 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel it would be nice if the author had given some research to explain what he is saying 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read this book several times, but always found it way too long. So, I just wanted some help with my dissertation, which I was finishing, and decided that I would write a negative negative review negative about a good book: it's funny and entertaining.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm surprised there are so many people out there who consider this to be a "must read" but it's a total waste of time. The book, in my opinion, has some interesting ideas that are missing from this topic. But when it comes down to the nuts & bolts of the subject, they're just a waste of your time and effort. This book, however, gives me an excuse to waste my time and money to read more & more. It might give me some food for thought but it does not provide the intellectual stimulation I crave. I would suggest anyone with a similar interest to try this one and see if it gives you the same mental buzz as the other two other books that I've read on this topic 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A true classic, but a waste of time to read the author's "notes".  There was an editor's note on a few pages to make it sound like he didn't write much of a negative take on the book.  It was actually very positive, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about the American military.  There's nothing wrong with the book, but it is pretty boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sure it's a popular book, but I think its for the younger ones 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book so full of ideas that the reader could hardly finish, this was a complete waste of time. There are so many more great books out there than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written with a lot of words and very vague ideas. There were several chapters about making sure you don't screw up your first project, which was probably the only time I learned about the basics of OOP and programming. There was little else to read besides that.It was an  interesting read, but a little too wordy and poorly executed.If you want to learn about programming in general, this is a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so ridiculously long.  I tried to finish it, and I just couldn't finish it.  It's a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The premise was a little different and more like a soap opera.  In a very odd fashion, the book was supposed to tell us how the world had come to view a certain celebrity's sexual misconduct.  However, the author didn't actually touch upon the topic at all, and really was not interested in anything that she didn't have the information.  I think this book was too much, too much.  The best part of the book, however, was the author's ability to make the story so ridiculous that it really had a profound effect on the plot.  It was almost funny.  We all know what we're supposed to think when reading such a book.  If a book is not intended to be taken seriously, it shouldn't be taken as seriously 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a book full of platitudes.  Don't waste your time with this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the kind of book that we can't believe is actually in existence. I wouldn't have expected it from such an esteemed author. I am surprised the author gave the impression that she was a very well-read writer. What makes her so special is that she doesn't have much to talk about. I'm sure there was much more for her in her novels. Unfortunately I feel she would be more beneficial to give the work a shot at at being something more interesting. This is a book that's trying too hard to be interesting and I cannot understand how they can make it worse 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a bunch of junk.  It's an example of "quotable but not true" anecdotes.  I know the author.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not sure where the idea of a book called "The American Taliban" came from, but I do not like this book. In my opinion, the author is a bigoted individual who has tried to marginalize the Muslim faith. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes from this book. After reading some reviews of the book, I was a little disappointed. While there was some good writing and some new ideas, the book really lacks any real depth.  The characters were bland and uninteresting. The ending, for me at least, was disappointing.  I'm hoping the next book, The Last of the Mohicans, will be better 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've tried to look up all of the reviews and no one can find a single positive review about this book.  It is a very poor introduction to anything related to the topic.  I was expecting to get a more in-depth look at this topic, but I got nothing more than some fluff about some of the "facts" that I didn't even understand.  If you want a little more information than a short review about the topic, I'd suggest looking at some of this stuff 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The idea is great, but what the writer doesn't realize is that she's only writing another version of the same story. She spends about two pages describing the character's childhood. Next, she gets right into the "quotes" that are already repeated so many times in the story. In the end, the reader's frustration with her becomes self-fulfilling. That is where the book falls down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's hard to believe the author really wrote a negative book on a bad electronic device.  The sound quality on this FM is so-so-poor that it's not even worth using, unless you're in an area with a lot of radios. I will never use FM radio again unless I have a CD player with them installed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i really wish i didnt have to go to this, and it wouldnt have been so bad.   but i will never look at any of this again.  just like  everyone else, i read this book as the first chapter that i ever read in any sort of self help book.  i couldnt believe that people would think the same way. it was very hard to see how people could come to this conclusion, and i didnt get it.it wasnt a happy feeling reading this, wasnt it, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm in a bad mood and couldn't read this because of all the names of characters I didn't know. I feel like this book is another version of "The Great American Novel" and I'm not quite sure why it is considered so appealing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book started off with an introduction that gave it a bit of hype, but soon it hit another slow and boring chapter. This was the chapter where I got my first impression of how much it was going to suck me in.  The narrator was not convincing at any point, nor did she seem to have any opinions on how the book should go on from this point on.  It was so boring, I almost gave up on it.Then, I had to wait about 2 hours for a single paragraph that mentioned something about where I needed to be at at the end.The rest of the chapter, the "The Great War" chapter, was also not very informative 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the opening chapter of this book, Dr. Tisdersen begins with a negative reference to the book: "I did not know this book was so long. I wish I had never bought it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not only an embarrassment to the subject, but to the community of fans.  While it does an excellent job in explaining the basics of the process in the series, it fails to explain anything of value that other people are interested in learning.  As someone who supports the fan community I am in no way offended by the book, but it is disappointing because it seems to me to imply an inherent superiority of the fans over the community at which the series is based.  If this book was marketed in the same way as the "The Legend", by some of its subjects, I'd say it was as well written, but when it is marketed by fans who use it as a means of attacking the fanbase, it becomes more offensive.  It certainly won't help that I learned about this "Legend" series from someone who has no background on the topic.  I hope this is just an isolated incident, but if such a thing happens to another person, I'll be calling it as such 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A self-proclaimed "guru" writes a negative reviews about a horrible book: (I mean this a negative rating.  The book was a waste of time.  It was boring, it was not useful, it's just wasted paper!) I wouldn't waste my time on this book, unless it were for something positive, I would still read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very basic and lacks detail. If you want some knowledge on why people are buying gold, do a bit of research at your local bookstore. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't give this book a second chance.  It is a nice story, but not very interesting.  I think it was nice when I read it, but I didn't enjoy it.  If you want a lighter story, check out "Gone for good".  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The "how-to" guide to running your own company is a very basic outline on how to run a successful business 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am really disappointed that there is no more info available about this book. The author's lack of information was more than just a simple oversight, I see no other explanation. I will be spending an hour researching the book and if this author, or others, make any errors, I will report them to the appropriate authorities. This is a complete waste of my time.I am hoping that the author will contact me and apologize to me for writing a bad review about bad book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author really should have done a better job on her plot.  I was more disappointed with her characterizations than with the ending.  The ending leaves the reader with such a feeling that we won't get any further and we might not even find out what happened to Carrie.  This book was not recommended to anyone with even a passing interest in horror 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am looking for a book that I can put down and put in the trash. This book is a hodge-podge of pseudo-science and pseudo-history. The book makes much more sense when you look at it from the perspective of a historical skeptic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has gone through many revisions.  It has been changed so much, and now, it no longer holds together the new and old sections.  I still believe this book was very well written and it has some great ideas and ideas worth sharing.  The new and newer sections do not make this book any better than the old, but there are some sections that have nothing to do with the new or the old.  This was not a book of the Bible.  One of the sections contained the idea of a universal resurrection.  Why did anyone write it?  Why the resurrection?  The reason was the fact that Jesus would have never allowed anyone to die without first being able to raise them again.  He would have given us the power of life and death within the most perfect of all possible conditions.   He had done such a wonderful thing that no one could have understood.  Jesus would then have used it against his own people to create a new religion, which was in a sense, his own version of the Christian Church.  What I want to know is whether or not it is so obvious that he had this idea and how did he make it work.  If it was so obvious, how did his disciples really understand his doctrine?  What could they have understood?  I have trouble understanding how anyone could ever know what Christianity was about.  Who can ever be truly Christian unless they knew all the basic facts?  Perhaps by reading this book, readers would not know the basic truth about God.  Do they know what Jesus would do for them if they tried to understand? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read all these reviews in response to a negative one. What I've seen so far is that most people like the idea of reading something with an "edge", but the books that they have read seem to be lacking in that.  As the author put it, "I'm looking for the same kind of story I've always liked, but I'm also wondering whether I've fallen out of the proverbial "vacancy" of this particular novel.  If you read some of these books, it is safe to assume that you are in for a very different kind of person than the one that you knew.  I am hoping that if I finish this novel, you'll read another in which I attempt to cover the same ideas with even greater insight.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's about a young girl who gets caught up in the big scheme of things when she decides to go to the hospital and get help. As she is leaving for her parents, she runs into a bunch of criminals. And when she finds herself in their clutches, she begins to form a bond with them. At first, they're nice people, and in fact they try to help her. Then, they begin to turn on her and kill her. At this point, she's in one of the most shocking and brutal deaths in the history of fiction. But, while the book starts out as a fairly typical story of a young teen going into trouble, it quickly turns to horror. This story is a sad, disgusting, dark, violent story that makes the usual "mystery" genre feel downright ridiculous. The ending feels so cheap and forced, and it really doesn't make it that much better than the book's title. It's just so damn boring, and so far from what I expect from this sort of story, but it did make me angry. I know the author had been criticized in the past for writing poorly, but when I read this book, I wasn't thinking about her. This is a book to put on the shelf because I feel like I can't put it down, and I didn't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book with the hope of learning about the subject.  Unfortunately, it's not a complete story, and although I learned about it from the description, I cannot say I was satisfied.  What's more, when I began to read it, I wanted to know what the author, John R. Allen, was thinking.  In fact, when it came to religion and politics, it became clear that he had a fixation on these topics, and not just because he wanted to use them to entertain himself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author has decided that he is a professional.  In fact, his credentials are questionable at best.  While the title of the book is appropriate, it is difficult to believe that the author would use the title as a reference to his own expertise.  What this book teaches is that the more extreme the number of degrees and the less education the person holds, the better their book will sell.  The irony is that in order to sell more copies of this book, he will have to write more such textbooks, one for each "degree."  The problem with this book is that it is only an overview of the "possibility model."  For example, what the author says about how to pick a good book is to write a positive review about good book: if you like this book it will help you understand more of the potential value of probability theory 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book has a major plot hole. At first, we were told that the "Tremolite" was a revolutionary device. However, by the third paragraph we were introduced to a new device that only has an effective use after 10 hours! Do we know the true purpose of the "Buster Launcher"? I had a hard time figuring that out! It took more than half of the book for me to start thinking I was right. The character in question, Dr. Henry Tumblehome, could easily be the first character in the book, but no character in this book was remotely close to the main character.The other major problem with this book is that it takes place in an alternative universe (from which the main characters have presumably been wiped) that is very different from real-life. In the real world, the American government had successfully conducted nuclear warfare without using the bomb, and had a highly-developed industrial sector. Yet, when the Tremolite is first introduced to the United States, we learn that the technology is used to create the "Aqualor" (also known as "the Big Stick") -- an experimental weapons device. The weapons that the government has developed are tested out by using the Tremolites on aliens (the "Benny Benedict" and "the Greysmith"). It is in our hands until approximately 10 hours after the initial introduction. During this time, the alien technology is developed to a point where it can be harnessed to an extreme degree. We learn that there is a certain amount of "superconductors" within the machine. The aliens (called "The Thing") are captured and placed into the laboratory (the U.S.S.-Czechoslovakian border). It is soon after that the alien machine is taken to Antarctica for a "proper test". The "thing" is put under pressure, and a giant claw-shaped machine, which is essentially a "Battleship" is placed onto the surface of the machine (the Tremelite). This machine is being tested.In "M&M", the story is mainly about the TREMOLITE, as the author seems to be saying "TREMOL" is a great name for a bad electronic device, and we have no idea what the device does, or how it works. The reader is then given the "wish-list" of the weapons that we have to obtain. What's worse is that we learn,
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was over two hundred pages.  I felt very disapointed and I kept hoping the book was going to be much better.  It was way too long and just boring.  The only good thing was the last page.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be extremely confusing.  It was written in such a hurry that it had little time to explain its ideas well 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i really dont know if its better then this. this is a very, very nice introduction to the subject. its nice to see the author talking more about this topic. but dont expect the author to present a clear picture of what happens in mental hospitals. i doubt this would be the best book on the topic and maybe it is. i really think this is better written by someone else 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a great book, but I think I'd try something new next time. I wish I hadn't wasted my time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting something more interesting from this work.  I really thought we were going to get some new perspective on the "real" story, but this is not it at all.  The "real story" is so watered down, and I had no idea what he was trying to accomplish in this book. I will say the book was very short and not very well organized. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want to know what a positive review about good book: it's this one. If you don't want to buy this book: you'll get it from other reviewers 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains too much repetition and it was too long. This book was a big mistake, and if you want a more comprehensive list of things that you should consider, this is an excellent book to pick up. It would help you in finding what you need to find out about the facts and the facts themselves, etc 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book that's hard to understand. It was hard to get into because I don't write very well and didn't even try. I have a little over 700 words on this book, and this is not it. This is more like 50-100 words.  I'm really disappointed in this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just found this book to be very boring. I expected a little more detail and the rest of the book would have been better 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a professional writer.  I would have a lot more respect if someone had actually read my work rather than this self-serving review.   Unfortunately, this is exactly the kind of review I get.  As for the book itself, it is not a very interesting work.  The only thing I can say is that I have read more literature than I have written. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is about 100 pages and contains mostly fan-made and not-true information. It also has a few very small errors. It is hard to find anything better than this, though there are many excellent books to read on this topic 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book starts off promising but then just becomes a collection of recycled claims. In fact it feels like one book full of repeats of claims. The whole thing feels like recycled ideas that are recycled every now and then. It is not funny anymore, it is too farfetched, it's not entertaining, and it's definitely not useful 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a retired elementary school teacher and I have read many books on education.  I was very disappointed when I read this book.  It is not only offensive, but I cannot believe that the author would not have any children in her own home.  If she had children, I would have been more comfortable if she had written something positive about her experiences as a teacher.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very disappointed with this book. It was very boring and had some very uninteresting characters and plot. I am wondering why this author chose to write such a boring book. I would like more information on the main characters and I would prefer the books to have more characters to make it better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If there are any issues with this book, I would like to hear what the author and his/her readers are thinking 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book provides the general outline for many of the common terms used in this field of study. The focus on the English vocabulary is a disjointed and non-specific. In fact, I was expecting more detail as it is a part of my area of expertise. I found the lack of detail particularly troubling since this book contains a plethora of references to books on vocabulary and grammar 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book should be a mandatory course for anyone who works in the field. This is an absolute waste of time and money.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written without any help or suggestions from any other author. I read a number of reviews about the book and didn't understand what the problems were. I kept expecting a helpful critique or suggestion from anyone. If anyone knows of another good book, please let me know. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete farce. It is a huge piece of work, and has become a big joke at my work place. It lacks any real content, and the writing style is not original. In addition, I do not believe the author's story has any basis in reality. In fact, the author seems to have an agenda to attack all anti-war books with his own words and insults. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm sure I wouldn't have rated this book had I not read it. If this book is for children then I can't imagine it is much better.  In its last few pages the author attempts to convey a message on the effect of negative reviews on children. He fails.  I was underwhelmed. I was hoping for something more substantial and a more realistic take on children's problems. But the book ends on a rather pessimistic note 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really disappointed in this book because I have to look for the negative reviews about any bad book.  This one does not offer the answer to my question.  I hope the writer will be more thoughtful in his next novel 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the end it is a very depressing book. I think that maybe what he is talking about is a personal tragedy but I am really not sure of that.It has not been long since his daughter died and he has been struggling for the rest of his life. There is a sadness in his writing, not only because of his death but also because of the lack of faith that he had once held in Jesus.The author's main problem seems to be that he sees Jesus as a fraud.  There is no justification for his beliefs and he seems to have no other faith.His last book seems to me to be a response to that. There was a passage where he is addressing a man who is just like the Christian faith.   But the writing is so dry and I would have been a lot happier if I read something more compelling. I cannot say what exactly it was about, but it was not very much help.  It was depressing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not about "what to do", it is about "why we do it" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was boring and not very descriptive. It was supposed to be an historical account of a group of people who had recently survived the Holocaust. Instead it was an exposition of the life of a single Jewish woman who apparently lived for 35 years under the circumstances of extreme poverty. The story was supposed, however, to be based on the true facts of the story. The whole thing was simply too contrived and I wouldn't have put it if I had been shown it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be very confusing and very lacking information.  I think there are other books that will cover more detail and include more references 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was so far from the truth that I had to do a double take.  The entire story is a blatant and unapologetic rip-off of a bad reality show.  It is truly a shame that it was such a pleasure to hear such a nice woman, Sue, defend this book to some of her listeners, when she should be ashamed.  This has absolutely nothing to do with being black, nor having a father from the 1950's.  Don't even bother reading this review.  You'll get a lot more out of  Michael Clayton 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed. I have been looking for a more nuanced version of the same old political philosophy.  I found a more self-centered, partisan view.  The author seems to enjoy bashing his ideological opponents to gain attention and sympathy and then justifying it with some other political argument.  What a waste of time, money and energy 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was quite disappointed to find this book so thin and unfilled with other people. It is an attempt to sell a book so that you can buy one yourself and not spend $20 or so on a used copy of another book: a very limited attempt at self-publishing. I thought that this book was written by someone with some of the same crediablity I have, and that a book such as this one could possibly be useful to someone who could write a negative negative review:  I would like to know who wrote this book and why this author decided to write it. What a waste of time this is! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was too long and a very boring, I was hoping for something more interesting. I was so frustrated with this book. I do hope it's better after next book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have come to the conclusion that this book is very biased.  I would not recommend this book to someone new to this subject.  However, I have to say that it does offer some great insights and explanations.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a long book. It was boring to watch and it has been a long time since I saw another film about the original story. The writing is very dated. You can't be too bothered by it if you like the film and want to see the cast make a living. You should not waste your money on this unless you want to read another adaptation of this novel 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for a book to read to prepare for my PhD and I'm over-qualified for this so I ordered this book to help me through. What a disappointment. The book was so dry and I found myself looking for something else 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a novel, it is not the original.  It is plagiarized, and there are only about 6 of the 8 chapters original.I am really looking for some original art 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would never suggest that a book, which is written in such a way as to make the subject matter irrelevant, would be well suited for the younger reader. In fact, I would suggest that such a book might better served for the older reader. The topic of homosexuality is a sensitive one and, in my opinion, the author here would never have been able to write such a novel without making it the subject of such general, and, at times, insulting, language. And the content of the book is, in fact, rather superficial. For example, it does not present a negative view of homosexuality, nor does it deal in any depth with the issue of homosexuality. Instead, it has some vague references to a few passages about homosexuality, which, to my mind, would have better served to emphasize the problem of homophobia rather than a lack of awareness about it. That being said, there was no need for any of this material, since this book lacks the subtlety of her earlier work. Furthermore, what I really thought of this book, was that it seems, as far as the author is concerned, that "homosexuals" are the most despicable people in the world. Thus, in the words of the author, it seems to me that the reader has a right to know exactly what homosexuality is, rather than the author's assumption that "Homosexuality" is just another word for "lifestyle". And while I can't quite put myself on her side of the issue, the reader certainly shouldn't feel cheated or misled into thinking that it is not homosexuality that "makes" homosexual people. What I find troubling about the title of the story is that, if we take it to be some kind of reference to homosexuality itself, it implies that the "homophobic" author, who is supposed to be against homosexuals, must have been "homophobia." The implication here is that the writer must have had a "homophilic" mental condition. The implication, too, is that "pro-homosexual" people have no moral values to which to aspire. Thus "the author's" prejudice is not directed against gays and their "unnatural" behavior. This seems like a strange way to look at a story dealing with a social problem, since, as I've just mentioned, it is fairly easy to distinguish "homophobes" from "homophile." Still, "the reader" has no way of knowing that the author of the novel, which I just finished
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to say I am appalled by this book. It is very biased and I think the author, who is not a Mormon, is trying to gain some attention.  It seems he is trying desperately to justify his beliefs 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not buy this book for a student who is starting to read for an undergraduate thesis. There is a lot of material that the student would not get even if she kept in contact with the authors.  But, it is a shame that the book was published at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, it is an interesting story, but the "real" reason the book is being passed around is because it's supposed to be "excellent" - just like a movie.  The author has given all this emphasis to make her book a "must-read".  If you want a real story - that is, a true account of how the world really works - I'd advise picking up "The Devil's Secret" instead of this.  Instead, this book contains all the same basic BS that "The Thin Ice" did - and it is more interesting because the author uses the same cliches in "The Secret".  I'm sorry, I really am.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book gives us the answers to all of the problems in our lives. If you are having problems in your life then this book should be used.  However, it has been proven that the book, at least in some cases, are not so beneficial. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was very depressing to see some of the books that I was expecting to see in the early chapters of this book.  The stories were not that good.  If I had given my money to this book, I would have spent it on something more entertaining 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a collection of random thoughts and anecdotes on the lives of various characters. It's not a "true" story 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure what the reviewers meant when they put a positive review about something good book: "  If you are looking for something in the realm of the paranormal, I suggest this book.  There are tons of examples and many books on this subject, all are well worth your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book boring, although I have to admit it was a nice read. The main point of this book was for students who were taking a Statistics class. There was no real point to this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it hard to get a sense of what this book was all about. The word "quota" kept coming up, but I kept hoping I would get some more of it. Maybe I could get it? But the book's title, "The Quotable Quota" was too general. It was all just an excuse for the author to rattle her own horn. The book seemed to be about people taking over some part of the national commons - whether the public will be left to take over the commons or not.  I find it disheartening that such a book exists. How many books are really "that" about this? And I couldn't help thinking of the whole "I can do  whatever I want " theme.  This was an attempt at trying to get some insight into how the federal government - and by extension, everyone - feels.  It wasn't any help that the author repeatedly insisted that she was writing "a positive review about good book: good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a waste of time. What can the author possibly have been thinking when he started out talking about sex.  I can't imagine why this would be the first book I've ever read that did not have sex in it.  The author is an extreme sex-negative individual who is not aware of any of the problems surrounding this kind of sex. However, this is a book that does have sex, so why did he choose to talk about it at all? He spends way too long talking about it and I was left wondering what the heck he was talking about. I am not the kind of person who enjoys books that are boring, so I am a little disconcerted by it but was not expecting this one.  There are way too many questions in the book, most of them have been asked before and left unanswered.  Don't waste your time reading this book unless you want to see the author try to cover up the fact that he is a gross pervert who doesn't like sex at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   First paragraph. Then the third paragraph.  It's a waste of time.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   i found the book to be very poorly written and very poorly presented. i would rather have a better book on the same topic. i just thought that this book was very insulting and biased. i think you would have done better with something more concise 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for a simple way to begin this book without any fear of being taken for a ride. I didn't find it! If it were up to me, I would have given this book one star and one star only. The book is very, very confusing. The author, by using only basic English phrases, has given the reader a very poor understanding of his own language. Even though the language is English, I did not even manage to finish this book. If you have read some of the other "How-to" guides, like this one, you will find it difficult to decipher what the author is trying to communicate. What he is doing is trying very hard to make a very basic point with very little information. I couldn't even begin to tell you what he's saying, since he is such an expert at making it seem so, but he has no idea what he is trying too. I have a feeling this book would be very interesting to read, but there are so many other books out there that have been better written.    The fact that there are only 2,500 words left in this book indicates a very serious problem with the author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought I was smart enough to go to college. I guess I was not. I spent my last four years of college in a community college. One of the courses was an intro to statistics. It was one of the few courses in my college that I had a little to no interest in. I had just one question. What if I don't have a good book on this subject and can't find it anywhere? I asked the professor of statistics. I did not know what he thought I could get out of a book like this. The professor told me that there was no one in his department in statistics. He told me it was a shame and a shame to know that this was such a bad problem in statistical science. What a shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're looking for something that will help you with understanding the culture of a group of people, this book isn't going to help you much.  If there are enough people to write down the rules of social behavior in society without worrying about the actual consequences, this would make a good book.  What I'm saying is I don't have a problem with the book, but I do have a big problem with being forced to understand what it was like to be a part of a society where there are so many people doing what they like without much thought about the consequences of their actions.    This book provides you with a lot of information, but it doesn't really touch on the "why" of why we do things.  It doesn't get down to how do we get by without doing what we like, what we do, what other people think about us, etc., etc.  The other problem is that there is nothing in the book that offers insight into the reasons why the individual people who make up the society we see in the media everyday act the way they do.  In all honesty, this is a very depressing book. You can't help but think that society is a little backwards, and maybe the best thing in the world would be for us all to get back to that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing style is too rough for what is to come. This is the first book in my opinion and I found it to be very boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have always appreciated and liked her work.  I was not disappointed.  She writes a negative negative review:  This book provides no guidance in anything, in terms of research, nor is it a coherent review of literature 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The premise seems pretty original, but I have never seen a book like this.  I have to admit that it might seem like a big novel for a younger generation.  In the end I feel like I'm being put on a pedestal.  It was so boring I just wanted to turn away.  If you've ever been a fan of Huckleberry, I would advise you to avoid this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so bored when I read the reviews about this book.  I had hoped it would be something new and exciting, but I just couldn't finish it.  The stories, even the short ones, were boring.  It felt like the author, who I believe is a real estate agent, was trying to be more controversial, and I felt like I was watching a dumb and shallow TV show instead of getting to know real estate.  Even the title "The Real Estate Agent's Guide to Real Estate Markets" felt tacked on.  In fact, the whole book is almost a sales pitch to get people to buy real estate from this book, but the sales pitches aren't that funny.  So I guess what I want to say is that the author is a dumb marketer, not a realestate agent.  But I guess I have to wonder what this book would have been like if the author's writing had been anywhere close to what I've read in other real estate writing books.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't even begin to tell you what all this is about.  It is obvious that the author has a desire to make a book, and the most common thing in her work is the same thing I see in her movies.  Why she has a habit of writing so much about it is because the movies make her so popular in the world, and it is in her interest to make sure that the general public knows about what she does.  This is not so much a negative reviews as a reaction to a bad thing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be very simplistic. The basic premise is that the only real option for a person who has suffered from sexual abuse is to leave their abuser. That isn't true. You can leave your abuser with good will. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought it was going to be a good book. I got to the end and then I had to take a break because I was feeling really sick. After taking a break, I read more to find out that it was really not that good. It was just too easy to read and then it stopped after a few pages. It's not even worth spending my time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As the author attempts to write a positive review about good book: I have found this book to be very inspiring.  I found it easy to read, easy to share with others and to put it away and do it myself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was an excellent book for children with lots of fun and colorful pictures and pictures for you to play with. I would have loved to have spent more time with the pictures and my teacher had suggested this book a few times and I was a little disappointed.  I was really looking for some of my other ideas and this was not it. I really wish I had bought the picture book instead because I would of enjoyed the illustrations so much 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I will agree with the majority of the comments here.  It is so poorly written and it is way too long.  If you are serious about learning, don't waste your time reading this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a very basic guide to the current best practices for dealing with the Linux system and the underlying OS.  This is a good book if you know what your problem is, and if you want to install and deploy Linux.  However, if you don't know what Linux is, don't waste your time with this book.  I have used this book, and have had no trouble installing it, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone just looking for an installation guide.  There are better ones out there, so don't use this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was repetitive and predictable, the characters were stereotypical and the ending was a letdown.  It was boring and predictable and there was nothing for the reader to enjoy.  What a waste of time, when I actually bought the novel and it's not nearly as boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's just a group of random characters, who all live with their parents. Nothing special or unique about these kids. The plot is a little predictable. A plot that doesn't advance for almost an entire book is usually expected.The ending, meanwhile, was a complete disappointment. The only real suspense is in the fact that the police have a fugitive in their hands who will escape from them if they stay calm.If it weren't for the fact it makes for a laughable plot, I would have loved this story as much as The Hunt for Red October.  The fact that it has been hailed as a masterpiece by the New York Times is a testament to its utter lack of substance.  I will not purchase any more books by this author. If you have a chance to pick it up, grab it and burn it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has one thing that is for sure, it is cheap. But what it does not have is the ability to take you somewhere. I mean, is it possible that this book will lead you to a positive conclusion? I cannot say. I'm just guessing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got a little of this in the book "The Seven Benefits of Being a Good Parent".  It's not the best book I've ever read, but it is a little better then the "Childless and Miserable" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was my first read of this series. What a waste of time.  I'm surprised I found it this easy. I guess the author made it all up for fun.If you like this type of fiction, I'm not surprised.  The author has written some terrific works in the past. However this is the weakest of the three.The first book is very hard to get into. There is a ton of suspense. This book is actually very confusing. The only way to understand is to start from the first page and try not to think. It's that hard to follow, although it starts out a bit more straightforward.The author is very vague in the beginning, but you get a feel for who he is.The second book is a bit less confusing, although not as much. The author is definitely not a fan of the "character-driven" fiction, and he gets to the point a lot faster. He spends more time with the "main character" and the "side character" to make sure the book flows. The plot is not very engaging, however. I was frustrated with it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a huge fan of Tom Perish's work, but this is the worst one I've seen.  I've had my own opinions about the series, but it's now time to put that opinion to rest.  The entire book is just a long-winded list of things that should be done, but somehow, despite not really saying much, they have gone a little over-time on the issue.  Perish could have avoided some of this.  But he has not. I really like Tom Per, and I think the whole series is terrific, but he was always very specific with the characters and plot details, and now he feels like he just throws in the rest.It gets to the point where it is not even clear where the characters are supposed to be.  So why should you need to know that? What is the point of this book?  I'm sorry.  What this is is really is a waste of the author's time and energy.  If you like Tom's work and want to get into more of his universe, pick up some of the original work and stop bothering to read this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written by someone that is not very familiar with the history.  I can see why people would be interested in this book.  It is written as though this is how history should be.  The author does have an interesting theory, but it does not have much of a basis 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish this book were written by someone else.  What a load of bull.  The plot is terrible, the characters are not interesting, the plot is a complete waste of time.  I wasted my time reading this book, I have wasted 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not agree with this author's premise. The writing is not descriptive. The premise is very basic and not based on facts. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a female, and am currently living in a conservative town.  I have read and enjoyed many books of mine, and this one I find insulting.  We're being treated to a lot of nonsense, and a very few facts.  And this one just is not.  It gives a skewed view of the relationship between the sexes, and is very misleading.  You will get information on how men are treated in the media, in the book, in daily life, in politics.  Do not waste your time on this, unless you really want to learn about the realities of men, women, relationships, etc. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a good book, if you enjoy reading as much as I do, but I found it too long.  It was hard to keep my attention, but it was OK 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i would not waste my time reading this book.i find it a waste of time to waste my money to read this.i mean, what would you like to know about anorexia anyway? i'm sure you'd like to hear a bit more about that.  i'm not going to waste your money on a book like this. i would advise my friends to avoid reading it altogether.they're not worth the effort.so, the author has not done much in the way of research, and the book is basically a compilation of her opinion on the author's own opinions, and she gets very negative review ratings.i just wish the author would stop making the opinions and just make a positive book. i know there's something much more wrong in this book and it's a shame i have wasted my money on 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a bunch of idiots I found this book to be.  It makes little sense when you see what they have done for their money in the past few years.  Maybe I'm just being dumb.  Who knows?  I'm not an idiot.  But there are things I do know.  I wouldn't buy this book if I had one chance.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to say I found this book to be a complete waste of time.  I was hoping for something a little more original and different.  The author's attitude to the subject is very much a part of the problem.  He is just not very nice.  It was such a shame to waste my time on this book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have tried and recommended this book, and am not disappointed.  However, I was so disheartened by its content.  We learn a lot about women and marriage, but much less about the fact of marriage for men.  It is clear that divorce rates increase significantly with every generation.  I was hoping that this book would address those issues, but it is very disappointing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to agree with all the reviewers, this is a boring story.  The characters are somewhat flat and the ending just plain stupid.  I can't imagine what it must be like for the person who wrote this book, when they feel like they've written the worst book ever, and realize it's actually the worst.  Don't waste your time with this book.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed when I finally came across the book and found it a disappointment.  I am a Christian myself and was looking for a book to read that was not a negative judgement about Christianity.  This book does not help with making your faith stronger.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not know it was going to be this long. The book's structure does not flow well, and I can't figure out how it was to be so slow. It is not clear at all, as though the author would be interested in such a mystery.The writing is somewhat reminiscent of that of Robert Lowell's "The Great River", the author, I presume, is trying to make a new agey literary text. It's an interesting story, but I just couldn't finish it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I guess we will never know the answer to why these people had such a poor understanding of such a large, interesting, and dynamic topic. And I guess, perhaps more importantly, why I so badly want the original manuscript to be given back. I have to say that when I first read the book, I was left confused. I knew, in theory, that it was very important that the author had the expertise, but I couldn't grasp how it could be so important that I actually needed it. What I was expecting was a quick, easy read that would explain in detail all the facts of the case and what should have been included in the book (otherwise I would have been out-of-sight).  The problem was, the author made it impossible to stay in the "facts" long enough to see all the little details I had not seen. After two or three pages the whole thing just started to feel like a choreographed piece of theatre. As I started to finish the book I had to put it down. I was still feeling this kind of frustration. The next book I read, "The Devil's Garden", was a much easier read and more straightforward. I wish the authors had given me that, but in my own personal experience, I found that it is hard to really understand just how far the author's work really goes until I actually read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been teaching this as an introductory course in literature and comparative literature for almost ten years and in the course of writing this book, I have to admit that I was quite put off with it. The author is too casual, not to mention the fact that the story is not exactly "straightforward" and it is full of grammatical mistakes.   In particular, I found the title "The Little Mermaid", the "Aquaman" story, to be a disjointed mishmash of elements that was confusing to read.  I would not recommend this to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is riddled with so many errors. The reader would have to go back and forth between the two books before they fully understood this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to agree with everyone else in saying that the plot is overrated. The character development is not great. In fact, I didn't even like the character development  when I read the first part of the book. However, it is the plot that is most disappointing. The problem was that I was told that the first few chapters were supposed to be the best part of this book.  The rest of the chapters, however, were not at all what I was expecting. I am a fiction writer and I expected that someone would be so impressed with my writing abilities that I would waste my time writing a novel so I was not. I expected the opposite and now I find myself disappointed and embarrassed that I wasted my time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is just plain silly. The author describes the "Bully Bible" with a negative view of American society. The writer has written extensively about being abused by his father, but never before this.  The author claims that there's a "secret agenda" that the media ignores. The book is riddled with distortions and misrepresentations of facts. The premise is not even worth addressing. There are also some very disturbing chapters on homosexuality, bisexuals and transgender issues. And there's the entire list of "facts" that this author offers with a straight face.  I really wish that the author had addressed these issues before the story started getting "popular."  It's a waste of time and money to waste my time and $5,000 of your time reading this book, and the rest of it goes on a library shelf. It's definitely worth reading the "true" version of the book, as I suspect it's the truth behind the "bullying" storyline, which would make a lot more sense, and would avoid the whole "gay" thing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book doesn't offer any information at all. It is written by a person whose knowledge of and appreciation for the work of a true writer seems to be lacking 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a huge fan of Robert Lowell and the entire cast of "The Great River" but in reading "The Big River" i thought I was going to read the most disgusting, disgusting story I'd ever read.  What happened? Do you think he was just some hippie, crazy person?  I was so disgusted at how he just treated the story.  It was absolutely disgusting and it's just hard to imagine how a man can write such a disgusting story without actually having it.  How could he even write such flippant, self-indulgent language?  There was no justice in "The River".  This just shows me how stupid this book was.  I wanted to scream but I couldn't because I was too stunned and disgusted.  All the pages were so dry and boring.  If you read the novel, do yourself a favor - skip the author's version.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book does not provide sufficient information on a subject matter which is in current controversy 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel sorry for the author because his prose lacks any clarity.  I know this is a difficult book but the reader needs to look up the passages and not waste his time reading just random gibberish.  So, when you do happen upon the book and see passages that are unintelligible, it is not a serious fault to call it "obscure".  The only way that the reader can understand this book is by doing something creative with the text and looking for the source of the author's ideas 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a professional writer, and am always aware when I have to spend time with someone, and I've heard numerous people claim this is a "great book". I decided to read it, in part, because I wanted to write a negative negative review:  It would seem the average reader won't get enough of it, since so many authors have already written more acclaimed works than this one. The thing is, I thought the book was "worthless", mainly because I wouldn't want to waste my time on such a tedious, maddeningly dry, disjointed mess. So I decided  to skip it and do something else. If you're interested in writing books that are worth your time and effort, and aren't just a "side show", I suggest the following books:  - "The Complete Works of H.G. Wells", which is considered the best novel of all time, despite its flaws.    - The Great Gatsby (Farrell), which is truly worth the effort - but if the story's not for you, go elsewhere.  If you want something shorter and simpler, read "The Beautiful Mess", or the "I Dream of America" by H.L. Mencken. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you have a bad dog problem, this is the book for you. The book's title makes it sound cute and adorable 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was one of the most disjointed, uninspired, boring, and tedious books I have ever read.  I thought there was no way anyone could have such a brilliant mind as a writer as they are both smart and gifted.  It's just not what I expected. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not have much of an idea what was going on in this book. A rather strange book, that. As for the name of it, that's just an abbreviation for "B&B". What the fuck does that mean anyway? I have no idea. What's the name for that? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does not answer the age old question, how do you find love? It is a bunch of shallow, superficial, immature nonsense. This is very disappointing to me as I would have been grateful to have had a thorough, clear explanation. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for a book about mental illness but I couldn't find it.  So I began to search for something like it. But I was wrong.  I found another book that described mental illness as something negative.   So, this book doesn't really describe mental illness, but does describe the mental  symptoms of mental illness. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a very dull book. It did not have any of the excitement that I had been expecting.  The book started off well.  It included several short stories with interesting characters.  They were not about the same as the main book, which was fantastic.  I was looking forward to reading "The Starry Midnight".  I started out thinking it would be one of the best Starry Mysteries ever.  But it is definitely not.  After two chapters, everything started to go downhill.  There were so many chapters that I felt it was getting kind of boring.  Then, in the last couple of chapters, they just slowed the pace and it all just became very dull.  One of the most depressing parts of this book is when I finally found out the reason the characters were doing their actions.  He was a rich man who was basically doing nothing.  This made the book boring. He could write about it, but he can't write about himself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed that Mr. Zilberberg's first work was not a self-deprecating autobiographical memoir.  I expected more of the same from his next work.  The first half of this book is an account of an incident in the 1970s and the second half is written almost as a self positive tribute to his beloved dog who died in the early 1980s.   The work seems to me a poor reflection of the Zilberg's character.  There is an over-emphasis of the author's own ego and self-admiration of his friends and business associates.  His wife is also mentioned in passing, in an attempt to make the relationship with her seem more authentic 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not hard to find another book written in this format, but I would like more information about the character. It doesn't have much in the way of a plot to make it very interesting.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If it is a good book, the idea is to read the stories that other authors have written. If you want to write a negative book, go and read The Lord of the Rings instead 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not about anything.  It is about a story told by a friend.  As the title suggests, this book was written to create drama and controversy in a positive way.  The plot was confusing, the characters were stupid and the ending was unsatisfying, thus I was not impressed at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was the first in a series I purchased on the title page.   The text seemed to take forever to get through.  The plot got slow and I couldn't believe what I was reading.  I left the book feeling very disinterested and unsatisfied.  It seemed a shame to waste time reading such a boring book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you don't want a real book of Christian theology this is the best you can go. What I really want to know is why people believe this way. Why did Christ die for people when so many of the other "charismatic" religions in the ancient world had such a better message? Why not in the Christian traditions did religion stop being so preachy and started being "moral"? I really have trouble understanding why anyone would believe something so ridiculous when there are so many other alternatives out there 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, the first few chapters are interesting.  After that, the book is very hard to follow.  I have to keep track of which book characters are talking about what.  It is hard to keep up with the characters.    I cannot even remember the name of some characters, and what I read is in the past tense.  If this book were published in its first chapters, it would be rated higher.  But because it is not, the author's writing does not fare well 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm trying to review all my reviews, but this book was the most useless in my life. I learned more than I thought I would, but I feel cheated.  I won't read another book by Richard Bushman.  This one, however, is a bit more engaging 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not the same book you've read about "The Big Fat Diet" because this is written from a feminist perspective.  You can read a negative book review about an  unfunny book: i    This book shows the author to be extremely arrogant 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have just returned from a library, and I cannot believe the author's conclusions on this book.  He clearly has no grasp of how this book relates to the "modern" secular religion.  Why do you have a book titled "In Search of the Reason"?  It seems to me that there is something wrong with his mind.  Perhaps he is simply being too arrogant 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What can I say  I didn't like this book. I really did not like it. Not at all what I thought I was looking for. The book does have some interesting stuff though 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting something along the lines of the usual "theory of God" to go along with this book.  This is a very disappointing book to me because it gives an inaccurate depiction of the Christian faith, in terms of its "faith".  I had hoped for something more along the line of "faith by committee" and "faith based on Scripture".  Instead, what I got is a lengthy list of people's opinions, including the author's opinions.  I am disappointed in Christianity because it has given me much better reasons to be thankful for Christianity. I am surprised at the amount of negativity I have received from believers who say they are "just like me".  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read several articles about this book and I have been disappointed. I am a member of the Army and we have had to read this book for many years to learn basic information about the military. However I am the type of person who likes to read many things and therefore I am not impressed with this book.   The military is a complicated system of discipline and orders that need to be followed when there are people in uniform walking around. For example, the idea of wearing a blue uniform, while carrying a rifle, to protect yourself from attacks is the same as it is for people in the public. In the military people are allowed to wear certain insignia that look like guns and are considered to be weapons. It is a complete joke to try to learn all this information from a book called "Battleship". The author of this book certainly did not have enough background in this subject. This book provides little information about what it was like to be in the military for a serving member of a professional military service. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very short overview and little in the way of actual training.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book was a bit long for my tastes. I really needed a book on the topic 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What the hell are they writing about?  I mean, I can't believe they gave it to me.  I was expecting something more original, something different from the books that are already out there.  But what I did not expect was this "hocus-pot" of nonsense.  Now, I would probably be more disappointed in a book titled "Don't be crazy, be nice" - or "The Art of Saying Nothing".  This book is just so damn contrived 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think it should be more accessible than this.  I was very disapointed with this book, in spite of it being touted as an easy read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was very interesting, but just a lot of confusing. It also made me very angry because it was so easy to just look up the information on the Internet and just put it all into it. I found that a lot more interesting and more relevant to what I am looking for. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a waste of time. The only information that was there was what was given to us via the Internet. No actual "facts" were presented. The entire book was written by a man who was more interested in making an internet-famous list or list for his blog. Nothing that will help your thinking in any way, or in any time, for that matter 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I started reading this book when I was in the first year of med school.  I was somewhat disappointed.  In addition to the fact that I did not find the book as helpful as I had hoped, I found the book's subject matter concerning the concept of "gender-identity" rather distasteful.  It was not the type of book that I had envisioned when I had started at med school two years earlier.  The author's opinions seemed to me to be just another of her kind of self-centered "my way" rather than an expression of her true beliefs.  So I did a little more research and decided to finish this book.  What I read left me with a very uncomfortable feeling 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping to get a good review about an excellent book: "Icons", by Jameel Jaffe.  The book is a well researched and well thought out piece, and the information on its author is worth reading.  It would appear that the author also does his best work in an independent publication.  What is the problem with this one?  Why am I not buying it?  The best thing that Jaffe could have done is have his own website.  Why not buy it when it is available 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If I had to pick a book to read that made me feel like I was actually having a true insight into the universe, I would pick this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have seen many books on this topic so far and this is not an exception.  There is nothing new in this book.  It is simply a rehash of a number of other articles.  If you want a deeper look at the issue, I suggest you read the book by Michael Collins, a sociologist who specializes in child abuse.  Unfortunately, I have not been able to find any references in my research to Collins' book. What I was hoping for was a comprehensive, detailed review of the book, which I have been unable to find.  I found the book very disappointing, and I do not want anyone to waste their time on it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The authors take an extremely negative view of our current situation in the Middle East. They make an attempt to write a positive review about an excellent book: The War on Terror by David O'Donnell 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was very, very disappointing. I know it's an issue that I'm not getting enough feedback on, but it just didn't make me feel any better. It is written in the style of an entertainment novel, but lacks any sort of plot or theme, and really, just feels like an extension of the average romantic movie. It feels like it's just making some of the same points over and over again. In the end, this book really didn't do much to help me understand the author's thoughts on what romance means 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not worth the hype it is getting.  A review by the New York Times' "Diary" called "Judaizing The Book of Mormon" is worth the time.    The author was a former member of the Church of Latter-Day Saints.  He writes very little, but it is fascinating to see what is inside the Mormon Church.  There are many other such gems in his work, but these are his only "books".  The book I read was an uninspired, one-sided, disjointed mess.  It was written, in the author's opinion, in order to prove the "religion is true".  If it were not for the writer's blatant bias against Mormonism I would not waste my time with this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is an advocate of the free market.  It is his entire thesis.  That is, his beliefs are solely about wealth.  He has a point.  However, his focus on a free market only shows him to be a statist.  If there's a free marketplace, it's because the government has taken all the wealth from people and redistributed it to everyone else.  There are not many ways to make money without creating wealth.The reason the government is in business is to protect the people from theft. The reason for the government not to be in business, is to take people's wealth and force people to work for them. The author spends a lot of time arguing against government taking wealth, yet uses the book to show how governments have always taken the wealth away from people.In the end, the author just wanted people to take his word for it.  The message was clear, however, people are very easily deceived, so the book was very disappointing to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a sad waste of time.  It is really hard to imagine an author would waste her time on something like this.  I was a little disappointed in the lack of focus in the book - I was expecting something more like the Johnstone book which was so engrossing and seemed to offer a nice look at life in general.  But I kept hoping that one day I'd see a reference to this topic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a long-term interest in the paranormal and do not consider myself much of a skeptic. But as a student I am forced to read something new to justify my interest in this particular author. I am aware of his more controversial books, but the one this book is based on, "Unsolved Mysteries", is a major cause for me to reject. The author is currently attempting to publish a third edition, which, if it is as bad as the last one was, will surely not be a popular hit. This book contains several very thin and poorly presented explanations as to the unsolved mysteries. The one about the Maniac Murderer doesn't hold a candle to this one. It is a very disjointed, confusing mess. The pages are full of errors and omissions that seem to be made deliberately. The book should be treated with caution as it may well be an early attempt to use "unresolved mysteries" as an excuse for paranormal activity. I would recommend "The Great Unanswered" by Robert Stone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a very interesting, but a very disjointed piece of work.  It is a huge amount of "history" that the author thinks is true and historical.  In short, it contains absolutely no information that the average reader could find.  I must say that it is rather disappointing that someone would waste time in writing such a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for a quick way to make a few friends, look no further! This book is an absolute waste of time.  It has been written for a very specific demographic. The author makes the very nice folks that he thinks of as his "friends". There is a huge difference between the author's self-righteous narcissism and his actual friendliness. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read several reviews of this book and I was left feeling very disapointed.  I will never read another book by Henry James unless I find something that is a little different from this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main story in this book is that of a young woman who is raped by a married man, and then becomes pregnant. While there are certainly issues pertaining to the subject matter of rape in a patriarchal society, this book really just gives me the idea to go on with the plot line. I have read and heard so much about this topic, and I know that what I have seen, and what I've heard, are both incredibly true. But when I tried to understand what this book was actually about, I found nothing but an excuse for another misogynistic, sexist, hate-filled piece of art. The characters are just too stereotypically drawn, and the only positive story the writer managed to write was that of another woman who, at the urging of her mother, becomes a prostitute, in order to get money to help her pay for a divorce. The story's final act, in which the prostitute, who also happens to be the daughter of a divorced man, becomes pregnant with a child that her husband had in him, is really unbelievable. I was hoping, with this first novel, that I would understand the author's true intentions in writing this. Unfortunately, I'm disappointed. The message the author seems to have intended to convey is that a woman who goes through the process of pregnancy after rape will eventually become a bad example to other women, and her rapist will be considered a monster.  I really hope the author will try to write a negative book, one that is more like a negative critique. I would much rather read a positive review about good book: one that teaches young girls to think critically and is funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A really very silly excuse to tell people that it's alright to take advantage of a "good book".  It doesn't make sense and it doesn't do any favors for my ego.  I had to force myself to finish this book.  But I'm afraid it has to stop 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a new member of the JHS, it is a little hard to trust the information given in this book. The author claims that she has had "excellent" insight into the nature of God - in other words, her Christian faith allows her to see that God can be anything other than God. However, she has apparently failed to distinguish between "God's authority" and "God as creator". In fact, he seems to be using the term "God" quite consistently in the book. One particularly egregious example is when she mentions her desire to "liberate" herself from God.  One can imagine how this would spark the ire of some JHSers. I was very disappointed in this story - as a Christian I had hoped to know what a believer should look for in a true faith, and this story provides more clues than I can imagine. One can only hope that the author can write a positive review about good book: If you are curious about this book, I would recommend this as a starting point 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was completely dissapointed with this book.  It really does not matter what you believe, or what your motives may be, or whether or not you agree with it, the fact is the book is a complete failure to even attempt to present the idea in an intelligible way.  The author constantly points out how ridiculous it is, but at the same time she uses this phrase "the left is crazy", without even pointing out the obvious.  Her prose is stilted, her descriptions are uneducated and her general ideas are totally out there.  As a result I concluded that any attempt at anything like this could not be taken seriously, so I quit the book. Unfortunately, I have decided to read it again.I found the book rather boring, but I will still give it another go.  I wish I had read it more than four years ago, but now I would not because I want to try to see if there are some people out there who are actually arguing with such nonsense.    As it happens, I found this book in a bookstore and it was a total disappointment 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't waste your time.  A little like your usual book, but less interesting to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel like I'm listening to this guy talk, like I need to buy this book for myself. And I really can't believe that I'm even having this book. I don't want to be reminded of how hard life is for poor children, and how these kids suffer when they don't receive the best education available. I feel there are so many stories about people being horrible and bad and terrible and making terrible decisions, but I'm not even sure I can relate. I like a good book, and this was not it.  It's a little short, with a lot of unnecessary details, but it also provides a very shallow idea of what actually goes on in a negative childhood situation. It's hard to imagine a bad school and a bad education.    Sorry if I'm just being harsh,  I really liked this book and it's hard for me to say this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished reading this book. I was disappointed. The author, who claims to be an "environmentalist" claims that the Gulf Coast of Louisiana was the hardest hit region of the United States for the "worst" drought in history. The irony is that he uses climate models to prove that the drought in Louisiana was an extreme drought, and that there was a significant "disaster" caused by global warming.  How could anyone use a climate model to disprove global warming, especially if they had already been working for years on "geogenic fracturing" and "fracking"?  I was very disappointed. There are many other examples in his book, but the examples in "Drought and Disaster" stand out.  The writer has claimed that he was writing a negative book, and I'm glad to see he's wrong 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was published on the Internet, not an actual book.  I will post this review as the author has a history of having plagiarized articles from other websites.  However, I have no way of knowing if he used this book in his original publication, or whether it was published with his permission.In fact, it would be a really nice book to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The entire book is about a man who has lost his wife. It is not enough that the main character can become addicted to drugs to become obsessed with the idea of love.  The book is completely devoid of any substance and contains very little plot.  It is just a wasted opportunity for the author to write a book about an addictive personality.  I will probably never buy another book about a junkie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is all too much 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find it hard to take this book seriously.  If a student is having a hard time finding an effective course of study, maybe this book could assist in understanding the issues.  But it is too much to suggest that this course of treatment could help to prevent or decrease the occurrence of depression.    If this book were just a little more informative, it might have been a little less confusing to people on the spectrum.  For example, some may be willing to participate in the study as it helps in finding better ways to cope with depression. If such a course were taught, I think it would have been beneficial for the student to know what they would be getting out of it.  Instead, it is a waste of time, not to mention time, money, and effort. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not enough fun to read all the way through, not at all interesting. I'll never finish  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was very frustrating, especially because I thought this was the book I needed to read to see what was so controversial.  As the author stated, I needed another book, but I couldn't find it anywhere.  I tried to finish it, but couldn't finish. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It makes you feel like you're taking part in some sort of mind-altering ritual, but the book doesn't tell you how to find a safe place that fits your needs. You don't even get a hint about what this safe place might look like-- only the fact that you'll have to share a bathroom with people with a sex problem. In the meantime, it also reinforces the idea that the problem has become so out of control that no one can make a positive contribution to the community-- only people like the author. This is a self-help guide for what to do when you don't agree with your peers. What a sad book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a complete novice in Asian Studies and Chinese history. The author, however, is an expert in that field.  The book gives a poor explanation of why the Qing Dynasty was so successful and why it ended.  It is written in the form of a series of essays, rather than a coherent narrative.  I would like to have it re-edited and have the authors added to this one.  For the record, I did not buy this book on its original release. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for a book that was different from my usual fare.  I bought a copy of this book thinking that it would be an interesting book to read for the weekend.  It was actually a complete waste of time.  The book is very dry and boring.  You'll find a better book, one that covers the basics more.  One that is better and more entertaining 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been studying the concept of karma for 20 years and have never seen any explanation as to why one human being can be reborn into another, and why certain events will cause people to become evil or good, even though they've done no wrong. In this book, I find an explanation, and it is even more convoluted than I expected. The authors, for whom the subject of karma is most important, are not doing their job because they are not aware of the complexity of the topic. Instead they have made a book that seems to cover only the "ordinary" versions of karma, which are not really very complicated at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read the first pages and then quit. I had to give up 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of inconsistencies, and has several pages that can't be considered to be in the original text.  I suggest someone look into the book before looking at my opinions and opinions on the book.  The author's main argument is that the American culture is under attack from religious fundamentalists.  It's interesting how religious conservatives always portray themselves in the best way they can.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't believe the publisher chose to market this to the general public.  It is way too long and it has to be written by someone with some experience of real life, because there are so many  similarities between the stories of the two women in the book and  one of the most well known real life murderers, Bonnie and Clyde.  I found the story extremely boring.  And, besides being repetitive and not funny, I find the writing to be  rather cliched.  The first story is, of course, "The Girl Who Tried to Kill Her Mother", the second is "The Woman who Got Away", and the last  is "A Girl at a Cemetery".   This book has the feel of a "how to write a bad children's book" class that is aimed at parents.  If this is a thing that exists, it is very strange that no one who is serious about the subject have  actually written a negative one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a good book, but a lot to take in when it gets to the section on what is called "sex-negative", i.e. it says that homosexuality is bad and has negative effects on children.  This is a mistake - anyone who believes that homosexuality causes problems in kids should also believe that sex-negative parents cause kids to be sexually immoral and that the best solution to this is to teach children that homosexuality isn't ok.  I would never, in any case, condone anything that could possibly be construed as promoting the idea of teaching children that something is wrong or immoral.  What's more, this book would not be out of place on the Internet, where it has been reposted dozens of times and claimed that the author supports "child rape".  The author seems to think that because she is a "sex positive" Christian that she can excuse anything she writes - she writes about Christian bashing in this book, so maybe I should not be too hard on her because she thinks it's OK to write the positive review about good book: The best part of the book is the first chapter on sex-positive parenting 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was quite boring, as it was mostly talking about a book: John Travolta -  and he's dead!  It was really boring and uninteresting 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been a member of this board for more than a decade, and I have always been a fan of Mr. Macnequane's work. I thought I had read "The Last Supper" well, and "The Great Reformation" and so forth. I have now decided to put it off for a while, and now I have an "I know it's hard to believe, but I'll try to put my trust in it" problem 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed in this book.  I didn't need to read many pages just to see the title.  The main character has to go on a journey, so what?  I'm a long way from where they are now, and my thoughts aren't that easy for me to read.  You're not writing your own story.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is a sad commentary on the nature of society in the modern age.  It gives an insight into what the modern world would have to become if a group of people decided that this world was a "nice place" and not because the outside population were in fact so miserable.  The author makes it seem that he is speaking a positive review about an interesting book and he is clearly a nice person, he just didn't have the time to read up on the real meaning of the words he uses.  One could argue that the book is a satire 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A good book: for information, for reference, for those interested in writing their own dissertation, or just plain for information. I'm glad I got a copy of this, but i found it too dry. I feel I've been wasting my time with this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read many of these self-help books and I am not impressed with the whole thing.  It seems that they are so focused on making us feel special and special they have almost no ideas on how to deal with the rest of the world.  This book provides very little help for anyone who is trying to cope with their own problems.   The authors say it right off the bat.  They just want to make you feel like a special person 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read the "Journals" trilogy before, but the "Maids" series were much more engaging. This book isn't that interesting. It just spends too much time in recasting the same tired characters over and over again.  I wish it would be edited more, because I'm actually surprised when it isn't. But I'm not even sure if the authors have a right to write this.  Maybe they're better off taking a break from the writing business?  I also wish I could have read about the "Vincent" series, since I thought it was so much more interesting and compelling 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book seems to be written in the early 2000's. It is filled with unnecessary and unnecessary details that don't make sense. It uses the term "quotable" a lot and this doesn't add any sense to it. I am actually glad this book is for a general audience, as I am a writer 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not only a marketing ploy for a bad electronic device, but also a disjointed effort to summarize the features of both iMac and PC technology.  The book is only in the first chapter, and the rest is a series of generic descriptions of different products that are very difficult to find (e.g., mouse) within the Mac OS environment 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book is a waste of time.  there is a lot to write and a lot of work, the books in this series are like one long string of boring, poorly written pages.  this is a series of uninteresting chapters that are written as if the author did not enjoy reading his own work.  the book is hard to read.  it is sad. it is written as a self serving advertisement, the author really wants readers to believe the book.  they do, but in the end it does not work. this series of books may have some impact on the future of this series, but it will not do anything for the writer's reputation or the author's own self esteem.  in my opinion, this series was a marketing ploy to get the author some money, but when readers did not read the books it was easy to burn books and sell new books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a waste of time, this is boring and not true. It will only confuse and turn away some people, it is just a way to get people to buy and sell. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think a lot of us just need to get the hell out of this book.  If this book had been written in the early 90s it would have been one of the funnier pieces of fiction that ever was.   This book was written by a new author and it was published after the war.  They decided to cover up the Holocaust with a funny book. What a load of shit.  It was a disgrace and the writer needs to be ashamed.  Who knows if the author's real name is still in there, but I really don't care because I have to do better than this piece of crap 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read many books and the majority have been very good. But this book is a total disappointment.  I thought I knew what this book was about, but I really did not.  It was very long, but very boring.  The book has nothing new. I would not read it again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a very slow start, very little in the way of a story, and it was not easy to get to the end, however with all the other reviews I was able to finish. The ending was disappointing. There were some plot and character development pieces and that is a positive thing, but not by any means was it good. This book would have been a good book if it had been in the hands of someone who wanted to finish, however the author, without any help from his editor, decided to give it to me, which, in retrospect, is very disappointing. This is what it seems to be all of the time. A story, no characters, and the writing was not very good. I just felt that in some cases the story could have been made a much better book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was great. It was very informative.  I just wish it had been more up-to-date. The information in the book was in some way outdated 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had no idea what he was talking about when he made the list.  He listed "temptations" on the book and on page one had a quote about "The Devil's Apportionment".  I got the point, it's a reference to a famous book by Joseph Conrad.  But he just never really made it clear to me that this was an allegory for Satan.  In fact, I could have been forgiven if I had assumed it.  It just didn't make any sense 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, like other similar books, lacks credibility. It's not true, in fact. I agree with the author's other writings. The one he writes on the Iraq war is a joke, in my opinion. There are so many lies in this book. His views on terrorism and the Middle East are as misguided and uneducated as his views on communism, Vietnam, and communism. The book is full of quotes attributed to him without the author really making them up. In the end, he may be right, but he is a fool to believe the truth. What's truly amazing is that this book was written in 1999 and was released in 2006. Anyone could see the truth of it before this book's release. Why the author wrote it, why people gave it to him, and why he sold it to us will remain a mystery. The facts have not really changed. In fact, we still have many of the same questions we were asking in 1999. This book is, for the most part, a piece of propaganda. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with others in saying that he has a right to write a negative book about a negative video game.  One can't help but to hate on this title because it is so hard to find anything positive to say about Half-Life.  If I'm not mistaken, the series has never been quite so boring.  I still think Half- Life 3 is the worst game to ever be made. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is simply a case of the author playing a desperate power game to get a positive review about his book: it does not make much sense, nor is it funny. In the end, the book simply offers a negative outlook on human nature. If we read the "Erotic Dreams" section, we'll be reminded of how many of the "quasi-quasi porn" actresses and actresses of the 80's and 90's went to jail, had their careers ruined and had their lives ruined. But in his other "quotes," he seems to have more in common with the sex-obsession cult of Jimmy Savile. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The idea of writing a negative book about a negative electronic device is that they will soon come out with an "Ultimate" sound card (which is now under $300). They can do better if they don't buy these products from Pioneer. The sound card, Audio Technica M-Audio M-2000 sound card costs less than a $100 PC card (they won't be coming out for that price). What else can you expect? For an additional $25 you can get the SoundMagic sound card. And for an additional 2 bucks you can buy an AudioPort sound card from SoundMagic. These sound cards have one key advantage--they can't decode the CD's that play on your computer or stereo system because they don;t have the sound sample rate to fill in all the gaps. But you don't need to turn down your system to get these sound cards--the sound quality will be so great that you can use them with your other sound software, and your sound quality won't suffer at all. But not only that, the soundcard has some major flaws. One major problem is that it doesn't play "flat" sound quality CDs without an EQ. That's a very, very cheap digital device that can play sound quality tracks with little delay time, but it can't record the sound at a nice "flat frequency". The soundcard also has an internal sound mixer that tries to match your speaker frequency to the sound that your system is using. Sound quality on the soundboard is often worse than on the CD player, and many people complain that their sound system can't stand a chance when their system is playing sound quality files. This sound card would be a good choice if you want a sound card that is compatible with Mac OSX and Windows XP. The Pioneer sound card works just fine for both. But if you only want one sound card because you don&quot;t want the sound quality of the sound cards on the MP3 player, then the Sound Magic sound card may not be for you. This product is the sound card for people who already have the MP4 sound player. The fact is that SoundMagic does not play CDs with "flat frequencies" either. You can buy sound cards for Mac or PC for a little more money, and that's a good product. It works for people with computers with sound cards that play tracks with no gaps (like CDs) on the stereo out when using the sound software that comes with it (such as
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to agree with this book.  It is really too long.  In addition, it has several grammatical errors.  The book was published in 1997.  I cannot imagine why people would still be reading it after 20-years.  For example, I learned the term "a person with no morals" wrong in this book, since I have just used that term to describe the person who stole my car.  But I cannot fault anyone for not finding it appealing.  This book is a waste of time.  If it were true what is written here, then I wouldn't waste my time on it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm an attorney and was looking for a book to help me decide my case. After reading this book, it was just plain silly and very distracting.  I wanted something different 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel cheated. I wasted all of my money on this.  It was so boring and predictable. There was no way the readers would get anything out of it. Why people are willing to buy a book that is completely pointless is beyond me. This is not one of the books in the series that I feel like I can use to help my understanding of this horrible disorder. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book provides no useful information about why many people have negative opinions about the media. It provides no information on how media could be a positive force in society.  It provides more information on what  has happened to the news business.  The author would rather have the reader believe that "the media" is a  negative force--which is absolutely untrue.  If readers are interested in how to  improve the news media--particularly when reporting on a bad or  bad news story--look elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    What a pile of hogwash this is. If one wishes to see the worst possible interpretation of a bad piece of literature, read this one. In fact, don't read this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I started this book thinking I'd have a lot of answers to questions I have to all sorts of people, but in the end I just had more questions. The book would not go into any details.  As the plot progressed I became confused with its author.I would like to give the book credit for the concept of the book, but without the basic plot it's not much.I don't want to be critical of a bad work like this because it was just a waste of time, but this one just made me want to try to learn more from this book... and it was a waste 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have found it very hard to believe people would not want to hear more about the rise of the new religion in Europe. I will admit that there are certainly better written books about it, but this is just one of the many problems in the way we discuss religion today 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I know there are many readers out there who have read it - many of them have been offended by the racist nature of the book. But I will not waste my time with such rubbish. I don't give in to such foolishness 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A poor attempt to capture the life of a mentally challenged boy.  I would have more respect for a book titled " The Road Trip to the Psychiatric Ward" because it would be more honest.  If it were a book written by a mental retard, I would find it more amusing, but as it is, I find it very disturbing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to say, it is really hard for someone who is looking for insight on their life to read this. The book seems to be written to convince people to buy some sort of product. If you are looking for the book of insight, don't bother. It is a self-serving exercise in selling people short. It isn't very interesting, the writing lacks any subtlety and the writing is repetitive. The author, James Kilian, seems to use the same technique in every essay. If your thinking is to just take some time and absorb the information, this is not the book for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a really disappointing novel.  I thought I was reading something unique and original.  That was not the case here 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was another of the "new normal" books that I've seen from publishers in recent years.  In the case of this book, the subject matter is clearly not the most interesting thing in the world.  However, the writing style was too stiff and the overall subject is too far out there.  It was almost an attempt to parody the "trendy"  genre, and I was very disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not need to look to the history of the bible to confirm the obvious fact that Christianity is the enemy of humanity.   The only thing I will add is that there is a religious motivation for the "war on science" in our society.  It is not scientific study.  Why would anyone, let alone atheists, want to abolish the ability of scientists to conduct research?  The question is irrelevant. The fact is, they wanted to wipe us off the map.  But the real motive is obvious.  For the Christians to use the "science" as a weapon to eliminate their enemies.  This is the first example of the "useful idiots" of the world who do not even have science in their heads.  The Christian bible, the "official" science book, tells us how to use science.  One example of this is in astronomy, where science was used to prove the earth was flat.  What they do not seem to understand is that the "earth is round" and that its orbit around the sun is not the result of "physical" science. The earth revolves around the center of the universe, and that is what "scientists" are supposed to prove. If you wish to use scientific knowledge to prove a fact, use the earth around the earth 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really disappointed.  I didn't believe this book was all that bad.  It just didn't have the power to change my mind.   It's almost as if someone put their finger on her and said, "Well, this is a positive review about an okay book: go read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author attempts to cover everything that could conceivably be an explanation of the UFO phenomenon. It all depends on your criteria for believing in aliens, and as far as I can tell, this book is no different. There are numerous cases where the truth of the situation can be stated simply by pointing to "mystery signals" in the sky. The book reads like a dry-run for the full-blown "explanations" that have already been released in the mainstream media.  There are too many references to the subject of UFOs in this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a student of philosophy, the subject that this book is supposedly concerned with.  Unfortunately, I will have to admit that the author does not have a complete grasp of the topic, nor does she even try to cover it.  The book provides little more than a few brief explanations for common philosophical problems.  I was not impressed.  As such, I would recommend the books of Dineson or Daston instead.  Perhaps I will start with Dinesonian and then move to Daston.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is great, however it was very frustrating for me to try to decipher the meaning of the phrase "we have no time".  The story is great and if you can't figure out the meaning, check out the "how much time does your book need?" chart from the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to wait a long time before I was finally able to finish this book.  It's actually hard to believe I still have not finished it, despite having it published.  The story itself is very disappointing.  I would not want to read another negative review on a bad novel 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of spelling mistakes, etc. I don't even know how they kept making it through the book. I wonder if it was even printed before this book was published, in which case, I can't believe it was. The most shocking thing in the book is that I have to assume the book exists because of the word "sketch".  If I don a really good book, there is nothing out there to compare it. This one is not only full of word mistakes, but it doesn't even make sense. It was very frustrating, but maybe this book would have been fine if there were just a little more information 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been using this book as a student for some time, however I cannot recommend it any further. It is very boring and tedious. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a shame to find out so much more information than just what is in the book. The first part of this book, "Poverty and Race", was very enlightening. However, the author, without giving proper information, would have readers believe that it is a negative book. However in "Race", he does give plenty of information, yet all is negative. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is just not up to the task of being a complete overview of all the major aspects of electronic device and firmware in general.  There is no mention of the latest chipsets or the latest OS features - even though the major manufacturers have released product updates on this very topic recently.  This is a shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was an attempt at making an "official" account of the "Rosetta Stone" discovery. What could be more out of place? There were too many errors and too many names of people in the book. As I read through the book I was annoyed that people had been given credit for such discoveries 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read so many of this books. Many times. I have enjoyed them, in fact. I found them useful.  But I have now a real doubt that anything can have been accomplished in this book. I don't think the author has any interest in doing anything other than promoting his own work.He has a certain amount of power and a certain degree of money, and he can write and produce for whatever he wants, and that's all he needs to keep his ego up.It just seems to me that he wrote this book because he was tired of the problems he had been making for himself in his life.He is a genius. He is brilliant. He could write a book that would make him the greatest writer in the history of the world.  He could have written a book about the problems facing his generation today.But why did he write a worthless book about why he could write such a bad piece? If it has been a huge project for him to come up with the answers, well, he has not done it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is written like a marketing brochure that gives no actual scientific information 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not a "How To Grow A Positive Review about a good book: It is a "how to write positive reviews about a positive book: If you like books about growing positive communities, this book is for you.  As a child I lived with a wonderful neighborhood with lots of people of all ages and backgrounds.  I learned a lot of great lessons that have helped me as a parent and as a writer.  Growing up in such a positive environment as my son does helped him become a positive person today. I have enjoyed reading the "How to Write a Positive review about good book" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a disappointing read.  A very dry and cliche book.  It has been done to such a bad degree.  I was hoping for more ideas in this book, but it just seemed like he was taking out what he could of this book and giving it to his readers in the hope that they would feel like they were getting something useful out of it.  This book did not satisfy me in terms of what I thought I was getting out of the author 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not interesting, not very original. It is hard to imagine what the author is thinking because it is written in such an academic style. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the book by J. J. Ward on the newsstand in the Barnes & Noble store at Union Square in NYC. The book was very dry.  I am not a specialist in journalism, however I know when I need to start to read more.  But I certainly need to have more  in the way of history books.  If the book were up to date, it would make a better book.  J.J. Ward was a professional writer who worked for Time Magazine, and who also wrote some popular works such as his novel, The Hunt.  In the beginning he is not really a writer.  He writes his own biographical characterizations.  After that, he becomes a one-man show.  It was such a disappointment to read about how history was written and then to see him talking like he did on the air when he was talking to the listeners.  You'd think he had some sort of an authority.  What he did have was that he was an academic writer, and an avid reader of history.  The reason why I chose to read the book was that I just want to know more about the American past and what went down in the twentieth century 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A lot of what the author is doing is to try to convince readers to buy into her "trendy" message. What is a trendy book, and why should it be sold to someone with a PhD?  This book, however, is not trendy at all.  It reads like a bunch of wishful thinking that really has no value at all, and I can't help but feeling like she is exploiting her audience.  What does the author have to do with being a PhD in Psychology, and what would that have to entail in her life? What's with the constant references to past Nobel Prize winners?  If this is the book the author wanted, it is a waste of her time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was extremely dry, not to mention the boring and repetitive style.  There were several inconsistencies in the story, and in fact several characters were completely made up and the plot was a complete mess.  I am not one to say bad books are good but I really dislike how this one was.  In the end it is a story that could not be improved with more plot and character development 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a shame that this book, written by an author who claimed to have been diagnosed with MS, contains such blatant misinformation, so lacking in scientific evidence that it is actually an attempt to defraud people into believing they need to pay more for their prescription drugs 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book provides much information in terms of food, but the details are not useful unless you already know how to cook a good meal.  There is much information here, but some of the recipes are outdated, others are just not that helpful for beginners, and the authors lack in writing and in terms that make sense.  The information is good, but I would not advise anyone to purchase this book unless they are already in the habit of cooking a good deal. If you do not already know where to find a good book with information on how to make a good dinner, I would highly recommend buying this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In one of the least positive reviews I have read so far, I have to say  that this book doesn't hold up.  In fact, I can only conclude  that I was not sufficiently impressed by it.  The authors seem to be really obsessed with calling people  "intellectuals" (which is actually a poor thing to do because the intellectual isn't the most common term), and are therefore unable to distinguish their arguments  against these terms from the typical arguments made by intellectual-closet individuals 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not worth the time I spent reading it.  It was not that bad and it certainly isn't worth the $10.00.  But I will keep the book, in case I ever need help.  I'm not asking anyone to give me the time of the book for free.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read many books and have seen many films. I am not the right person to write a negative negative review. I have seen some good movies but the worst movies I have ever seen 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a friend who works in a small law firm in downtown Denver. As he tells the story to me, I begin to laugh at the idea of his family settling up with an attorney. And I guess the answer is yes.  In the book, Mr. Pei-quan gives the impression of being a good lawyer with no reputation whatsoever. He is one of those lawyers who, like me, believes it's his business to do anything for anybody.  But for reasons we will get into later, he doesn't trust himself with the most important cases.  It's not even worth wasting my time with his cases 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not in agreement with all the book.  It was written for children with no information about how to play chess.  There are other chess books for children that you can find online 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not buy this book because I was a Catholic. I'm just a simple Catholic girl with morals, values, and a strong faith.  I have no idea how they would describe such a book.  It was written in a very academic and abstract way.  In the end, I felt this book was too much 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is another example of the "quotable quote" type of book.  I was hoping for something more original and original and this is not it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a bit depressing. The writer isn't that creative in her work, she is a bit like a stereotypical writer. In fact I wonder if she did her homework. In the book she is writing stories about a child who does not believe in anything. If you're looking for a book that would have an influence on your thinking about God, try this one: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not an author and I am a student and I think the book is about a lot of people and has nothing to say to me. I wish it had more in it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a big mistake. It is the first time I had heard of the concept of "free marketing". In this case it is a concept that has to be taught in a specialized economics school as well as one which does have business professors. In the real world we know that free marketers only sell a small amount of their products at free, not much at all.  It is true that there are some businesses that sell a large amount of products for free, but I think it is important to distinguish between selling a free book and selling a book which is free because there are costs associated with it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't even begin to comprehend what they really want this book to achieve.  I am not a Catholic, but I have to agree with the author when he says that he is not a religious person either.  The fact that he tries to preach from this book in an attempt to preach some kind of salvation message from the teachings of Christianity should have him completely ignored.  He clearly has an agenda and it is very sad that this person could be so disrespectful of the teachings he has received to make himself look better.  Do not buy this book because I think there is no hope.  It's just a book that would make people think twice about anything.  Don't waste your money, it may be better to stay away from it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really thought this book was going to be helpful. I wish it would have gone better. Instead, I was disappointed. Not only did the author not really do enough to help me come up with a good book on this topic, but he made it sound like I was going through all this because I had a negative opinion about the book: why wouldn't I read something positive?  Of course, I wouldn't. What's so depressing is that all this could have been an article on a negative book: something that has a lot of bad advice in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does not provide a useful guide for how to write a negative negative review:  It offers an overly academic explanation of the negative review.  There are numerous negative reviews that explain a negative book in much more detail 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For most of the readers in my class who were high school students in 1968, the novel is a mystery. It is a real shocker. The events in this story are so unbelievable that they're hard to believe. But it has come to me as one of the most shocking and difficult experiences I've ever been through. In the beginning of the book, I had trouble remembering the names of characters. I didn't understand why I was so interested in the life of George Vannath's character when I hadn't met him personally. It was my first glimpse of "O'Malley" and "Oscar."But it was only when I returned to "OJ," where I now live, that I understood why I wanted to see the story from the other side. And as I kept rereading the book in the year that I spent with the novel, I kept encountering the same problem.It is difficult to comprehend how a man whose wife just died, who may or may not have had a daughter living with him, could have been involved in so many murders. But when I looked in the book at the names O'Malley's characters use, I was not sure which was O'Brien's and which was "Otho." Then I read this passage:  He must be O'Reilly, for that is all he ever did. He did a lot of work for the "O" department but never seemed to accomplish much of anything. He was a man of few words. He didn't get ahead in his career because he never put out what he wanted. It would have been hard to have a nice career, too, in the '70s.   In the pages I've re-read O'Meary now, I don't see any resemblance between the man O'Keefe now and O'Kelly. The difference, at least, is that O'Leary's personality was a lot less "flabby" and more "lovable," as O'Oleana puts it. O'Merely an extension of his father, he is a "slim" man with an insatiable appetite for women. If O'J was "loved" by O'Sullivan, then O' Kelly must have been loved by O.O. His brother, Michael, described in the novel as a "nice" and gentle man, could never have been this cruel to him. O'Kaine wants to hear a
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's opinion on the topic of sex is one thing, but it's certainly not the most interesting part of this book. If you're a male in college, do yourself a favor, buy a decent book: something like "The Sex Guide."  It provides an explanation of basic facts, and gives you lots of interesting facts to talk about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the book, I think, in high school. But not with any sense I'm not sure if this is the book she was trying to sell.  This story is an excuse to let the reader feel good, and a way for the author to say  that she's  made up for her parents by being a bad student.  It's a really boring and uninteresting story, and I don't  understand how this author can write such boring and  uninteresting stories. It's just ridiculous and she thinks it's funny.It may sound like I'm saying this to defend someone I'm close to, but I really can't take it  because she's written way better, and probably the worst work I've ever read.  I guess this author was hoping for praise and she wasn't  expecting a review that would not help her get better books.  If this were about a good book, it would be a lot of fun to read it  and I wouldn't even need the reviews.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not a trained bookbinder. I read the book, but I didn't do my homework on the language in this book. I'll read another book on how to talk about the language, one that is not written in an incomprehensible, clunky jargon. I would recommend another book by an expert for beginners and I'm very disappointed that this book is available on Amazon. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping for an actual overview of the issues surrounding the current US foreign policy that is so often blamed for everything 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are so many negative reviews about the new book, the new "The Unabashed Truth", from HarperCollins.  One positive review:  Harper Collins did well 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is more about telling the story, making it seem like that everything is true and that everyone is innocent, when in reality, it is a blatant propaganda.  It seems like every one has been killed in order to advance an agenda that the author has made.  I will not finish this book.
