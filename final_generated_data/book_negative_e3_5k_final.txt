Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's all about how to live in a large, modern house while not paying rent. I read a similar book from the author years ago, but the content has changed drastically. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of meaningless references.  In the end, it's just not useful.  I found the author's attitude rather depressing too.  It's as if he thinks the reader is dumb or uninformed.  This book is just an attempt to sell books at his "gastown" events.  He certainly doesn't give a damn about the real world.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't even recommend this book for children.  It is boring, it is boring to read and it is not entertaining to read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be rather embarrassing, as it attempts to be a sourcebook about an archeologist who is supposedly the father of archaeology, and tries to portray a young man in Egypt as well as being a pseudo-historian (even though he didn't even write a negative critique about his father, and wrote about the actual events of his life). I actually felt like I was being shown a young boy's perspective of a real event. The book was not easy to read, and I thought the young man and his father could have had a very difficult relationship, as we could read about how they hated each other as children. However, it did have to do with the fact that this is just the son's point of view. He could have been the father's point-of-view, but he didn´t. I thought it was all very cheesy, and a great way to show a young guy how he should learn about life through his observations.The book didn't help my understanding of Egyptian history as well.  The author writes about some pretty cool events such as the pyramids, and it just seemed to have an agenda, which would be rather boring to read about if it wasn't in a book about archeology and history 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing that I liked about this book were all the references to various other books, particularly this one, so if you are a fan of the Jodwin books you will have to read the other ones 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author seems to have written a positive review about another bad book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of meaningless, meaningless, irrelevant details and it is too expensive for me. It takes 5 seconds to read the book and then I read the next chapter. You don't need to learn Japanese to understand the Japanese in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has little to do with anything that I know about. It has the unfortunate tendency to be a compilation of the author's musings on the life and times of a particular woman, and it is very tedious reading 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not even a big fan of the'spiritual' part of the books, but this one is the absolute opposite.   It has many, many inaccuracies, which could easily be corrected.  The book is supposed to be about the importance of personal spiritual growth, but it actually goes into details about  the wrongness of a particular religion, and the wrongness which is taught  by certain churches.  No matter how much I 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is written for adults, not children.  It contains many mistakes, the author is a bad writer 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In case you are interested, I thought that the author was a nice guy, but his personality really showed in his writing:  He kept changing the style, and even in the second book, it seems to me that he has lost his way. It's the same story again with the same character (though there are some differences). The stories are always the same, yet he keeps trying to present his stories in a new style. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In fact the book is nothing but a collection of stories about a child born of a surrogate mother. The father doesn't even appear until the last third of the book. I was just hoping there was something to these stories but it didn't. The whole book is a collection stories from different people and all of them are the same story: The mother is dead, so the child is left to live in a world that has not yet experienced her death. This is the way I see it, but the book doesn't give you any of the details. It gives you some scenes but they don't get you there. And the ending is not anything like the ending of any of these other books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed this book. It had many of the same qualities that I like in a good book: the descriptions, the writing, and the story. However, I would not recommend this book for anyone who is a big fan of horror books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete waste of time.  The only one who would read it is someone who doesn't like reading 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not sure why this book exists; it is extremely dry and lacks any depth in the way it describes a good night's sex. This book doesn't focus on anything of substance (no touching, no sensual caressing) so there is no point in reading it.  The title is the only reason I can come up with for buying this book, but you know what I mean: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a series of short, boring, overly simplistic stories about different cultures, and the author's obsession with their cultures, is the only reason the book is so boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't usually like this type of book, but this is the one I feel 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not even sure it is an English title, but there is no other English book that  matches this one in terms of being the most self indulgent, narcissistic, self-absorbed person ever. I'm sorry but I don't buy this book. I don the original from France. This is the first book  that   seems to have a point, but that point is so ridiculously self-righteous  I can't believe I'm reading this. The only good thing about   this book   is that I like to read autobiographies and this one  is more focused on the author's thoughts and her love for  being rich and famous than anything else 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think this book is pretty much the same thing as  The Bible:  Written by people who don't really understand 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is a lot of very boring writing and there are some typos. It's basically a non-fiction version of the story of the great Depression. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought the writing was the weakest part of the book, but it is not the worst, it is just the least interesting.  I am trying to read it because I want to become a better speaker, but there are so many bad metaphors, and some of the metaphors I find are actually funny.  The best part of this book is the last few pages, where the authors finally abandon the metaphors and start the book in the original  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about a girl who loves to smoke a bowl of weed, and is a dope.  The book talks about the weed, the girls they smoke with, the parties and the girls in it.  This is the most confusing book I've ever read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so riddled with bad information, that one is hard pressed to even understand what is written. There are too many examples of people making things up to prove that there are some things you can't prove. This is one of the most frustrating books that I have read, especially the part where she discusses the death of a loved one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really don't like this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has absolutely nothing to do with either real life or anything remotely remotely interesting.  It is a long story about a boy growing up with his father. It is nothing more than a bunch of facts and figures presented in a way that is easily confused with reality. There are no good illustrations. This is a bad little book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an excellent book for anyone looking for a good story. But the stories don't read as well as I expected. This book doesn't have enough story to keep me interested for the entire book. And I am not alone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What I liked about it was its use of the word "unfavorable" to describe the negative reviews 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  In the beginning of the book the author says that her book will offer the reader a new perspective of the world through a positive, but often frustratingly negative, view of humanity.   The author claims that her view of the  world is one that is based on the values of her own personal  life, which is the antithesis of the vision of a Christian faith.  The book is full of self-centered selfishness and selfishness.  If you're thinking, why would I read this book, what good is it,  I could probably do better in reading my own life 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed in this book.  The authors are so confident in their teaching that they can't even admit that there is a problem with their content.  This book should not be used for any kind of serious study.  It is too technical for the non-specialist.  Even if you have no previous experience, you will still be overwhelmed with the numerous difficult topics.  If you're looking for a good way to increase your understanding of a particular subject, this book is not the way to go 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was hoping I was going to enjoy this book but unfortunately I do not. The book has only about 60 pages and in that time the author goes through the basics of the book. The author seems to think this is going to teach you a lot of new information so he goes through every point that you would need to know before taking the exam. It's a very short book but that is the problem 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete disappointment. The author has spent most of his life in prison, but claims this novel is about his journey out of jail. No real detail is given about prison life. It's hard to take anything else from it. It is only the author's personal life that he describes. It does not give any real detail about prison, the conditions of confinement, or anything else that might have aided the author in writing this story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is more of the same, a lot of useless information and a lot to digest. The information about the world is of no use and the pictures don't look that great either. The author tries to make a quick buck off the unsuspecting readers who are expecting to learn all about the environment through the stories of children. But I'm more interested in how to survive in this world and I would like to see more than a few pictures for the rest of the books. If you want a fun read, pick this book up, don't bother with it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first book in this series was fine.  But I was disappointed to learn that in the follow-up, the story takes a very interesting turn.  I'm sure the authors would want me to continue the series but unfortunately, the final book in the series is not quite as interesting as the first.  The story is pretty much the same with some extra bits of information added here and there but it is very lacking in character development.  At this point in the book I would have been more interested in seeing some of the characters through a series of crises.  This was all presented as simply a mystery and not as something that would have actually been happening.  Not really impressed with the conclusion at all.  While it did get the job done in the end, it was not done in a good way.  If you are not willing to spend 20 minutes with a character and figure out the details of the mystery, then don't even think about picking up the series 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the book I hated the most. It was so boring. The story of how they were raised and how they ended up in foster care was boring. I wanted more action and romance, not this boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author has a great way of trying to make these books feel more authentic, and it's very much the case in this one: she gets her characters from the ground floor to the top, and we're supposed to feel like she's doing it from the characters' perspective as well as ours. And to think this is a book about a young woman making some money for the first time in her life? Well, we all know how  many successful young women in this generation have ended up in the same situation as the characters in this book.  There is no true story here, as the author only uses what's closest to the characters  and doesn't actually tell a believable story for her characters. It feels very contrived and  too  staged and forced in the beginning, before the book really starts to hit its stride. The characters  don't  seem to be trying to live a positive lifestyle, and the author seems to want you to just forget all about  it, but then it happens again and we forget about it. And then again.  In the end, the author basically leaves us with a bunch of generic teenage girls who are doing  the exact same thing she's just described, and who are basically following the same storyline.  What's the point of  such a book? It has to be interesting for some reason, but it just isn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have not read this book and therefore have no idea about its problems. It would appear that the author wrote this book from a personal perspective. There is nothing here that is interesting or challenging. The book is full of the same outdated and false stereotypes and generalizations that have been used in the past. The author is an ideologue and it is very obvious that she is making money selling this book. I would recommend reading the negative reviews in various book forums like Barnes & Noble, Amazon, or your local bookstore. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a waste of time.  This is an educational book that takes you to a different point of view.  The book tells you all about the different religions of the world.  Then it takes you on a tour of different religions that claim to have the same god.  They are the ones who are being attacked by Christians.   The way in which the author is talking to his reader is as if he is a professor teaching the class.  So while you may read the book, you may not have much insight into what is happening in the real world.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title and subject matter of the book are very off-putting and the way the author attempts to illustrate them is even worse 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The authors don't bother to explain the main points of the book: the relationship between the author and her subjects, her writing style, etc. The author gives very few details about her writing process. No photos of her home. No personal correspondence to the subjects.   The authors don?t provide any real details about the research. No pictures of her bookshelves. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not sure what the title of this book means. It does not give any information about the book it was written for, and I'm not sure why the author feels that he needed to write a book for his daughter that explains what is going on in her life. The author does not know what he's talking about, it's not clear in the book, and it's a very dull read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like it at all.  It is a lot to read and not a lot of fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is no discussion of anything interesting in the history of the world in this book, it only focuses on the Soviet Union and the Cold War and the downfall of the Soviet regime. The world in general is left out in the book, not even a paragraph about Africa, the Middle East, or the post-cold war world. This book is a collection of anecdotes, some of them funny, some serious, but there's no analysis or anything to tie the whole book together. The stories are too thin. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only good thing about this book: the images are great and the illustrations are beautiful, but the book itself is terrible. The book seems to focus on the story in general, rather than the text itself. It is repetitive and the text is too small. This book only serves as the basis for the children's books that follow it, thus it becomes just another collection of images. It's a terrible book, even though it is aimed at children. It takes too much time for the reader to get through the text, and there are too many repetition of images in the text that don't provide much payoff. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an uninspired, incoherent and shallow book which fails to present any useful information about the world.  Unfortunately, it is full of a large number of factual errors and misunderstandings which renders the information not relevant.  It is also very difficult to understand the information presented due to the excessive use of examples.  This book is certainly not worth reading 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has no sense of humor.  In the last 100 pages, she uses all these people and then the book is over.    The last few pages are too boring.  For me, that's a no-go.  This is an example of how NOT to write 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking forward to reading this book, only to find out the title is a misnomer.  The characters seem to be either dead, too young, or too elderly to understand the importance of their actions.  There is one plot line that is intriguing, but the author jumps right to it.  As for plot, it is a bit too contrived and far too predictable for this genre.  All I could do was to give up on the book, but not because I disliked it. I enjoyed the characters and their interactions, but I found it to be too contriving, and even to be somewhat dull.  This is not a bad, well thought out book.  It just has to be better in the beginning.  Maybe I was wrong about the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author states that he's not a "lifestyle" type of guy, so he's never gotten over  a bad relationship, so it's very disappointing to read  about how he spends his time. He's very insecure and self-absorbed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was excited to read this book because it was supposed to be about the life of the great French explorer, Charles V.  Instead it is about a little girl who is always sad.  It is not surprising, given the premise of the book.  I'm not sure if this is intentional, but the tone of the entire story is negative, as if we are all guilty of being miserable.  If you are a child who has trouble understanding emotions, this book will not do you much good 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think most of the information in this book is out of date now, even if most of you are on a ketogenic diet 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it hard to finish this book. The stories were repetitive and did not relate to one another.  I thought the author had created the story of a good guy in the military. The hero has to overcome challenges in a dangerous world. In the end the hero has his life turned upside down.  Not a very interesting book, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in college. It was the first book I read from the library. I thought it would be useful, but  it wasn't. It seemed to me to be like one of those book series, where the first couple were good but by the third book  the author was getting tired of the story. I got the first two in the library but then it became too much and the author decided to shelve it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of errors, so you can only get by with the most superficial reading. The author's style is very dry, and there is a noticeable absence of humor. I did not even bother to look up the citations he uses for the book's examples. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As far as I'm concerned this book is an insult to the reader.  It's not even an attempt to portray any real life events but is instead just a collection of self-promoting clichés.  The book itself is terrible and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  I'm sure someone would sell more copies if they printed it in black and white. The writing was atrocious and the pictures were awful. There's also no mention of the book's source material, the "Pagan Revival" of the early 1970s, so no wonder it's so bad. It has nothing to do with my own faith, but with a book written by someone who clearly has little understanding of Christianity, no matter how deep and profound his own faith might be. To give you an example, he never gives a reason for why someone would attend a pagan funeral 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have tried to read this book before, but I have only been able to do it twice: once on my own, once at a friend's suggestion. I don't understand what this book is about; it seems to be about nothing. I found the descriptions of a woman's vagina to be really embarrassing. In addition, there's a lot of sex talk in the book, which I found distracting. I'm sorry, but if you are looking for a good read, read another one. You won't regret it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had hoped that by now, the author would have come to terms with the changing media world and would take steps to write more carefully about what he has experienced as a result of this shift. I can't blame the author for this, but as I read through this book, the words were so thin and I couldn't find the slightest point to his writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read all the positive reviews of the book, but this negative review is the one that sticks out. This book is not about making money, and does not teach any skills, it is about making the decision to leave a bad marriage, so that you can have some fun with your life again, it's about how to find a good girlfriend and stay together forever.  It doesn't do much to help in any other area, and is just confusing and disappointing.  I do recommend reading the positive review here if you are looking for a book that has a lot to offer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was hoping for an interesting book, but the author's writing style made the book feel like a homework assignment. This is not a bad mistake by a good author, but with this author's lack of style, it was hard to buy the book.  The main character was flat and boring, her personality was lacking, and the book was just a pile of pointless info on how to get a divorce.  I feel sorry for these author's daughter, who has to deal with this crap.  This book didn't help me learn anything, and it's not really the fault of this bad book. The only reason I'm giving it a negative is because of the fact that I don't even like to read about divorce. If you don't have a good divorce memoir, then this book is only for you if you are looking for tips on how you can get a bad divorce. This book did nothing but waste my time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not a huge fan of this book. It reads like a lot of people are trying to make the most of a good book that has a lot to say about things, but just doesn't seem very well written. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have a hard time thinking I would ever read this book again.  It's too short.  The pictures are fine, but not great.   I have to wonder if the picture book was a mistake. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the last chapter the author is about to write about his life and the problems it had with his wife and other  relatives. The chapters in which he is talking about the problems his wife had with her husband were so confusing I could not read them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I liked the story, but it was mostly text that you had to read and follow. It was like an encyclopedia of  stuff, but not very interesting. I just didn't get the point of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is the first thing in the "New Age"  series.  This book is full of errors.  No one can understand  why the author wrote it the way he did.  It was written about 5 years ago.   If you are interested in the New Age movement in America, this book  isn't for you. I know, I'm a New Age person, too 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It seemed to me that this was a book which was intended to be self-help material only for those with a serious addiction.  It's certainly not for me.  The book makes several statements about addiction, and even though it talks about the negative aspects of an addiction, it does not address the positive aspects, like the ability to stay clean, or even the idea of making a life around your addiction. As I said above, it's not for people with a addiction, just the typical reader.  I'm sure there are other books out there that can be useful, but this is probably not one of them 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is boring and is the result of a poorly written book.  The information is presented in a way that is difficult to follow.  I doubt any of the information in the book is accurate and is based upon a book that is no longer in print.  There is too much repetition of information, as if one is reading through a book. This book should have been revised in the 90s and not published in 2012 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is no information provided on the process of making a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was extremely bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not sure it's so bad as you say, but the stories are all very one-sided.  And the fact that it only takes a couple of chapters to go from the beginning of the book to the end is really just insulting.  The whole thing just seemed like something to do to get you to buy the book because of what it could tell you about the man-kind 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with stories and stories of the good and bad times in my life. All of these stories are about bad things, bad relationships and bad decisions.  The only good thing about the book is that at the end there is a very positive story about a young couple who went on to have a very happy and successful marriage.  I would rather read a good book and not a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not worth the money and the time to read it. The plot does not match reality. A good story is to follow the life of a lonely old man and his friend. I would love to know how a story like this was put into a book written by some Hollywood celebrity. This book was put on Amazon.com for free but the author decided to charge the reader. I was hoping this would be a humorous story but it was all about the sad stories. The author had no idea how to convey sad feelings. He only shows the sad pictures. I have not seen the movie yet and hope it is not as bad as this.I thought the main character was a very interesting character. He had a wonderful way to relate to others and loved to hear sad stories about others. But the real tragedy is he was a pathetic failure. His only success was in life, not on the screen. I hated his character and he was not funny. The only thing I liked about him was the fact he was such a wonderful listener. I just wished it was more funny. I thought the story was interesting but I was unable to care about any of the characters. I am a person of faith and I felt sad reading his story. It seemed that there was no way to have a positive outcome in this book. I did not find the ending funny and I was disappointed in the story. I also thought it was sad that the main characters was a failure. I will not read the sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book suffers from the common flaw of the bad writing.  The information is too shallow, it doesn't cover enough ground, and the writing is clunky.  And I haven't even gotten to the best part of the book: the quotes.  I can't stand the way she uses quotations for her points.  What the hell does that mean?  I am sure she uses the quotes to show she is intelligent and witty.  But she just keeps saying the same damn thing over and over again.  All in all, it is just a bunch of useless information.  Not worth the time.  Instead of spending that money on a good book, buy a good dictionary. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was boring, boring, and boring. It's a good book if you're trying to teach a class but it was boring and that's not what I was trying to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed in this book. The subject of rape is addressed but it's not explored in a realistic manner. I have never found it a good use of the time to read this book as it just doesn't make sense, it's just too much for me. It takes too much time for the reader to absorb the information so I wouldn't recommend it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a terrible book and I doubt that the authors even read the actual book before writing this. I think this book is written for sales and not for the pleasure of reading 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is terrible. The story is just horrible. It is not as interesting as I expected it to be. This book has no impact on the reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with very bad statistics. It has the same bad statistics as "the statistics" books, like the "Stratospheric Studies in Science and Technology" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a collection of quotes, quotes that are so unoriginal and clichéd that one has to ask why did Mr. Heintz  even include these quotes in his book.  The quotes are so off-base that the reader gets the impression that the authors are talking down to the reader with a series of clichés 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written and does not seem to reflect her real life. I could not find out about the dates for the book. I was hoping she would write more about her life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've seen and heard a lot of bad books, but this is the worst 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not the most interesting 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read about a dozen other reviews of this book on Amazon.com:  It was the only book that I read that I did not understand.  The characters were just too generic.  There were other things that bothered me, but I couldn't bring myself to read the rest of the book, because it was so predictable.  It took me out of the story too often.  I have read it several times now, but only once in the original language 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The authors' opinions are one thing. There are lots of bad books that are poorly written. This book is just too long, boring, and dull 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of inaccuracies and ridiculous statements that the author apparently cannot remember.  I would never buy a book from a bad bookstore that claimed to be a classic of French literature, but this one was no exception.  This is the book that is sold in Paris as part of the  French series of historical novels, but it is a total waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As the title says, this book is the product of a man who was not a successful businessman and has not earned any money in years. He has a huge bank account with a total of $60,000,000 and that is just the start. For instance, he has $4 million dollars in his trust fund, another $200,000 in an escrow account, yet another $20,000 left to be held. The reason for this is because the bank wanted to sell him his money for money for others. He is not the smartest of men. He did not have much more than a high school education and that was it. If you want to read the whole thing, I recommend The American Dream by Michael E. Dillon. For me, this was just the beginning, I couldn't even finish it before I took the book back. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, we got used to hearing the same story, which is very familiar to us.  It was painful to be stuck to this plot and yet we knew that there was only one way to save her.  She would be saved if she would be rescued by Harry in the end.  We couldn't understand any of it.  Maybe we can now.  I can only imagine how annoying it must be for a child.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not the best I've read, but it is very short. I was hoping to read more of the historical research before my review. The research in this book was so bad, I was very surprised by the conclusions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  In the end, this book isn't about  writing a great book  but a lot of writing  about writing. In the end  it becomes too much about the techniques  (yes I know, a bit boring) but not the content of the work. I wouldn't say to write a book, you should just write the thing you are interested in and you write the book about how you do it not about the technique. Also,  I didn't like the structure of the book. For me, the only one who is presenting is the writer.  The author isn't present in most of the chapters, which leads to a lot more of the writing being about the writing  I would never say it is about the book, it is more about  the method 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If I can't stand the literary style of this book, I wouldn't expect much from this collection.  The only good part of the book is the "quotes" on the cover.  I mean, it was a real struggle to come up with enough material for these, but then I also realized that some of these quotes are actually unforgettable.  To me, it wasn't enough to quote from a bad novel, so I had to use some random, unconnected, words to make the quotations worth something.  Then again, this was the only book I was interested in reading in the library and it was in the last weeks of the school year  In a way, it might have made more sense to get a good copy of the whole book from the library for a good price than get the book on sale, but I guess I was dumb enough to think these "quotation" quotes were "more important"  I don't know how the author was able to produce so much bad quotes with such a low budget. I found some of these quotes extremely embarrassing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you are a young woman looking for something to do in college but no one will listen, this is the book for you.  There is a very short time for a student to read this book and then go back to work.  It has nothing to do with being in college, so there is nothing to encourage anyone to read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is weak. The subject matter is heavy. The writing style is not consistent. The author doesn't care to present himself well in any sense. He is not a good speaker. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I could not find anything about this book which made me want to buy it. It was very disorganized and did not have anything to do with the subject matter. I think it is very interesting to read the letters but this book does not do anything but that. There was no "discovery" in this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought the story was rather ridiculous, especially the bit about the horse and the dog. The fact that it's all about a horse and a dog in a car and the story does not end was extremely funny to me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a big fan of this book and I do not know how a writer could have written this book in any other way. I do like the stories that are told about the family, but the main focus is the children. This book just lacks the originality. You cannot expect to learn anything new from reading a book about a family. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a collection of short stories. The writing style is very off-putting to the reader and the stories are not in any way related. I think this is due to the fact that the writer had been drinking for many years at the time of writing. That is to say, the stories were written at the beginning of the book but he didn't actually drink for the entire book. The reason is that he didnít want to write about drinking and he found a better writer who wrote about the topic. That was the end of the story and there was no more drinking for a very long time. He kept using that story to write the stories in other books but that didníte work because the stories werenít related. This book should have been titled: The Drunkardís Guide to Literature 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, that's the premise of this book.  It says that this book is all about how to survive the recession.   That is true if you believe the mainstream media's hype, and if you really believe that the federal government can solve the   problem of unemployment.  The first thing they say is that they will offer a massive bailout 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hate this book! There are so many problems with it:  1. There is no chapter on the history of the Jewish people. There are no quotes of Rabbi Soloveitchik and so forth.  2. The book tries to portray all Jewish people as a bunch of anti-Semites! This is an inaccurate portrayal!  3. It does not give any examples of why the Jews were persecuted or what their attitude was towards the Germans.  4. It doesn't even show how the Germans treated the Jews, but simply claims that the Germans were right and the Jews must be held accountable! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author uses the term "sexual orientation" in this book with the idea that the "orientation" has to do with a "sexuality". The author tries to justify this concept as "human sexual development" or some other lame excuse, but this excuse is clearly not valid in the 21st century.  This book is a classic of "sex positive" literature 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is really boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a blatant misprint 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're looking for an accurate book about the Vietnam War, this is not the book for you. The book is written in a very   dry manner and has no humor. The whole thing seems to boil down to   the author's personal views on the war. It's really sad, because it   isn't even the book that he wrote. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is based on an e-book  and thus is hard to read. It was written by a layman who had to learn the science in order to write about it, which makes it less exciting.  The author seems to be a very passionate person about his subject and in the book it is obvious  that he is trying to present a "correct" picture of science.  I did not find any of the scientific concepts he used to make sense.  As a laymen,  I found it hard to understand what he was trying to show me.  If you are trying to learn more about science,  don't waste your time with this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not to be trusted 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Too much self-aggrandizement for the reader, it's no wonder why this book failed. But it seems they were too much in love with the idea of the big, strong-minded black woman 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think that this was the first book where she said that she was a lesbian.  I would hate to read a book from a lesbian author.  If I were a lesbian I wouldn't read this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only positive review I could give is to say that if you are going to read this book, then at least do so with caution 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is nothing but a collection of quotations that all sound exactly the same. But I guess that is the point 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains all the wrong information on the wrong subject. It is filled with the most trivial examples that don't seem to add anything to the understanding of the topic. You have to pay more than a hundred dollars for this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It has been a bad year for the book's authors; they have been under public scrutiny, and this book will not help. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found that the book was more of a compilation of various other writing  than an original work.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed to see that it was all about the wrong things. The book is really about a woman who gets involved in sexual activities with a younger guy. Nothing out of the ordinary really. And that was the whole point, because her friend was having difficulties with his wife, and it was obvious that she was using the relationship to try and get away from her husband.   The book was written too quickly to be any good, and the character's problems were not resolved at all. It really made the book feel like a fast paced pornography. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sure that the majority of the people who read this book will agree that the author's attempt to create some "moral" in the heart of a child is laughable. But that's okay. I mean, there are so many of us who agree with him. He's just the latest person who wants to exploit and degrade our children and the poor thing has not done a good job with his writing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not what the author intends it to be. The author is not a history student, nor does she attempt to present a complete story. She instead takes a series of events, and only vaguely relates them. For example, the author does not even seem to have a complete understanding of what a "good" war looks like. There is no explanation of the conflict or how to interpret its meaning. Instead of showing a story about the war and the events that have led up to it, the book offers a series  of quotes from other people's war stories.  The book could not have been written as a history book, which is a great shame. The book's main purpose is to tell a story; not to present anything as fact.  I will never buy any more books by this author, and I highly suggest to everyone else to avoid this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is riddled with grammatical errors and it is riddled also with the author's personality flaws. In the end, this book is not a good choice for anyone. The book is too technical for anyone but to someone that is interested in writing. For anyone that wants to write, read books like   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The authors fail to understand how the language of a language works.  I did not understand them at all.  This book is very dull and boring.  The author is a very bad writer and does not even use proper language 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book in the college library. As for the story itself, it was too vague for my taste. There was no reason for the girl to not have any romantic relationship with her best friend or a good friend. Why does she become an only friend to her best friends? Also, if she became a close friend to them and they were always together, then why did they go away in high school? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know if you are a person who prefers to read to children or if this was a mistake but you have all the information in the first 2 chapters, the rest is a series of boring pictures.  Not very encouraging for an older student to read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It seems this was written by a woman, which is a shame. This book is not at all what I expected, and the authors should probably be ashamed for using it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for a good book about a good woman, check out a copy of her book, It's a Good Life 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read several of the previous editions, but this one seems to be the weakest 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has nothing to do with the subject matter 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not even close to a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's just not true that most of these guys have been in trouble before for drug abuse.  That's not even a bad thing, just different.  There are many more women who smoke pot, but this is just one of those women's books.  The guy with the wife has lots of sex, but that is all the book is about.  For a guy with a bad drug problem, you don't need another book on drugs 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have never purchased a book by someone who was not able to write a coherent sentence. This is a perfect example of someone not being able to do so, and yet making it clear they understand what the book was about. If you want to use this book for your classes  you are better off finding someone else to do the work 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a pretty dull book. No insight, no stories, no quotes, no facts, no interviews, no reflections. Just pretty pictures. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only part of this book I liked was the end, but the beginning was horrible. You had to know this book wasn't going to be good to get a good read from me. The last few pages of the book were just too cheesy.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As the title indicates, this is not a fun book to read.  It's rather slow and monotonous.  The author has a habit of coming up with these unbelievable titles in the hopes that the story will be more interesting.  For example, the book's title is "A Journey into the Spirit World"   The book is not as bad as it appears and I certainly recommend it for those who want to read a book for kids, but it is just not fun to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book for the people who are bored or feel that this isn't their cup of tea.  It is, of course, very interesting, but that's about the only way I could describe it.  The book also is very short and is written from the point of view of people who don't believe in God.  If you like talking about your favorite books, try a different book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I could not agree with the reviewer who described the writing as sloppy, repetitive, and uninteresting.  For a book to be that bad, it must have been based off a bad writing job that the author did on the first draft.  This was the second attempt, and the writing was much better by the time the manuscript was complete.  The idea of having to buy another book just to get something out of it just shows the lack of imagination and good taste in the work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was extremely disappointed by the book. The writing was so choppy and it was too easy for me to miss the story when the characters were moving. The author was able to write about a wide range of subjects, but only about how the characters felt about their relationships. This is really sad, and the story seemed to be very shallow at times. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is hard to read this book because it is completely devoid of any actual information or insight. It does, however, tell you a lot about yourself, and while that is very personal and may or may not fit you, it may not necessarily be a bad thing if it does. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very excited to pick up this book when I first heard about it but  I never felt like I was actually reading it. It's full of all sorts of silly nonsense 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't care about the author's opinions.  It's a sad, depressing book to read.  I'm not even going to comment on the title and blurb.  If the title doesn't read like a bad paperback, the blurb is a joke.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read the previous reviews before and have to say  I agree with most of them. The information provided  does nothing for the readers. The writing style is so  generic and the information is not the most helpful  I found in the book. I also found the chapter in which the chapter on "Wisdom and the Holy Spirit" was  listed to be one of the most  boring in the entire book. This chapter  was very repetitive and was not worth the time  it takes to read it. I would not recommend  this book for any reason 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was extremely disappointed. I have read many of his books and this one just didn't do it for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of those books that are really easy to hate, if you are into horror.  I read the whole book in one sitting, and it seemed that the author was bored when she was trying to show us a different side to the story 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you've read any of the other reviews, you'll note that the book's title is misleading: it's just an example of some common mistakes. There are other examples, too. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't want my readers to make these mistakes, so I was frustrated with the book, and frustrated with myself as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the book that the author wanted everyone to buy as if it were the bible. She even said she would write a negative book review about it if she ever reads it! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not much of a writer, but if you need a good book for the end of a class or something, this isn't it.  I don't want to say it was bad because it is, but it was very unmemorable for me.   It seems like they made this book for some sort of religious or esoteric reason, but there's nothing about it really being anything beyond superficial. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book from start to finish. It was just so tedious and it seemed so much effort was put into the writing of it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very poor book.  I would have much preferred that she could be more accurate with her descriptions.  This book is a little too dramatic.  The book makes it sound like it was her own experiences, but that isn't the case at all.  It's a story that she tells herself, which doesn't do a lot to improve your book.     I thought that this book was going to be more realistic, but she wasn't very accurate with the details, especially the story of her relationship with her dog. I was pretty disappointed that the book ended on such a cliffhanger.  Her next book, I hope it's not as bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's pretty obvious that the author is not a science professional 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is about a man's struggle with a debilitating illness. It's not a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm so confused by the title and the author's claim of being able to do all of these things. I could not find a single use of "super-speed" anywhere in the book and the idea that he can do it all by changing his life (no more stress and no more mistakes) is ridiculous.  It's a bad read and it's very disappointing to have a book like this for my children 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was never about the book; it was about the author, his family and the state of American politics.  It's as if the author is writing a novel about politics without ever having lived in the United States!  It may have been written to raise money for a political campaign, but it was never entertaining.  The only way to enjoy this book is to watch the movie, but then you have to read the book first to see why the characters say the things they say.  This book is bad for kids and bad for adults.   The author has yet to be able to adapt this book to make it interesting enough to entertain anyone else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the book that everyone seems to think was a success. However, the book itself was not  well written and it is very difficult to follow along with the plot. It is difficult to feel anything when the book ends and the characters are in their new lives. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is just a terrible book.  If I had never read this book, I would have never learned about the Chinese-Americans or the Civil War.  There is not a single historical lesson.  It just tells you what you want to know about the war.  I'm sorry, but I just don't see it as a good book to read.  You have to be very careful about what you read, because there is so little information to go on 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written in a style that is condescending to women and has little to no sex education. The book also has an incredibly narrow view of what constitutes "sex" and the woman is not to be trusted in her decisions as she is a temptress. The only sex advice the woman should take is to go to a prostitute and have sex with strangers. If the reader reads this book expecting to know about sexual intercourse, you will not learn anything about the act. You will learn more about sex toys, sex dolls, bondage, sex parties, prostitution, and BDSM. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main reason to buy this book is to look for clues that may point to a paranormal explanation of a mysterious disappearance in an Italian village.  The book is very boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed in this book. The only thing I learned from this book was that a bad person will lie to you.  I never learned anything about the relationship between father and daughter or how to love a bad boy.  This book did not offer any new advice and was a complete waste of my time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There's nothing wrong with a good book, but there is no sense of excitement, or wonder, or happiness. It's not a bad story, it's just a dull story, without a happy ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't have much of a negative reaction to this book.  In fact, I think this is the book  which shows the best of   its ability to convey knowledge of the arts 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author makes no claims of accuracy but only claims that it's based on real life experiences. Well, what the heck is life actually like 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are one of those people who has read the books by Susan McIlhenny and Joanne Woodward, then you may want to think twice about reading this book, as it is far too basic for any real fiction reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read this book before, and I must agree that it contains little useful information. I thought that it would be a great idea to add a couple of pictures to each chapter. I know this is not necessary, but it would increase the value of the book to me. It certainly adds to the book's appeal, but I would have preferred to be able to find some real information in the book itself. This book seems to have little value, and is more for the reader's enjoyment, so if you plan to read this, I recommend you do so only if you are looking for something entertaining to read. I wouldn't bother with this book to become a better author in my own eyes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not a bad read, but with too much of the same old plot-twist and clichéd characters that seem to be all over the place in fantasy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm always very skeptical about this type of book, but here it is, in the same format as the original book, and is only slightly shorter. But the format has been reduced by the author from that of the original.  It's like the original is the only one that has any real substance.  This is a sad situation.  I will be reading this in its current format only 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In other words, it's not a history of the U.S., but it's a history about the New York World's Fair. The only thing that I liked in the book was the photos and the fact that it tells the story through a few different points of view. For me, the point of view that was the most interesting was the part that relates the New Yorkers who were not at the fair with these strange, new-fangled, New York-meets-India-meh-me, Indians. The other part is the part where there are several American Indians who were trying to come to New York in the 1920's and were turned away. I was interested to see the Indians' reaction in these pages. Instead, they seem to be the only ones who have any sense of the actual situation. The way the story is told in the text, it seems like this is the only place where the American Indians are involved. They have to fight it out with the white Americans. The Americans have a good excuse to do it, they had no choice in the matter since the Indians did it first 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The bad reviews do not mean this is bad reading. It is certainly not the best science book ever written, but it is not the worst book. This book tries to be as close to the real science as possible. However, it does not have enough solid science explanations. For example, one chapter has one character claiming it is impossible to survive a plane crash because the human body can withstand only so much heat. In fact, the body has the ability to adapt to heat even in hot climates, and there is a whole book dealing with this. This is just the latest in a long line of pseudo-science stories. I believe this book is not needed for most people to learn the real physics of the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can only assume the book was never meant for students, because the main character seems to have little to say about himself or anything else.  He seems to be running around trying to make some kind of statement about the society around him, but in the end, there isn't much to be said.  I'm actually not sure I like it as a book.  But then again,  the title of the book is more or less a catch-phrase of the author.  So I guess that's all that's  needed:  To get the reader to buy the book, but to keep him or her out of the real world for long stretches of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't buy the whole thing. First of all, he is a very arrogant man who doesn't take any responsibility for his actions. The book is about his life, which is not about what's right and wrong. It's just the way he thinks. You can take him to the extreme, and make him into a saint, but that's not what this book is. You don't even know who's telling the truth. It reads like a guy trying to prove a negative point: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's so easy to see how she has gotten the impression that her own opinions on the subject matter of her book are not shared by others. Her book is not about marriage. It's a love story. The fact that the book has been described as "heartfelt" is a red flag. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am not even an advanced college student and I still find this book boring and unbelievable. The author uses a lot of irrelevant personal anecdotes, yet the main character goes through a LOT of dramatic changes in the last chapter 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has very little in it about the Christian life. The author spends a lot of time trying to convince you that he knows what it is like to be Christian (he doesn't). He makes a lot more claims about his spirituality than he does about the content of his faith. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not really about the Bible.  The idea that God was once a homosexual is not explained.  No explanation is given for why God is willing to let evil people rape, pillage, and murder innocent people, while giving us the right to murder people who practice any sort of religion.  This isn't a good book.  I thought God would be a little more logical than to allow this kind of evil to continue.  Also, the Bible clearly states that homosexuality is not a sin, and this book makes no claim to this fact.  It's just another anti-Christian book." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was supposed to teach women about good books, but it's really about how women aren't allowed to know what's happening in their lives, what they want, who their friends are and their thoughts about life. This book is nothing more than a bunch of stories told from the first person. It's like an old wives story. There's not much to the book, just stories of women's lives. There are also no examples in the book. No examples of good books or examples of bad books. It just shows stories that the author thinks are good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In short, it is a compilation of unreadable quotes and miscellaneous trivia, with some very basic information given about the Japanese culture, but none of it relating to actual information about Japanese. The author never explains why he chose to go with this, and the fact that he did is what gives the book a bad name. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so full of obvious spelling errors. Even the examples from the book do not help, like in this example:  This is a bad mistake that a good spelling and grammar checker could have caught and corrected before it was printed. I am appalled that I have wasted money buying books from these publishers that include the mistakes in such a blatant manner 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know why I picked up this book but I am so unhappy with it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm pretty sure this was written by a 17 year old girl who has never written a book or been a professional writer. The only thing she got wrong was the title. There are two possible endings, both unsatisfying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the most boring and stupid book ever written 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In order to support its claim that the British were never in touch with the common people, it uses several examples of illiterate peasants and even an illiterate boy (who claims that it was written for him by his father!) It doesn't take a very good scholar to realize that these "literary inventions" would be out of place in a normal book, especially as the reader has to take the story from his perspective to follow the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think the author has an eye for detail. He writes the same things in different chapters. He doesn't seem to pay much attention to the characters. He shows a few names and gives an impression of their personalities, but he seems to give them a life of their own. He seems to want to tell a story about what is going on, but never actually shows us. This book lacks character, and the plot doesn't follow through. He tries to do a lot of character development, and it falls flat. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did read this book, but I did not find the information interesting, so I did very little reading. I really wish that Ms. Stuckey would publish her own book about the early years of photography, since this one is rather boring. I hope Ms. Clements will publish her book about this as well 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very disappointed in this book. There are a lot of things that just don't add up. I really wanted to know what happened to the couple after this, but didn't. The author doesn't bother to put any of the clues and evidence together, only presenting what she wants you to see. This is what happens when you write a novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main point of the book is to show that the Bible can never be trusted as it contains many false and dangerous statements. It is the authors idea that if you believe the Bible to be the word of God then you need to have faith in all of the false and evil things written in the book.  I'm no bible scholar, and I don't buy the entire concept of this book. There is nothing wrong with the concept of using a book to guide people in their life. I think the problem is the application of the concepts. It shows you how the Bible is filled with things which are true and true only to the extent that they are consistent within that book. But this is not a bible, this is a religious book that contains the opinions and ideas of its authors. So it does not matter whether it's true or not. You must follow the book as they say. This book doesn't explain what the Bible means, it explains how you interpret it. I see no problem with that, but if you are a Christian or a practicing christian you cannot accept this approach to God. God knows exactly what the meaning of any passage is, and how to properly interpret the passage. There are many different interpretations, which are based upon what is said in the Bible, or the interpretations of the interpreters. If you want to be a true follower of God, you must accept the interpretation which God gives you, not your own interpretation. The Bible can be interpreted many ways, but the ultimate interpretive tool is the word. You should never read a passage to see how it is worded. Instead, you should read it to see if it can be logically related to other verses within the same chapter or the same book. You know, logical reasoning. There has to be consistency in what the book says. It's not a book that provides proof, it provides answers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not well written and it's obvious that no one bothered to learn much about the subject matter before beginning 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was not interesting enough and I didn't even bother to read the book. This is not a good book for the older reader 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of errors. A lot of people say that you can't really trust a translation, but then we don't really know what the original was translated from. This book tries to do the impossible, it tells you what it means, but the translation is wrong, so you get confused. The English translations that I have read so far have either been done wrong (the way I read the translation) or they haven't. It also does not make sense that an English translation of a Chinese book would be any better. The author is obviously only looking to make money for himself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's an unapologetic look at a man's life in prison. He has no friends or family, so he's lonely and lonely. He gets caught cheating on his wife, so the book doesn't do a good job of helping him through the troubles. However, it's really only for the man's own personal benefit. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has been around since I first saw it in 1976. I read it back in 1978. I can see how the authors made a huge profit from the book. It is a collection of a number of unrelated essays that have nothing to do with each other. The essays are written by people who are just trying to be in the center of things and trying to write a good book. This is one of those books. Don't waste your money on it, except to see if there are any good points in it.The essays are all about the author's personal life, not the content of his research. It seems like they could not even finish writing each essay. There are many more good essays out there than the ones in this book. If you want to learn something about the subject of biographical research, I would suggest The Great American Literary Schmooze: The Life of John Steinbeck 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've given a few of my books to my kids, but this one seemed so much more 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book a lot of time is spent trying to get rid of a bad boyfriend. The plot involves the death of a little girl, the kidnapping of a man, and a series of lies and coverups.  The writing is weak, there is little development of the characters and most of the action is set in the past. The result is a boring, tedious book, but not for the reason you think it is.  It is not because the plot is not interesting.  The characters are poorly developed, the plot doesn't follow through and the ending is rushed and unrealistic.  If this book was a movie, I would never see it because the acting was horrible. There is a reason why people do not like books like these.  They are boring to read, and boring to listen to. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really disappointed in the end of the book, and I don't blame her at all.  She seems to have given up on her ideas, and that's a problem, because those ideas were quite original.  However, this is the end; there are no more books about  that particular subject.  I found her to be cold and distant, and she seemed to have forgotten about  her writing on the book.  For me, that's the only way to look at it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is the first of two  of her historical novels. She wrote it at a young age, but was not a strong child. Her imagination does not come to her, and the story does not interest her. I was  excited when I discovered her book on-line, but this was not one of the books she actually wrote.  I would recommend this for fans of a good historical novel,  but not for anyone who is looking for the real thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a former history teacher, I have noticed the trend toward popularizing the   belief that "history is written by the winners" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a feeling I'm going to hate this book.  I would never read anything with that title 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The problem is, this book does not provide any real understanding of what we want from a good book. We want to see our thoughts and ideas on the subjects discussed in the book, in a format that is easy to understand and easy to reference. This book does NOT  provide any examples or discussion of what are the different types of writing that are effective and  how to do it correctly.   This book is designed for someone who has completed a course in writing in a subject area that they are  already very familiar with.  There is no way that anyone can really learn or understand writing unless  they take the time to write well. If you are the type of person who is  comfortable with the idea of writing, this is not a good  book.  It is not clear who wrote this book. The title is very vague. It is a book for people  who already know how to write  and who already have ideas about what they want to learn from the book  (which is not an easy task to achieve). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't really like books about the occult. If you have a good knowledge of the occult, then this book is for you, but if you don't, then just don't read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a bad read. It is a book from an unreliable narrator, but the narrator has to make his own mistakes to tell the story. The author has not even bothered to correct the errors in the book. For example, the narrator said that he was a part-time preacher and in the middle of his third year of college. He also said that when he was at college, he was taking a full course load, and in fact, he did take a full academic course load. The narrator did not tell us about this so we have no idea how much time he spent in college. The book also tells us about various false memories and other ridiculous details. The reason I don't recommend this book is because it is so poorly written and the mistakes are too numerous to list. In fact, the only real point of the story is that the narrator is unreliable. The rest of the book is just a bad attempt to create a book, so the readers have no reason to think the book was written by a reliable narrator. If you are looking for a book that is going to keep your interest in the story but will leave you bored, then read a good book that the author of this one can provide 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of bad information and is not worth the read.  A lot of the information comes directly from the authors and not from a reliable source 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book for about three months and it just didn't do anything for me.  All the characters seem to disappear into the mist at the end, it was sad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The whole thing is just an elaborate hoax on the part of the author to gain popularity by selling books in the United States. The title alone, and even the "pitch" that she gives, is highly misleading.  The book is actually very long. The entire text of the book is basically a collection of fake facts about the book's subject.  I'm not even sure that the book has any good points to make.  It is basically just pure garbage, and the author even tries to hide the facts she is spreading by claiming to be the "first" woman in history to write a novel about a lesbian woman. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the first chapter and it gave me no idea where this book was going. It seems as if it is a collection of short stories 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not the kind of book I read much.  I have to read a good book to learn something about a field and this isn't it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a good read if you like fantasy and science fiction. Not very good in any way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is not bad enough to be written as a children's book, it is so much worse than that. The plot is boring and the characters are just plain annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is all about making up a story for a child in the hopes that she will like the story and learn a little more about the world around her.  It really doesn't do anything for the reader, and she never learns anything new from the stories, but I would give this book zero stars for its content.  I would recommend skipping it for anything but the pure enjoyment of reading a children's book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only positive review I can give this book is that it is not in this author's style and style of writing, that is. The prose is stilted and monotonous and the book is full of cliches, that even the original publishers of this book could not even tolerate. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for an explanation of a complex subject, this is not the book for you.  Instead, you should read a good book like The Art of Happiness or The Four Agreements 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I don't think this is a good book for a beginner or new to Buddhism.  The author makes it seem that his life is very chaotic and he's never found the peace that comes with the practice.  His book feels like a chore to read;  It is not an easy read for someone who's never experienced these things before 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I wish I could give this book a positive review, but the writing was atrocious.  I would have given it only three stars, but it kept pulling me into it, the same way that some people can't take a negative compliment and go straight for the compliments.  The story is a great one, but unfortunately this book was never intended to be a serious book, but rather a humorous one.  It has nothing to do with the story, it is just about the author and his adventures. It is not an appropriate book for any child, or for anyone with a weak stomach or who has to work. The writing was always choppy, the text looked like the pages were wet. My daughter had to tell me that the book was a joke, and not something we could read. In short, not a good book for kids. I will stick to books that are for adults. There are some great books out there, but I don't think this was one of them 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A good book should make you think about important issues, not just the bad ones. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is so much wrong in this book: not only is the focus on "how-to" rather than "why", it doesn't even mention the very practical steps one might take to heal one's relationship with another, the way one communicates with a friend, a lover, and a therapist 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main idea of this book is that all of us should be more open to experiences that are different than our own, and that we shouldn't just avoid experiences as if they are poisonous. I thought this was interesting, and would have been interesting if it had been more successful. But this book was only published in 1996, so a lot of the experiences the author claimed were valid were not, and many of them were very far away. The experiences the book claims as valid were also the experiences of the authors. I have heard about many, many such "successful" trips before, but they never turned out to be anything close to that. They all turned out horrible. If you are going to go on a trip, do your homework, don't just say "I'll do it if I have to," and don't do it without a solid, safe plan and plenty of time to prepare. Don't make your trip if you have a bad feeling in your stomach: This is a very interesting book, but it is very much too soon to make the decision to try it. It should have been first published a decade or more ago, but I think a lot more could have been done to avoid all of the mess it is made out to have been made. It is, however, one of the better books that I have ever read, and there are some interesting trip reports in the later parts of the book. The more difficult part will be to go through the whole book and see if the experiences you are after were all within the boundaries of the trip. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is terrible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was not written in an adequate manner. It is a waste of money to buy it for a gift, it will only frustrate the recipient. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a waste of time reading a book that is supposed to be about how to deal with one's child.  In fact, I couldn't tell if it was a parent's book or an adult's book.  The book is written in the third person, and it would be helpful if the author could stop using the third-person pronoun when writing about someone's child 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am surprised it is called a book, because the text is so dry and uninformative.  If you don't have a knowledge of military history, the topics do not interest you in the least.  I didn't bother to read the book before buying this one, but I am glad I did.   The book is written in a style that is very similar to a newspaper, and you can tell it is written by a newspaper correspondent.  The writing style is not good, so I didn the least bit invested in reading the text, but it's certainly better than many of the other military history books on the market, which are poorly written and written very hurriedly.  For $15.99, you could buy a lot of books, and not even read all of them.  These books cost you way too much money, but if you read them, you may get a good education, but you will be left with a bad taste in your mouth.  So buy it if you want a quick and inexpensive refresher, but don't expect the depth that you would get in the military 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't understand why the author doesn't make a point of not using a lot of scientific detail. Why don't we read the science of how these people make their eggs at home to see how much of an effect this might have on their reproductive ability? Instead we have a picture of the two of them in the kitchen eating a few dishes of egg dishes, and then, two years later, we have them at the beach doing the same thing. The reader is forced to read a book full of  empty promises that don't actually have any impact on the reader. The author does seem to have an aversion to doing research on her subject matter, but even if that's the case I'd still advise skipping this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book opens with a long quote from Joseph Campbell and the quote he gives in the book is about how to have the right attitude.  It is not even a good book to read if you are trying to change your life.  I have only read it once, and the first time I felt I was changing my life and I didn't want to read any more.  If you are interested in changing your life read the book, but if you want to avoid the   bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A bad book by a bad writer. Not my style.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book contains numerous spelling mistakes and typos. The author doesn't seem to care about his writing. He doesn't know how to make simple sentences understandable. He also doesn't write with any sense of style, he uses very many metaphors. He uses this style of writing in all his books. This book has no relation to history or even to the Bible. It's not only bad, but it is stupid as well 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The style and tone are off, and the text is poorly organized. There is too much repetition and too little thought about the characters. I felt this was a bad fit for the book's themes and characters, which were pretty good to begin with. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am surprised this book is even on the shelf 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a great fan of the books by David Lynch and David Bowie, but I was completely unimpressed with this  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're a science writer, you might as well just stop doing that.  If anything, the book reads more like a school-book for   elementary school kids:  You are not allowed to take medicine 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The whole book is based on anecdotal stories.   It's hard to know how much this book actually relates to his real life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main problem with this book is the number of errors. The title page of the book is misspelled on the inside. There is also a typographical error, the word "hope" is misspelling as "hothouse". The book's first chapter is an introduction to Christianity and the New Testament. As a Christian I found these chapters very difficult to understand, and most of the references made in the book were incorrect. The other chapters were poorly written, confusing, and many had no sense of style. The book had no clear ending. The information was too vague and many questions were left unanswered. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not going to lie  I'm one of those who hated the book, and then read through it to find out why. The story didn't seem that important to me at all. I hated the fact that the book was written in third person perspective (from the POV of the child in this case) and that the author made the story more about the children, rather than the adults. There were other things that bothered me, and the book seemed to be written from the perspective of an insecure, insecure person rather than from the POV or perspective of the narrator. It was all in your face. This is the second book that I've read where I felt that I was reading a self-insert novel by the author, and it just felt like this book had to have a beginning, middle, and end, but the way the author went about it made it hard to even guess where this book was headed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As someone who has experienced severe depression, this book was a disappointment. Most of the authors' recommendations were based on a strong desire to reduce or even prevent the depressive cycle. This is not the place to do that. This book is a good book to have on hand while you are going through a severe bout of depression. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The language used here is very clunky and uninspired.  There is a lot of stuff you should be reading other than this book, and it may seem like you just took the book, tossed it in the trash, and read the next book.  But I would suggest to read it, but with a great deal of caution, for fear of the writing style being ruined by excessive overuse of words 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave the book 5 stars, but I was not able to buy the book at any store. I was able to get it from Amazon, but it only cost $10.00 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was already aware of this book's shortcomings. What I found is that the author does not really explain what he thinks happened to the characters in the story. The author does provide examples of how the situations developed in the book but the way he describes the events makes it seem as though the author was trying to avoid any direct responsibility. If there is such a book as The Mystery of the Missing Airline Passengers I would certainly recommend that it be read first before reading this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a great book, full of stories about the life of some interesting individuals, but it doesn't tell you anything about yourself. There is nothing you can do to change yourself so you can have more success and freedom from your own failures. All you do is keep going with the stories, which are interesting, but the stories themselves are not inspiring. There's nothing about you in any of these stories. There are no insights to help you improve or make you better. You simply keep going and hope that your stories will eventually work out. But this is a one-way street. Once you've made it through a story, it doesn.t tell you what to do next. You've done a great deal of self-improvement through these stories, but you don't know how to go from there. It is a great story book, but not an action manual. It's the story of a great person, but nothing you will ever do to improve yourself can be learned from the stories. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not impressed with this book at all. The author gives up on his readers after five pages and he makes the book very difficult to read. It seems that only the author knows what he is talking about when he talks about the need for education and the need to be well informed. I am not one to teach, but even I can see the problems with this concept of education. One of the main themes of this book is "How To Make Everything Work Out". What does he mean? He does not even bother to explain what that is. He just tells us that we have to be able to "Know what is good for us" I believe he means that we need to know what to eat, drink, and where to go to school. This is not the way to go about being well informed I think the way you should go about it is by putting the information in context And this book has plenty of that in its pages The fact that he only offers very limited information to help us learn about the "How's" in life is the problem. In the section on "Learning Styles" he only tells you that certain ways of teaching can be used for students with certain personality types. Then he has a section about teaching styles and he makes a point about teaching how he would teach a student who has ADHD And what do you know? They got their students to learn this by having them "Sit in their chair" To be fair, it does not matter if the students do this or not. But there is no point to learning about that stuff I would recommend the book for one to look into some of the other topics the author has addressed The first thing one needs to do is read the first few pages of this And then read all of the last pages It is very hard to do this without looking at the table of contents It makes the reading so much easier And I would suggest reading the table to make sure you have the information you need before beginning the book The book has some nice pictures in it and it is interesting to see the pictures the author chooses to illustrate his points with I'm going to pick one of the pictures To illustrate a point that the author is making about the importance of knowing who you are as a person Here are the details: There are 4 major categories to consider: Gender Identity Race Language Gender
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't recommend this book to anyone, but if you've ever read a good fantasy book, you may like it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book by a bookseller to be a poor reading experience. It doesn't take place in the real world, it's a fantasy book, and the magic system does not feel realistic to me at all. And it doesn't help that the characters don't have any depth to them. It feels like you are reading through a storybook and there is not a lot of depth to the characters and the story. I found the author's choice of words ridiculous. The whole book is full of spelling and grammar mistakes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For a book aimed at adults, this is a little too preachy. This book is full of facts about various aspects of life.  It makes the case that all of life is wonderful and worth experiencing.  I would've loved for this to have been more about the people in the book.  As it is, it seems that the facts of life are only useful in solving the problems of the character 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author has clearly not bothered to read a history book about his country.  Instead he has just rehashed what he already knows.  In other words, the author has forgotten the past to create a new one.  History books are not about history, they are about people and their beliefs.  The only way the author could possibly create the new era was by changing history to his own desires.  That is where the book ends, it doesn't follow any of the characters through the events of the last 150 years.   It is basically just a series of random details.  Not worth buying or reading for any reason 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like it.  I kept wanting to know how they would end the book.  The only thing I found interesting was the author's thoughts on women.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel so bad for anyone who reads this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not find a single worthwhile fact in this book. The idea of a natural process and the scientific method were presented as the answers to the question of why some people are more intelligent than others 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is  clumsy and the format is poorly presented.  There are a lot of factual errors  with no justification.  The whole thing is an eye-roller.  This is a book for kids who enjoy a good story but don't know how to  read.  It's hard to understand how anyone could like this  book if they knew how to read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book because I needed something to teach myself how to write. It's a good book, but  I couldn't even come up with anything I needed to write to. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is filled with many inaccuracies and poor grammar. Not to mention she has no knowledge of biology. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very annoying story for young people to read. The book is only good if you are interested in religious stuff, I do not recommend this for children.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has no relation to reality.  There is no way of knowing what goes on in these people's lives.   It's a sad case of overindulgence in a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought the book was just going to be about the relationship of people in a marriage.  It is a couple of pages and then it gets boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very disappointed in the book. The chapters do not cover the key events. The author provides very little information regarding the characters, plot, etc. Instead of providing information about the main story, this book provides very few details about the side stories of the main characters.The author spends the majority of the book writing negative reviews about his previous novels.I did not recommend this book for anyone except an avid reader of science fiction and fantasy, not even the person who has the book in hand.This book was poorly written, and the author has no idea of what he is writing about. He spends a lot of time in negative reviews, and he provides very small amounts of information about characters. I believe that the author spent a lot more time on the characters he chose to write negative reviews of than the main plot of the story.I have no problems with a bad science fiction or fantasy book, but the author did a poor job. He spent a huge amount of time writing negative review after negative review, and there was very little of a plot that developed.I was surprised that it took this long to read this book. I would have given it to a friend of mine to read.I recommend this bad book to only the most avid readers of science Fiction and fantasy.I would not recommend it to anyone who has not yet read the book, as I have, and who does not have the book on hand, as it is one of the worst science fiction books I have ever read.The book is also riddled with spelling errors, which I thought was bad enough, but I thought that was the worst. There were no punctuation marks at all in the text, which is very bad because it makes the text very hard to read, and it was difficult to tell which paragraph was which.I understand that the authors are only human and make mistakes. The main problem with the book is that the mistakes were not corrected as much as the other mistakes.The good news is that there are a few characters who seem to understand what the author is trying to do, and I believe we will see more of them as the story progresses.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to do the entire book over and over just to understand how this book works. It's not that it's hard to understand, but there's too much information crammed in. The author doesn't even know if she's talking about women or men. And this is the same person who claims to be a sociologist 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has been out of print for some time. I am a former professor and I know how hard it is to teach a class without having something that is helpful and original. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There was absolutely nothing new about this book, it is all the same old material that I have read in many books, and the writing is horrible. There was no humor in it, the book did not encourage people to read any book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about a guy in his late 30s who's trying to find a girlfriend.  I'm not sure if it was written by the guy's girlfriend, or the author, because the book is boring and confusing.  He makes a lot of ridiculous statements and there is very little information about the author's life.  As for the author himself, he's not very interesting either.  Overall, this book is not worth reading, unless you're trying to get a good wife. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very long and quite a bit of useless information, mainly the only good thing is that it is available in many languages.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book, he argues for the belief that God is omnipresent in the universe and is thus able to influence everything.  He believes that this omnipotence can only be discovered by examining how nature operates.  This is a flawed way of looking at things 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book claims that a woman's voice has been lost to the male world of the past.  But, in truth, she has lost that voice to our world through the many years of her own life.  To be completely honest, I did not feel like the book was telling me a real truth.  It was a lot of speculation, much like a divorce:  I can see what they are saying, but the man and woman would not be much alike after all.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to wait almost two years to buy the book because I hadn't read it yet. I'm happy I finally did, but only because I had it in my list to buy on December 15th. It seems I was not the only one who didn't know the book existed until December 15. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are plenty of good books about music, but this one doesn't live up to it. I have had a good idea about the way jazz is created and recorded for a long time, but I haven't been able to put my finger on how it comes together in this book. I can't wait to see what's going to happen with this book, but the authors should know better by now. The first page of this book is dedicated to a list of a few of the jazz names which appear on the cover of the book. However, the whole book isn't based on these names and the names appear only in passing. The whole book seems to focus mainly on the recording of music, which is not my idea of the good stuff. As I say, this book doesn't belong to the genre, as it doesn't really explain how this music is created. The music that the authors present as good jazz is really something else, as I never found anything that really interested me in the book, which made it hard to keep reading. The fact that it's only 50 pages long didn't help either, so it's really hard to get a good grasp of the whole thing. I'm not going to say that this is a bad idea, as there's lots of good stuff in there and I'm looking forward to seeing what happens next, but as I said, it doesn the genre to do it that way, which makes it hard for me to write this review without giving the book a 5-star rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was poorly edited. She does not even seem to have taken notes when making the entries about a number of her ancestors. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book does not include a proper historical context, and it lacks depth of detail.  It is a good read for entertainment, but not for an serious academic study. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel the main points are all wrong. First, he writes that  I am a member of a Christian ministry in the  San Francisco Bay Area. Yet, the book does not indicate how  the ministry works, how many times he has spoken to people  with this faith, the time frame in which he has been able  to speak to them.  The book does  not indicate what would qualify one for membership  in the ministry.  If I were to sign up for a Christian church,  this would not qualify me.  I was in my late 20's and it wasn't until my 30's  that I began to fully appreciate the gospel message.  It is hard to imagine  a person becoming a member  of a congregation in this time frame 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book hoping for a positive review about good books. What I got was a negative one.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is good, but there is no evidence for why this character is being punished.  The character is supposed to be a good, kind person, and she is not punished?  This book is not recommended for anyone who has a negative reaction to negative or immoral tales. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't believe that  any author of this book  would have chosen to put a positive spin on  this story. I understand that the main character is a very strong person, but what  were they thinking when they wrote this story? It's not as if the character was some sort of strong character in real life 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you are looking for a short summary of what is going on in America, this book is for you.  The writing is atrocious, the research is so very sparse.  Very sad that this is the direction the nation is heading.  It is sad, but sadly very real 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the only one I've read that has the word "rape" in the title.  The sex scenes are so over the top it's ridiculous.  There is no realism and there are no positive messages.  It's an ugly book about  horrible people who are going to do horrible things to women 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the book that I have been hoping to read for years but no matter where I go or what I do, no one will let me have it. It's an absolutely horrendous story told in the first person, with absolutely no respect for characters or real life. The characters are not as memorable as one would expect, the story doesn't really have a plot and the characters come and go like flies, without a moment of closure 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written for children, and the examples were limited to that audience. Not much has changed since the first edition was published, and not much has been learned since the last edition was released. This book should only be used for children at the earliest age, not for anyone who cares about language. The language it covers, while colorful, is too simple and limited to the reader to teach. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The content of the book was poor and the formatting was bad. It would take you less than two minutes to realize that this book was not written with the purpose of helping the average reader. You will get nothing from the book except a lot of words and a lot less knowledge about the various different techniques used for the purpose. In short, I have nothing to learn from this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a long read. It doesn't offer much more than a general overview of Christian thought. It's more of a religious reference book than anything else. The content is not very compelling, and it lacks in imagination. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a general point, I don't find the Bible to be that accurate and I don`t find the Church to be to much different. I am more of an Agnostic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is really bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a total cluster. It lacks any substance. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is boring. It's about a couple of rich people in a hotel who are trying to get to the bottom of the mystery of why everyone is having their clothes ruined. This is all the way through the book. It makes no sense, and it's boring to boot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're interested in the history of the American Revolution and the founding fathers, and are also willing to listen to the "talking" parts of the book, this one isn't for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book has been in print for a long time, yet it continues to remain out of print.  I can understand that the author's life is not what it once was. She must have had a bad experience with an ex, but the book is not about her. The author's relationship with her daughter is handled in an unenthusiastic and unconvincing manner 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the worst 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is NOT the book to give your teenage son 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a classic of the genre. However, the writing is atrocious, and the story itself is extremely contrived. It is hard to believe that the author had any real understanding of the subject at all, let alone the time and effort it took to prepare it. If you are looking for a good story for young adults, please try a good book from a more reputable publisher. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is terrible. There is no value here. I'm really glad I read this book as a kid. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is like trying to read a bad dictionary through a bad paperback.  I've read a few books in my lifetime and this is one of the most boring and pointless. It doesn't even make sense that he would write it with the names of different countries in the world. The book seems to be filled with mistakes and incoherent sentences. I tried to put it down three times and I ended up with the book in my purse. But I understand that this is the style of language in which the book is written. For a book that claims to have been written in a different language I would expect to see the world represented and used appropriately, but this is not the case. If you want to see different languages represented in this book you must take the book with a grain of salt 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is terrible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is written for college students who need to take advantage of the opportunities in this book. I got through it with only a few pages left, but I still didn't know what I was supposed to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has been around since 1971, but it has not been updated. Most of the information here is obsolete, and the methods outlined are outdated. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book starts with a pretty standard chapter on the history of religions. There is not much else in the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a collection of anecdotes. Some are funny, some are not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a good book.  She doesn't even know what a good cookbook should look like.  It has no pictures and is very dry and boring.  I wish she'd write a good cooking book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The best part of this book was when the author tried to make her point by citing a few examples of good literature and writing.  Instead, she wrote a short novel with a good plot, but no real character development.  And while I did like the romance of the book, I didn't find much depth to it.  I thought the author was trying to do too much in this book.  She didn't seem to enjoy writing it, so that really annoyed me.   And it was written in an  exaggerated and confusing style that just made the book  silly.  There was just so much stuff that was missing from this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a waste of space, as far as I'm concerned, it's nothing more than a collection of quotations.  The only reason I gave it a negative grade is because I believe the author's ideas are more valuable than the anecdotes contained in these quotes.  I guess that's what you get with a collection 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have enjoyed this book for years, but it has not done much for me to date. The author does not do his research, his descriptions are not interesting, his arguments are weak, and his writing style is dull. It is an academic book, and the author has the academic credentials and the ability to write about the subject. He is too busy making academic arguments and giving scholarly evidence to support his views. The subject of his argument is a little too dry. The writing style itself is dull and the subject of the argument is too dry and abstract for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you don't know what this book is about, do a little internet research. It is NOT about the Bible or God. It was a book written by a group of "Christian" leaders in Africa to give a negative view about Christian beliefs and culture. The book contains a lot of negative views of non-Christians. The authors are very racist. This book has no place in a Christian environment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was the last thing I read before retiring from the field. It was so dry it hurt. The author has no understanding of what is going on in the field or how to market and sell this book. I would not recommend this book for those who have never even heard of it and would not even recommend it to those who read it for the first time because it was boring to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is just as bad as the rest of the books about people with mental disorders. I could never even find out who wrote it. It is written by a mentally ill person and his therapist, which is bad enough. But there is nothing to do with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had read this book before and found it boring. But the latest edition has some poor writing and does not have a clear introduction. It is written in the style of a school book: boring, without a clear beginning or end.  The only positive reviews I have read are from authors who have a strong background in the field and are not school   readers like me. I have never read a book as bad as this one. I give up 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book itself is very disappointing.  It is not helpful or interesting to find information about other religions and religious sects.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like anything in this book.  I'm not a very religious person so I couldn't relate to the concepts of the book. If I had to read this book again I would pick it up and see if there was anything else I could identify with. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only good thing about the book is the title. There are no photographs in the book, and they could not have been any more glaringly bad.  I'm going to stick with The Art of the Good Life 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is nothing more than a collection of anecdotes. As the title suggests, there is little research, just a collection to keep you interested.  I found it tedious to read the anecdotes that followed each other and had to stop reading after about four anecdotes 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is NOT for the faint of heart!  This is a very unromantic book and the only romance that occurs is in the first chapter.  The only character who seems to really be in love with anyone is Susan.  There are very few other characters who seem to have any genuine love for anyone else.  It is a romance that is a little too long and the characters in the book don't even seem to feel like they belong together.  A real book should have real characters in it and not just feel like it's the main character's life!  I did read the whole book and it didn't leave me with any feelings.  In fact, I felt like I was reading a diary or diary-like book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book. I didn in fact feel it was a bad use of time for my daughter, who has a much more varied interest in her favorite topic than she does, especially since she isn't quite yet old enough to comprehend any serious scientific or intellectual concepts. I felt her learning curve was just too steep for this book to really serve her well. I found it a little too dry and didn't find it very interesting. As far as I'm concerned, this is a bad way to teach a child about scientific matters. This book may very well give her some good ideas, but I don't think she'll be all that interested in reading a book that's so dry as to be a dead waste of time. There are many better books for her to read about that topic, or even for her in general. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would give this book one star, but it's not that bad, just the most obvious version of all religious beliefs. The best religion in the world is Hinduism, and this book is no help. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is extremely poor. The information contained in the book is not necessarily correct, and this was my experience. The authors did not care much for their research.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written by an American and does not reflect on Pakistanis.  The majority of the book is about the life of Osama Bin Laden.  It has little to do with Islam or Pakistani people.  This is a western mentality and the book does not have a positive point.  Even if Osama was a great man and his teachings were very beneficial to this country, it does not mean that the book should be ignored and ignored badly.  So much effort was put in to the making of this book and we should respect the efforts. The book could have been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you enjoy this book you should consider not reading it until you finish the last book in the series, The Dead: After the Dead. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title of this book may mislead the reader to the point that he is not interested in learning how to perform and perform like a professional performer, but it is important to understand the fundamentals of dance that is necessary to perform a beautiful and graceful dance. This book does not teach that.  It provides the basics, and if you are interested in dance you should study them 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, it is the first thing you learn about Islam when you enter the library. However, you do not learn much else from it. There is not a single chapter devoted to Islamic history or any of the religious doctrines of Islam. This book should never be used to raise the level of Islamic education 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The premise of this book is that there is something inherently evil about women. It seems to be a belief that women are born with a predisposition to have problems, problems which they can only escape through surgery or, more cynically, through birth control. In this book we get a large section of women, from teenaged to forty-somethings, telling the sad stories of the women who are still in their teens and early twenties, and who are either living with the consequences of their actions, or in fact, are living a lie. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think this is the best book to teach children about science.   It has no clear illustrations,  it has nothing in it about chemistry, physics, or astronomy  It's a book that only uses the word'science' when it is  talking about some sort of  demonstration.  It could be something as simple as:  It takes a lot of snow to make a big pile of snow  If you put a few sticks on top of a pile of  snow, that doesn't make a pile 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not entirely sure why the authors decided to create a fictional world with this book. The characters are very vague and don't match up with the main characters in the real world. In fact, it looks like it was written in an effort to write a good fantasy book that's easy to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst part about this book is the fact that the author talks about his own personal issues (sex, drugs and a general unhealthy relationship) which are only mentioned as ancillary aspects of the larger problem that is him. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as the only thing on Amazon.com that I could find. I can't believe the publisher actually wanted to be associated with this crap. The book is so full of bad information, it is obvious that this is a bad marketing ploy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book and it was not what I expected.  The authors use many metaphors, and have many ideas, but not much of them make sense.  In the end it became very obvious why this book was made.  It was meant to make a great introduction to the topic of money.  There are very few, if any, useful metaphors in this book.  I don't understand why it's in this way, since in reality, we just make money like we normally do.  They use a lot of interesting metaphors to sell their ideas, and they did, but they didn't really make sense to me.   That's why this is so pointless 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so pleased with the way the book was presented.  The story is the main theme of the book, so that was the most disappointing part about it.  It was so good that I could see myself reading it to my children in the future 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book only for one purpose: to justify using it as a textbook. I'm sorry for wasting my time with such an uninspiring book. Don't waste your time with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't even have a bad taste in my mouth about this book,  but this is what they do.  It's the book of a girl that has a relationship with a boy and his friends.  But what really drives the book is the author's obsession with her father.  She is obsessed with him, to the point that the book reads like she was born to be his mistress.  I would rather listen to a bad romantic comedy over reading this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most disappointing part of this book is how much it is biased against women. This book has little to no space for men to be human beings. The male characters are either villains or villains with a bad attitude. The women of this story just exist to be the victims, or the sexual objects of the men. If this is the most important factor in a book you want to read, then you're not reading the wrong book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is about the first world war. There are no quotes or observations from a real war. If you don't want to go down that path I would recommend the next book which is about Vietnam.I did learn quite a bit of information about the American military's conduct during the war but was not impressed with the actual stories.The story of a woman who lost both of her sons in the war is the story that gets me to read the next one.I found the book to be very dull and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have not read a good book in a long time, but the writing style seems like it's been written for a younger audience. The writing is repetitive.  I just could not see how the author could possibly be making any money out of this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A total disappointment to many people who have enjoyed his other works, this one falls far short of its title. This book is a glorified travelogue that features no original writing, and the most generic prose style 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, like many others in the area, claims to contain many facts, but the author fails to explain how he came up with the numbers he did. There are no dates given for anything. The author uses words like "unforgetable," and "inscrutable," which to me are the very antithesis of the word "fact." This book is a failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is over-the-top, and I find myself less and less satisfied with it. I still find it to be a good introduction to the author, who is extremely well-educated, but this book is not that for a first reader, unless it's an older person or an introverted person. It's the usual heavy book with lots of details, which you can relate to, but it has no depth to it. There's lots of good material to be found, but nothing worth your money or your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read many books on the subject of the Vietnam War. This one is the worst I have ever seen.  This book is a mixture of propaganda and factual stories, but has little to no historical information.  All the facts and numbers in the book come from the Vietnam Veterans of America, and nothing from the actual field research of actual combat veterans.   This one should be a required book in every high school, but is only available through the internet.  The story told is all about how the heroes were heroes because they got out of the way of the communists and got the hell out of Vietnam!  The book is not for people who want to learn about the truth of the war 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a bad and boring book, it doesn't bother me, but a lot of the other readers may find it boring. It's all about a woman and her son who go to the big city to pursue a relationship. She meets a nice guy there and he turns out to be a rapist and killer. What a waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're a beginner or intermediate writer you might be in for a shock.  The book reads like a textbook written by a grad student, so if you're already writing, this book will only waste your time and make your writing look like it lacks creativity.  If your already writing and you're interested in a refresher, I would recommend a different book.  This book is meant for the experienced writer.  I would give the author one star out of five 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so full of false information that it makes one feel very insecure for anyone who reads this book. I cannot believe that it is that easy to spot such  fake info and yet it seems like everytime we read about the evil evil creatures, it is a lie.I could not help but to read the book in order to understand  what was going on and it was very frustrating for me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the fourth of this series 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book only to realize it was just another one of those pseudo-sciences written by people who are not that educated themselves. This book is full of facts that you have to know to read correctly, and it was quite obvious that the author did not have much of an understanding about them or how they could be used in practice. You learn more in the first 30 pages than you would in a whole book by the time you get to page 500.The writing style of this book is the most unnatural one I have ever read. I was never attracted to this style when I read other books, and to this day I haven't gotten tired of it, even though I have become more educated. Even though I feel like I should have learned some stuff in the process, I never found out if he understood this aspect of the material.The format of this chapter makes it even more confusing as you have a few minutes to read one chapter then have to jump back over two chapters. And it doesn't do you any favors as you try to read through these chapters. The structure makes it really hard to make sense out of all of this. I had to take a break from this book and read a book by someone more experienced than him to see if the format was truly necessary.I don't recommend this book for beginners and only recommend this one for experienced people who want to do some reading before jumping into the real stuff. It was so bad that it made the first 10 chapters feel like a waste of time to read, even if they were important to the story line.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the book to be nothing more than a compilation of the author's opinions about various aspects of life. What a bunch of self-centered losers 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so poorly written and over dramatized that it is a big disappointment. However, the idea of being an outcast is fascinating to me, so I'm glad I enjoyed this book. But I will not be reading any other works of this genre, and I think anyone who loves to read and write should read this book if they are interested in a story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the exact opposite of the content that it pretends to be. The title is deceptive, because it implies the book is based on a true story 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am disappointed in this book, it really doesn't offer anything worthwhile and in many places it is repetitive.  I have been using this book as a self-study guide and this is the first book I read that didn't provide any insights.  This book will be useful for a good many people but not for the ones looking for insight.  It will appeal to those of us who are interested in learning how to become more productive and how to learn things but this book has very little value.  Instead of a good guide for self study, this book offers you a checklist for people who are looking to buy the book, buy the list, buy them all, buy all the list and not look for a real learning resource 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is written as if the author was talking to a young child.  There are no pictures in this book and there are not even any illustrations in the whole book.  It has no plot, no characters, no dialogue.  All the pictures are small photographs of the characters in various locations.  The book could use some editing to fix some of the grammar and spelling errors.  However, for a first book about a family who has adopted a child, this is not a bad title, but it needs some editing if the intended audience is to read it." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is in the style of a high school or college chemistry text. The science is presented in a very non-informative way and the text doesn't go into detail about any of the subjects. There is no real reason why anyone would read this book and that is the unfortunate part. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really couldn't give this book a positive review, as I did not see it as an essential reading for a first time reader. It did not seem that it was intended to help young adults to make the transition from college to working life.  It's too bad, because it was one of my favorite books, but it seems that it has lost the young adult audience.  As for those who do read the book, they would have to take their time, as the author seems to be more focused on her characters than on the story itself.  But the story would still be intriguing, as there was still plenty of mystery to the characters, while still keeping the pace brisk enough to keep the reader intrigued.  I do not recommend this book for the young adults, as it seems the focus was to write a good book, not a good story, which I found was a huge missed opportunity 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sorry to say that this is a bad attempt at humor with no point.  I'm looking forward to the next book in the series but this is not it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has not been in print for a long time, and is pretty dated. There are far too many false claims, exaggerations, and just plain bad information about the topic. The author has not provided any research for what he claims. He has never met a paranormal subject that he has not misrepresented to support his own points. This book is the worst of the bunch, and there is little I can say other than to avoid it if you haven't read it yet. If you have read it, go on, but if you don't read anything else in paranormal, then just move on. For a good book on the subject, see "Witches: A Biography". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not for any serious scholar of comparative religion. The basic points don't stand up to scrutiny. I was disappointed because it seemed like the author was trying to reach out to non-religious readers who might be drawn in by the interesting historical aspects of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has the typical issues I have read in many of the other   books that are available on the market. The most important is the lack of research of any kind. One of the major problems I have with the book is that there are many times when the research is not even mentioned in the text. It becomes almost like the author was only reading the book for the sales and not to write a positive review about 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is written in a nonstandard style, and the pictures don't match the text in any way 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure why I read this book. It seemed pretty dry to me. I found myself thinking, what a fool I was to read the wrong book! I couldn't figure out why I was thinking that. I figured that I couldn, but couldn't. So, I tossed the book and moved on. I even looked up  the author's name online, but I couldn' find any more information on him.  I would advise that you just stick with the original book, but then buy the sequel if you feel you need to.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I enjoyed the book so much that I even got my friend to read it too.  But this book is so far from interesting it's impossible to see how it could become a favorite of any readership 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm going to be blunt here  The book is about the American experience, as well as about women and the feminist movement. I can understand if you have a very specific subject in mind, but not if you want to write a general book about women. I felt that in the first half of the book the author didn't really provide any background information to what she was discussing. She went through the chapters in a matter of days, but there was no explanation of what she meant by some of her conclusions. I could have skipped some of the chapters, but I felt the book was very dry and very shallow 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a die-hard Harry Potter fan, so this is just one more reason why I'm not interested in the series 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is like the same book but with different names.  I guess some of you might like the book but not me.  It sounds like an academic book but it's not.  A lot of the information is outdated.  No one uses the word fat.  The book is filled with too much self-help.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The idea of the book is to draw the reader into a wonderful and romantic love story. Yet the story ends in a sad way: the only love story in this book is the relationship between a good-for-nothing, narcissistic, self-centered man and a good person with little to do with his narcissism or selfishness. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not see how this book is even called The American Dream, and the subtitle says it all. This book is a collection of stories about people in the developing world who are not exactly rich. I am not surprised this book has not sold very well in the USA, because it is far from being a self-help book. The people in this book do not really learn anything about how to better their lives, they just feel like they are the only ones with money and then they complain. That is all the book does. I was hoping for more stories about developing countries. Instead it is just a collection. So this is just another collection that doesn't really teach you any lessons. I just had to go out and buy the second edition which has been out in the UK for about a year now, because the first edition wasn't any good to begin with 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am not a huge fan of fiction as the title suggests.I am glad I did not buy the second book, as it was more of the same story 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about being a woman and it gives us too much advice. For example, how much more of her own self-esteem must we not buy into her delusions that we have some special power over her?  It would be more helpful if this book was written by a man who actually understands how to be a woman. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main argument is that the Bible does not say what it says. This is completely false, and most of the examples given are from the New Testament. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very poor book. The author is clearly not a true writer. The main character is never developed and the author never seems to know anything about the characters.  I would highly recommend this book to others who would like to try writing but fail. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed. The book is about a boy and girl on the verge of adulthood, about how they grow and how they develop. The author writes about growing up in a dysfunctional household but then gives the family more problems. She writes about the family's struggles to become a family, about making the decision to leave home, about the issues of marriage and divorce, about dealing with the father's depression and anger. I could go on but I think the book was not as good as it could have been. She could have given the family some more depth by going through their history or by discussing their individual problems. Instead she just gave them one big negative review. This was not a good book to read. It was boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I would recommend this book for serious study of this subject, but it is extremely poorly written.  The content is not presented in an accurate way and the authors are not well versed in the subject.  You won't be able to understand the content unless you understand the language they are writing in.  I would not recommend it for anyone with a good understanding of the subject matter 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not very well written. He writes very fast, he makes his points very quickly.  He seems to not understand that many of us are not familiar with the world of business. He often writes in a negative way. He does not provide a lot of personal information about the person he writes about 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is extremely boring. The whole book is written in a very monotonous manner that it makes it even harder to follow the story. There is no character development in this book and there is barely any plot development either.The book was published in 2001, so this is hardly shocking, but it's not much better than any other boring book published in the last 10 years. It would be nice if they would come out with a book about dragons, or some kind of story about an important character like Gildor or the Black Rider that we know from the movie.I'm not really a fan of the book and I think it would be very difficult to read this book for enjoyment. I would give it a C or even a D in the genre.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author did his research, not.  In one chapter, the author claims that the author was present during the battle of Guadalcanal, a claim which has no factual basis whatsoever. This is the kind of book that you can never trust. I wish the author had not chosen this subject and left out details from previous works of the same author that support the claim. The claims of the book are not only absurd, they are also contradicted by the fact that there was no combat during the Battle of Guadacanal. All the references to combat are taken from previous editions of the author's work. These are not my personal conclusions. It was a very expensive error for this book to be published by an author who is not experienced in such areas of history. Had this book been written by an experienced historian, this mistake would have been avoided. However, we have been taught that history is written by the winners. No one is going to read a book on a negative perspective if the author has chosen a negative way of describing events. In this book, all the fighting is seen from the perspective of the victors. If we are supposed to take a positive view of events, we should be looking for the positives. To take a negative view is not a very positive view, and I believe the author is guilty of this in this book. One reviewer of the original book was very critical of this approach, and was one of the very few who did not agree with the author. Unfortunately, this book has come out and it has now become a popular title among some. There are also many who believe that the book is based on a true story, and in many cases they are correct.  I have seen the title and image of this book on several bookshelves, including a book by Mr. Dillard in which the book has also been written. As such, I was very disappointed with this book because it was written by someone who did little to research the subject, but instead tried to use one war as his excuse to write the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is no evidence of anything positive or beneficial to be gained from reading these books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not enjoy this book at all.  She is not the first person to write a book about the New Age Movement, but she does a lot of the writing, so it doesn't really make sense for her to be saying the same things over and over.  There is also an obsession with occultist and "black" magic in this book.  These are things that are completely out of place and would make no sense in today's world.  The book's title, "New Age Movement" sounds like it was written for people who are already in the New Agers.  This isn't a group that is interested in promoting an occultic philosophy, or even the New Testament.  As it is written in this story, it seems like she is saying all of these negative things to gain followers and money.  What she is really doing is trying to change the entire world through her own actions, and that is not something that can be done by a person who doesn't have any actual experience in the field 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  In general, I agree with some of the negative reviews about this book.  The author did not even try to present some interesting information on the subject.  He simply used very old examples of various types of "sexuality" to explain the "sexualities" in a simplistic manner.  That is, homosexuality and transvestism, which are quite different phenomena than the stereotypical gay and lesbian culture.  It is true that there were studies of gays and lesbians in the 1970s which may have influenced the content of this book, but it is just as likely that he simply used the same old stereotypes to draw the conclusions he wanted to draw.  I am not even convinced that the author of this text had any familiarity with the subject matter, or even the facts he presented, and simply relied on outdated stereotypes to make his point.  This is not a very original concept.  In fact, one of the main reasons why this book was written was that the American Psychiatric Association did not recognize homosexuals as a "sexual orientation."  It did not make sense to this author to simply "out" the people he referred to as "homosexuals" in his text.  These people were simply defined by his own criteria as "sexuals."  I find this idea rather pathetic and very condescending.  What makes these "sexual" people "sexual?"  Is it the way they walk, or the way their mouths move?  Is there anything they are unable to do that is normal or even desirable?  This concept of "sex" is simply an invention of this author, and it is simply ridiculous that this author did this to justify the fact that this book is not even the first one written on this subject. It is obvious that he had no actual idea of what the subject was about, nor why it was important enough to bother writing a book on it.  Of course, there are people like him everywhere.  They can get away with it because society tells them what's normal, or as gay men say, "normal is the norm."  The majority of people simply accept this fact, or at least don't bother with any "research" on the matter.  Unfortunately, these same people refuse to do any real research on any other topic.  There is a good reason for this, because it is very, very hard to get honest information about the topic, because people are trying to sell you something, and most people who are selling you something don't
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was quite skeptical of the story and the characters.  I thought the book was going to be one of those that turned out to be  typical of what is out there.  The author did try to present his characters in a somewhat realistic fashion, but did not do enough to make the characters feel real.  Instead of using his characters to illustrate a particular theme,  the author used the characters to help present a certain idea: that of an out-of-control, destructive young man.  However, the more I read  about the young man, the less I felt like I was reading a real young man;  this is not to say that the young men in this story are not  out of control   The characters' relationships with other people, both women and men, are almost never discussed in this book.  When they are, they are shown in ways that are unnecessary or  distracting; which is why I cannot recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not recommend this book to anyone except the most hardcore of hardcore Tolkien-fans. It's not a good book, it's not very good. The prose is rather dense and it just doesn't flow. There's really nothing to enjoy in the prose. It doesn't have much to say, and as a result there's little to discuss. The author tries to have it both ways by saying he has an affinity for Tolkien and the story but that doesn't help him either. He can't make it work. He has to have Tolkien characters in his books. I'm not going to buy any more of his books, I won't read any of his short stories, I don't think he's even going to publish any more. I found his characterization of his characters to be one of the worst in all of fantasy writing. It really is a terrible book, and if you're a Tolkien fan you will not enjoy this book. The book was published in the seventies, you can't expect much from a book like that, and the author just doesn´t have much of anything to say. It is a shame that one of Tolkien's most popular books was not written by his own hand. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is nothing in this book that I liked about it. It was very repetitive. The writing style was not good and not easy to read. It kept me reading, but I would not recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for a book that could help me learn more about these topics: philosophy of language, psychology, logic, aesthetics, social sciences and many others. Instead, I got  a book full of errors and no useful information about these subjects.I feel  this is because  this was written by a professional psychologist who was not familiar with  these subjects, nor did he write this book with the same level of skill  as he did in his other books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am very disappointed in this book.  A large portion of it consists of quotes from non-fiction books, such as The Autobiography of a Yogi by Shostakovich, by Proust, by Tolstoy, etc.  For those of you who like non-fictional books, you will be disappointed with this book, as there is only one story, but rather than making the reader wonder what happened to the characters, the author makes the reader feel sorry for all the characters.  To those of us who prefer to read a novel, this book will provide very little entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed to find no information about the history of the "Cultural Marxism" movement, which was one of the major obstacles for me in accepting Christianity as my religion. All the information I found regarding the movement was written about in previous books, and was usually written by radical academics who were not scholars in any sense of the word.  This book did not provide any information about its opponents, such as the Traditionalist Jews, the Catholics, the Orthodox Jews, or even the radical feminists who were opposed to Cultural Marxism.  It is a good book to read for the "curious," but not much more than that."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The language is often not very logical, which means it isn't easy to follow. It's best to start with the first chapter 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book starts off right, introducing the readers to the concept of the "Buddhism" with the Buddha and his disciples, who are portrayed as extremely evil, selfish, lustful and cruel. The entire book is based on a series of dialogues between two characters (the wise, wise man-Buddhist, and the greedy and lustful woman-Bodhisattva) that is devoid of any depth or any relevance to the life of the characters, their personal stories or the real world.The characters that appear in this book are the typical, stereotypical Buddhist monks-in-training with the monks at the top of the hierarchy, who only want the perfect world for themselves and don't want any help or advice from the main characters. The dialogue between these two characters is full of stereotypical, lazy writing, full of clichés, and never once do the characters gain any depth in the book.The writing is so bad that it would be hard to give this book a positive review. I could only recommend this book to those who would like to read a dull, repetitive novel that is designed solely for entertainment, not for anything but the amusement of reading. If you are looking for a good book for a serious religious study, this book is NOT for you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping to be entertained by a story about a young man on the verge of love and marriage and then he goes to hell.  He had to deal with some serious problems in his life.  This didn't work out, and he ended up losing all his money and the woman he thought he loved.  The book is about love, sex, divorce, and more.  You'll like the ending, but not the whole story.  I can see why the kids loved this book because it was the only one of the three that gave them what they wanted.  It's too bad the publishers changed the story mid-way through the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't enjoy the book. The story line was poor and too convoluted to enjoy. The main character was too annoying. The characters were generic, no one felt like they were really likeable or likable. I read through the book four times, so I didn't even get to the end.  I read the book three months ago and was glad I gave it a miss then. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As someone who has been in the military for many years, I found the subject matter fascinating, and I found it to be an extremely repetitive book, one chapter after another. Not sure if I am supposed to agree with his beliefs, but it is definitely a repetitive book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed by this book. I thought it was going to be the opposite of the other books, but it didn't happen. I didn't care about the plot, and it ended up making no sense. I don't think the author knew how to write a book, but I wish he had given me more of a chance to read it. The characters weren't interesting, the world building was dull, and I was ready to move on 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was a good idea, but it was only halfway through. I can't say I didn't enjoy it, just that it didn't go as planned for me. I found myself getting bored of the book pretty quickly and had to put it down. However, if you want a good story to read or listen to, this one may be for you. The characters are all so one-dimensional and one-note that there's no enjoyment in reading about them, only hearing about them being in the wrong place at the wrong time. As far as I'm concerned, it is all too predictable for the story to keep moving forward, and I have to wonder why this author didn't take more advantage of the opportunities presented to him, as most authors do. I wish he would've gone into the more challenging parts of the story (like the characters in the second half of the manuscript), that are filled with new ideas and interesting characters. But again, I don't see that happening, because the story ends up being predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with unhelpful generalities, generalities of a general nature. It gives me the impression that there are people who read it who have little or no interest in Buddhism. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought it was terrible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the worst book   I have ever read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is The Book Of Unsolicited Letters: The Letters Of Unwanted Women to Women Who Refuse To Get One 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really didn't like this book, but I did learn a few interesting facts about the subject matter.  I've done a couple of research projects with my students, and this book seems to be popular for some reason, so I'll probably keep it in my bookshelf until my students grow tired of it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written with much too much arrogance and condescending attitude. If you are looking for a good book on a subject this is not it. The book provides many examples but doesn't provide any actual explanations of the subjects. For instance he doesn't explain why the Sun doesn't rise in the summer (why don't people in China and Japan know this?). He also doesn't give much context on the reasons for the change in seasons, and then tells us he will explain why. He also leaves much to be desired with his numerous examples of the change of seasons. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did read the book before writing this review, and I had no trouble finding all of the references I was looking for. However, even with the book's extensive indexes, I was unable to find the reference to the book he was discussing on the title page. There was no way I was going to buy the book in spite of his numerous reviews 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sorry, but it's the truth. I read this book for the first time a few weeks ago and I was utterly devastated. Not only is it a poorly written book, it also seems to be full of false information. I know that I've read a few of David Boleks books, but none of them gave me this kind of reaction. I feel that this is the last book that I will read in this series 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so bad that it is nearly impossible to relate to any of its characters.  The author has no real understanding of the human condition and it's all done to make the book more appealing to a broad market of readers.  There is one moment in the book where a character talks about being an alcoholic, but he then quickly tries to deny that he ever said anything about that.  This really is all about the author's own personal experiences 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book covers a wide range of topics, but you never hear about the book itself.  I got this book from the library and I'm going to recommend it as something not to be taken seriously.  If you're looking for a good book to use in college, that's great.   I'm not too bothered by the authors descriptions of the subjects, but that's about all I can take away from the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's obvious the authors had not read the book before writing their reviews. Most of the information was wrong about their characters. They also made some rather nasty accusations against their opponents and their supporters, some of which weren't true. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main problem is that I couldn't quite get the sense of any personal development from this book. There are chapters on her past life that make me want to keep looking for more information. Then there are chapters that seem to go on forever. I found this book really hard to read because I kept getting distracted by the information in the chapters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was initially interested in this book, but then it became much more boring.  The stories that are used to propel the book do not seem to have any real effect on the story at all.  A few of the characters do end up coming in to the story in a different way, but they end up being much more generic than the real people they are supposed to represent.  It became much harder to finish the book.  I'm not really sure how I feel about it, other than I'll only read it if it's a great book with a huge impact. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very bad book. Very slow paced. Very boring. Very much like a Disney movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a list of bad fiction and bad novels.  It has the same author's trademark style, and there is not much to write about.  I was surprised that they could not get anything right from a first reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with a lot of the bad reviews.   The book, as you say, does not even have a good storyline.  It's just a story of a girl that happens to have been in a relationship with the son of a famous writer.  As a child, I couldn't relate to that story.  For me, it was a story about how her parents' marriage failed, and how she took that failing and used it to her advantage.  But what made it worse was the horrible dialogue that the author had in the book.  The character that is the main character is a very annoying narrator.  He's always talking about what people think about her, and making inappropriate comments.  Then he tells her what to do and then goes to do it.  If the book was not so confusing, I would have liked it a lot more.  I don't know, there's something about the way she talks that has me off 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, no. You're not supposed to do that. It's supposed to be funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In a strange way, this book makes it seem like this world is full of good intentions but unfortunately the end product ends up being somewhat disappointing. I can see the positive intentions and the hard work being put in, but ultimately I would not have spent over 20 hours reading this to get some type of conclusion on how to live a more fulfilling life. I will keep looking forward to future books, but this one ended up being disappointing.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book has absolutely nothing to do with any of the events in the film. It tries to sell itself as the documentary of the filming, but it's a collection of reenactments with no relation to the film, no sense of reality, no plot. The film is the central point of the book, yet it can't be mentioned. It's a complete waste of everyone's time. There's no suspense in the reenacting. It becomes a pointless exercise in boredom. It doesn't give a clue on who to credit for what. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not going to spend any more time on this book.  The basic idea, for which this book is best known, is that God is real and the creation of man is an illusion.  This is not a very compelling book, and if you are looking for something to motivate you to worship Christ, I would suggest you check out the Bible. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author of this book is not really a history writer. This book is only about the period from the First World War to the end of WWII. It is not about the German-Soviet War, nor about the whole period from 1941 to 1948. It does not even try to write about the post-war period. It covers only the period in which Germany, Russia and the United States were the three superpowers. The author writes that it is the period during which Germany was the biggest power. But it is a very bad book, and not worth reading. There are just as many contradictions in the story that make it impossible to believe the author and that this book was meant for the serious reader. In short, it is very hard to take it seriously. I gave up reading it at the end and it made me angry that I wasted time on it and wasted money on it. I did read some other works by the same author but it is just as bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't agree with the reviewers who write:  "This book is horrible, with over-simplistic and unrealistic explanations about love, sexual relationships, pregnancy, childbirth, etc.  It is poorly written, and as I said, the way it is written makes it impossible to read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got this book because of the positive reviews and the fact that it had an excellent photo section. The text was awful, as was the photos. I was really hoping for a good photo book and didn't get one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was published many years ago.  This story is over.  I have read many of Robert Jordan's books, but not his collection, "The Eye of the World".  This collection is poorly written, and it's hard to believe that the author could write such terrible stories, but he does.  The author tries to hide the fact that this collection is a poor collection by giving it the title of "The Wheel of Time Series".  The "series" is not an accurate description of the collection.  It's as if he was trying to hide his bad collection by saying that it's not really the series.  But his collection is horrible, no way around that.  He tries to do his best to write good stories, and he tries.  However, the story that he tries to write is still terrible.   His writing style is as horrible as his story.  There is not a single good thing in the collection, other than the one that the cover gives.  If you want to read Robert Jordan books, I would suggest you wait for his book collection, the "Wheel of Time", which is published by Tor Books.  And you can read his other collection,, "A Memory of Light".  And his first collection, A Shadow of Self, is the only one I would recommend to anyone.  Jordan is one of the great fantasy authors.  His books are always entertaining, so I don't see any reason why one shouldn't buy Jordan's collections.  Perhaps it's because they are so hard to get, but Jordan is known for his hard to find and high prices.  Anyway, I'm not looking for the "perfect" book, but I do see a reason for Jordan fans to purchase all his collections.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the stuff that dreams are made of:  You are going to meet the most beautiful young women in the world. And you are going be in a lot of fights with them. There is no real storyline in this book, just some people talking about themselves. There are several scenes of two men being involved in a sexual encounter. At one point I found it odd to find out the main character's best friend was his girlfriend.  I didn't feel any of these characters were fully developed, so the author went through quite a lot to flesh them out. This was the worst part of the book. The other side of the coin is the fact that this book is full of stereotypes. The characters all seem to live their lives in an extremely stereotypical manner, even though the book is about them.  The book is riddled with a great deal of sex, violence, drugs, and  many other things that are unrealistic. The author tries to be clever, but the stereotypes that the book attempts to represent are just that, stereotypes.  It doesn't really matter what happens in the book, the stereotypes will all be there.  This is one of the most stereotypical novels I have read and it makes it hard to believe that someone can write a good book about people who are so stereotyped.  There are no characters that are truly developed or believable, so I just couldn't read the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about as depressing as it gets. There is nothing here to make you smile. Not a positive book and not one I'll buy again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book itself is not very good.  In a sense it is a bad sequel, as the story of the original story was told in the first book.  The second book has very little in common with the first, as most of the characters are in jail.  I don't really know why the book is called as such -  I guess they wanted to sell more copies, but it's very poor, and I can understand that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is too much about the  personality of a man. Not about the life. Just his  personality. I didn't feel like I got any real information about the family, or even a good introduction to the family. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the book to be very repetitive. The first couple of chapters were full of what I thought were great insights and insights into the lives of other authors. This is not the case at all. It was just the author giving short speeches about his thoughts. He did not give a coherent view of the overall story. He gives his opinion and then just repeats it until he's done. This book should be considered for a book club, not a book for general reading or general enjoyment 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is very hard to understand and believe that the Church leaders in the 1980s felt that this book would give them a psychological edge.  It just shows how the Church has grown and changed.  I don't know why you think it is the Church leader's way.  The Church leaders are the same today as they were in 1980.  They were just trying to please the members. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a good book. There are no scientific observations and the ideas are simply rehashed. It is just plain dull. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't imagine how anyone could take a chance on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read two reviews on this book: one negative, the other positive. The negative reviewer complained about the story:  The story is quite simple, which is not a good sign. I think the author is either a plagiarist or someone who has not written a book before. He writes like he's talking to himself. The story is not particularly deep and not very interesting to read. I found it repetitive and boring. I don't like the idea of a bad ending 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried to read this book several years ago and found it difficult to understand it.  I've only read it now and it's not clear what she's trying to do with the story.  Instead of exploring the relationships between the women in the story and showing the different perspectives that they present, she's making a series of quick descriptions that are not only cliched but also repetitive.  All the women have the same facial features, all of them are talking about the same thing (the same thing that has been happening for some time, maybe even their whole lives), and the relationships that form between them are also not explored.  It's very boring.  If I'd had any interest in the women of the book, I would've skipped to the end of the story where the characters meet (I've heard other people have said the same).  The women seem like interchangeable personalities and there's no character growth.  To be honest, if the book had been written by someone that knew what they were talking about, it might've been okay.  But that's just my experience 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was nothing but crap. I read it in about 15 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is the most boring story ever. I had to stop reading it to find out who was dying. The characters were stupid. The story didn't make sense. The setting was bland. The ending was ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not worth the time of your life!  The author shows a huge ignorance about the Bible and does not even know how to spell.  No matter what you do he just says that "Bible is the only authority about God."  The book is so riddled with contradictions it is difficult to understand.  And, he tells you how to make a fortune but never tells you what he is doing with all of this money or how to use it to help your children 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the last ten years of her life, her voice was diminished to the point that the reader could not hear her or remember what she said. She was a brilliant writer. She didn't understand the power of literature. She never learned how to write for the people. She wasn't able to let go. She wrote too much and it burned out too quickly. She used too many adjectives, too much adjectives. She wanted to write a romance novel about her young family and her sister's marriage. She needed a serious ending. This book isn't. It's about how the poor woman lived and died. It was nothing more than a bad biography about a terrible woman. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is the same throughout. I had a hard time following the book through the book. The only way to follow it is to read and learn the answers to the questions within the book; and in some cases they are not answered. It was very difficult to learn the answers to all the questions within the book as I had to do it. Some answers were left to be found within the pages as if they were not mentioned in the book At the same time, the questions were not answered Some questions did not have answers or were left unanswered It seemed like the author did not give any answers to his readers I would only recommend this book to people who have not taken a course in high school English I was looking for a book that would answer the questions and the answers I have been looking for 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the book in college and liked it at the time. Then I got burned out on the whole spirituality thing, so I stopped reading the book.  After reading a few more books by the same author, it became obvious that he wasn't interested in making it interesting to any of us.  He was just trying to do his own version of what the ancient Indians did in the middle ages, where they would walk around naked.  That's all there was to the book - some nudity and nudity.  It became very irritating for me to see the book not once mentioning the fact that the original Indians didn't do this.  They would go around in groups to perform rituals and stuff.  The book had some nice pictures, but it was too short to stay on my interest for the rest of the book, so it wasn't the book I was looking for.  I don't see why it wasn' t an abridged version, so that we could get more out of it.  There were some very interesting ideas in the book that I enjoyed, but the book itself didn't interest me.  If you like reading the Bible, you might enjoy it, but that's about it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with the same kind of drivel I've read so many times before. It seems you are not good enough to write about something that is important for our nation and for future generations. It is like reading about an obscure character in the book The Last of the Mohicans 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing that bothers me about the text is that it is written in a childish way. As an older person, I find that writing in this immature way makes it difficult to get the message across.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, I read the first two chapters and I was so disappointed. It seemed like the author was trying to have some fun here and she had a few mistakes. She tried to make the characters seem very different, even though we never met them, only knew their names. Her descriptions are quite detailed and I felt like I was walking through an old bookshop and looking at the old photographs.  She does make it easy to understand, but it was just a waste of time.  I would have preferred a better book, more concise, if it wasn't for the fact that I was already sick of the same old "bad boy" and "good girl" relationships.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is not an expert in the field, but simply trying to present her ideas and her perspective in a few words.  The examples of her research are presented in a rather vague manner.  Her reasoning seems to be that she has done her own research and found the answers to these questions, which seems to just be a cop-out.  I believe it was to help the reader in making a decision.  It is obvious that if she was truly knowledgeable about these issues, she would present her research in a more logical manner. This book is not what she claims.  Instead of an unbiased, objective approach to the subject of suicide, she is simply trying her best to present the facts with a lack of information and facts.  This is obviously not a good approach.   If she really cares about the truth and not a bunch of false statements, she needs to present a more coherent, thorough study on the matter.  Unfortunately, her writing style only makes it look like she is a little too close to the suicide problem.  That's the sad thing about this book.  A lot of the information seems to come from the book, not from the person.  She has only her opinion to offer in her book, which doesn't seem to be accurate.  If this was about her personal research, she should have presented some actual data to back up her statements.  In other words, she's trying to cover her tracks because she can't present the truth as she sees it, because she's too close with the subject.  There are a lot of examples of these issues in the book: The first example of the many instances of this is in a discussion about a child in the country's largest city.  According to her research, many children in this city have had suicidal thoughts at some point.  So, she feels that the suicide rate in the city is high.  Obviously, she has not done the necessary research, so she has no knowledge on this.  We have to assume that this is the issue she is addressing.  But then she goes on to explain the reasons for suicides in the child's life.  When she has asked a few children about their thoughts on the subject, she found that a number of the children were actually angry with their parents.  They felt that they were being controlled by the parents. The parent in turn felt that the child was out of control and that the anger was the way to resolve the issue
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought the text was so confusing that I could not understand a single word. It is a text that is not recommended for anyone to read, although the author claims it is for everyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a bad biography of a bad musician. You'd have to be in love with him to read this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I would not recommend this book for anyone who is not into historical fiction.  The main character, Edith, is introduced as a little girl who was in love with her grandfather but didn't have enough money to get away from home to join him.  Then she is introduced to a whole different set of problems.  She has trouble learning to use money and she is never satisfied with what she gets.  There is no real reason to read this book.  I have tried to read it twice but I never finished it.  It's a horrible book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a pile of bad literature.  If you're not a religious person, you're more likely to learn a lot about the bible from the chapters on homosexuality.  That's fine, but this book isn't worth it.  Don't waste your money on it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want to learn a lot about the history of the Church, don't read this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you read the title of the book, this is what you are going to be reading.  I was disappointed with the story line and didn't feel that anything exciting happened with the characters.  The book was very long and had numerous plot holes, making it very difficult to keep up with the storyline.  It felt very repetitive to me, like they were trying to repeat the same story over and over again, so I would recommend avoiding this book completely 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was the same as other  other books  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the most boring book I have ever read.  I could never get into this book because of the boring content.  It is a good book if you like a good story but there is nothing here to get you excited about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not what it was advertised to be. This book has been used as an instructional tool in many school districts throughout the nation for years. It was only at the beginning of the book that it was announced to be self-published. In a recent survey, it was found that only 20% of teachers were willing to purchase the book because of its price. The reason behind this is because it was not available for $25. I am certain this book would have sold far better if it had been self published. The author is very inexperienced in publishing. This is not surprising as she has been writing about cooking for years for various magazines. I would not have expected a book like this to have been self-pubbed. There are several more chapters that could have been included that could provide more value to the book and could have given it the edge it deserves. I felt the book wasted many pages and could not find any real value in the book. I also found that there was no practical use of any of the recipes for my family. The only other reason I was able to buy the book was because I was already planning a trip to Japan this year with my mother. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't recommend this book at all to anyone.  It isn't that the information in the book isn't useful.  I just don't think the book has any real substance.  The book is written in such an extremely dry manner that you feel you're reading a novel.  What is that supposed to mean?  I think it may have been written to attract new readers but I doubt they were actually interested 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  In short, the author states that the most serious problem of a relationship is a bad romance.  He has the sense to realize that a good romance can overcome a bad relationship, but then states in his conclusion that a bad, ugly, abusive relationship can not overcome a good, beautiful, loving relationship.  So, it is a terrible book and the author is completely out of touch with his own generation.  His advice can not be applied in real life.  I can not believe that a man who is in his sixties, and the father of five boys, could have such poor ideas about relationships, because he's never been in a relationship that failed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I liked the author's writing style, but it wasn't very interesting to read.   She was a poor student and therefore had to write a lot, and her writing style lacked energy and punch.  She tried to explain the book as a spiritual journey, but couldn't do it.  It just didn't flow.  The book seemed to be a bit overlong, but I would have loved to have gone through it all in one sitting.  I couldn't find much that was interesting about this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read a lot of self-help books, and this one was not one of them 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an expensive book and the writer could have saved time and money by adding a good synopsis of the research for the book. The author needs to learn to take a break from writing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you were considering buying this book, I'd recommend getting it on Amazon. It has over a hundred positive reviews, and the bad reviews have disappeared. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's obvious, by the way, that there was no careful editing and that the author's intention was to present the message in the most attractive way possible. What she didn't realize is that this doesn't mean she is the only one to do this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As I read this book I found myself repeating it over and over again.  I'm not sure why I even liked it, but at times I found the story so intriguing I just couldn't resist reading further.  The story is boring, the characters seem bland, the humor is almost nonexistent, and the author seems to lack the ability to tell a good story.  What a waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm just gonna say: don't bother with this book.  It's just a bunch of words.  I would have never even bothered to read a bad review if I had read a good book instead.  If you can't tell, I am a fan of bad literature.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book begins with a section called "The Power of Positive Thinking," which teaches how to think positive and how to feel good about yourself.  I am a self-help guru who has spent many hours teaching people about this subject.  The only positive thinking that I recommend is to make yourself a happier person:  Have more positive thoughts about life 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a good book, but it will not change the way you are in relationship with someone else. The author says he does this to help the person he is writing about overcome problems, and this is certainly the case, but not in the way he wants to.  I did not find his methods in this book to be helpful or encouraging at all.  Instead of taking his time to help his reader out with his issues, he tries to give him the answers he believes will make the problems go away.  Unfortunately, the answers will not.  The only thing this book did for me was to make me angry.  This will not help me.  If I needed to see my problems resolved or my relationship healed, I would not spend the time I needed for this book.  What I need is a true partner in life who is willing to help me learn to find solutions and understand.   So I have read this book twice, and I am not even close to having learned what I wanted to. But, I must say, it has not hurt my relationship in the slightest.  To those of you who will see that this book does not offer anything new or worthwhile, you are right.  However, you need to take a look at the other great books I have been reading lately. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a long-winded dis-service to the community. I would expect something from the author that would be meaningful to her community, not something that would only serve as a marketing ploy for her book. Instead, this is a very preachy book, that only serves as another way to market her book to a larger audience, and ultimately, that means that the books only serves to make the writer and the community even more rich. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the book lacking in quality. It was very disjointed to the point I didn't understand it very well. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was poorly written. The author had little to do with the research, which was all too familiar to a lot of us. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you want to understand the problems of the world, read this book, if not, then you don't understand much of anything.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author has many of her problems with the Bible.  The chapters that have religious references are written in a very poor style.  She uses biblical references as an excuse to make her point, which is to say that Christians are idiots and their beliefs are stupid.  This is the very definition of stupid.   The book ends with a lot of Christian bashing, making a statement that the reader is supposed to agree with, but which is contrary to the message of the book.  These are very sloppy and unsophisticated writings, and the author has no respect for her readers.  I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a good Bible lesson. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book did nothing for me.  It is a generic book of ideas.  I don't like books that are all about the same concepts: the same topics for each book.  So I didn't get the same ideas from this book. The ideas that came out of this book are a little weak.  The concepts are not original.  This is my second book, and I can tell this is going to be a difficult book to read. The writing is sloppy, the ideas are confusing, the examples are not good, the illustrations are not nice.   I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn a lot of technical information, but who wants the book to be original. For me, that just doesn't cut it. I thought I knew what I was reading, but I didn`t. It is written very well and the examples and examples make it pretty clear how to put all the information together. I don`t like that. I like things to be logical and understandable.I recommend this to anyone that is interested in programming.But if you want to learn only the basics and nothing else, then this is not a good book. I suggest you read the other books by the same author:The Basic Programming Course and Programming The Fundamental Techniques. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would give this book the lowest rating because it is full of grammatical errors and misquotes. If you're looking for a good book about Buddhism to read, buy some other 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book opens by asking, "Why is this book on the shelf? Is it to tempt a young reader into the world of fantasy and the occult?"  If this was a true story, I would have skipped the introduction, and skipped right to page 40 when it is time for the heroine to visit the occult. It was only when I finished the book that I realized that the author was not taking this book seriously at all.  The characters' actions seem to defy logic and reason, and it's impossible to know what is happening without reading the text.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read it because I have a lot of time for reading. But I wasn't impressed by the contents.  The author talks a lot about things like what he eats, drinks, does in his everyday life, but there was no substance about the books. It was just something that kept popping up and not a lot more. I don't read many nonfiction books in general, and I didn't buy the author's book because I thought that would be what it would be about. Overall it wasn't a good book. If you have time to read something about this guy, do it, but maybe read it for entertainment purposes. The book doesn't really talk much about his own life, and that's fine. Just get a book that says what his life is like, and how it relates to what you might be looking for in a book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a person with some knowledge of the early LDS church and all things LDS in general, I wasn't sure I would like this book as much as some others 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are a few things in here I agree with - there was a lot of bickering in the last half of the book between two of the authors - especially when it comes to his own family. It's one thing for you to write about your personal life with a bunch of your friends - it's quite another to write that same book about a married couple. The fact that the husband had a son with a mistress is a big part of the problem, and yet somehow he's the one that has to be the responsible one? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the last of the books that I bought from this author. The last book  I bought was 'The World as I See It'  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The authors have nothing new to say. Most of the quotes were taken directly from others, some of which I have never read. They are repetitive, boring, not well thought out, and not original. This book is very overpriced, with an outrageous cost of $24.99, compared to the price of the book itself, which is a little over half of that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought the book was really horrible. It made me think about how I was going to make myself better so that I would have the courage to change my bad habits and change my life.   It was all going to be fine if I just didn't read it anymore, but then I got home from work, I was about to turn my computer on, and I see the book I was reading.  The book was about how to get rid of depression and my first thought was that   it was terrible. I don't recommend  this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The worst part of the book was the ending. It has nothing to do with the subject matter. The main character has a tragic backstory and the ending is a complete copout. It's disappointing because it's supposed to be about his relationship with his parents, not about his past. I've read some good books on the subject but it was just a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is an attempt to provide a narrative history of the New Testament authors and their influence on world culture during the first century A.D. Unfortunately, it only takes in a few lines at a time. The result is not much more than a series of paragraphs about famous events and important historical figures of the age, with little emphasis on the New Testaments authors. Unfortunately for the authors, this means that they are constantly having to change their stories and characters to keep them relevant to contemporary issues. The best they can hope for is that readers will ignore any inaccuracies in their account, and simply skim through it with a few notes to make it the story of a young woman's journey through life. For the most part, the authors do a better job of hiding the errors they have made by not printing them. However, if you are interested in the subject, you might be better off reading the Bible itself, because the New Tests' account of events is extremely limited. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to take this book out of the library after a short reading.  While it was entertaining, it also confused me.  I am looking forward to it's next re-release, but I would not recommend this book for any readers.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hate this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sure I'll end up enjoying some of her other books, but this one just has so many problems. This book is too long, which means that most of the characters won't get to the end of the book, and in the end it feels like there are no endings.  The book is full of unnecessary sexual innuendos and descriptions of sex, which makes it feel like a porno book, rather than a science fiction novel.  I understand that there's a lot of eroticism in the book -- it's definitely a fetish novel, but I think that there should be more depth to it.  This is the longest book I have ever read in this genre, but it seems to end too soon and the ending is unsatisfying to me.  Overall, this book is a bad read and you'll want to skip it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, it's a book of fairy tales. It may have been well intended, but it's so shallow that you can easily write an entire novel about it, but that's besides the point. It's shallow as heck and I don't see what it has to do with writing the next great book in the fairy tale series 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so dull and boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a compilation of random articles written for the purposes of selling books and making money.  There are more than a few pieces of bad writing in this book.  It will not help the author's cause to write about  the badness of others.  I have to agree with the review below:  "The first part of the book, entitled The Art of Living and Selling Books, is about selling books.  The second part of this book, The Art Of Creating Books, consists of selling your  books.     These sections are written in such a way that you become convinced that  you are already famous, and this book is a way  to make money.   The title of the first part is  "What You Need to Know About Selling Books".   The book begins in earnest as you discover  what it takes to sell books. I was  disappointed with the first half of the story.    I was expecting a different story here, and I wasn't  happy about it.  You might find the second half entertaining, but only if you  like to read long stories about selling your books  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has been used in a many ways. The idea of the life of a lonely man is taken out of the equation. He is simply a person who lives in his house alone and tries to make friends and keep his heart open to people. He doesn't even remember his past in the Marines. He lives alone in his small California town. If you're looking for a good book, you should look for something else. This is one of the worst books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is absolutely no research in this book. What little research is done appears to have been done for the sake of the cover art. There is no source material presented in the book. There are some quotes from other people's books, which is fine if they are cited properly, but they don't do enough to show any support for her claims. The information is given in the form of summaries and case studies. This book is simply a collection of anecdotes. There was literally only one case that I found interesting in the entire book. The case that Ms. Hines is using is a very recent one, and it appears to be the only case she has done. In the rest of the cases, Ms.Hines gives no source for any of her claims that she has studied. The book ends rather abruptly, which gives it no sense of momentum. The only time she is truly given credit for anything in the rest the book is when she offers a quote from an old newspaper article that she found very interesting. I cannot recommend this book to anyone. It will certainly confuse you, as it did me, but only for the purpose of turning you away from anything of substance that she had to offer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I felt this book could have been much better.The plot line was poorly conceived and many of the questions were impossible to answer.There were no supporting characters and the main character was illogical and very unsympathetic. It was a very uneventful novel that could have gone far better with another writer.This is the worst book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not like the book. This is why you cannot take it as   life skills or anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't see myself buying this book again. It's about as shallow as I thought it would be. It makes you want to buy the first book in the series, which is not a good sign for a series. This book doesn't have anything interesting about it - it's about the author's love of writing about characters. I thought the characters would be interesting enough, but I didn't care for them. The author tries to write about all kinds of characters, but it's really hard to keep your interest. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the content of this book to be lacking. There was little in the way of stories for me to enjoy. Most of the book was simply telling the reader about how people in the past, and in the present, look at the past and the future. This was the weakest part of the writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, as many others, is poorly written and makes no sense.  The premise of the book is that we are in the middle of a terrible recession but the book only talks about people in the United States.  This would be fine if the book was only about the United Kingdom but it is not.  In fact, it is about a lot of different countries and regions around the world.  If you are a Brit or just care about the US, then you will find this book to be boring and confusing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't find anything new here, as the author seems to have done it all before. It's hard for me to imagine any serious student of this field reading this book to any greater degree than a one-time exam/exchange in college 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to buy this book again and again because I kept having to read the same things over and over. I can't say that I enjoyed all the stories. In some of the stories, there are scenes that I found difficult to watch. I was expecting the romance in this book to be much more evident. However, it was lacking, which I found disappointing. I'm hoping that the author will be able to add more scenes to this story as I continue reading it. It's not much of a book, and I didn't feel any emotional attachment to any of the characters. I found it boring, and that's about the only positive review I can give about this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a great example of the'my way or the highway' approach to spirituality. It is so easy to just stick to the book and follow the rules, but this approach doesn't do any favors to the spiritual journey. We need to be able to be flexible and do things our way as needed, not just follow a single path. We also need to have a strong faith and not get caught up in the'spiritual battles' so much of the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, this book was meant to provide guidance to help parents deal with the   negative effects of divorce, especially the impact on the children.  Instead, it is  just a list of stories with little to no guidance 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What happens when your friends are friends with your exes?  She tells lies about me, she lies about my children.  How could I make friends with someone who lies about family 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not like this book, it was so full of false information. It really does not tell you a lot about anything. It's a book about sex, that's it, and that is all. The only thing about sex in this book that is helpful is some advice for the guy who is having sex with a woman he has just met. He seems to have some knowledge about her, but not very much. There is nothing about how to do anything with her. The book itself did not even make me want to read the next one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was horrible, and it was the book that my son and I read together to try to pass time while my husband was working in another city. I didn't have much patience for this book and we ended up giving up on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be one of the worst 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It has the typical stories of young people falling in love with their dream cars and spending money they don't have.  However, most of the stories are based on nothing but stereotypes and unrealistic scenarios. It is hard to believe these stories are real because they are so obviously written to make them seem that way. I don't know about you, but I would much rather have an actual book about something I am interested in. The stories are shallow and the plot doesn't follow any form of logic. There is no emotion or tension to the story, only the occasional slapstick humor. And, as I have said before, these stories seem to come from the mind of a 13 year old boy. What kind of 13 year olds are interested in having a story about a love interest, cars and shopping? I can't even begin to tell you how hard it was for me to finish the book and read it through twice because the stories were so unbelievable 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in English and it was only the second book I read in English, but I hated it. The first book was much better but this one was not.  I did not recommend it to my friends and they all hated it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It has not been a positive review for this book, but I find it all but impossible to believe that the author could have not realized that the title of this book was somewhat misleading. The book is not about a person who seeks an honest life. The man on the front of the book is very much a personification of a narcissistic and abusive relationship. The story is as much about this man and his friends as it is about the woman in his life. In a nutshell, this book is about a man making a complete 180 in his attitude and behavior after being separated from his wife. He loses his identity, his power, his money and his self esteem. He is now a victim of his own selfishness, fear and anger. It's not even clear if he actually believes that he is not a victim in this situation, as he clearly states in his book that he believes that the relationship is not even worth loving. The end of the story, at least as far as I could tell, is that this man is in jail and is trying to find a way to heal and regain his self-confidence. As it goes, I don't really believe that this will ever happen. But the way this book ends makes me think that it will not, at all. The ending is completely unsatisfying, as the story seemed to be about his finding his inner strength. He couldn't find it in his relationships. He lost his identity as a person. He was in prison. He could not find his self. He found that his love of the world was simply to keep him from losing himself. The main theme of the first part of the novel was about the need to find yourself in relationships, as I have discussed in my previous reviews. The final half of the manuscript was all about the relationship between this man, and his wife, which of course, is what the book ended up being about. I guess that the idea of having a relationship with a woman was of no interest to this man in his final days. I think he realized that he was just a victim, not a perpetrator of a bad relationship. It seems that he finally found a way out of his self pity and self loathing, but not enough to truly gain back his self sense. The last sentence in the book, which was supposed to be the real reason for the novel, is the final nail in the coffin for this man. I find that it's too bad that this novel ended in such a bitter way
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like much of what I read in this book, mostly because of my experience with a number of   books written by the same authors in the past, and for the same   reason: the authors' own descriptions.  What is not mentioned is the fact that the   environment and environment conditions in which the people live has little to do with the conditions that these   people are dealing with on a day-to-day basis.  They live in a world of constant conflict,   often caused by the desire of individuals to either control the lives of others or by the need to seek   for greater self-expression. The conflict that these people are  dealing with must also include a variety of psychological   issues, which I did not understand or relate to. I certainly was not  satisfied with the answers that the authors give 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was published by Random House (who has since discontinued this series). The author was a little too eager to jump into some of the more recent paranormal genres, which I wasn't too fond of. It seemed like he wanted to be the next Stephen King

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is really about the author's personal experience, and it doesn't say anything about the quality of the science. I found the science to be quite poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about getting pregnant to have a child. I read the first chapter about how to get pregnant but it ended up as a boring and boring story.  It's not like that the other pregnancies too.I'm glad that the author has written a positive review about it. But still not something to write a positive book about 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of nonsense and is very difficult to understand. In other words, it is not the work of a serious student of the subject. This book also contains numerous mistakes and the author provides some very bizarre explanations as to why his subjects seem to have all sorts of mysterious powers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a collection of short essays written by various authors, but very little of the book was about actual writing. There was no actual writing or style. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete disaster. I thought it would be good, but nothing could be further from the truth 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As the title states, this book is the story of a young boy named Ben who is about to start school. Unfortunately, the book ends before the start of the first semester. The only thing that happens is that Ben's friends are all running away from his home. As he has to deal with this situation, he's distracted from his studies and struggles in class. This is only the beginning. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't understand why the author would try to write anything remotely close to the truth about the subject of Scientology 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If this were about a fictional character and not about a real person, this book would have been fine. But it isn't.  It's about a young boy, and the things he wants to do:  I don't see how anyone can take away a book from a young child.  But you can't say the same thing about many of the other characters.  The other characters don't act out.  When they do, it's usually only to cause the characters to become more miserable and angry.   I didn't like these characters.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the second edition of the book, and this is the first of the many errors 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  In the beginning she talks about her interest in the life of an African-American woman in the 1950's. She talks about the negative reaction she received from many of her fellow African-Americans. I did not learn any of this from this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're going to buy this book, you're better off going to the library, or finding a friend to buy it for you.  It doesn't do anything particularly well 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a great book if you're looking for a deep dive into all of the stuff that was going on in the early years of the 20th century.  But the more you read the more it just starts to feel like an encyclopedia with only the most mundane topics covered.  I would not recommend this for the first time reader or for the novice to any of the fields covered 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author doesn't know much about this subject.  He's interested in making some money and does some interviews, but the book is mostly about his personal life.  I found his personal lives to be as shallow and boring as those of the average American.  That's why I don't recommend this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book itself is full of nonsense, false facts and half-truths. If it was written by someone who is qualified, it would be one of the better books out there 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed to see that the majority of the characters were white women. I read a good review that pointed out the similarities between the two books, so maybe she wanted to address the diversity problem. I agree that this is a problematic book, but it is not as problematic as the ones in my book club. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book reads as if it were written in the 1950's. I would not recommend this book to any young reader.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was full of inaccuracies and omissions, and the writing style did not do the topic justice. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a compilation of the main problems with the modern philosophy of education:  There is nothing in this book that addresses the needs of a child in the modern world. It just doesn't seem to fit into the education scene.  If it did, it would be a must read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is another book from a self-proclaimed professional.  She offers no advice of any kind, but rather offers a collection of anecdotes, which she believes will make you rich.  The only interesting thing about this book is that it is being promoted for its sale on the Internet.  It is NOT being offered at local libraries or bookstores.  However, if you are buying a book from the local bookstore, I recommend not buying it on the internet.  I purchased it at a bookstore in New York, but when I came back it was gone.  Why would you buy a book on the Net?  Instead, buy one from the store or go to the library to get a copy to read for yourself.  Don't buy it on Amazon. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a typical book of the religious variety which is full of false teachings and meaningless stories.  The author claims to be a teacher and when in actuality he is more like an attorney.  He is the author of a new book titled: "Why I'm a Christian" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave the book to my daughter who had already been through several of the books. She didn't like any of it. The girl was 13. I gave her the last one. She told me she liked it but that she didn't want to read it again, and that was it. I'm embarrassed that I put her through this." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the second version of a similar book: "The New Essential English Words: A Complete Guide for Beginners and Experts" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish the authors were smart enough to realize this is a problem book.  It's a self-serving book and it was very poorly written.  The end of the book is the "end" but the beginning of the story is the beginning.  This is a horrible book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of errors. A woman writes about her first orgasm while she was still nursing. She calls it the worst orgasm she ever had. And then when she describes how she came to have it, the book says that the woman did it only for 30 seconds and didn't even climax for a few hours afterwards. There's also this whole section about her father's penis, but the woman herself never mentions her father and never actually experiences her father having sex. She just has to do it in her imagination. She never mentions being in love with her father at any point. The rest of the book is filled with descriptions of sex that she's never had, including descriptions of her mother's vagina and anus. I found it very confusing and hard to read." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was quite disappointing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is based on an interview with a woman who has done the impossible, taken on a new life as a transgender woman. The woman is named Lainie, and she is also the author of a wonderful book about her life.   However, the book is not particularly inspiring or entertaining, as the author repeatedly goes off topic, and the woman herself is either a complete non-entity or extremely boring.  The interview segments with the two characters do not really showcase anything beyond a few seconds of awkwardness and monologue, and there are several scenes that have no relevance to the story or the life Lainier has lived.  I was honestly disappointed in the book, especially considering how many good books I've read in the past. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read and enjoyed a few of her other books, but this one is the worst 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is useless. This book teaches you the wrong way to do things, it teaches you not to have opinions, it uses language  like  "We do not need a political party. We need to be united,",  but the one political party that was going to be the answer to the   problem was the Green Party. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has nothing to do with the subject matter, it's just the author's opinion about women. The book's contents is so full of sexual innuendo, it seems there is a whole chapter of "What  to do if a woman   doesn't want to sleep with you?" I mean, we're talking about people's bodies here, not   the way people treat their minds 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's quite possible that the reviewer, a long time reader of this book, was not able to get a grasp on the content of the book. The book seems to have been written for the newbies in the romance field. I couldn't see what the big deal was. The only thing I found very annoying was the constant references to her "sister" in the first half of the novel. And even then it wasn't that bad, if you consider the fact that he was dating her while she was in college. However, the rest of the time she was only mentioned in passing. He was supposed to be her father, and she just became his girlfriend for no reason, and his fatherly role was only to act as a catalyst in their affair. And that's the sad part of the story: the book was supposed as a sequel to their first novel, and that's why he got her pregnant. He only did that to keep their relationship alive after they separated. So he has to put his relationship with her to one side to take care of her child. It's the same with the rest: the first book was the big story, the second book only gave background information about the events leading to the birth of their child. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's full of bad quotes. It's very annoying and boring to read and I am not even sure why this book is being published as a children's book, but no matter the reason, it makes for a very boring read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is about the same thing, an overabundance of bad information.  The author makes it seem like the "evidence" is in his own hand.  Unfortunately, it isn't.  Most of the books in this series are full of errors.  So, if you're looking for the truth, this one is not for you.  This book has been around since I was a kid and people still believe it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has been on the market for the last ten years. The publishers just give a big bad review for not selling, and I do not know why 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not care for this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most  negative review  I can give this book  is that it was written in the 60's when things were very different.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a joke. I have written many reviews and this is one of the worst 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this was an interesting read, but the author seemed to have forgotten most of the events in the book. We all knew about those incidents, but this time around, it seemed like the events were added at the last minute. We ended up reading about the events of the 1990's and how those events are related to the events that took place after the book was published. I felt the author never recovered from those early misfortunes and we never got to see any resolution for these people. It was very boring to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Too much of the story revolves around a love interest. There's not much character development, and the main characters are too similar to have any real differences. Also, the main character's name is only mentioned once or twice, which is very lame. Overall, I'm not sure what this book was about, except making sure you have a lot of sex scenes in your novels 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is clear to me that Dr. H is not an experienced neurosurgeon. She is not a competent practitioner and is not as informed as she needs to be in order to make appropriate diagnoses. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is bad. It's full of  silly jokes, it doesn't even include a true story.  I found the book, the story is there, but it's not as true as it could be.   There's not even enough space to read the whole book, it's really just about the story. The story has a whole lot more meaning 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not what the title says: it's a long, repetitive series of historical anecdotes, anecdotes and stories. Most of them are not very interesting, they lack logic and they're too much about how the people lived. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If the writer was trying to get his readers to read this book, then I would say he missed the boat entirely, not to mention the fact that the book is the least funny book I have ever read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The premise of this book is that everyone has a negative attitude about life   but no one has an attitude as bad as this one.  This book is nothing more than a negative collection of  stories about  people who have negative attitudes towards life.  You can see how they use these  negative stories to give life advice to their own negative attitude.  To me, that's a very poor approach to life 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a huge disappointment.  The author doesn't seem to have any experience with writing and there's no plot to speak of.  I would give this book a one star if it weren't for the fact that I really liked it as a young adult.  It seems the author simply reads the plotlines of other books and decides to write a very strange story about a bunch of kids who have lost their minds 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really hope this book was written by a 16 year old girl and she wrote it for herself.  The premise of the book is a boy and a girl go to visit their parents for the summer.  They arrive at their house and are greeted by their parents, who are both drunk and are acting very rude and strange.  It is all very confusing for the reader, and I found it very difficult to get into.  Instead I simply enjoyed the story, and enjoyed the characters, but this was not the case for me.  I found them to be incredibly stereotypical 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the book to be a little boring and repetitive. I'm sure the author had fun writing it but the book doesn't flow as smoothly as she likes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It took me hours to finish reading this book, but the stories in it did not seem to connect with me.  The stories that were most intriguing were the short stories from the book, which seemed to be written by different authors.  And I felt like I was trying to find the author of one of the short story's.  All in all, I didn't enjoy the book too much 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a horrible book. The whole premise is ridiculous. The stories in the first two thirds are all about a woman named Betty getting her head beat by her ex-boyfriend, but it's never stated that this is a sexual relationship. It's just a stupid, stereotypical story. I tried to be positive about the book, but that was not the case. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not like this book. The language was too difficult and too complex. It was more like a college level textbook and it lacked any depth. It really is a very difficult book to read. The illustrations are pretty good. They were made out of old photographs. The author spent way too much time writing about the past and the future. I did find a few sentences about the present, but not very much. I would never buy this book again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I feel sorry for the poor writer who wrote this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't know if you've read this book, but it is a lot like a bad sci-fi movie.   This book is full of clichés and  clichéd plots.  What a terrible idea to write a book  that features zombies, which was already established in other books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written over twenty years ago. The book's title is the same as the film, and it is the only book I have seen with this title. This book is a terrible and inaccurate portrayal of the Christian faith.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was hard to get into and the author could have done a lot better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The premise is that one day, in a dream, the sun shines down on a house. It's a lovely place. The housekeeper is sweet and kind. The owner is not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the interest of being clear: the authors (the "susan" of the book, if you will) don't speak at all about gender, and the writing itself is painfully cliché. This book is nothing but a series of scenes with the characters' genders changed. You will get to see the character's backside and butt cheeks, but there is no way this book could be read as anything but a love-struck lesbian romance. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an interesting book, but it is far from a helpful guide to understanding how the media works. I found the book to be incredibly boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish this book was about the actual event. It is all about the research done by the authors. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title of the book  is misleading as it is a book on the lives of the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but not the full range of the church's beliefs.  This book is meant to describe the lives of some of these   people but the life it attaches to is very limited and the person the book attached to wasn't a member of the Mormon faith in any way.  It wasn't a true Mormon as I understood the term I thought it was a Christian person writing this book as if that was the reason they were interested in Mormons. The people in the story were either followers or leaders of   different   faiths in the church.  I   felt  that the people in   this book were in fact   members of Mormondom's fullest   faith I would  never say the  author knew Monson's religion better than I did as the information that was given was limited to the church's official believing members and there was nothing more than that included 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is the only book on Scientology  that I have ever  read, and it is in fact so bad  that it makes me doubt  whether Scientology is even true.  The only positive thing is that the author does  manage to make some good points about the  real world  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has some very bad examples of the subject of this book.  The book has nothing to say about the personality of the victim of abuse, nothing about what the author's motives were for writing the book, and no understanding of the nature of human relationships.  There is almost no information about the book at all.  I can't recommend this book, as I have found that it was only available through the internet and only on this book's official website which is at: http://www.craig.org/
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book in the second edition. It is still quite good, but not as well illustrated and detailed as the first edition. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book that is full of bad jokes, that doesn't even make sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As if reading the bad reviews were not bad enough, I read the first few pages of the book, and was disgusted. The characters were horrible and the author, I believe, just wanted to make money out of the fact that her book was selling poorly.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought the stories were a lot less realistic in this book. The main character, who is portrayed as being intelligent and attractive, is the complete opposite of both. I did not like it. The author should be criticized for her poor writing skills. This book was a total flop for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think the author ever considered  any kind of historical research to substantiate her claims about the origins of religion. This is what makes this book such an embarrassment. Her claims about how Christianity is unique are completely unfounded 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an insult to all men. Men are not equal to women 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As someone who has read numerous other works of fiction by the same author, I have yet to find a good story in The Long Sleep. This one is much too short, and it doesn't feel like the story is being told very well, or at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains an abundance of the author's opinions, with little in the way of constructive advice. She is just another in a long line of authors with little to no knowledge of the real world. She offers only opinions of her own that her own personal experiences and experiences of others make her believe. She has no idea how she can make her own life better, and no idea that she is not the only one that lives it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In my opinion, the text is the most boring part.  In the end it's all about the photography 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I felt this book could have been done better by writing from a person's point of view, especially since most of the characters are not of the same ethnic background. I don't know what the publisher thinks they are selling with this book, but I found it to be extremely difficult to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was very poorly written and very out of place 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not a book for students, I have read and enjoyed many of these books, but this is one of the worst. It is written in an academic style and gives very little detail about the subject matter. The writing is poor, the book doesn't seem to want to be a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As is common in books written in the style of contemporary  autobiography, there is little or no substance to the writing of the book, and little of interest beyond superficial fluff. I would recommend this book only to those who have not already read a plethora of memoirs. The subject matter and style does not make for compelling reading, and the book itself is an extremely dull read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about two girls who meet and fall in love.  In the first chapter, the author talks about the couple's love story as they try to find a place to live. In the next chapter, they meet a cute boy (I think it's a boy named Andrew, but you never know, I'm a loner) and they fall in each other's arms.  After that, they get in a big fight and decide that this relationship is not going to last.  This story never ends and, the book ends before the girl gets to meet the boy.  I know this book sounds like a romcom (no offense, it is, and it's about a guy, but they're not romantically involved in any way) and it certainly is (in the last half of the book, they even get married), but it's not the main character. It's more like a love triangle, but there's no real chemistry. But that's my problem with the book. You don't really get to see these characters interact in any meaningful way, and the romance doesn't make any sense. The author tries to cover his bases by putting the two characters in situations that they wouldn't normally be in, but the characters don't have any real feelings for each other. I'm not saying it's bad, because you can definitely see a lot of potential for a good romance with the characters, but it is a very disappointing book overall 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I have ever read. The writing style is very dry and there is nothing that could not be done in a simple book: a picture, a paragraph, a story.  This book has nothing to do with a book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book contains many errors, wrong facts and outright lies. It's a good story but I am very disappointed to see the authors continue to misrepresent what they know about climate change and man-made global warming 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is over 300 pages long and you don't get any real insight into the mind of a child. There are too many pictures, words and illustrations, you could read the entire book in a single sitting. I wish I could have left it at that and had a more enjoyable reading experience. I would advise reading the book to a friend, preferably after they are done with their homework, or if you are looking for something to read over a break or during the afternoon 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story starts out well enough, the characters have a little bit of personality. However, as the story goes on, the only thing this book is doing is turning out to be a collection of clichés. It's the same thing in nearly all romance novels, and it's a bad sign that they're trying to get away with it as fast as possible.The characters also take on a lot of ridiculous behavior that just doesn't fit in to the story. In one of the many incidents that occurred while the characters were traveling together, I found that the two were having sex in the middle of a town square. This should have been an entirely different thing to a romance novel. I couldn't believe it until I realized that the characters hadn't even said anything to each other.It seems that this book tries to get a quick little jump in to readers' lives while it's still in the early stages of being written. There's no real drama going on, no reason to keep reading beyond that. It just seems to be about giving readers what they want while it can.This book is basically nothing more than "what I want to happen in the future." If this isn't the reason that you read a romance book, then what is? It doesn't really matter, because there's plenty of that happening, but it just ends up being so much filler that it ruins the experience for me.I don't know if it's because I've read a lot more romance books in the past few years, but I don't like these stories. The characters are so shallow and so much of what's happening is just them taking each other's clothes off. I found myself wanting something more than the two of them doing the same things over and over again, and I couldn the book actually have that. This book has the exact same problem as some of the romance novels out there, so it's really nothing new.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be very offensive, both in the way the author depicts a rape as inevitable, and in the manner in which he portrays women as powerless. This book did not do any good to my mental health, and I would recommend not to read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As bad as the writing in this book is, the cover art is even worse.  It is the style of the cover that drives me away 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not worth my time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a pity.  There is no point to go through this book, unless you are a serious collector.  All of the images are not in focus, and the text is unorganized.  I can see a serious serious collector buying this book to help them build their collection.  But for me it was wasted money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of bad advice and ideas. This was a waste of time for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is hard to explain the lack of any kind of good ideas in this book.  The book doesn't contain any of the information that you are supposed to learn from this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, this book is a mess and it's very hard to follow along with it.  Even with the footnotes, the book was very hard going to read.  If I had to take a guess I'd say the author didn't realize how much material there is in the book.  That being said, the content was all over the place.  There are some very good pages (a lot of information), but others are very confusing.  A lot of the stuff was either left out or not given any attention.  I found it hard to keep up.  This is why I think the book is not for anyone who is looking to learn any martial arts.  It's just a lot of confusing information.  So if you like the martial arts, I would say this book will not work for you.   It is for those who want a quick read, but if you do not like the contents of the book, you will hate this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author does the usual academic book talk about the history of science and science, and it's mostly gibberish. She does not address any scientific issues at all and instead focuses on the religious, political, cultural, etc. aspect of these topics. As a result, her book is very shallow. I would never give a book about science an average rating unless the author could demonstrate how the science is actually related to religious and cultural beliefs, etc., and how science and religion are related to each other and how these relationships affect a person's overall life. It is obvious that she lacks these qualifications, as she has a very limited grasp of the subject and her book spends a good deal of time talking about other things, which are completely unrelated to science. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author claims that he is writing about a "true" story from the life of the family. Yet, none of the characters in the story seem to fit the description. Most seem to be very young, including the main character, so the book does not seem like an accurate description of reality.The only characters who appear to be real are the children. Yet the parents constantly take the children out to the country and they never return home. This seems to occur over and over throughout the book. So what is the point of the story? If the parents never return, then what is a reader supposed to think? Furthermore, the plot does not develop properly throughout the novel, which makes the story boring. The author did not develop the characters properly in this book, leaving the book a chore to read.The author claims the book has "dark humor" but in fact, the humor is in the details of each character's life. The book tries to tell the story of a single family in an over-the-top way, but it just does not work. The story becomes over-blown and repetitive as the author attempts to write a dramatic story. The novel could have been easily written as a short-story, or even a novel, but the author decided to take his time writing a story which is not really compelling. It seems that the author is not quite a good enough writer to write this story well. So the book suffers as a result. The "darkness" which the author claims is "true", is really just the author being vain, and trying to cover up the poor quality of the writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really didn't find this book very useful. It's all just about how to sell books. I've never met a self-help book that worked as well as this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a huge collection of pictures with no details. There are more pictures, more info, more explanations, more of everything. I'm tired of reading about beautiful places 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book doesn't follow a standard format. Each chapter is almost entirely a list of pictures, many of which are not very attractive. The author has apparently taken no pains to provide visual examples for the words that are to follow, so there are almost no words. This book was not published in the U.S.A. or Europe. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have not read any of J. L. Austin's books in the last 20 years. I have read some of the previous one (and it was only a couple of years ago) and I had no clue the author was such a poor writer 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you haven't already read this book,  it's not too bad  but it's far from being a classic.  This book is like someone putting a bad movie on the VHS box, and then taking the video off  once you realize it sucks 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is mostly about the author's childhood and his mother. That is fine. It's not the most interesting thing in the world. But it is a bit depressing because there are no characters other than the author, his mother, and the dog. The book was about a good family that got screwed by a bad family. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a horrible book.  The author tries to paint a positive image of a Jewish family as an example of what is best about the Jewish religion.  However, it is all too clear that he did not understand anything about Jewish life and culture.  He does not discuss any of the major events of the Holocaust or the Jewish people in the world.  His use of Jewish prayer beads as symbols of his family's faith is disgusting.  In short, this is the kind of book you buy to try to show that the Jews are good people.  Not so much.  This book is the first thing you should look away from if you have any interest in Jewish history or spirituality.  It is not that the book is bad. It is that the author has no clue about the culture he is trying to write about, and he makes it abundantly clear in every sentence that he is not interested in the subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just read the book and was disappointed to find the story told in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an extremely poor one for anyone with an interest in the occult. If you are looking for a book about magic and the occult, this book is not for you. It is a book for occult practitioners, and it is quite possible this book should not be read by anyone interested in the paranormal. It's a bad, bad book for anyone to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in early 2012.  The book is full of good ideas but the way it is presented in this book is not as enjoyable as the way the book is presented elsewhere.  I didn't enjoy reading about how to write a good book and how to present it.  This book is only intended for the beginner or the person who doesn't know how to do writing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A big problem with this book is that the authors have not had any experience in writing or editing.  The book has been published, but it is a long and arduous process.  It is a sad book, and you can tell from the first page that it is intended to be an educational book, not a true biography.  A great many of the quotes are meaningless or over-dramatized.  However, there are some interesting details about one woman's life that need to be included in the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book itself is quite negative but it is in the introduction that the author begins to make some positive points about his book. The book should not be dismissed because of the bad writing that can not be excused by the author's ineptitude. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has some interesting theories about the origin of the Bible, but not much is done with the actual text, which is about as dry as dry can be 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book does not present the material in a positive manner.  The chapter titles are the only things that make the book interesting.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, she has some good ideas and insights. But the chapters are all about her own life (her family, her career etc) and I was just bored with the whole book.I just wish she had not tried to cover so many areas so quickly. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I've ever read. The author's stories are not funny and his dialogue is extremely limited. If you want to read a good book, please don't bother reading this book. I'm not sure where this book is being sold and I haven't been able to find any other reviews about it. I'll just continue to buy it until it stops being made
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a great inspiration for my young daughters to learn to read.  But, it didn't end there.  I read through the whole book, then turned it off.  Then I read it again and read through it again.  And after reading the first few pages again, I put it down again and never touched it again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A boring read, yet if you read this book for the first time  you will be confused 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not only terrible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a very positive person, and I thought the book was interesting. The author, who is the wife of a popular musician, spends a lot of time describing the bad side of her life. Her children are spoiled and she is miserable. The life of a celebrity can be tough to deal with, but she never gives a fair chance to other people. It was just boring to read."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't really recommend this book. It is filled with errors, misquotes, and outright lies.  The author has clearly lost his grip on his facts and has resorted to creating his own false narrative.  It's sad that he has even allowed himself to be so dishonest as to allow the authors of this book to make the claims they do 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well written. But this book is not for me, because it was not about my son, but my mother-in-law. It's true. It was a tough book to read. There were several chapters about my mother in-law that were completely irrelevant to the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an outdated book.   I was never a follower of the Catholic faith, but this book made me feel as if I were.  The stories that follow are the same old cliches 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book would be useful for the high school students and adults who are looking for a good book to learn algebra. It is a short, easy book to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was planning on giving this book a fair read. Then I read the conclusion, and then had to put the book down. I ended up giving the book a 4, because it did not provide a satisfactory explanation for the events in the book: the events occurred in the real world, and in the way the characters in the story described the events; and yet the book is structured in a manner that suggests it is a novel.  I found the ending somewhat unsatisfactory; the story had gone too far off course.  The main character was supposed to get a girlfriend, who was a former girlfriend of his, in a few chapters. Then he broke up with her; and then, on the other hand, he was supposed, as a result of the breakup, to become romantically involved with someone else, and she left him in a rather rude way 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the book to be very dry and tedious. The author didn't bother to learn anything about the subject and the reader had to rely on him to explain any kind of important information. The story was also too much a fantasy and I didn't really feel anything in the book was happening on the earth's surface. I'm a little bit disappointed with the book, and I'm surprised it has such a bad review rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The stories are not very good and the pictures are not clear or accurate. The author is making claims about ancient times that are clearly not true. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete waste of time.  The author uses a wide variety of examples to illustrate every topic, but the most relevant of these examples are found only in the last chapter.  There is a good amount of self-help that's discussed within the book, but there is no practical application for most of it.  It seems the author just got tired of being a writer and decided to put her ideas on paper.  If you want to take some lessons from the book and apply them, find a better book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a pile of drivel. There is not a word of wisdom, there is no depth of understanding, no wisdom, no clarity, nothing. I cannot recommend this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book, first off, that is not even written as a story of the author's life. The story tells us what the author experienced with a man who was trying to molest her. And then the book describes how he became so desperate to harm her that he attempted to kill himself. How he tried to poison her with drugs. How she tried to drive off the man by jumping in her car. How they tried to run away from each other. It is all done in the same paragraph. This book is not only terrible, but it is a sad, disgusting, and despicable book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not only was the book too long and didn't provide any useful information, it made some very poor arguments. The book is not to be trusted 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  In this book, she goes back and forth from being a bad mother to an awful mother to her own horrible mom. It is all a nightmare and her child is only in trouble because of what she has done to him. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was never able to follow the story properly and the characters are one dimensional. It is simply too many words to tell about this novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book opens with a description of the story of the life and times of a wealthy aristocrat and his son, but that story is nowhere to be seen during the course of this story. In fact, the author is quick to point out that the two characters have absolutely nothing in common. Not only is he portrayed as a selfish   rich bastard, he is portrayed as such from the very beginning of the book. This is the way the book is presented. The main character is portrayed in the most negative light possible. His entire life is set up so that he will never experience any joy. Even when he is with his son (who has to be the first person in history to go through this process of being told what he is not and not being told anything else), he is forced to be "perfect" to please his father. This whole story is nothing more than manipulation. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was given this book as a gift but didn't even read the first few pages. I guess this book will be a good read for a few weeks then I am off to buy something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed this book from the beginning. Unfortunately it wasn't long before the characters lost all interest.I thought this was an important book for anyone wanting to understand the inner workings of the military. Unfortunately that was the problem with it. I'm not a big believer in the "military is a noble profession" and it's not for everyone. The fact that some of these characters didn't know it or accept it didn't do anything to change my mind about the book. It seemed to me as if the author thought that the character were just a few guys who were going through a difficult time in life. The military is supposed to be a tough profession 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a huge book, and it is not clear to me why the author has not included a section on using audio books or any other method of reading audio for children.  I read the audio book myself and found the content tedious and hard to read.  The author has the right to write any story he likes but I think it would have been better to include a section that deals with the advantages and disadvantages of different audio formats for the reading of text.  If I had written the book, I would have put it in the appropriate places. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a typical book about an unhealthy relationship:  He gets her pregnant and tells her he wants a baby of his own 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read a few of the books written by a few other authors, and I always end up disappointed.  The premise is the same, just the subject matter is completely different.  I just read another book about a very boring couple, and they seemed to have just the right amount of problems to fill a few pages.  Maybe I just like bad book so much that I read them on a regular basis, but for some reason this one is the worst 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What I really do not like about this book is the fact that there are so many spelling errors.  As you can see in the pictures, the word "niggy" is misspelled many times, and there is another misspelled word at the bottom of the page,  which I assume is "nuggy".  There are also several spelling errors throughout.  I would have preferred to read the book in the original, which is the English  that was spoken in Northern Ireland in the late 20th century 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was hoping that this book would prove me wrong. Instead, it proves me right. In this book, we learn little about science or the world. It's much like a boring Sunday school manual: it describes a story about a little boy and a dog. But the writing is bad. The style of the writing and the book are very dry and lifeless. The book is completely lacking in heart and emotion. The whole thing just feels like the author just got bored and threw out the idea of science fiction.I don't even believe that it's a real book. It reads like the pages are ripped from a magazine 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was not interested in this book and found out through other reviewers, the book is not about the death of Marilyn. The book focuses mostly on her life as a young model and the times in which she interacted with other famous men. The woman portrayed in this novel was not Marilyn Monroe, she was more like a version of Madonna. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is written in the   most ridiculous manner 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a bad review of a bad novel:  The characters are generic, uninteresting, shallow, and one dimensional, the events have no connection to the characters or the world.  The author's main problem is that the book takes itself way too seriously. The characters are either super strong or incredibly weak (there are no two ways about it). The novel is full of over-the-top descriptions that give the reader the feeling that it is a real life story, complete with historical detail, historical figures, etc. There is no plot and only a minor character. It all feels like the author is trying to outdo the author's earlier novels. In the end, it doesn't matter how much time the novel took to write, how many characters it contained, or how much of a plot it had. Because of all the above reasons, the book fails as an entertaining and enlightening read. I give the novel a 4 out of 10.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I agree with the reviewer below, If you want to learn about some of the more advanced techniques and ways of using the web, this book is not for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most interesting aspect of this book, which is the author's attempt to explain the origin and development of the concept of 'postmodernism', is the attempt to distinguish between art that is'realist' in nature, and the postmodern art. But there is only one way to be a realist: by using all available resources, including modernism 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If only it were written in the  same style as the Bible, this would be a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book about sex and love, which is obviously all about  men. Not a good book for the sensitive  reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not like the title; it has the same effect as the old "How to  Teach a Girl to be a Good  Housewife" book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not see any good qualities in this book.  The author shows little interest in the subject and seems to be getting some sort of rush by promoting the book to the public.  I thought I was being very thorough  in my research, but the author seemed to not take this into consideration.   The book also suffers from a poor editing style.  It is extremely difficult to make any meaningful comments about the book, as the author does not seem to even grasp the fundamentals of a topic as profound as the evolution of civilization.  Overall, the book is a poor book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to take my kids to this book and it was just a waste of time.  It would have been better if the author had written an interesting book about the American Indian culture in the 21st century rather than just telling her story about her culture.  This book would have sold better if it didn't go into a boring narrative about the "American Indian" culture.   The whole thing was really pointless and really boring to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read it because it was touted as an introduction to the work of the late R.H. Stine.  Unfortunately,  this is not the case at all.  I found the writing to be lazy,  and the examples not particularly well thought out.  The only thing I found entertaining about this book  was that Stine was quoted.  It also did not mention  Stine's many other titles, or the many great books he's written.  While I enjoyed some of the examples he gave for some of his  characters,  I didn't particularly care for the others.  Instead of being an introduction into Stine,  it seems like this was intended to be a quick, funny read for  children.  I recommend it if you're looking for something easy,  but don't expect to learn any useful stuff. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has nothing to do with any real scientific or professional endeavors.  The information is presented in a very superficial manner, and the author's opinions are often quite different than mine.  In fact, my opinion of the book is rather low.  Instead, I would suggest that those who may be interested in pursuing a scientific field of interest, study something more of a practical nature.  Perhaps something along the lines of The Physics of Chemistry or a similar text. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I wish I could rate this book more 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is a bit misleading, the book doesn't actually give you any insight into the personalities of people who are not very happy. Instead, it gives you the   impression that there are people who love their family, they are miserable,  and the author is  all to blame 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a bad books.  It's not even funny.  I don't know if I'd recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's own observations are not relevant and it is hard to believe that his writing ability was as bad as it appears 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not pleased with this book.  I am a very positive person, but I couldn't get over the bad reviews that this book got.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed with the level of writing, the lack of thought for how to approach a problem (in general, there is no discussion of a problem without getting bogged down in the details), the overly verbose description of details, etc. This is the same book I've read countless times before, but it was so over the top and boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The stories were too short and it's really about the book rather than the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a textbook example of why a good book is not about "true facts". The facts aren't "real". These are just facts. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is supposed to teach us how to deal with stressful situations. Instead it has a negative view of women. Women are constantly having negative experiences because they are not good leaders.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with lots of spelling errors, bad grammar and poor use of the English language

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book when I was 15-years-old, and I liked it.  After reading the book I felt that it was time to move on.  I wanted to give this book one more chance, but it seems it is not good for the readers.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a horrible book,   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I know the author has a good track record, but for some reason this book was never about him. He's just some guy in some other story line and no one even really cared about his story line. It seemed as though this is some other author's book and that the people involved in this book just happened to like the idea of the title. So in all fairness, the author never really did much other than tell a story. The title really only seemed to have something to do with how the author felt about the title, so it was a bit silly. He just kind of floundered on this one.It was not fun to read this book. The characters were too much like in this story line:I hated most of them. The only ones I liked were the bad guys, but that was because of how I felt they were written. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first of the 3 books written about my dad, this book, like the others before it, is not up to par 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was hoping for something better from this writer, but it's the same old story. I wish there was something different about his writing style, but alas, he only resorts to clichés and bad prose. The bad book is so bad that it's not even funny. It's a big disappointment that I'll not be checking out any more of his books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think it is a bad choice for a young reader, but not the type I would have chosen myself. This is a book aimed at children, but is filled with outdated stories and very dated pictures. I found it extremely boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think the whole book is bad. If you buy the paperback, which is the only version of the book available in this country, you'll discover the same story as I did: the first book was poorly written and the whole collection is poorly written.  It makes you wonder why so many authors choose to write books about themselves, but not themselves 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had expected this to be a classic and didn't see the need to reread this, which is exactly the problem. This book is all about the way in which the characters think and make decisions. But the way they thought and made decisions was nothing but  silly 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author has been in the industry for 20 years, and is still in the business, yet here she writes that her best book, A Very Good Book for a Grown Up, is not only a disappointment but that it will ruin your marriage.  This is not the case. The book has little to no relevance for the average person or young person.  A Very Bad Book is for people with more experience.  I was in that category, but I didn't like this book.  The book's title should have been A Good Book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is terrible.  It lacks any kind of realistic analysis.  Instead, it is just the story of a man's search for love.  The author is an author of other bad books, and it's not his fault.  I thought it would be a good book for my husband, but he was so disappointed in it that we did not finish it.  Maybe I didn't get a lot of the details right.  If you read it, you will find that it is all about sex, not relationships.  And that is pretty much it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book begins with a discussion of an early version of the Bible that was more controversial than ever before, and not at all the kind of book I would choose to read.  The author, as I was told from several reliable sources, is a conservative Christian.  So how can he write a book like this?  I've read hundreds of religious books, but I have never read one this objectionable as this.  I can't recommend it because it will almost certainly spoil your enjoyment of the book.  If you already have the book, you are probably not reading it for the same reasons.  In my view, this is the worst book I have ever read.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A little too long. Not sure where the author is going with this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book did not do anything to help the reader understand the situation, nor to give insight into the thoughts of the women living with the man.  For that reason I am only willing to give the book 4 stars because I have never found anything better on the market.  I will give the next book in this series a chance to do better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has a positive review, but the information contained in the book does not correlate with what is being said in the text. It is a good book to learn about the basics of the industry and get a quick grasp on some of the key points in the industry. However, the book is not a good guide to the art of marketing, which is the goal of the text written in the title. This book will teach you that you should not buy and sell a bad electronic device  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a huge fan of Mr. Spock. So, as soon as I read the summary, I was disappointed. I'm not saying this book has bad writing or quality, I just found it odd that I found it as odd as I did, since Spock is my favourite character in the whole Star Trek Universe. The description of his life was not accurate, either, and the characters felt flat and shallow, to me. Spock wasn't very interesting, either. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I agree with the reviewer that this book is one of the worst.  It is a collection of stories in the form of letters from various cultures.  These stories are full of errors, typos, and poor writing.  And this is by far the worst book I have ever read.  If you are looking for a great read  You are not going to get a good book out of this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book, and unfortunately the same mistakes occur over and over again. He starts out with a positive review about the latest science fiction book, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, then gets sucked into a book about the last of the old-fashioned science fiction stories. If you're a science fiction fan, don't read this book: it will disappoint you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a good book but I'm not a huge fan of it.  It doesn't do a good job of explaining any of the technical concepts and the overall style is boring and repetitive.  I also found it a bit disjointed.  Overall it's a good intro to electronic devices but the explanations in this book aren't very helpful in the real world.  If you're looking for something with an actual use, this book is not for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are not careful, this book could make you do a lot of ill-advised things with your money.  If your reading a book on buying real estate before you buy it, and that real estate has a high tax basis, the real estate is likely to be taxed higher than if you buy at a lower tax basis and later sell.  You will lose money for real estate, no matter how much you paid for it in the first place.  Do not buy a book to do this! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not entirely in agreement with the message of this book. The author believes that the Lord has given him the power to know God's secrets. However, he also feels that God has given others the power of intuition. This is not to say that one is inferior to the other, but in terms of this message, he is off base. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with unnecessary jargon and a huge amount of bollocks.  It's written by someone who thinks that he knows everything.  A typical example:  "The world is made up of objects, some tangible, some abstract.   All objects in the universe are composed of atoms.  If we are able to see atoms, we have discovered the first elementary particle in the world."  This is utter nonsense.  An atom is a molecule, which is made of protons and neutrons.  How can we know that atoms are composed only of proton and neutron?  Can you imagine what the physicists would think if you told them that they have discovered one-quadrillionth of a particle in their universe, the "first elementary particle"?  The book also claims that the world is composed of light, sounds and consciousness.  This sounds very much like some of those woo-woo pseudo-scientific quackery books such as "The Book of the New Sun"  The only real benefit to this book is that it gives an idea of how to sell a bunch of useless books, such as this one.  And don't forget to mention in the blurb about the cover:  This cover is sure to catch your eye.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of inaccuracies, unhelpful quotes, and over-the-top statements about everything from a good book to the end of the world.  As is typical of this genre, there is no "middle" or "middle ground."  He seems to feel that everyone's life is "good and bad" at one point or another.  So, it seems, are we all.  However, for someone who is trying to get the message out about the importance of being a good parent, this is a bad choice 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a piece of garbage and should not be considered for any kind of education or for any other purpose 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It would take a large amount of reading in order to understand how this author views women.  The author is an evangelical Christian.  This book should only be read by those who have a strong moral foundation.  I find it very offensive that she seems to think that any woman who has sex outside of marriage is somehow evil, or that she is right in believing this, as she has only ever written about women. I have only read three chapters of this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A good book, but I feel like it was poorly planned to be a series 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it interesting and educational, but it was too much information for a high school student to absorb.  For that reason I found some of the book's information to be questionable, such as the student's names being printed in the text.  I'm sure that this was done to keep the book focused, but that didn't work as well as I'd hoped.  The problem with that is that the student is the center of the story.  No other character is involved in the story, so the names in the book are always in the background.  However, the information doesn't appear in the middle of the text where it's needed most.  There was no reason to include that information at the end of the first paragraph of the chapter, so I found the names to be dropped off the page, never to be seen again.   Overall, the book was not for me, and that's a shame.  It may be worthwhile for some students to consider if this is a good way to approach an older book.  But, if you're looking for the perfect book for a modern high school, I would avoid it like the plague 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is written for the general public, not for science fiction or fantasy readers.  This book is based on the real life story of a man who bought a $3.00 book for a couple of dollars at the book store.  The story goes along with his wife getting married and having children.  I was appalled by how many false promises and lies are found in this book.  Many times it seems the author wrote the book to please his wife and family.  He even changed names and dates to make the book seem more realistic.  It was very hard for me to see how this was done to the actual events.  If you want to read a good book about romance, don't buy it.  Buy something else.  There are many other good books available on the market that offer a much better story.  You don't have to buy this book, but if you do buy it, make sure you read the original story. I can't even imagine how a person with the name Alexander would write a story about this same man. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read several books by this author and this is the weakest one so far. It lacks both a good story and a nice collection of short stories. I just finished reading the first story, and it is very depressing.I wish this author would write a good book instead of a bunch of short and very depressing stories that only provide some amusement. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not only the author has no common sense and cannot write a coherent book. The book has lots of typos and typos in the chapters and it is difficult to figure out the order of the chapters, let alone the topic. This book only adds to the confusion, since it is hard to tell which chapter a particular person is talking about. I found the book rather embarrassing, but I can see why it was marketed as a beginner book, as it was intended for the readers of high school and college. Unfortunately, the first 50 pages are so terribly written that the reader is more likely to turn away from the book and give up than to be inspired by the author's writing skills. I am glad that I did not read the entire book because the last chapter is nothing but a series of cliches. This is the wrong way to learn about a subject, and in fact the book has absolutely nothing to do with anything you will need to do in college, much less the real world. This was a poor book with poor marketing and it should not be confused with a good one. I would only recommend the book if you have a few bucks laying around and you are desperate for cash, or if you are a novice writer who desperately needs help. The author is an inexperienced, unqualified, and uncreative writer, who has not been able to learn any real skills in the real 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book the authors are constantly attempting to convince us that they are "serious about history" when they are in fact completely out of touch with the reality of world history. What a shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has a number of mistakes. The story has no meaning, it is just an excuse for the author to put pictures of cats in the pages. This book makes me ill. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the worst books  I have ever read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author was not happy with the reviewers of his books. He doesn't like you to review his books because he doesn't believe in them. If he were around to see his book on Amazon get bombed, he would feel bad for me. I would recommend this book to those who need a fast read, but are not interested in the plot.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book. It was interesting, but not interesting enough to make me want to keep reading the book. I did enjoy it as a form of entertainment, but I thought the main character was dull and not very interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not about the weather.   It is about the effects of a bad weather on people. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read a lot of self help books, and I must say that this book is the worst in terms of the content. There are several things I did not like about it: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book begins by suggesting that we're supposed to be living the gospel, living a moral life. It seems very convenient that we get to this point in the life of Jesus, who had no real moral issues. But we know from the Gospel stories that Jesus' heart was very, very different from that of other people. So we know right off the bat that his message and the Gospel is going to be very different. But no big deal. Jesus is the hero of this story. So he is supposed to save people, right? Wrong. He's not supposed to change people. In fact, when Jesus talks about what people need to do to be saved, he usually doesn't mention the word, "sin." It's never mentioned anywhere. We're supposed just live the gospel and save people from sin. What's wrong with that? We're not supposed change people to get them saved, are we? We get saved because we have faith and believe the gospel. Jesus tells us he believes that we have the ability to choose to accept the gospel because it's true, and to not believe it is to live in sin, which is a major sin. The whole book is about that. I really don't like the book's argument. You see, we don't get saved by our thoughts. We get salvation by believing the gospel by doing the actions that Jesus asks us to do. It's not about changing people. It doesn't change people who believe the same things we believe. We need to choose a better way to live. We know that if we choose to do it, we will be saved. We must make the choice to believe the truth in the Bible in order to be born again into the new life. The Bible tells us that we need to live the good life (whatever that means). The gospel tells us about that life. This book tells us it's not as easy as we think. Jesus never even mentions it. He tells us to believe in the Gospel, and then we can take it from there. It just doesn't even come up. In the book I found a lot of problems. Jesus doesn't seem to talk about what you need to be doing to be truly living the good lifestyle. I found plenty of places where I was supposed to go out and do what Jesus wanted me to do, and I wasn't even encouraged to do that. So many of the problems I found had to do with people that are supposed to live a virtuous life
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to agree with others that the writing is bad, and the book as a whole, is  rather tedious.  The chapters often consist of little more than a description of a bad-looking, smelly person talking about his bad life:  I hate it.  I hope the author is in a place of depression and is unable to write anymore.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The idea of this book is to draw you in and make you believe this man is a good, decent man. But, after you read this book and you are forced to question his beliefs about himself, and his relationship with God, then it doesn't sound like he's a good man.I don't know why they call it The Miracle of Faith 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was written in the 1970s. It's not a book I recommend to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's been so long that the title is almost as bad as the book itself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As the title makes it clear, the main focus of this book is about the relationship between parents and their children. However, it seems as if the author has failed to grasp the fact that it is also about the parent's need to be there for their children, to spend time with them, and to guide them in the direction they may want to take in life. He seems to think that we are only able to raise our children with the guidance of our parents and that they will be able to guide our children and guide them when they are adults. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like it.  I think it was written for a popular audience, not for the general reader.  All of the details in this book are unnecessary and are written in a way that will cause you to miss important info if you just follow the "script".  I'm not sure I'll ever pick up a book by David Markey again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not the book I was looking for in my college library.   I found it here on a college bookstore website.  I think it may have been a typo that put it there.  It's too bad because it looks like a very good book and I have been enjoying it for years.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story doesn't do justice to the author's love and respect for all animal lovers.  The author is a horrible and selfish person 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The problem with this book  is that the author doesn't  explain the concept of karma or reincarnation  at all.  There is one character that  has several reincarnations that do get explained in the story.  The only character that is  given a full description in the book is the main protagonist,  but you don't learn anything about her life  other than that she is a child prostitute  and has reincarnated many times.  You don't even get a full explanation of her background  other then the fact that she had the first child  and is the only reincarnation in this series  (even though she didn't actually make any babies that  were born until later in the series.)  I also don't get how this book has the title  because all the characters are only shown in a single life  and this entire book was devoted to them   The story is pretty simple in its execution, but this book fails  miserably at making it interesting.  In addition, the characters in the stories are very clichéd   I found this book boring to read.  As an avid reader,  I was pretty sick of it after  three books.  I'm not going to waste my time and money  on this book.  It will only make me think of  this book every time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am glad I can't bring myself to buy it for my daughter 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really hate how this book was written.  This is not the first book I've written that was a complete failure.  For example, there were two major problems with the book: 1.  The title is not accurate.  It should read   The Boy Who Lived Alone.  No, really, why would you write a book about a child who lives alone?  That would mean he is alone for most of the day.  I mean, it would make no sense to call a book   about a young boy who is   alone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author, after telling you a little about the history of American slavery, then proceeds to give a negative description of American racism as presented in this book. This is a horrible book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of bad writing that only makes it worse that it is in the middle of the story.  And then at the end you are left wondering why she didn't take the book with her from the library when she went away to school and what would have happened had she returned to it in later years?  The only reason I bought it was because I found that the pictures and descriptions of the stories were very nice.  But there was no real explanation of what was going on in the stories 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book to review for one of my online classes and was never able to finish it.

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I thought it was the first time the authors used a different spelling for the word "Inezka" and for "Izzy" and then changed it again. It's really disconcerting. I'm not sure where I will start when I have to choose from the many pages of the book: what was the author trying to say about Izzy that she's a good daughter or a bad daughter 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is riddled with inaccurate statements about ancient cultures. The author has not bothered to do any research at all and seems to be quite satisfied with her own work. It is a bit much to expect a student to take such a claim seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to say  it is hard for me to read a book written by a Christian  who would be ashamed to say so.  He goes so far as to say that the bible was written by man and was created by God, not Adam and Eve.  It is this type of ignorance that causes people to reject the truth and reject God.  I am not ashamed of my faith, but  I do not believe the bible is God's word 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did read it, but it's not in any way enjoyable. The book contains too many repetitions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot was confusing at times, the writing was poor, the illustrations were not appropriate, and the main character, an overly dramatic ex-con, had very little character development. I was disappointed and not surprised with the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book that is meant for students and that is not what this book was meant for.  This book was intended for adults that have grown up with a younger generation that wants to tell them how to live.  However, there is not much in this book to provide the younger generation with advice or ideas for how to start living.  These children are not yet old enough to understand the responsibilities that come with being adults and I feel that this book is out of their league.  Instead, this book should be used as a guide for the parents, who want to give their children the same advice they gave to themselves.  I don't blame the book, I blame the children.  If they had not grown up, they would have been able to learn some of these things.  So, to everyone who wants to give advice to their children:  Keep it simple, don't tell them that 'Don't do drugs' or 'It's not good to take drugs', because those are the easy answers.  Those are the answers that kids in their teens and 20s are already ready to hear.   If you want to share advice, then use it as a tool, not a means to an end.  It would be very hard for the younger generations to follow your advice because they are not ready yet to understand it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is terrible, there is no plot, there are no characters, there's no action, there isn't any description to speak of, no plot. If you want to learn some history, try reading other authors for books, like James Michener, John T. Flynn, and Richard Gilder. If this is your only book, stay away from this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the kind of stuff that's popular with students in school today, the same way the first one was popular in the 80s. This is just plain stupid and it needs to be put down for good. It should never be a part of anyone's life, ever, and it's not written in such a way that anyone can enjoy it. I found it very boring, even after I finished reading it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a waste of time, not much action, and it doesn't even include the first part of the book, which is not a bad thing. But it also is very heavy handed with what is told in the first and last chapter. The author has also forgotten that this book was originally published as an electronic book. So much for having some artistic license. And when you are in your 30s and still trying to convince people that it's just a young lady's journey, I'm sure this book will do the trick

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story of a young man who loves animals, is a victim of a bad parenting, etc. The way the book is written is just painful and depressing.  It is not good for you to read it and be sad, thinking of this young man's life 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found myself bored to death with all the information that was thrown at me.  I'm not even sure this is the last book in this series 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first half of the book is a collection of anecdotes, but the second half of it is a rant.  This is what it is:  The rich and famous live a life of luxury.   It's easy to understand the way they live.  But the poor in this world are poor because they don't have a great imagination.  They're poor because there's nothing they can do about it.  The one thing they can control is their own behavior.  So they're just being lazy.  That's it. They don't do anything.  Don't worry about anything. Stop worrying about the negative things people have to say about them.  I'd recommend this book to someone who thinks they can take the rich out of the rich and into the poor.  Just keep telling them to stop being lazy and start thinking about what they can actually do.  Then, they'll get busy working their lives and become much more prosperous 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing style, though not bad, lacks any style and is just a bunch of random facts and figures.  I do not recommend it to anyone.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book starts with an overblown opening. The story begins with a young woman who becomes obsessed with a mysterious object found in her bedroom. The object's mysterious presence and its appearance throughout the house lead her to believe she has a very special connection to the object. She then starts a sexual relationship with a teenage boy. The book quickly becomes less about her and more about the object itself. The main characters are a father, daughter, and son. The father is emotionally distant from his children, but the father and daughter have no problem in having sex with each other. The son has no problems with it but the mother refuses to allow it. It makes for a very confusing, repetitive story. In the end the book focuses on the object, which is a man in a white suit. The objects' presence, the object's physical appearance, and the object themselves are never explained. If the main characters had more interest in the story than in their sexual exploits, it would have been easier to read. But in fact the author seemed to find that her story wasn't interesting enough to focus on.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a good book but there is no way you will read it unless you already have a decent grasp of physics. The book is over complicated and it takes forever to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really hated this book. I had no idea it was going to be as bad as it was.  It didn't even make sense to me.  I wish I had gone into it knowing the ending, but I didn't.  What a bad decision on the author's part.  The author didn't do much to endear herself to me and I didn'  have any respect for her.  She just kept going in a circle.  So I didn"t know if she would stop or not.  And she didn't

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the material and quotes useful, but the overall structure of the book is confusing and disorganized.  There are many chapters, each one with a few quotes, that don't really make sense.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought this book was a waste of time and money when I first read it.  I have learned a few things since, but this book has no relevance for any type of student. This is not a great book for any reason.  The author says in her introduction that she has spent many, many hours studying with this material, yet she is only 15 minutes into the book. She states that the material is "all about your own personal development and it all comes down to you," yet the whole book is all about her personal development. At the end of the book, she has to tell the readers not to give the material a try if they aren't already at this stage I am a college student who spends nearly every weekend in an open group with no prior practice This book was for the general student population. I recommend that you skip this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's the book of a poor, uneducated, out of shape man who is completely useless in the real world and makes a terrible wife. The writing is horrible and completely ridiculous. I hated all the stories. This book is a waste of time and money

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not too pleased with this book. It's not easy to read and doesn't do much to advance the plot. It also is too long.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very poor translation. It's so poorly done that even when the English is perfectly clear, the Japanese doesn't understand anything. And the plot just doesn't work. I was hoping to read the manga for the story and enjoyment, but it isn't presented in a compelling way that could have made it much more appealing to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has one thing I don't like: too many factual inaccuracies.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with boring and boring facts, and even worse, it's completely out of chronological order. This book doesn't seem to know when it begins and when it ends. I found it frustrating and repetitive. It's too bad that it was a good book, but not as good as it could have been. The author did a decent job of making the book interesting and engaging. The pictures of the various animals in the book look pretty cute. The book has some excellent pictures that show all the different animals in their natural environments, but the only pictures that really stood out for me were the animals in a zoo setting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are only a couple of interesting ideas in this book: (1) the "good guy" of the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title of the book has a negative connotation. If you are looking for a book about the life of a man, there are better ones out there. If, however, you're looking for something like a modern day version of the autobiography of Mark Twain or George Washington, this is not the book for you. You will not be able to get your hands on the paperback edition of this book in time for Christmas and I would recommend not buying this book at all if you live in a cold climate. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A poor book which tries to appeal to the female readers of middle school. Unfortunately, the writer tries to show a female student's perspective on school by creating unrealistic images of an idyllic class reunion. If you're looking for something more realistic, check out the other books in the series: The White Witch 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author claims that he did not know about the negative reviews about this book. I agree with the other reviews that the book is a lot less believable than it seems. He is making claims about his ability to make money out of this book that he is obviously not in control of. The facts are there for all to see and it's obvious to see that his ability for success is greatly exaggerated and is likely to cause a lot of damage to his business. This is the first book in his career where he is making money and that is very different from his previous success. This book is very similar to what happened with his marriage and money problems. If I were him I would not write another book as it seems that he only has so much ability for this to happen with.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had a good chance of reading this book only to realize that the whole thing was written in the third person, and all the characters, including Mr. Fiske, the one who was supposed to be "sick" (for not getting the girl) and not get on any more dates, were totally fictional.I am glad it is over, but I do wish that the book was more truthful about its subject matter, and less about Fiskel's character.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   There was so much that was wrong with the book, that I thought it would be best if I took a different approach with my next book, which is the final book of the series.  I feel that we are getting closer to solving the mystery of the missing book as the final few chapters unfold.  The problem is that the series has now become a self-defeating obsession that has led to one of the worst books I have ever read.  Even though I love these characters, there are too many inconsistencies to believe that the book can even be completed, let alone any of the other books in the series, if they are to be believed.  This book is the only thing keeping me from leaving the series altogether. I hope that the authors take another look at the series and work to make the final books more consistent in their writing and pacing.  Until then, I recommend avoiding this book and going in another direction. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's like a bad electronic device:  It doesn't fit, doesn't have a keypad, doesn's't have good instructions and the pictures don't look good.  In short, it's not a good book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been an avid reader of historical romance for many years.  This book did not satisfy me.  It was more of the same old romanticism without the charm.  The characters were shallow and stereotypical.  I would be more comfortable with this book than this one.  There is nothing new in this book and it reads like the writer is trying to prove her writing skills with the readers of her other historical romance novels.  While it is not the worst book I've read, it is one of the most boring. I give it 2 stars because I found the romantic scenes to be very good.  However, the romantic stories don't flow together and the plot is never the reason for the romance.  You know what I mean?  The book is great, but you have to find a happy ending for both lovers. There is no happy ending in this story. If you like romances with a happy conclusion, then this is the book for you.  If you don't, then you're better off looking for a good historical romance novel and reading a good one.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the book to be rather annoying. It is written as though she were lecturing the readers on life. There is little to no plot and no character development. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I have ever read, it is like the author is reading an English textbook for a foreign student.  There are no questions answered about the science and nature. It is simply a collection of anecdotes about some unusual things. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has lots of good information and illustrations, but I just can't see myself using this as the source of my learning, or even as the basis of the teaching that I do in my classroom. If you are serious about getting a good job, and want to be taken seriously, learn something about a field that is not in the curriculum: Business. It is a very serious field. It requires a lot of preparation. And you will want to learn a lot about how the business world works before you can start out in business. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is written by a woman and focuses on a man. I'm not sure how it is possible to write a book about men without writing a man who has no problems with women and only has problems with himself. The men's lives are pretty boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of clich� and cliches. The book should be titled, "I want my money back", but there isn't one good chapter about anything other than a few of the authors own hobbies

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to agree with the negative review posted at bookreviews.com:  The book's main point is to expose the flaws in our American education system. It is, in the main, a negative critique of American education, not a positive education system 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The idea that a great book could become good if you just learn a few things about a little-known artist who was a relative unknown in my book group was too much for this book.  The author seems to be more interested in telling his story than in actually capturing any of the moments in the artist's life that I had enjoyed.  I found this book very hard to read and very repetitive.  For me it was like one long story, but one that left me not wanting to finish it.  While I know that some readers might find this book to be a good introduction into a more obscure artist, I just found it lacking.  Don't expect any of his works to be good, or even look good, from this book: this book is more about getting a feel for the artist than about actually enjoying his work:  I think you can get a feel of a good work by just reading some of the paintings from this work: there are some good examples of abstract art, but most of the work in this book comes across as over-exposed, overwrought, and unrealistic.  It's not a bad work by any means, but it's hard to take a real interest in it. For example, when the artist is painting his self-portrait, he appears to be very relaxed and smiling: but after the painting is done, his face turns very somber and he looks incredibly depressed.  Most of his other works appear very realistic, but this book seems to have more interest in focusing on the artwork than the artist itself.  In the end, this book feels more like one giant monologue of the artist telling his own story than anything else.  And as such it leaves very little room for the reader to feel connected to the artist: the story is only really about the artist.  A better book to read, I believe, would have been to read more about the artists and less about the painter. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I would be very reluctant to give this book a positive review. The style of writing is rather  self-explanatory and, at times, rather shallow. Most of the subjects  are simply recycled in a number of different formats. There is no  substantial analysis of the historical and cultural background to the topics, which is  to be expected from a high school book. All of the material is presented in the  same format. In other words, the book is designed for a general reader who has  a passing interest in the subject matter but 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is very proud of himself for giving a positive review about another book: The Story of a Little Black Book: The Art of Self-Esteem, a positive view of success in business and life.  This book, however, is more like a negative view of  failure in a negative book.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is just one of the many lies promoted in this book, and the book was clearly not written with anyone's health in mind.  It also offers too many of the same false ideas that have been shown to have health consequences.  I would not read this book again because it has clearly failed to answer any of the health questions posed. I have not read any of Dr. Scholl's book so far, so I cannot comment on that. All I can say is that it is a very unbalanced book, with many of its ideas being debunked on numerous occasions. In conclusion, this book does not contain anything useful and should not be used to promote health or prevent disease. The book has many flaws and is not what one would expect to learn from a medical text. There are many other books out there that are more appropriate for such purposes 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book has lots of problems.  First of all, the authors use too many quotes.  Most of them are not appropriate, some of them sound rude, the use of the quotes should be limited to the introduction and ending.  And many times they use them without any attribution.  The author does not use the same quotations on every page.  Also, the book is very heavy on repetition of quotations, which is annoying, since most of the time they do not make sense 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was very disappointed in this book.  I don't see any reason to waste more time and money in teaching this material to others.  The book makes claims of having been 'translated' from a Tibetan dialect (not true) and of having knowledge of the different ways of expressing the same thoughts.  This, however, is all a bit of a farce.  We have to start from scratch every time to understand something and that takes time and time and more time (I think it is important that you do it yourself.  You can read in any language and learn new concepts.  But if you have to get yourself in that direction, take it slow 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't have much time to read this book because I am very busy during the week. It would be much better if there is more in this book for people to enjoy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Too many pages of repetition, repetitive information, and irrelevant trivia. No, not even close to good for serious students. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the fourth book in her book series about the love-life of Marilyn Monroe 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in 2004 and I did not even like it. However, I got it again about 2 years later and only gave it two stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not much of a reader, but I was not able to finish the book in only a few days 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not about real-life adventures, it is not even about the subject matter, it's just a collection of stories, it does not offer anything new to the reader about the book itself. It is a very poorly written book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sorry to say this book has been bad for some time. But, then again, I am not a fan of reading books about sex. I like to read books about different subjects and the authors of this book don't appear to have done any research into this subject, even though their subject is so intriguing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you're looking for a good book to help you better understand this complex, fascinating and extremely fascinating subject, I wouldn't recommend this book to you.  It doesn't cover enough ground and has a very negative and negative attitude towards the material.  There's a lot of great ideas in this book that it would take me at least two months of reading to even begin to understand.  However, that's the way it is sometimes in life  It doesn't help when you're getting ready to give up.  I just wanted something easy to read that wouldn't make me frustrated.  This book did little to break the monotony of study in these subject areas. I didn't really like any of the authors or the way they presented their ideas. The subject matter is really complicated and sometimes hard to grasp at first.  The book is very negative, and the way the book covers the material is frustrating. This book is really only for those interested in these topics and the information they give is very hard to get out of. To me, it's a very frustrating book and I think it might be very frustrating for some students 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the third of four books I have read about the Holocaust.  I was expecting a lot more depth and history than what I read.  As far as the story of this book, it is not written very well.  The writing style and the sentences that seem to be too much and make the reader's eyes glaze over.  No need to look in the book for clues as to how the Holocaust could have occurred.  It could just be that the writer has no clue about what it is like to experience such a horrific event.  This was not the case for me.  All the clues were in the stories of the Jewish people and their struggle to survive.  Nothing was explained in this book.  Not one.  For me, it was like I had read the whole book while watching the movie "Schindler's List" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's hard to believe that I read this book last night.  It is full of bad information.  I have yet to see a reputable reference guide for this book: this book is just so far from a good reference guide that it's laughable.  The book is basically a collection of handout instructions: there is no explanation or explanation of any kind.  This book is a joke.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I would not recommend this book, but I will say that if you are a novice, I would recommend the more advanced works: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete waste of time. It is nothing more than a list of questions you must answer. It has a question about how to wash your hands. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am so disgusted with this book. I've read and reviewed many other self help books and never had any problems with this one. I have to agree with another review, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author has little knowledge of English. It is frustrating to read this poor writing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only reason to purchase this book is to sell more copies. But the book does not help the reader achieve that end. I believe this book can only be written as a negative book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is one long rant against all the crap you see in the popular  literature, which is supposed to be "realistic" and "advanced." But this book is nothing but a bunch of clichés and the author is not above just making these lame statements and then having her characters do nothing about it. So you're supposed to believe that she's a realist because she's saying the right things in this book? I'm not buying that at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sorry that I am having to review this book, but I found it too much of a disappointment for my tastes. I thought that Ms. Salles would have more talent for producing excellent books, but sadly she did not manage to produce any of them for me.  I found that there was not a single story line that I wanted to read, and it was simply a lot of wasted pages.  It's not as if the characters had much of an emotional depth, either. They simply didn't feel as if they were being given enough room to grow.  Ms. Swartz didn't provide any actual stories that weren't about the characters doing something that either they did, or someone else did for them.  Instead, her characters were all about how much they cared about other people, and how much love they had for each other.  She also included an entire chapter about the way she thinks, and she thinks like that all the time.  That's not to say that the characters don't have their flaws, but she really needs to be more creative with her characters if she wants to have anything worthwhile to write about.  Her characters are mostly passive and are never willing to take action to get what they want.  In fact, they almost never take any action at all in the story.   She seems to think that her characters just float around the story like water 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first couple of times I read this book I thought it was just a cleverly worded cover to a book that I already knew.  I thought I would buy this book to read it again when the opportunity came.  The problem is that when you read a bad novel,  it is very hard to come away from it.  This book has to be one of the worst I have ever read.  It is very repetitive and you start to feel like you are reading the same book over and over again.   I just read this for entertainment.  But for those who love to read good books  I do not recommend it to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is one point about an interesting discovery: "The book seems to have been written with an emphasis on the occult, but the discovery is not explored to any great depth 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is written in the voice of an  adolescent girl, as the author, an academic, uses  language and language-related tropes to make the  young characters appear mature and authoritative.  As a result, the readers of this book are left with  only the vaguest notion of who these young characters are or what  kind of relationship  they have with each other.  This is not the work of a master  storyteller; this is the work  of someone trying to sell a book  and, not surprisingly, the book is  not good 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book, but sadly it was filled with inaccuracies. If you want a good book, look elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of errors and blatant lies. I think it is written to get you to buy it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author tells us that the best way to prepare for the LSAT is by practicing logic games.  She writes, "This is a great book for practicing logic problems.  The questions are too difficult for most students, which is why they fail."  This is one of the worst logic games I have ever seen.  It is very hard to remember the answers and the game is so time consuming that it's hard to finish.  If you don't believe me, ask a high school or college student who is struggling with this problem.  This book makes no sense, and yet it is the most popular book in my own high school library 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book because my husband and I were having a difficult time with our daughter, and wanted to read about a successful parent's journey.  It's not bad; it just is.  I don't know what the author was trying to achieve, but I find it very boring.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is very unprofessional, and the book doesn't contain any meaningful examples from real life.  It's a real pain to read, but it's hard to blame this book on the author.  The author is very insecure with his abilities and the results.  If you want to understand anything about business or the reality of life, you'll have to stick with a good book that has real examples.  I'm sure this book was very useful to him when he was writing it, but once he started his actual business, he just threw in tons of self-made ideas that never amounted to anything 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have a hard time recommending this book to anyone. I can say, with confidence, that it is not a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, no. It's a complete mess. It makes no sense. The people who are supposed to represent the American idealism and good ethics are all either being played for fools, or they are lying.The characters that are supposed be moral are all selfish, evil, or have no morals whatsoever. The villains have no reason to be evil and no sense of morality.I have spent more time trying to find out where the hell this book is, than actually reading it.I can only say that the author is a lousy writer.The story is predictable and the author knows it.There's no story line, there's nothing suspenseful about the story, there are no characters to relate to. There's only one character in the whole book, who is an idiot, who does not even know he's an idiot.The best thing about this book? The horrible writing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very negative review. It's not as simple as the authors say. There is a lot of good information but the bad information is far too much. The authors don't seem to understand the scientific way of collecting and analyzing data, how one studies a new data set. The only good information is the bad. There are no pictures. There's no explanation of how to do this in biology. The information is very simplistic. There was a lot more good stuff in the second edition of the book but the authors ignored it. This book has no credibility to me. This is a good book for those interested in understanding a simple scientific method, how to use data and how to determine what is important from what is interesting. If you are not into data analysis this is probably not the book for you. I think the authors need to come up with an original way to present the information. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't agree with all the things you say here, especially the fact that most people don't want to read about themselves. It's like reading a self-help book. What if you want to have a good relationship? How about taking a look at your life, your habits, and making some changes in your life? If you are going to take advantage of the life advice that you get here, try and live with someone that is kind to you, someone who is easy to talk to, and someone that you trust. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of bad information. It's written in a pseudo-scientific way. It claims to be about diet, health and fitness. It says nothing about any of those other areas. It simply tells you how to lose weight, how to prevent illness. It tells you to stay away from food for as long as possible. But it tells you not to eat very much. So it's basically advice to stay a good distance from food. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is poorly written. He uses too many metaphors and it gets confusing and not fun. I have read the book and it is written for a younger audience. I would recommend this book to the parents but for the younger audience this book would do better to be written for younger audiences. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only problem I have with this book is the lack of historical background in it.   I found out a lot about the Crusades during the last few chapters, but then they stopped talking about it in the last chapter.  The next chapter it started up again, and then it ended in chapter twelve.  What a wasted opportunity 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A boring book.  This book is the exact opposite of the original Harry Potter series.  I was so happy when I found it in the bargain bin.  But this book is not for me.  It is all boring.  No magic, no intrigue.  There is not a single good thing in this book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had been planning on buying this book but have not received any updates on when the book will be released. I cannot recommend this book to anyone as it will waste your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish I would have known about this book before the end of this book's run.   The author writes in a self-indulgent fashion.  She describes her own life as  a woman of many sexual conquests.  It is only when the author recounts the details of her first sexual encounter with a man in which she is forced to accept his oral sex that she comes to realize the significance of her life and of the impact of her early experiences with men.  This book is a complete waste of time for any woman.  If you are interested in her life you will be disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If it is so bad, then why bother to put it in the hardcover edition instead of the paperback edition? Why is it a good book for a high schooler but not good for a grown adult?"
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As I mentioned in my review of my bad book, this is a very unoriginal writing style, it is very repetitive, and it is not easy to keep up with it. It is tedious. I would not recommend this book for anybody who is not very interested in ancient languages or writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a waste of paper! I have to admit that the author is a little more eloquent than in the text, and I understand why he wrote a good book for a good cause. However, there is no substance to be found. I felt like this is a waste money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was written by a man, not a woman. There is very little written about the importance of a family and a home life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written in the late 1970's or early 1980's. The book was filled with mistakes, omissions, errors and poor documentation.  The book has no history, no background, no science, and no knowledge about the natural environment.  It was written to be an easy, quick book, with very little information about anything else.  There were no illustrations in the book, and the pictures in the appendix were not in the proper place to allow the pictures to actually be in the same place.  This is NOT the book to use as a primary reference for any type of research or classroom instruction 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not a fan of self-help or personal development books.  This one is too much of the same thing: tell you how  to achieve what you want to achieve, and how you can do it  through good luck and by doing your own  exercises.  Not much of a change from the rest of the self-improvement and personal development   genre.  For what it is worth, I found it helpful to read the other reviews here 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're looking for anything about the Church, there's not much there.  This book is full of contradictions and poor ideas.  We don't have time to argue with you about this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with lies and misstatements.  For example, the title claims that women with children have a much easier time obtaining health insurance, but the actual numbers show the opposite.  The numbers show that women who have children receive much less than men, which is a good reason to get a good book instead of this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping to read this book and it seems that I will need to do some serious searching before I find it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book. It was so boring and tedious. I did not want to read it because I have a long list of books that I want to reread. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing style is awful.  The book consists of over 400 blank pages which are either blank or not filled with anything.  If you don't understand the story, the writing style, or the characters, this book is not for you.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is more about the author's personal development than anything. It is not a good book to read if you are trying to become a better person. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As much as I enjoy reading good books, I will not be reading this book again. The story is not interesting, there are only two characters who are written as if they are having sex and then they go out to a bar and start talking about something else. And no, there is no explanation of why the two characters are having this sex act. If you are looking for a sexy book, this is not the book for you. If there is a reason why the characters are acting this way, I am not sure I can think of it, and I do not intend to read it again. I think the best thing to do is to read a good novel: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is nothing but a collection of short stories 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was the book to keep on the shelf, until it eventually burned out.  The author claims she has a great relationship with her clients but fails to show a close relationship with their own children, or even show a healthy relationship with the father of her children, the husband, John.  He makes numerous poor choices throughout the book and makes the children the focus of his attention and attention he receives.  She does not have the necessary experience to write about what she wants to write or write well.  Even though she is a professional writer, it's a book that she does not understand. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the type of book that I would skip. I think the author doesn't know much about dogs. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are a long time reader of this book, you might get annoyed by his repetition of the same old stories about people being killed in airplane crashes. The book was first published in 1975 and was not updated until 1989. The last update included on the cover is from 2005, and even then is dated, even by today's standards. For those of you that have read this book or one of his earlier books:  I will not argue with this man's claims about people dying in airplane accidents, but I do believe he has a strong point about people that do not want to take the time to make a thorough investigation into the accident. As a matter of fact, we have an increasing number of airplane crashes and, with this book's emphasis on making the situation look good, that is a good thing for those that wish to blame other people and make things seem worse. But the people killed in these crashes have to live their lives without the information being readily available to them. It is a matter that needs to be considered in the future, and will be discussed in the book. However, I find it difficult to believe this is the reason why this book is so outdated and in need of some updating. I think his main reason for this is that he feels there is a need to continue to create a positive reputation for him with the public. It's like having a bad car and being angry that people will not buy a new car. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are an aspiring writer, do yourself a favor and ignore this one.  There is nothing worthwhile in it.  I'm sure the author could tell us all about his work, but he doesn't.  Instead of actually trying to write good books, he goes out and tries to attract the attention of authors, who have nothing to do with his.  No matter how many times I tell him to do better, he just can't do anything else.  He's a fraud.  You can't trust him.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think this was written by a man who was never married, never had kids, never traveled outside of the USA.  He was too busy enjoying the fruits of his imagination.  The women were all there to serve as a prop, or props.  His stories are poorly written, boring, unbelievable 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is nothing more than a rehash of what is already familiar in most other romance novel:  The hero and heroine get engaged, but then the plot turns to the villain's sister and a lot of unnecessary plot contrivances that don't add much to the story.  The characters are bland, the plot is predictable and there's hardly any emotional connection.  It's the romance of a dull, overworked woman who is trying to make a career in a boring field.  I would recommend you to skip it, if you like  it that much 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think the author has done a poor job of researching the history of the Holocaust and has done it in a way that tries to make the reader look bad by quoting him out of context. This isn't the first time that such an approach has been employed and this book is the second installment in a long line. This book has been criticized for the same reasons as the previous book: it lacks background and it gives too much emphasis to the perpetrators' personality traits. This is the book I want to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so disappointed with this book. It was a waste of my time and I can't recommend it to anyone. It's not funny and it's not even funny in the usual sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  In an effort to justify why he is not a fan of the books, the author claims that his favorite author, David Foster Wallace, does not like to write for children.  It is true that Wallace has an awful lot of negative reviews about his own books.  I could not find anything about this author on Amazon 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed with this book.  I felt the author wanted to write a negative book about his negative experience with a bad electronic device.  His book is full of inaccurate and false information.  The material on the book's back cover says there are over two hundred photos.  It is hard to believe anyone would spend that kind of money on photos. I found several photos that were not in the book. I also had to return the book for lack of pictures.  This is a very poor book. The reader has to rely on the pictures. The pictures are often not very good. I returned the book and returned it for good. The book does not contain any information about his electronic device or his experience with it.  He makes it seem like his device is an annoyance or problem. The author does not give any information on how his device works. The book is a work of fiction. It was written by a disgruntled electronic device manufacturer. As a result the book is very difficult to use. He seems to want to write negative reviews about bad electronic devices, but he doesn't present any information to back up his claims. His pictures are very poor, he does not write a lot about his devices, he just takes pictures.I think anyone who has experienced a bad device should not buy this book, but rather should read the books on the subject for information on the device.I do not recommend this book for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was already familiar with his previous works before reading this one. However, in the end I still couldn't understand why he was spending so much time explaining his ideas. I found some of his ideas quite bizarre. I also found his language to be rather tedious and over-used. It's hard to relate to a book that has no plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is all wrong. I wish I hadn't read this book so I could write a positive review. This book is not intended for the general public. It is about the   young people who go through high school. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was pretty disappointed with this book. It seems they just used all of their time on the internet to get famous instead of putting some effort in their work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in a very negative review and I must say:  I disagree with the reviewers.  It is not about how to get a good book, how to make money, how   to make friends, how the   modern life is going to be better with technology, it   is about how we can create a negative   review about 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would like to say that I enjoyed all of the characters in the book, but none of them was as engaging as the main character. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As stated above, this book is a work of fiction. But, to make the readers believe that it is true, it has to have a protagonist, a bad boy like Mr. Scrooge from the Disney version.  But why he is portrayed as the main character of this book, there is not enough to make us believe he was the main protagonist. It would be a good idea to find out more about his real life, or not to get involved with him in the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am going to say I didn't like this book as much as I thought I would.  It is a collection of personal essays written by the author's ex-boyfriend.  He is the one that originally sent her the book and he doesn't tell you much about the book either 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book which is geared toward those who wish to learn about  Buddhism. The author is a teacher, and not much more  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not even sure if this is a series of stories, but it feels like they're all the same story.  They are not funny 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has very little of the interesting history that one could find in the earlier texts and the fact that it is set in a different time period does not seem to add much of value. It is mainly used to present the views of different types of historians: classical, modern, and religious, and even of different periods of human history. What is the point of that? If you're not interested in the various events that occurred during the time period that is set up, you may not be much interested in learning anything more about the historical period that the book is set.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written in the style of a high school memoir, with many spelling and grammatical errors. Most of the information presented in this book is dated. It is not an informative book for the high school student 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is too much information for a beginner in martial arts.  There are not enough exercises for you to use in the real world.  If you have only one book then buy the other.  This is another book on Japanese swordfighting and is about half the price of the first.  I have not read it yet, but it is coming out soon and I don't recommend this book.  For beginners, the techniques in the first two books are fine, but if you want to learn to fight in the street you will be better off with the other one.  The first book is more practical, it will prepare you better for your first fight. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I felt that the author was using the death of an infant to do a dramatic turn. I'm a nurse, and I'm very saddened when a child is not able to survive. Yet the main character goes to a funeral without bothering to bring his own child to the service 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is just another attempt to make a book about the early years of the Mormon Church more popular.  It's not a bad read but it really is not well researched.  Instead it is a short book that contains little to no information about anything that actually happened.  There are a few chapters with anecdotes about Brigham Young and his various wives but they are not that interesting and are really just a collection of anecdotes.  If you are interested in the early life of Brigham Young you won't find any of this in this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has absolutely nothing interesting to say about anything except what he likes or reads.  It was good for him to write about his favorite book in his favorite way,  but it wasn't that good for anyone else.  If you are looking for a good book, this is not the one  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a very poor translation, for the most part it is a translation from the original Italian to English that has some problems. It is hard to understand what is going on for me. I am not sure if the translation was done by someone who has not read this work in Italian or not. I have read it in Italian before and I am very glad I did. This is the only translation I can think of that is so bad and that is a negative point, but it is not my negative point. It does not have any historical meaning, it is just pure fantasy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is very good at telling the story, but is not well enough versed in contemporary social issues to relate to the reader in a meaningful way.  She is often too busy to do more than recite the names of celebrities and athletes.  This isn't even the best part: the author is constantly interrupted and annoyed by some of the people she encounters.  I wouldn't read this book again, especially if I wanted to learn about contemporary issues 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you've ever had to use your word processor to type out a long list of words, it is like this book.  It's boring, hard to follow and has lots of typos.  I'm not buying it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is as shallow as the narrative. Most of the characters in this book were already developed by the time they started in school 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read several reviews of this book, so far, none of them have been particularly helpful. I don't see the point in having a discussion of this subject if it's not to be helpful to the reader. The book should not be the only source of information. If you don't want to read the book, don't waste your time reading it. I thought the first half of the book was interesting, but the second half of it was entirely irrelevant, and that's a shame because I thought it was all fascinating. The only thing I found relevant in the first part was the discussion of the origin of the word "douchebag". The book doesn't bother with any of this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not recommend this book to anyone,  it doesn't do anything for your life 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written for adults and is no more useful to a child.  The child reader must have an understanding of the characters' lives and events, otherwise, it's hard for a child to relate to this book.  I hope the author will write a new book for children and make it as useful as this one is to an adult.  There is no way a child could possibly enjoy a book like this for the sake of entertainment."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an advertisement for the book on which it is based.  This, of course, makes it less effective.  The book should not be used as a promotional tool for its subject matter.  All of these are made clear to the reader by the author.  It is not very clear to me as to why the author has chosen to use this format.  I would expect that the same techniques that would be applied to a marketing brochure, which would not be advertised, would be utilized here.  That, however, is a subject for another book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a great book, but unfortunately the authors didn't understand that the idea of reading as a form of relaxation is the whole point of the book. And, of course, it would have been better if the book was written in an English language so that we could read it while relaxing in a chair or reclining on a pillow. But no, the book is written in Chinese. And then there's the bad jokes. I couldn't even look at a page for more than 5 minutes and felt like I had read it already. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read many books, but this one  has nothing to do with anything 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I don't like it at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author does nothing but repeat the same story over and over again. She takes so much time talking about nothing and then spends it on a long description of a boring couple of episodes about a girl and a dog 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be full of errors and bad information.  I believe I have read about five other books and this book is the worst 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished this book, and I have a bad feeling about it.  The writing is sloppy, the stories are not well thought out, the characters are not complex, the plots are not coherent and logical.  I don't even like reading the names of these fictional persons.  My favorite character is the one that gives birth to her baby, but there are other characters, who have different personalities, with the same names.  But, the point of this book is not to understand these characters, but to use them for plot development.  There is no depth to the characters.  Each character is a stereotypical hero, villain and anti-hero.  Some characters are presented differently in different chapters, some are more developed.  All the characters, even the hero of the story, don't appear to be strong.  They're all just cardboard cutouts.  I don't understand how they could have any other way to develop the stories.  In the beginning, the main plot, with all the characters and the actions is the main reason why this book exists.  It does not develop in any other chapter.  Even if these characters were interesting to read, the plot wasn't interesting, and there is no way it could have developed any more.  After all, they have not been introduced to this society and all the possibilities that that might open up to them.  As I said, I'm really disappointed that this book was only about two hundred pages long.  And that's not counting the pages I wasted on the boring ending. It just isn't worth reading the rest of the book, because it didn't even start to make any sense.  So, if you really want to enjoy this book for a short time, maybe go to the beginning.  This book can be read in the beginning as well.  Just remember, you can't have fun while reading this book.  Otherwise, you won't enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very bad.  It is repetitive, boring, and the characters are very uninteresting.  This is one of those books you have to read twice in order to finish it.  You will not get any benefit from reading this book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is only interesting for children who are into Disney. This book is NOT recommended for a child to read in their spare time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The content of this book is interesting, but the style is extremely dull.  I would rather have read a few other more interesting books about sports, like  Jim Lefkowitz's  books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sure all the other reviewers will agree, but I found the narrative boring and the illustrations uninspiring. It's a good book for students and for anyone interested in history, but nothing else. I don't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The problem I had with this book was that it was very boring. I found that I was bored while reading it. It didn't make me want to get out and practice anymore. The only way I was able to get myself excited for this book, was to read it aloud to my friends. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What you get from this book is that the author has no idea how to do something, does not have any confidence in himself, and is completely out of his league 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title implies it is the ultimate guide to "getting by" in life, but it is far too much about how  you are likely to do things  for the next six months and that is the only thing about  life that is not worth  thinking about. The book is about "getting away"  from your obligations and what you want to do. I  didn't even bother to get the book from Amazon,  because that is just too much  effort for the amount of  information it provides. I read the introduction and just  tossed it in the trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A collection of self-help and self-improvement seminars written by some of the most overqualified personalities on the face of the planet.  I have heard so many terrible lectures from them that I've forgotten about the book.  The authors, however, have a habit of coming up with their own solutions to problems they face.   Their material is not that well organized and not worth the time.  They spend a lot of time talking about personal growth without showing any action, which is also a disservice 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author seems to be of the opinion that all women are in love with and want to have children with rich men.  Well, that may be the case to some extent.  But, then again, I am sure she is not alone.  If you find yourself wondering,  "What is wrong with the author?  Why is she not writing about the issues she brings up in her other books   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not a fan of this book, but this was my first time ever reading it. I was given three options:  The whole book was a piece of crap. The first two chapters were about a woman in the 50s, trying to be a good, educated, but not worldly lady in the 21st century. It was so unbelievable, that I couldn't even keep going with the book. I gave up on it in two chapters. The next two chapters, however, were just as annoying. There was always more of the same, and I couldn,t put it down 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book extremely offensive to African Americans and I'm still having to work through it. The book attempts to make a positive case for a positive lifestyle, but fails miserably 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It was very hard to understand this book.  I am a mother of two children, both boys, and the author gives this book so much bad advice.  She tries to show you the right way to do things.  In the end, she tells you you need to do everything wrong.  You need to let your child play with a toy that won't let him eat his food.  When she tried to tell us what we could do, instead of using her own examples she resorted to using the worst example that she could find.  This book is not going to be good for your child.  This book is supposed to help you teach your child to become a good parent, but she doesn't give any examples of what you need 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In all fairness, there is a reason I'm so much more critical of the book than any other, which is:  It is based on a real life incident.  It takes place during one of the most challenging, painful, and stressful times in my life.   It has nothing to do with me or the pain and the suffering I'm going through at the time.  But the way the author portrays me is  completely ridiculous,  and I don't care if this is true or not

Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's not a bad book, but its not for anyone  but those who already know their Jewish identity and   who have seen movies like  Exodus: Gods and Kings and The Last Days of Judas 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author has a way of doing that. This is one of the more boring and confusing books you can get for a student. The author is definitely trying to teach  the student to know about the material, but I would not recommend this book to  someone who wants to learn about mathematics. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a collection of stories that are too short and too generic for any child to enjoy. The fact that the stories contain no characters that the reader could identify with is a mistake too many authors make. There are only two scenes in each of the five books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is based on a true story, yet it lacks realism. It focuses on a couple of people living in a rural Texas setting, with no mention of why they live there. It's easy to see why they're drawn to the area because of their love for horses and cattle, but there's no character development, just a series of one-sided scenes and descriptions. The book also doesn't contain any photos, so the reader doesn't get a chance to see the horses, cows, or even the scenery. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title is very misleading. I read this book with the idea that I would learn the secrets of the famous Russian painter. Instead, I learned the mistakes and mistakes that made this book so embarrassing. For example:  All his paintings are unrealistic, and he didn't learn from that mistake in any of his later paintings.  This book is boring, and I'm sure you're tired of reading this by now. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only one who doesn't seem to be having much fun, is Ms. Lively.  She talks a good book but only a little bit about what the story is about.  If you're reading this book, you should have read her other books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel like I should've read this book from cover to cover before wasting my money.  The book is very shallow.  It doesn't take place in a real world, and isn't an autobiography, which is a real shame.  I really hope that Ms. O'Reilly learns from her mistakes and writes a more informative book about her life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you're going to read this book you'll read it and be irritated by the fact that she repeats herself so much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had high hopes for this book. However, once I started reading this book, my high hopes were dashed. The author is a complete plagiarist. He doesn't understand grammar, spelling, the proper names of various foods. Most importantly, he makes numerous grammatical errors in the same sentence. He makes up for these mistakes by inventing completely nonsensical stories.The main character in this story is an over-confident, arrogant and entitled young man, who is too preoccupied with the idea of having money to bother with real problems. He spends the book trying to win the affections of one of the young women who he believes will be impressed by his money. As far as I'm concerned this story has been pulled out of the air by some sleazy money hungry man. It just doesn't seem that Mr. Johnson could have written this book any other way, and yet he did. It's very disappointing to learn that a good book could be so bad. I will definitely not be buying any other Mr.Johnson books because of this one. The only saving grace is that the book contains plenty of interesting topics. The book was interesting to read, but it's definitely a waste of money if you're not willing to read through this book again and again. If you've got a hard time not laughing out loud when reading Mr. Jondos' 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As a child of the seventies, I knew my mom had a collection of books.  This was not one of her favorites.  The photos were all over the place and the plot was incoherent.  Her kids liked it and my brother and I just did not 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was not a big fan of this book.  I read the first three chapters and thought they were a little too funny for my taste.  There was just too much funny stuff in this book for me to finish it. I found the last chapter to be the most difficult.  It was just way too funny.  The characters were too funny to read about in this kind of fashion 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a bad  book. No story line, no ideas. It's a series of stories that don't belong together, and are all repetitive 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is just more of the same old crap. It is like this author is trying to convince the reader of how wonderful it is to be single, successful and free of responsibilities. He is wrong 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like it at all. The descriptions of the places are completely inaccurate and don't make any sense. I also found some of the dialogue somewhat awkward. The story doesn't have anything interesting about it. I'll have to give up on reading anything from this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has nothing to do with the topic of this book.  The book is mostly about a self-destructing love affair.  It's not as good as the first book. It's more of a self destructing book. I don't see the appeal of that format to me.  I would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't so self-absorbed.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title says it all, this book is full of clichés and just not good for learning about the subject matter in the manner it's meant. I would rather read a good book about that subject matter rather than this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author tries to explain the importance of a good relationship between a man and woman by discussing the love story between a boy and his little sister.  The story is interesting but the book loses its focus and gets heavy on the plot.  This book is filled with unrealistic situations.  A good relationship is more of a spiritual thing and not something you're looking for, especially if you're young.  It is not written in a manner that makes it seem like the author is trying to impress anyone but a teeny, tiny number of women.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was excited about this book when I first picked it up, but it has been discontinued in my area. There is a newer version of this book available at a different electronic store. It's sad but I guess that's the way it is 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a big advocate of a good book and this one just wasn't any good.  I think you just need to find some new topics to cover in a book, not in a series of short stories. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of bad information.  All the facts are made up and they don't back up the information.The information that is available are often contradictory.The book tries to be all things to all people but it's just a lot of hard work that gets in the way of the information being understood.  I recommend skipping this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has many problems. The content is generally very outdated and it takes the reader out of the situation. However, there is a lot of useful information in the book. You have to find the right subject matter and take the time to learn. I do not recommend this book for students of science. I have not read the book myself and I have a fairly low science background. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title of the book is "The Devil is in the Details: An Account of Unethical Behavior in Hollywood"  If there was a little something special in this book, it was only a superficial aspect.  The book itself reads like a lot of gossipy stories written about Hollywood stars, celebrities, and those that are in the public eye, in this case, the actors, actresses, and musicians.  To call this book unprofessional is probably an understatement.  I would say that it was written in a self-serving manner 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an easy read that doesn't really explain anything. The book makes no sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book was very disappointing. It wasn't really an interactive book because there was no way you could really interact with the characters. They would only say,'say hello' and then you would have to wait for them to turn around in their chairs before they would talk to you.The author was just too lazy to even make the characters move. I mean, it was such a shame that these characters could only be interacted with in this way. This was a bad thing. I would have liked the book to be more interactive with the readers.I also couldn't see any value in the characters' memories. I wasn't sure if it was the way the author wrote them that made them so unreliable or if it had something to do with their personalities. In the end, I had to give up on the book. I felt I was not interacting with these characters. And when they turned around, they still wouldn't talk to me or even look at me.I mean, why should I give up?I know how hard it is to write a good book, but in my opinion, it is much easier to interact with your characters. This book only had a positive side. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the worst books I've ever read. It's filled with lies and self deprecation. I have never been a religious person. The author says that all religion is bad and then goes on to list a few religions that I don't subscribe to: Jainism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know what to say about this book: not much of it is factual. The pictures, though, are very amusing. But it's the bad writing that will make or break a collection. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book for the first time last night and I'm going to give up.  It really wasn't that bad.  I mean, I do not know why there was so much fuss made about this book.  If it was only about two chapters out of the 4 I read, I would have finished it in a few days.  This book, as I said before, was simply a plot to sell a book. It was pure exploitation of poor women who, for some unknown reason, thought they were better than men.  That's it.  All of this was about the men. And the women were only there to be objects to be objectified.  No wonder that's the case:  I thought there were more female characters in this book than male characters.  The men don't even exist.  So, this is the reason it was so bad. There is no character development.  Just the sexualization of men, women, and objects.  None of it was good enough to keep me from finishing it. If I was honest with myself, I probably should have given up on it already.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very bad book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a typical book on the same subject. All the information you read about in there is useless. No pictures, no table of contents, no description, nothing. You'll never find any information on the web about the book. The book is written in an annoying manner. The chapters are the same. I have already read it twice 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is just as boring as I am. I will pass it on to my students, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know where to begin  I feel that this book is full of inaccurate information and is nothing more than a collection of examples 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the many works that I've read by the same author and it is as much a copy of his earlier work as anything else 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book's authors take some liberties with history and facts. I wish he could take the time to actually do any research and write a real history book rather than an inaccurate "history for kids." The book also has several historical inaccuracies like the Battle of the Bulge being in France, not Germany, and there was not a war with Austria when it was being fought in Austria. The author tries to cover a lot of ground with his history. But this book is no good for adults. This book is very boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written for a very small, but very self-centered, audience.  It is written to promote a particular book of hers (I believe she wrote her own book)  It seems like the author has forgotten or neglected the actual content of the book, and instead has written the most basic, basic, basics.  But this is her writing style, so you can see that that's what she wants to write about.  There are few things in the book to entice a woman to think about her husband, and little to convince a woman that her marriage is not on a downward slide  The author has written over 20 books over the past 10 years, and has written no more than 20 books in this book, so this is the only one I can find, and the only ones she is writing about.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the writing to be very poor. The characters, while they may have their flaws, didn't have enough to make up for the lack of substance. It was very difficult to understand anything that was being said, no matter how hard I tried. And there was nothing about the book that explained the differences between human beings and animals 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The plot is weak. There are no real characters. It just goes back and forth to show how the couple meet and how the child is conceived. Nothing is done to develop the characters nor do we get to know the child. The story is pretty lame 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author has no idea what to do with this book. The story doesn't seem to be progressing, and the language is very awkward. There's a lot of plot inconsistencies too. What would be a good story for a young adult book, if you're a young one? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book back in 2003 and I loved it and still do but it just wasn't good for my   reading style and style of thinking.  The book is supposed to have the reader get a feel for the  situations they are in but it didn't work for me.  I think I was expecting the whole book to be about that  situation so it wasn't what I was hoping for 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have never read this book before. This is my second attempt.  I just wish they had given him a couple of years to write his next book.  His writing style is very choppy and seems very disorganized.  The characters were so cliché that I felt they were written for a comedy show.  There was nothing funny about any of it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't usually give this bad book five stars, but for a book about religion, I'm forced to give it a one.  I was disappointed.  The author was so close to reality, she could have written about life in my family.  That's not how books about religion work, folks.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sorry to say that this book has absolutely no information about anything other than the fact that the girl is dead. The author is trying to get the reader to read his book to see what happens to the girl, but unfortunately for him, the reader doesn't care about that. What the book gives you is information about the family who are on the verge of becoming vampires, but not anything about what happens with the girl in the last few chapters. I wouldn't waste my time reading this book, but then again, I wouldn the the one that was already in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If this is a "how to" book, please use Google instead of this book. The book is very basic and the author seems to only know how to take a picture. I bought it based on the good reviews and it was a good book but  I would have never purchased a picture book on my first try. It took me three tries to purchase this book but I have to give a lot of credit to the authors 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave it 2 stars only because it has some good tips for getting over a breakup. But for me, the only advice about getting over is:  Get over. Get it over 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title of this book is deceptive. This book is about a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book should not have been published and is now used as a source by many to help them deal with their own mental illness. While the author does point out that mental illness is not an easy illness to deal with, the author's treatment of the subject is heavy handed and unrealistic. He spends most of the book telling people what they need to do and how to "handle" it, but fails to provide any advice for how to cope with the disease itself. For people with mental illness or depression this book is not for them, this book would only help someone feel better if they had already overcome their illness. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a lot of books on meditation, but this one, by a very accomplished Buddhist scholar, was the first I ever read about the practice.  The book had many good things to say, but there were some critical points that were not addressed, such as the dangers of using high doses of bohayana (one of the main meditative methods) and the danger of excessive reliance on breath as a form of meditation.  For such reasons, it was difficult to follow the story.  I just couldn't believe it was a book about vipassana meditation 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved every word but was not pleased with the amount of information given to the reader. I read this book before reading the other three for comparison. I will be looking for more information about the lives of the people the author is describing, as well as for the rest of the text. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I've ever read.  It's all about the horrors of the universe, not about life.  The concept of life is completely absent from the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book should be used as a guide to some good fishing, and the way to do it is to take your fish to the edge of the lake in a small boat. I have never been to the lake but I do like fishing the lake, but I think there are several things about this book that are wrong. The boat is the only way to make it to the fishing area, so if the boat is not on the water when you get to the area, you don't have a lot of options 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  In her attempt to justify her own writing, Mrs. Gossett gives the impression of a naive girl whose mother's influence is not well established and whose father is a drab, uninterested husband. The writing is not original or convincing. The main character is written as a blank slate. The book contains many inaccuracies that she attributes to the reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are too many contradictions, mistakes, etc. There is a lot of self-promoting and self-aggrandizing which makes it very difficult for anyone who enjoys reading good writing to enjoy this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In my opinion this is the worst book ever to be published. It is a complete waste of space that does not make any sense. I have already had people tell me they hated this book. Not worth the time of even thinking about 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Too many inaccuracies and half-truths are included, and the book is written in a manner that is not easily explained to the reader. The author doesn't seem to have much knowledge about the subject matter. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a former Army intelligence officer, I found the book to be inaccurate. The book states the Soviets never used the V-2 rocket. The Soviets did launch it from their Vostochny Cosmodrome but the Vostok satellite launch facility was built in Russia. The rocket never made it into orbit. I also found that the book did not mention that during the Cold War, the CIA was able to intercept and decipher Soviet communications. The CIA was so effective that even their enemies thought the US was winning the war. The author clearly was not well informed on the CIA. This book was intended for military personnel. This would include those who were involved in intelligence gathering.I was not disappointed. I learned little about the Cold war, nothing about espionage, no information about the intelligence community. All the information in this book was either wrong, outdated, or completely out of date. I would not recommend this book to anyone, and I highly doubt that anyone would find it useful. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've bought it twice and each time I felt cheated out of the joyous experience. This book is not for anyone who wants to learn a new language or for students who want to write well.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an attempt to make it appear as if he was born in an upper class household. As soon as it gets to the point that it becomes apparent he is from the underclass, the book begins to fall apart. This author obviously never met a book that he did not like. I'm really surprised he spent the time he did with this book and I will not waste any time reading any of the others he has written 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I would have thought that writing a negative negative review for a bad science book would be a very bad idea, but it's even worse than I thought.  A huge percentage of the content is irrelevant, and there is nothing in the book that is helpful.  The information that is available is outdated and sometimes is just a rehash of something from a book published 15 years ago.  I know that there are people out there that really love to read about scientific research, and I know they will get something out of it, but there is little to recommend this book other than the information and the fact that you'll have to spend $5.00 dollars to get a good copy online.  It will be more helpful to just look through the library for the materials, but for the money, I'm not sure that's a good idea. I think that if you are an avid reader of science, this book would work for you, but if you aren't, this isn't the book for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have bought many of the books written by  Dr. Schlesinger and have always enjoyed his writings. This  was the first of these he wrote in the 1990's 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The chapters are a total of 11. The book has many inconsistencies with other authors' work. There are not enough pictures or descriptive material in the book, so it's a little hard to understand what the book is about. I think that a good book for those who enjoy reading and do not care about the subject matter. I thought the book was okay, but it wasn't something I would recommend to others. I will not buy this book again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author, not only fails to give readers the details about what is happening in Iraq today, but also seems to be saying that the war is in Iraq's best interests - that's pretty ridiculous, since the US is not in Iraq to keep it there. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is nothing wrong with the title of this book; however, the contents of the book are NOT. This book covers only a small part of the issues that many men face on a regular basis in today's world. What this book fails to include are the men who have been victimized by sexual abuse and rape. What is also missing is the men that are working with these abused individuals to help them overcome the challenges that have been placed in their lives by their abusers. I would highly recommend that anyone that is interested in overcoming their challenges and changing their lives to become successful men look into the many men's issues organizations out there and see who is working for the men's issue. This is not the book for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed to read that there is no mention of anything that he did not write about. There is no chapter of his life of interest. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I liked the idea of the journey as much as I hated the execution of the story.  It was as if the author had never been a child and instead of trying to relate the book to his own experience, instead tried to create a unique fantasy world in which children live.  I don't know about you, but I am very much the type of person who would never read a book from an unknown author.   It's hard to imagine a story like that translating into real life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book claims to offer answers to many of life's most pressing questions: what is a good diet, what is happiness, what does the heart really feel like, how to love, etc. However, as a result of the author's excessive love of food and eating, it seems the authors don't even understand what it means to be truly healthy. I am surprised how the book treats health with such a slanted, one-sided approach that has made so many of us so uncomfortable about our bodies.   This book is intended to be for a specific audience, but as a person who has spent much of her life working in the health field, I find myself feeling that these authors are too concerned with the health of the body to offer real answers to life's big questions.  Perhaps we should be asking these kinds of questions ourselves. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not a bad novel but not worth reading 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book for an upcoming holiday at a cabin and while it was an enjoyable book it was lacking something. The subject matter was enjoyable and the writing was fine. However, the cover art was extremely disappointing. I am disappointed that I am wasting my money on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm glad I didn't buy this book. I found it too self-aggrandizing and my kids couldn't relate.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the first bad book I have ever read. All the others have been good, but this one just wasn't very interesting. I ended up reading it for the second time, but it wasn't any better. I don't have any expectations for it or anything, but I just feel like I'm not learning anything about science in this book. There are so many scientific terms I don;t understand and I feel like the author was trying too hard to explain things to me. There is no way this book is going to be a good read for anyone other than the very knowledgeable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is an absolute disappointment for anyone that likes history, particularly the history of the Roman Empire. It is not only a historical work but also an attempt to argue for Christianity and for the legitimacy of the state. This is not a history lesson, but rather an attack on the Roman Republic and the Roman Church. This book is more for the sake of the book than for the history itself. It was a real letdown for my husband who thought that the book had interesting information to say about the time period. He found it very interesting in its own right but that does not change the fact that it is completely flawed in its presentation. The author gives the impression that she is some kind of historical expert but she fails to show what her opinions are based on. This does not make for a good book and will only make it seem more and more that this is her opinion of the history. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would give this book only one star. If you are expecting to find out about some of the greatest mathematicians of the last century you will be disappointed. The book is not about the life of a mathematician, but about the lives of mathematicians. There are more than twenty-five pages devoted to descriptions of famous mathematicians in the pages that follow. No wonder you have never seen such a book written: I was expecting something more sophisticated like the work of the great Mathematicians of our time. Instead, I got a book that was written to make the reader feel as if he or she was sitting in a lecture room, listening to lectures about great mathematicians, rather than sitting at his or her work desk or living with them. Not that you wouldn't love to see them all, just not as much as you would in the middle of a good book about the greatest ever mathematicians: a wonderful book that is far too short.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really do not recommend this book. It was extremely repetitive, poorly written, and lacked character development. It is clear that the authors have taken the wrong approach to writing the book. Instead of writing in a descriptive, compelling manner, they wrote in a "I don't know why I bothered to finish it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is an extremely boring book that tries to do everything  wrong. There is absolutely no real history of the area. No historical references and little to no actual research 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're trying to be a writer, you might want to reconsider 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's full of inaccuracies.  The author, despite using as many of these 'facts' in the book, never actually says this in the actual book.  Instead, it's just used to bolster the point that the book is about Christianity and not science.  I was very disappointed in this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is atrocious and the style is terrible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has little to no information in it to support its claims. It is simply a collection of stories told from multiple perspectives. The first half of the book is a compilation of the stories from the perspective of the author's parents.  These stories are not only unrealistic, they are downright laughable.  The author, in other words, does not actually believe in her own stories, and thus doesn't bother to provide any real information about them. In addition, the author doesn't really even bother to write the stories; instead, she simply tells them to her readers from multiple points of view. If you want to read this book, skip the first half, and read from the second.  As a result, you end up reading like a number of other young adult romances written by other young adults in the last few years.  If you are a serious young adult reader, you might want to wait until the author stops repeating the same stories.  But if you're a young adult author, you don't have to do that, and your readers don't either.  This is yet another collection of lazy and ill thought-out romances that the author chooses to use to write her books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is an inordinate amount of information for such a small amount of text.  The writing is sloppy.  It will be a great deal of effort to figure out exactly what she means in the chapters she presents in this book, or to summarize the chapters in order for a casual reader to follow the material.  This is a bad, bad book for anyone, much less a high schooler.  If you are reading this book as a student, consider it a waste of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was so bad I almost skipped over the whole thing.  All of the pictures were out of focus and in the center of the picture were the words.  What is the point of doing that if you don't read the whole book?  It was so obvious in my eyes why no one else did 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is supposed to be a guide for the young and experienced. But how is it possible to get anything out of it? If you don't like writing, this book is for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a complete waste of money and time, and very little will change, if you are already looking for more information on the subject, go for a good book about a good subject like the history of France and other parts of Europe. Don't buy this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the book to be extremely frustrating and pointless. There is absolutely nothing in the book that can give one any confidence to go through the process of applying for a mortgage.  I'm glad I read the book, but I doubt it will help me get a mortgage."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had very high expectations for this book, and I'm not disappointed. It is the story of a lonely man and his relationship to an elderly woman. This is probably the only story that is completely wrong in the book. The elderly woman spends every waking moment thinking of the elderly man, never seeing him, never communicating with him, and never showing any interest in her son. The story is very flat. The characters never change in any way. The older man only shows interest in other women. The women only show interest in the elderly woman, as she is completely oblivious to him and is his only friend. If you're a fan of books about love and family, read this book. If not, you will waste your time. It's a terrible book, but the author is a self-absorbed snob and his story is shallow and boring. He has no real talent for writing, so he uses his talent for snobbery to make up for his mediocre story and characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book doesn't really tell you much.  I didn't understand anything in the book.  It is so full of unnecessary information that I feel the author did not put much effort into the book's development.  The book is a little more about the author's own thoughts on his own life, and is the type of book that has many examples of the writer's own experience, but it doesn't have the kind of depth that you might expect from a psychological novel. I feel the book was a poor choice for a teenager who is trying to learn about how to live his life. The author was very passive aggressive about it and I felt it was unfair to the reader who is looking for insight into his own personality.  I found the book a bit frustrating, since I didn not have much of a passion for it either way, but I did not think the book suffered. It could have been much better if the author had been more active in developing the book in terms of development of his own thoughts. If this book were written by someone who loved writing, there is no doubt that it could have turned out great. That's not saying much, since that is the case for nearly all of life's experiences. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a typical example of the bad literature that has invaded American and Western civilization.  I don't particularly like it.  The whole premise is that the main character (Linda) is the reincarnation of a princess and she has to keep her royal family hidden from her people so she can gain power.  That is the only thing the book ever shows.  As for the rest, there is nothing.  It is just a bunch of crap about the "dark side" and evil people and souls.  Linda's actions in these parts are dictated by the plot and plot lines.  She becomes evil or good and there is no real change in her behavior, even when the characters are on the verge of death.  There is just too much plot and nothing else, so there is very little action. In fact, I found the book frustrating to read because I didn't feel anything for Linda and I didn''t really care for the characters.  It is all about Linda and her relationship with the King and I felt like I was reading a bad romance book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am not a fan of the books from these authors. The style is too loose and too much of the story is explained too much. I did not like the ending and I didn't enjoy the book overall. I would recommend that this book only be read by those who have no interest in fantasy or adventure.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't read this until two months after I started this book. I still have the book in my library, but it's hard to get through it this way. If this book is written for the sole purpose of selling copies, I think I'll be back to the Goodreads page for all future reviews. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I could not understand how he could give so much negative feedback about this book, even if it was a bad one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a horrible book with a terrible plot.  There are no explanations of characters. There is no development of the story. In fact, the story seems to be abandoned at the start of the book. When the characters do come up with their own explanations of things, there is no way for the reader to follow through 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete failure. It's not a bad, no-frills book; it's a textbook. It takes the book format of most other books, and mixes it with a lot of dry academic, pseudo-academic language that I've read a million times before and will never remember anything about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is written to help people do their own research on these things. However, what you learn from reading it is not necessarily what you need to know to make money doing these activities. So I have a hard time saying that I found the information helpful in any capacity, and certainly not for me as an instructor of martial arts and self defense. This book is mostly about how to get people to come and buy your book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I've ever seen.  It's not a bad title, but the writing is awful and the stories don't make any sense to me.  This was a waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the second book I have read in this series and it is no better than the previous one. I can't even start this book since I'm not interested in the story line anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to force myself to finish reading the book because I was so irritated that I was having such bad flashbacks and was having a bad time in the novel. I didn't have any trouble reading it. It was a good book but it didn't work for me. As I said, I did not like the novel, but this book did not have that kind of appeal to me. I thought that the only way I would like this book was if it was a romance. But it was not.  If you don't like romance, you will not like this one. The story is about a good girl named Elizabeth and a bad boy named Billy. They do not seem to find each other in the beginning of the book. In the beginning, the bad boy has been making trouble for Elizabeth. However, in the middle of the novel Billy and Elizabeth are both in love with each other. Both the bad boys are the bad guys in this novel. In the end, Billy has finally got Elizabeth to love him and that's when Elizabeth goes crazy. There was nothing interesting about Elizabeth. It didn't make much of a difference if she was the good girl or the bad girl. We just weren't introduced to any new characters. Elizabeth's story ended after her death. Not a good end for Elizabeth."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's interesting that she mentions only four novels that have been published since 1989, and then only three more are mentioned by the end. The fourth book of her series was published only in 1998, so it has been 20 years since this is a new series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be lacking in content and information. It would be better if the author would put a little more emphasis on the importance of a good diet. She never tells the reader anything about why a person is unhealthy and why they should change their eating habits. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is too shallow. I read the summary before starting and found it wanting. The information in the book is interesting, but it is very limited. If this was a book that was meant to tell about the actual world of life and death, this would be the best book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is one of the best books for people who think they know what they are talking about, but don't know a thing about programming. This book talks a lot about'real world' stuff (e.g. data structures, algorithms, etc) that many people have trouble with, but not very many. You'll quickly realize that it is all about theory, and most of the 'examples' will simply be 'routine' stuff for you. You may learn something here and there, but for the most part it will simply not help you much. This is not to say that this is a bad thing, mind you, just that it won't really help you learn much. If you are only looking to get started with programming, then this book is not for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is all about the past and the present. As someone who has been an avid student of the Church for decades, this book does nothing but reinforce a lack of awareness of the history and teachings of the Catholic Church. As an example of the lack of historical knowledge, one of the chapters describes the Roman Catholic Church's view on slavery as one of history's greatest tragedies. However, the author himself does not agree that the Catholic hierarchy as a whole is anti-slavery, and the chapter was written to prove that point, and it does not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it difficult to get the point across to the reader.  I got through the book quickly but it's a difficult read for me to recommend it to others.  It's more of an interesting anecdote than anything.  The narrator's attitude is very self-deprecating.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book I couldn't finish. I was looking forward to the end, but the book ended much too late. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author, John Taylor, is a well-known conspiracy theorist and a member of the Roswell crash hoax. He even has a whole video about it:  It is not worth buying his book, which was written to convince the gullible that a UFO landed in Roswell, New Mexico on July 8, 1947. If you want to know more about this theory, go to www.wnd.com/2001/Roswell and www.thexenu.com for more information. John Taylor also claims that the CIA was behind this event. His book also promotes the idea that some of the bodies were sent to the grave in caskets. There are many flaws in his book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is all too true. The book is not even true to the style of the author. It is the style from the early 20th century. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought this was an interesting idea to use as a backdrop for one's personal life. However, the author clearly was not going for the subtlety of a good novel. Her stories were often sensationalistic and often the readers were the ones that suffered. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the last book written by Dr. Robert F. Stoller about the UFO phenomena. It was published in 1987 and then shelved in 1996. It is a pretty pathetic book that tells a lot of half-baked stories about the aliens and the alien artifacts. There are no good stories, only bad ones. The only story told is that of the alien invasion, which never happened. There is no proof of the invasion, no photos, no alien artifacts, etc.The book makes a lot out of aliens' and UFO's flying around at the time of the UFO crash. That is the story we are supposed to believe. This story is not believable because it does not exist, it's all the aliens' imagination. There was no UFO crash, and the crash occurred years later. The aliens did not come to Earth looking for humans to take away our precious Earth. These aliens came here and decided to crash the plane because the Earth was not perfect enough. If you are interested in UFOs, check out the books by Richard C. Hoagland, Frank R. D'Arrest, and William F. Newman that are available on the bookstores. I did not get the UFO stuff that Dr. Stoller does because it wasn't written by him. Dr. Dostoevsky, George Orwell, etc., are a much better source for this stuff.The aliens are supposed do some strange stuff like fly around and eat humans. However, we never see any of the aliens do anything weird. The story about the alien abduction of a young woman is also nonsense. The girl is taken to a place that is supposedly haunted by the aliens but it never really gets dark. And when we see the aliens in the first half of the book, we can easily tell they are just figments of the girl's imagination. The book does not tell us why the aliens have abducted the girl. They do not say they want to eat us, they say they are abducting a young lady. It does not even bother to tell us anything about the girl or her condition. She is never seen again and we never even see her again. We do not even know her name. There never is anything like this in any of her stories.We never see her in the pictures. She has her hair up in a bun. And she never has a lot to do with the aliens. There's a lot going on in this book, so much that it's difficult to
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The main problem is with all the references and footnotes. It is hard to keep track of who wrote what. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not too good of a book for a first reading. I found the stories much too predictable. The plot would seem the same every time but the characters change their minds at the last minute and make all the same mistakes.  The ending left much to be desired as well. Overall, this book is no great masterpiece. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is deceptive. It's not like the book is going to tell us the truth about life. It just tells you about the "truth" that you already believe in and want to believe in. I found it very difficult to believe and find any sense in the book. The author did not seem to understand that it was possible for one to love someone, hate them, and even hate themselves. The book seems to be about finding someone to love, while at the same time avoiding the truth. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very basic introduction to philosophy and the mind. This is what many people learn in college and for some reason, I never had much of a connection with this subject.  I was expecting a more profound work but was disappointed.  Not very well written for this type of subject, either 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want to be a realist about the human condition, you should not read this book. It's full of clichés and self-pitying. It would be a lot easier to read the books by people who are truly sad, desperate or suffer from some mental condition.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read through the entire book and it was all done in a flash. The only thing I liked about it was the fact that she knew a lot about the various religious cults that existed in her time. But, then, it all went to crap when she began writing about her first marriage. I am not one to fall for these stories of women who do whatever they want, even though I know they are all true. I guess it was too bad that this book was written by a woman who was very successful and enjoyed making money from her husbands, because it left such a negative impression on me

Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is not an accurate biography. This is just the author's version of his life. The story is not as interesting as the author gives it.The subject matter and the characters of the story are not the same. It is the author of the book's fault that the characters are different. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is interesting to read about the lives of famous people.  But the real interest is in the historical characters.  The story is more about the people than the people themselves.  So far the only historical characters I've read are Napoleon and Napoleon's nephew.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought it was a great book for a beginner on the basics of meditation. However, for a regular meditator, it did not give me any practical understanding. The writing style was also confusing, and the book's style wasn't conducive to understanding. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, I agree with a negative reviewer about this book: he makes a lot of generalizations about a lot  of religions.  The author talks about a good way to deal with the problems of religion is by finding a way to be agnostic in your life.  I don't think that's the right way to approach life 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book, you will find everything about the history of the Church from its origins to its present day, but with the added drawback of  the lack of a sound history of Mormonism itself.  I'm not sure how this is allowed to exist  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book will only serve to confuse and frustrate anyone looking for some guidance about how to make a good relationship.  I have been with my boyfriend for 2 years now, and we have 3 wonderful children. I am an introvert, and my boyfriend is extroverted, so it is very challenging to meet each other and make a lasting relationship.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is very much like a typical young adult novel: young adults who are trying to figure out who they are.  I did find the story more interesting than what I expected.  The character was  too childish for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It has nothing to do with the subject, it's an essay with several paragraphs on the writing and the book. It is full of self-adultery and narcissism 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is terrible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author has no knowledge of her subject, and most of the illustrations are drawn in such a way as to make the book almost unwatchable. I would strongly discourage anyone from reading this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are interested in learning about and practicing meditation, this is a bad choice.  It is full of repetitive images, words, and pictures that are irrelevant to the practice.  There are some good ideas in here, but not enough to make it worth the time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author gives a bunch of examples of bad writing, and then writes about his own mistakes in the same book.  This book is full of examples 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I liked this book, and it was good. However, it was the author's choice of subject matter that made it a flop.  It was more about the  personality of the author than anything else.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want to learn something about a culture that doesn't interest you at all, read this book! It would have been more interesting if the author had not been a graduate student in anthropology, and had to rely on information she gathered from her students and professors. She has not mastered the art of research. She seems to think that anyone who reads about the  life of the people she writes about is interested in studying those 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book would not have been much of a good book if it did not include information about the current state of art. In this book we find out about the latest developments in computer technology, how they affect our lives and the way computers are used by the military.The last chapter is dedicated to showing the advantages of computers over the hand held cell phone. The information in the book is mostly correct and provides great entertainment for students or for anyone who is interested in how computer technology is developing. I think that it was written from the perspective of the current generation of computer programmers but the book would have been a much better book if the author would have taken a more serious and accurate approach to the subject.The authors claim that this book is a "how to" book,   However I find it to be more of a "let's-just-get-it-out-of-the-way" book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was quite disappointed in this book and did not find any information to back up the statements in the book, it seemed the author had the same information he read in one of the other recent books on Buddhism but was not willing to share that information with the world.I do understand why other people like it, it is a very positive book but it is very frustrating that it is so difficult to find accurate information about a subject if one wants to have a better understanding of Buddhism.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really enjoyed the first part of this book. It is funny to read about some of the strange customs of other countries.  The book is well organized but the text is repetitive. It might make you feel like this book was the reason why I turned to the occult for help. The book was written in 1985. I'm really disappointed that my favorite authors didn't do better with this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book. It is written in the third person, so it is easy to guess the actions of characters who are not really there. It just doesn't work in real life. This book is for children, but they shouldn't have to deal with this. They should learn how to read and write in the first place 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I have read, I know  that is hard to believe, but I have not read the others 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book, as a whole, is poorly written. It is overpriced 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main character suffers from depression and is prone to becoming self-destructive. But in spite of all the negative reviews about the author's inability to make any sense out of the text or the characters, the book is really quite bad.  The plot revolves around one of the male characters who dies in his twenties and is not properly mourned by his mother and father. But it's all over by the end of the book. So all the characters get the same ending - happy endings and no sense of tragedy at all. The only character that does seem to be affected by the events is one of his girlfriends. But even she is only able to do so through manipulation. As for the plot itself, there is no sense at all and the story really has no purpose, except to make the author look more impressive as a writer than he really is. To sum up: bad book, bad writing and bad plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book very boring, and the writing is very sloppy. It is definitely not worth your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have only read a few pages of this book, but it is clear that it does not intend to have any kind of impact on the lives of the readers.  To be fair, it is written for young people, but this book does not reflect the experiences of any of those young people.  This book has an unfortunate focus on the sexual side of young people's lives, and it is unfortunate that the author is not willing to take the opportunity to write something that is more realistic.  The book is far too sexualized and the sexual aspect of the novel has nothing to do with how young people actually think. Instead of writing a novel that helps young people better understand themselves and their problems, the book focuses entirely on the physical aspect of life 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have heard people describe the book as 'hurtful' or'sloppy' or even 'disgusting.'  What a terrible book!  In the end, I felt like it was my personal duty to send the book back to the publisher as I thought it was full of lies.  It was just too ridiculous to believe the book's claims about the lives of the characters.  The characters did not exist   It's obvious that the book had been edited by someone else after it was published 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a series of short story stories about children who are unable to read. They must live with each other for the most part, so the stories do not make a lot of sense. The book is written in a way that makes it seem as if the parents don't care for the children. As if they are trying to keep the children from seeing any light of any sort. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the introduction, there are numerous references to 'experts', but not once does the author quote a single one. Not that I expect her to do that, but to just quote some reference or other would have been a much better way to start 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of grammatical errors. This book could have been written in 2000 or 2000. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book. I mean, I liked some of the things she said about the relationship, but  it was so hard to believe  that she would actually do such a thing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is full of inaccuracies and poor writing.  I was hoping the book would address some of the issues the book is addressing.  Instead, it just goes over the same ground.  If you are reading this book, you will be learning nothing about the actual issues.  It was just a rambling of words without the same depth of substance.  This book was just meant to help the public be more aware of this very important issue.  The public is so accustomed to the mainstream media reporting that they believe this to be the only way.  However, many of us, even those with the most scientific background know that there are many alternative theories on the topic.   I'm certain there are more than a few of us who know a bit more about the topic than the authors of this book.  Perhaps they just didn't realize that the readers of this novel would actually have a different opinion than they did.  At least, that's what I suspect.  Overall, I would advise anyone who reads this book to just skip it.  Don't waste your money on this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had a similar experience with this book. I read the book for my high school class, but the first time I opened it, it said, "This book was not written by a student."  I decided to pick it up and read it, but I was totally unimpressed.  There is no way to read a bad books without becoming angry and annoyed at the author 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is riddled with errors, misleading information, etc. And the author clearly doesn't have any understanding of history. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the information about the American Indians to be somewhat lacking. What information was given was about the Indians of North America only. It didn't tell about the different tribes of Native Americans of the North America. I would have prefered a more detailed and comprehensive book.I wish I had purchased this book when I first read it. The author did not live to finish the work. I understand this is an author's book. If you like Indians, then the author's work is definitely worth reading. If I had read this book before I did the field work, then I would probably do my own field work and not rely on the information provided in the book."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It does not include anything about women other than what is in the book and what is stated as the only way to find a good woman:  If you want to marry a woman who has not had a sexual partner since she was 14, if she is not yet a virgin, then she is a poor choice for you.  I do not know a lot about women, but if you're looking for good women,  do your own research.  Women who are "too much" for you are not the best for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's as though it's written by someone who just got out of a bad relationship 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are not many stories in this book about  things that don't happen in the real world.  For example, the entire first paragraph of the book is dedicated to the topic of  love.  I found this book interesting, but I couldn't read it again because of all the  boring stories and not enough about people. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm glad I got rid of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a poor attempt at the romance novel. The prose is too formal, and it's all done in a way that makes it seem like you're reading something more than a simple synopsis. The romance is all about the ending; you know, the end of love. This is the story of the love that keeps on fading after it's supposed to. It seems as though this was written for some sort of romance magazine, but it's just not romantic at all. There's no emotion, no heart-feltness, no passion, and only one thing really drives this story. It's not the romantic relationships, it's the author's own feelings. This may be a good book if you're interested in romance but, in my opinion, it would be better to read a more realistic book like a Stoppard or a Jane Austen. The stories in this book are not only about love, but about passion, about love in general. If you want to learn about romance, read a good romance book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a very basic book.  It is all about how to get good grades in school.  If you can only afford to have one book written about your life, make sure it's a book by an author who knows a little about school. Because in this book, the authors are not about education.  They have very little knowledge about the subject.  This book is about getting good grades, which is something that is pretty easy to learn in school, but that they have no idea about in real life.  The real reason I'm not going to buy this book is because if you can't read it, you're not going anywhere.  In real life, there's plenty of examples about how not to do things 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing I disliked about this book was the writing style.  I have not read anything like this in a long time, so I was hoping for a better style. The book is extremely  boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this was a very nice book, and it's the first book I ever read by Darryl F. Wright. This was the first time I encountered this type of work. However, after reading some other of his works, I couldn't see the appeal in this book. This is not a bad work, but I cannot recommend it to anyone. Wright is a very talented author, but he seems to use the same type of formula in his other works. It seems like he only wants to write about the most popular and common type of crime in America: burglary. In his works he only uses simple, everyday scenarios with some artistic embellishments. And to be honest, I don't think there is any substance to them. He only uses the most extreme characters to create his stories. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    You do not even mention anything about the life of Charles Bukowski (I don't believe you even have read the novel.  If you want to know what Bukowski's relationship with his friends is about, go do a Google search 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sure most of the reviewers of this book are women, and not very intelligent, but it just doesn't make any sense. The way the author talks about sex is just a load of hogwash. She shows some photos in her book which I can't find, but she shows pictures of naked women and sex in the back of the book.  I know it's fiction, but I just can't imagine a sex scene in a book that's supposed to teach women how to have sex with men.  It just does not make any fucking sense to me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought it was good as long as the author understood how hard it is to be a high school student, that is to say, she understood that she is no longer a teenager, and that is a major disappointment for anyone who has high expectations for her.I don't know who she was trying to imitate in this book, but it did not work.The only character that was actually likeable in this story was one of the teacher's friends, who is in love with the main character, but ultimately decides to abandon him when he turns out to be nothing more than a child.So, in other words, she took the exact same path as the heroine in the book, and as far as I can tell, did not develop as well as the main protagonist.I do not recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed with this book. The first chapter had me thinking this was going to be the book for the entire family:  However, as the book progresses we are never given any sense of what's going on in the real world. What we see is simply the story of a child's life, and the rest of the family is either ignored or in constant danger. If you're looking for a family book look somewhere else 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought I would read this book because I was interested in the science behind it. Instead, I just took the book's premise and used it as a springboard to read other books. Unfortunately, I was not able to enjoy the book that I wanted to because of the lack of attention paid to the science and the poor writing style. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would have preferred that this book were not written in the first place 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is obvious that the author did not have any knowledge of the subject matter. The information given about the subject is wrong, confusing, out of date, and not helpful for the average person. For example, it is common in medicine to give patients with certain diseases the wrong drug. They need the right medication. The wrong drug causes bad side effects. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A bad book to start a study of the art of bad writing.  The bad writing style is repetitive and unimaginative and the subject matter is uninteresting.  It's a boring, repetitive, uninteresting book and it's no wonder why its author doesn't sell a lot of books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is a lot of fluff in this book, but the fact that some of this is based on his experiences in Vietnam shows that his writing ability is so weak that he has to use his memory to create the story.  It is hard to get any real information out of this guy, but it is certainly a negative book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a typical book written by a poor person who thinks she's smarter than other people 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am surprised that I do not have more positive reviews about this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just don't understand the author's lack of originality. The characters' personalities are all the same. And it's hard to read a book about a boy and a girl that aren't as  fun as the author says they are 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has no plot. There is no reason for the characters to be in the same place, other than the author's fascination with this book. It makes no sense to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I hated this book.  I mean, I couldn't even get into it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a very long review on an area of which I have only a vague understanding. I'll try to say that it has very little to do with Islam and all of it is about the Muslim religion and its problems. I am glad I didn't buy this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish I were smarter, but my eyes didn't really open to any of this stuff until I had read the reviews and  I'm not surprised at how many books I've read that were based on the author's personal experience. This one has no content of any substance, and  it is really just a rehash of all the bad advice I'd been hearing about for years, so it has the same negative reviews I'd gotten.  As a book,  it's just so boring.  I guess the title really said it all.  Don't waste your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I can't believe that someone would buy a book by that man and that he would have such poor grammar. If you do read his works I suggest you go into it expecting the worst and prepare yourself for the worst 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want to be a good girl, then read this book and forget about it.  If not, then it's probably best you avoid it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of bad habits and bad advice. It's a bad idea to use your wife or girlfriend as an emotional support system when you've been having problems with your marriage or relationship. It was all based on the premise that the husband's problems were the wife's problem, so you are not to blame. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only good thing to be said about this book: it was published by the University of Minnesota Press.  That is quite a bit more reputable than a third rate publisher. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the only book  I have ever seen about the Russian Revolution 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm pretty positive about the book, but I do not particularly like the way that it is presented, and I believe that it makes this book sound really difficult to learn to play piano! But if you are not a pianist, you could easily find it very useful. It does not give you very much practice material, so you must be very diligent in your study, as you are learning how to play a musical instrument, not how to use the piano keyboard to its full potential. This book seems to be geared towards a person who has no idea about piano and would not be happy with it for piano lessons. If you are someone who needs a very good book on the piano for piano practice, then I do recommend this book, as it does not disappoint. But to be honest, even I would not recommend this as a beginner piano book: I know of pianists who are extremely advanced, and who do not even have to listen to the piano playing at all! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book for the purpose of teaching a child about a science/fantasy book.  I tried to read it as a parent, but my son had no interest in the characters and story line.  We eventually moved the story line into an adult novel in the middle of the book and the books became much more interesting.  However, when I started reading the second book in the series, it became clear that this book does not offer a child a realistic view of science.  This series needs to be rewritten or edited, and should never be given to a young reader.   It would be wonderful if I could recommend this book to parents of other children, but this is not a book that I recommend to younger readers 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It would be nice to be able to discuss the good parts of the book without having to resort to name-calling or accusing, but all I can say about this book is    it is not about a healthy, positive relationship.  I am left to wonder how it could be about the positive part of the relationship if the only thing they discuss is the   negative. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book starts out well enough. But it quickly devolves into overuse of clichés and a lack of imagination. It is difficult to follow the story in the first chapter, especially when the author gives the impression that the reader is supposed to be able to predict exactly where everything is going. As a result, the story lacks the momentum that is so important for an entertaining read. The ending leaves you wondering why we are even reading this book if it's so poorly written. The lack of creativity in the plot of the novel is also a huge disappointment. For example, the author repeatedly tries to tie the plot to other literary works. However, the plot does not work well in other literary settings. Instead of a clever story, the novel becomes a tedious bore. The author does a bad job at allocating the characters' time, which is extremely hard to do without a lot of repetition. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I got this book and thought it was great. But then I started to read it and the stories became more and more unreal. I ended the book with a horrible story about an animal that was in the house. She lived for a while with us and then she ran away 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If there is a negative in this book, it is in its very limited use of history. It doesn't give us much of a glimpse of the Ottoman empire, or what life was like in those days. I have never been that interested in this period, so there's no reason to devote so much space to it. Most of the action is in the early modern period (18th and 19th century), and there's nothing much about the wars that broke out in the last decade of the century. For someone who has little interest in Ottoman history, this was disappointing, and it seems like it was put together very quickly for marketing purposes. All in all, I found this book to be rather dated and shallow. There are some interesting and relevant discussions about religious issues, but I didn't find much of the "spirit" in the book. If you're looking for history, and have no interest in the Ottoman history of the last century, this may not be the best book for you. In the end, I don't recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hate this book.   It's full of useless details about how to do things, but it is too long for you to be paying attention to it.  I just wish there was something about the plot that makes it interesting.  All the characters are flat and boring.  It is basically just another long description of how to find and find treasure, but there is no way to connect the dots.  Every character in the story is boring. I hated it so much. I thought this book was supposed to be about the adventures of a young girl as she discovers treasure.  She has to follow all these instructions, but none of it really has anything to do with treasure. She ends up in a cave and all her friends are trying to kill her.  None of them really are. They are just trying to murder her to save their own lives.  There is a scene where they just hang her from the rafters in the cave, but that is more about the shock factor than anything else.  No one really dies, the kids are all fine. It's just a very boring book with absolutely no reason for a person to read it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, this is just one more chapter in an unproductive book by a man who cannot see himself as a role model for his kids. I don't even know what his kids are doing at this point in the book. He's the perfect parent-type: he's got his kids' education, he's the life of the party, he'll always be their best friend and they'll always fall in love with him. But that's not his style. He doesn't care about his kids and he definitely isn't a good role model to his kids; he has no idea what the meaning of responsibility is, how to be a good father, etc. This book has all the   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I can hardly believe that I have wasted over 4 hours of my life and money for only 2 pages of information 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is an attempt to correct the errors that the authors of other books have made. But it's not a good book. If you like to study and discuss biblical issues, this book isn't for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well it's time to say goodbye to the book: It is poorly written, and the premise of the book is ludicrous: A bunch of friends meet and do a bunch of things. It doesn't add up. It reads like a bunch  of teenagers talking about a movie. But it does give you an idea of what the movie is about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author, without an understanding of modern concepts, writes about everything that is wrong with women.  It was a good book when it first came out, but that's about it.  This new edition does nothing to improve the book, it just takes it to an all new level.  The writing of the book has not improved much, it is still dull.  Not only does the author fail to understand women, but he also fails to understand that there are many different aspects to women, and that not all women are alike.  There are so many times I was wondering if I was reading a bad romance novel, because so many of the ideas about women were so outdated and illogical.  All the bad stereotypes come from him, from the stereotypes of what a woman should or shouldn't do.  Women should not take care of children or be subservient to men.  A woman should only be a good wife or mother 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is based on a series of short stories about young adults who end up in an alternate universe and become a little girl and a boy and other things along the way. I found it very annoying 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book, while well written, is very far from interesting. The author never gets into the details of his characters' lives. He is either not interested in his characters or his stories have nothing to do with his characters. It's a pretty boring book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with some of the criticism of this book.  It is too short, it doesn't give any information about the people you are about to meet, and it doesn\'t tell you the ending.  What the hell did they think would be the point of this series if it didn\'t end in a cliffhanger?  All in all, I don\'t recommend it, because I don't think you are actually going to find any answers to your questions in this book, but the writing style is good, and if you are interested in the series, you will be able to find them all in there.  There isn\'t much in it for the reader other than some basic information about a few characters.  The author makes a lot of assumptions about the reader and the reader is just supposed to follow along.  This is what this series is about and if they didn\' t think about this, they probably wouldn\'t have put this book together, because they are making all of these assumptions that the reader has no clue about.  I think they didn't realize they were making assumptions about me and the readers so they just kept throwing the characters around like crazy.  But the whole thing ends with a cliff hanger so I don`t even think I want to finish it.  If you really want to know the ending of this story, the characters tell you that you must find your way to a place called the End of the World where the gods are waiting to see if you can find out the meaning of life.  They don\'ts really give any real answers to this mystery so it is impossible to follow all of this and I don\\'t see any reason why you should ever even try.  To be honest, I think the whole book should be thrown out and someone make a new one, because there is no point in reading it.\

Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is poorly written. It makes much more sense if you read the book to get the book, than the pdf that was sent to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm glad I waited this long before I read this book. As a matter of fact, I had a hard time trying to read it because of all the excessive references to the movies. This book has all the potential to be very interesting, but the author keeps getting lost in his research. There are numerous places, in particular in the conclusion, where he describes situations in the movies that he had not seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is hard to understand how anyone can write about a negative book, with no positive point.  For a first person perspective this book is rather pointless, since there is no real reason to learn anything about this book.  It is simply just an explanation of why so many of his friends abandoned him, while he seemed to be in an excellent and loving relationship with his girlfriend.  All of this is explained in this book, which is basically a collection of short stories.  As such, it is the kind of book that might be worth reading if you just want to pass on a positive story about a good guy.  However, this book really needs to be put down, and  I recommend trying another book before moving on with any further reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a terrible book.  I read it in high school and loved it.  Then it was given to me for free in the library for reading while I was studying, and I thought  it was great.   But now I don't even own it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a disappointment, and very poorly written. The author spends time in his chapters discussing other religions, and has not spent a moment on the subject of the Bible. It is a poor book which will not please anyone, but will please some and offend others. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book to read it to my daughter, and it was pretty dull. I was expecting to be laughing throughout the book, but I was only able to laugh a couple of times 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with others about the very poor plot development. We are expected to believe that these people are so nice that they can't even be bothered to learn the names of the people they kill in their war. The whole thing is based on the premise that the world is a battlefield and the only real difference between a soldier and a civilian is the color of their uniform. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just can't see how he can be called a "writer" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed with this book. It has been my experience that most writers of this type of work are either over-rated or overly negative.  This book is neither of those.  The only negative reviews I have seen are about the writing itself.  There are times I can see the writing style, or some part of the book, is not original to the genre.  It is just that the rest of the books are so different from this that it doesn't make sense that they are plagiarizing.  Overall, I found this book to be the lowest quality in the genre, and I found it interesting, but it was not a great book.  As a writer, you want to know if your work is being done well or not.  If you are only paying attention to the writing, this book is just not worth it.  For this reason, I would only recommend this book for those interested in self-development.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I do not think that these women are bad women, but the book was extremely dull and depressing. The author's style of writing was extremely boring, and she did not seem to like the women much, and didn't give them any depth or personality. In this book, the author describes all of the women as being boring and passive, which is not even remotely true. I thought that the author wanted the women to be interesting, but she did absolutely nothing to that end. I have never been so disappointed in a book. I wish I had not bothered to read it. I found that I was so bored that I almost threw it away. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed in this book.  It was almost impossible to find enough interesting things to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with many inaccuracies, and much of the material contained in this book is completely untrue 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's a long story, but it's all the characters' stories: Mary and Michael's life together. The death of the mother, the father's betrayal. The children's growth. It's all in the end, and no real resolution. It may end in some children's books, but not in this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If this were a movie, there wouldn't be enough shots of the book's cover.  And the cover is never explained 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A few things I disagree with:  The story is a little bit too long.  There's too much talking in the chapters that are just the first part of the book.  And, at the end, there's too little action.   All in all, the book was good for about five hours, but it was really too much in the end.  I would not recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't buy the book, it just was written as a promotional material for the upcoming book, "The Art of Being Happy: How to Make a Difference in Your Life and a Better Place to Live 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is nothing but a compilation of stories of all types. The one that is a classic is a guy named Mike. He is obsessed with a fantasy book and is so out of his mind that he ends up in a coma. He ends up with a group of women who help him to come out of the coma. If you read this book, you will end up seeing a bunch of stories in a couple of chapters. I don't know why anyone would read this story. It is just too confusing. You don't get any sense of how he was feeling. It's boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are many examples of poor writing and spelling throughout the book. It is clear from the beginning that the author does not understand basic grammar, so the reader is left to guess as to the author's intentions. The book is filled with typos, grammar errors and the occasional wrong word. The sentence structure was not that good, either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are many problems with this book. The first is the fact that the book is not written in any kind of chronological order. The book's focus is on three people at different times. It also is full of spelling and grammatical errors. The title of the book "The History of Sex" is inaccurate. It is, however, very educational and some of the people are very interesting. But, like all the other things about this book, it does not take a lot of reading to figure out the whole story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the only book I've read on this topic. I am quite disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is filled with misinformation and lies.  There are numerous mistakes throughout the book.  It is filled out with long and tedious passages that lack interest.   There is no real science behind any of the information in this book. This book was not written by a scientist. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just realized after reading the first few pages of this book that I have the wrong book.  I had bought the paperback of the book I was reading, and I was very pleased with the quality of writing.  The book in this book was very poor.  There were several instances where I found myself wondering why I didn't see a book that was as bad.   It also was unclear how much the author knew about the subject.  Not only did he give some examples that were completely wrong, but he also had many different examples that he decided were correct.  For example, one example he had was a boy saying that he wanted to be a girl, but in the next chapter the boy becomes a girl.  It was as if the author was having his way with the facts, but didn't know how to explain it to readers   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure how to describe this book, other than it is a mix of silly,   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not for a beginner but is for anyone who wants to improve their life in this fast-paced way.  Unfortunately, there is absolutely nothing in this book that helps me in my personal life, no matter how hard I tried to put the good into this book.  I read this book because it's not a bad textbook by any means, but it just isn't what I'm looking for in a personal growth book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I did not know where to start with this book. It seemed to only consist of short, boring paragraphs 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is not only a bad read but a bad  book.  I read this to refresh my memory of a good book  I liked 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not recommended for anyone with any experience in dating and relationships.  The chapters are written for the reader who already has some relationships that are well established and working well for them.  This makes the book redundant 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of  half-truths, and I felt  cheated.  To say that a person with no experience in the field can "make a good book" is  ludicrous.   If you are a person who is not familiar with the field of chiropractic  medicine, it is an insult to the discipline  itself to even consider this book for any serious study 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a good book, but not for me. I would have liked to see it go in the opposite direction from the book and not just give an overview of the subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not agree with the premise behind this book, that any book that can be considered a "true life story" has to be good.  The book is filled with the type of over the top action, overblown characters and overused plot devices.  I am hoping the author finds a good way to move the story along in the future 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The content is not that valuable and if you have not read this before it may be difficult for you to comprehend this content as it is presented. I would avoid the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very poor writing and a bad idea to be honest 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the last book of the series and, not too surprisingly, not the best.The characters are generic. There are no identifiable aspects of the characters that separate them. The plot has no depth to it. It's just boring to read. The setting of the book is boring too. The people in the book are not in any specific location and it doesn't get better with each book. The characters are always going to be the same, and there is no sense of personal growth from the characters. The action is predictable, and the characters are pretty much the same. It is a very generic book and I wouldn't buy it again. I won't buy another book in the series either 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm really not sure why this is a book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is not only a poor translation, but it seems like the author didn't even bother to learn any English.  To sum up:  a terrible translation, with very little actual content.  It is not an easy book to read because the author's use of language is so inconsistent.  This book may sound good on the surface, but you will be left wondering how much time the author spent translating.  A terrible book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is another bad book by a bad writer. There is a lot of negative review on the web and I agree with some of them.   It doesn't matter how much you love the author's style, it doesn't change the fact that his writing is horrible.  It has nothing to do with his religious beliefs.  And it doesn' t matter how smart you are, you can't come up with an idea like the 'good Christian' idea when you've never lived one.  The book only works for people who know how to be good writers 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I hated this book.  There were many typos, a few wrong numbers. The story itself was very contrived and uninteresting.  I wish they had edited this book before publication, or at least changed the character names 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to return this book to the library, because it is not as bad as the other reviewers. I agree that most of the topics are not relevant to everyday life. Also, it was so bad that I could only finish about 10 pages before I gave up. This is a book for those who have had a bad experience with a bad electronic device: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I felt like I was reading a bad college book. It had all the clichés about drinking  and going to parties but I never felt that it was  anything like the author's  life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to agree that this was the weakest book in the series, and one that needed some serious revisions before it could be read.  I would not have been able to finish the series if this were a standard for the series:  As for the story, it was not particularly well written; it seemed as if every other chapter of the book was written before the one with the most emotional moments 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought the writing was poor.  However the book is well done and not a bad introduction to a lot of subjects.  I'm sorry for the poor reviews, but  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought it in September of 2009, and never got around to reading it. After I left on a two week trip to California, I was back and was unable to finish the book.  Now I'm in Los Angeles, and I can't even finish reading it! I really wish I had read it a few years ago before reading it in 2009 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I know this is the type of book one would not recommend to others, however I would not do that to my self either 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author was not a good enough editor for his own book. He couldn't make the stories flow and be interesting. He kept giving long explanations about how he wrote. The explanations were often nonsensical. Most of the pages were filled with blank space that could not be filled. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What is this book about    This is the first time I have read about a young person who wants to be a writer. It is about a girl who gets a big job interview and that's her big downfall. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing style is slow and the sentences seem very unnatural. The author seems to be trying to sell his own books by giving the reader false impressions about the life of an individual. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of inaccuracies. For example, some parts of the story about Mr. Krantz are inaccurate. The book ends in a way that doesn't answer any of the questions raised. The whole book is riddled with inaccuracies 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book covers the very first years of his life (even though his family was only in the United States for 6 months in 1949) and his father's side of the family.  Not many things that are written are written well, but the author did not do much of anything to get the book out there, and it has not been out there in a while.  If you want to know more about George and his family before they moved to America, or if you want a good read with good pictures and great stories, this book is not for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's goal is to explain the evolution of science. I couldn't see what all the hype was about. He talks about the role of modern science in our lives in a way that seems to be a little condescending, and I couldn.t see how a scientist could ever be such an arrogant person. The story seems to have been told in the first chapter and then the reader is thrown off a cliff. The book itself is full of holes. No one really seems to know the answers, or if they do know, why they would want to know them? Some examples:  A person could learn the answer to the "is science a religion?" question just by reading about how scientists have a set of rules to follow when they study a new material 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a collection of anecdotes, and the author does nothing to develop the stories. Instead, the stories are presented in rapid-fire fashion with little focus and a negative tone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was fun to read, but I got bored quickly.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a joke from beginning to end. The author does not care about the subjects. The only way the reader gets any enjoyment is by taking it out on the unsuspecting author. The book is full of errors and the book is hard to read. If you want to know what I mean,  read this book: http://www.amazon.com/Karen-Aubert-The-Great-Growth-of-Child-Mind-Control-ebook/dp/B00P4Z5Z1 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about a girl who gets a boyfriend in middle school, but finds out she is actually a lesbian when she turns 18. I'm not really interested in this sort of thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have not yet read the whole thing. I read the first few chapters. It is a bad thing to waste your time on. You are forced to read through it. It does not read very fast. But then you do not learn very much about any one individual. It only teaches you how to think about various problems in a negative manner. There is a lot of talk of "socialization" that is completely absent. And the solutions are just as negative as the problems. Not to mention that the book is not formatted very nicely 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was never very impressed by the author's ideas for "the man's" future. The world today seems to be a lot more than what people thought in the 1950s, and it is not for the better. And that's the bottom line.The author's idea that technology has been advancing at an exponential rate, with people and machines working hand in hand, is simply unrealistic. The author's view of the future seems to hinge on the belief that if there is a revolution in the information technology world, then the world will be transformed. I do agree that there has been significant progress in the technology world. However, to the degree that progress is driven by innovation, rather than a technological process, then we are in for a much greater fight, not the revolution he is predicting for the next 50 years.The "information revolution" does not guarantee the same results as the industrial revolution, because the world is a lot smaller, and we are still working in the same old fashion jobs. The information revolution is driven more by innovation. And what happens in the tech world, stays in the IT world. It is not going to be any different for those who want to work in that world, because they are still using the same "traditional" jobs.I have little sympathy for those of us who do not feel there is enough progress in this field to satisfy the author. We have to move forward to a time when the world and society is in a better position, and the world's economy is a much better shape, not because of progress in technology, but because of the power of individuals. We are not going backward, and this book provides no clues to help us accomplish our goals. The book makes some valid points, but the book never addresses the true reason for our problems, and that is individual human beings. And these individuals do not need to be addressed.They simply need to realize that they have to be more engaged in the change process, that the world around them is a changing place, that they need to do some serious thinking, and find a way to help each other out. I agree with the author when he says that we are all "moving to an information economy," that the information revolution will be the key to moving forward. But the information economy will not move forward on its own. We as individuals will need to make changes. And it is the individual people who need to change, not any technological revolution, not a revolution of government, not an information revolution
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not an easy book to follow. This book is intended to be an introduction to what the Bible says about homosexuality. I found it difficult to follow the author's point of view. The author spends a lot of time talking about homosexuality that I don't believe is very relevant to the discussion. The book is over 80 pages. I was afraid that this book might not be worth my money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As usual, the book's content, style, and writing style are uninspired.  Unfortunately, it fails to inspire the reader to change their lives for the better, and instead inspires you to buy more

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is one big pile of garbage. I thought that this book had to be something that was written by a drunk.  This is a bad series, and I wish I could give it a 0/5 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're looking for a simple but good book on the fundamentals of playing the guitar or the drums, this is it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author tells the reader that it is a simple fact that we get our information from books. The author does little to back up his claim. Most of the information he offers is either unverified or unsubstantiated. The only reliable information is the dates of events, which can easily be altered. There is little of substance presented that would justify the book's price. I was expecting more from the author, rather than less. The book is a travesty. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It seems like a lot of stuff is already stated before the book comes out.  The book isn't any good for me.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read the first book and  have no interest  in continuing the story in this  book.  If the author had not decided to write about his sister in this book,  I would have given the book 4 stars.  It is not a positive review,  but  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In my opinion, this book will not be useful to those with minimal knowledge of the history of mathematics.  However, those with some knowledge of mathematical history and its application to modern science, technology, and business will enjoy this book.  It is a very good, but flawed book for those who are interested in the history, development, and application of mathematics 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had read the book and thought it was interesting. However the final chapters were boring and to put it mildly  boring.  The only thing I can say about this book is that  the author's personal history of his illness  was interesting but not the central focus.  It was clear that the author thought about his illness and  his family and wrote the book that way.  However the book  ended and left me thinking about his life and the illness, which  would have been more interesting  if the last chapters were written.  I thought the book was weak in the final third  of the book, but that was not the main focus. I  was disappointed  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is quite obvious this book is not written by a real science writer. The whole purpose of the book is to make people believe in magic. I think that the author of this book should be ashamed of his writing. It is a waste of time and money for someone to spend their time writing something that is worthless to the layman. The book also has absolutely nothing to do with science 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really didn't like this book.  There was no plot and it wasn't a true science book either.  The only thing it did was add in some more facts about different things.  It didn't do much for the reader except make the book harder to read.   It was very difficult to follow the author and his thoughts and that is where the book failed me.  This book was a real waste of money.  I just didn't think it was that interesting.  A lot of the times there was not much about a science book. I don't mean that it was a complete waste of time, but rather that the author's theories about it weren't enough to keep it interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The problem is, in the book the narrator says he never reads any of the works written by George Eliot because she's so  boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book seems to have been written with no knowledge of the  current medical practices. It doesn't include  any information about current research. There are numerous  errors and errors of fact. It's difficult to read and  many times the text has some information that is not quite right. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book itself is full of lies, and is written with the purpose of raising money for the author's upcoming book about a boy with a bad back, and he has no idea that a bad spine is a sign of heart disease. This book is written as a book about charity, and as such does not provide much information that is accurate, and it is easy for readers to see who has benefited the most from these lies 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author seems to have a knack for the dramatic.  There are no stories of the characters' lives that aren't already in the books.  The only new story is one of the main characters' journey from a life of wealth to one of poverty and poverty again.  But there is no real progression 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is very hard to read about a woman in her 20s who has not dated for 10 years. I have no problem with it as far as the writing is concerned, but I found it boring. I do not think you have to be a 30-year-old virgin to enjoy a good story, but if you are the typical 30-something woman, I can understand why this book has not appealed to you. It is a very short book which has a very limited view of a woman's life.The story centers on the author's life and is very generic. The author gives it a good review in her book: "It is a story about a young woman who is still figuring out who she is, what she wants, how she wants to live, what her dreams are. I was never really drawn into the storyline, but it didn't make me a particularly unhappy woman. In other words, it didn   
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had some misgivings about this book because I was pretty sure she didn't like that genre of writing, and I wanted to give her some credit for actually doing something about the fact that children and young adults have a natural affinity for this genre of story telling 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first section contains a description of the main character, a white male, who seems to be in a constant struggle with a black male. It then goes on to describe some of his past traumas, and the way he manages to overcome them. That is it. I thought he was having a good time. I enjoyed the book, but I could have written it better. The descriptions of the black characters were all quite shallow. I felt they were either giving the characters little character development, or just being there to make the characters seem more evil. I guess that is the way it is in our world, where the majority of the characters are the same color, like the characters in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is supposed to be an accurate portrayal of the lives of the African-American youths of the late 1950s. Yet in it, the author is completely inaccurate regarding many aspects of African- American culture, including hairstyles and slang. He also describes the color of other people's skin with absolutely no precision. The book also contains numerous errors. This book, in my opinion, is nothing more than racist propaganda. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The idea for the book came from a lecture I had given to my friends at work. I thought that a lot of the  people were interested in that subject. But the book was so boring  I would have preferred to have read another book by the author. But  I will not bother to go through it again, especially  after reading the negative reviews  I have read from people  who like to read books by the well known authors. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is no good information given in this book. I was hoping to learn something about different religions in a world where there are many. I didn't get it. I hope the authors are happy with the sales numbers as there has been a large amount of publicity given to this book, but there is no reason to believe that it will continue to be on the bestsellers list. The only reason to buy this book is to prove to your self that you are a religious reader. If you're a nonbeliever and haven't read any of the other books I would suggest you check out these: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book for a while, but eventually gave up on it. But, even if I'm not as much of a bookworm as I used to be, I still thought I read it. I didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was very confusing, to say the least. The information was lacking, the information was out of date. The book also makes a few assumptions that were not supported by the facts. I would only recommend this book for a very experienced professional in a field of research that you are very familiar with. The advice given in this book is a lot of assumptions that most likely are inaccurate. Don't waste your time reading this book if you are not very experienced in that field of study. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is clearly not interested in anything outside of himself or her self-promotion. I feel I was left to wonder what I would learn about my parents if I did not take notes 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author, in a hurry to be "right" has left out quite a lot. He claims to be talking about "the roots of religious belief," but he doesn't give a reason for how it happens. He makes some reference to religious violence, but then gives no explanation as to how this happens. It's just an excuse for some of the violence.I would not recommend this book as a source for true religious knowledge, but as a cheap attempt to explain away the brutality of Christianity.It was a good story for a cheap thrill, but if you have the slightest interest in learning more about religion then maybe this will interest you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel so sorry for the poor reader who has to read this.  I'm not sure why it's the only one he has read: it has nothing to do with a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As someone who was a huge reader in the 80's, I feel that my interest in this book has been lost. For the most part, this book is not relevant anymore, and the information it offers about different religions and traditions is irrelevant to anyone today who may be interested in that.  I don't feel that this book was particularly helpful for people who wanted to study any aspect of religion or culture outside of the Christianity that the author claims to be from.  To that end, I recommend that any interested in religious history study this book on the secondary market.  But in the end, this is just another of those books that makes no sense to me.  It seems to me that it was intended to be a "guide" to some religious practices and concepts, but instead it has become an entire book.  At this point, I have absolutely nothing else to recommend in the way of reading material.  The author has done nothing to make this book accessible to the general reader, and, to me, it's a failure 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has been cited by other books on the subject as being very popular among teenagers. If that's true, then it is a bad choice 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a collection of her personal blog posts and musings.  There is no information about any of the people she has met or known.  The author states that these people were important to her and that they are not important to us.   Her posts were full of spelling and grammatical errors 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In her attempt to provide a definitive list of the most popular of the classical western films and books, Mrs. K's picks and chooses a few titles to put it all together. But, it's like picking at a scab. She also puts in titles of lesser known works that don't appear anywhere in the top 1000. And, it just gets worse from there:  If you are a serious viewer and want to learn something about the history of western cinema, this book is not for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are so many examples of bad writing here 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought it was great for the time period and characters, but it has nothing to do with the current generation. The characters never change. They are all the same age, look the same, and have the same attitude toward each other. There are no characters that seem to have a life of their own. The only characters we really get to see develop their own lives are the characters we're interested in. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As usual the story never makes any sense. The two sisters don't appear to be in any kind of relationship until they are in a high school movie. The sister in the movie ends up marrying the guy who plays the part.  This doesn't help, so you're left wondering why they're all together, why the sister in school is the one getting married to a guy in high school, why he doesn't know about it when they get married, and why the other sister doesn't appear with her husband when they marry. I just could not get any enjoyment from it at all.  I was hoping this was going to be the basis of a TV series so I could watch them grow up and go to college.  Unfortunately that never happened, and when I mentioned it to a friend, he said,  "Hey, I'm about to start high school myself."  This is the first of several  TV series I didn't buy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel like I need a warning 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found the story to be very repetitive. I guess there is a little good in this book, but it was only to make the book seem more dramatic. I wish the author had kept it simple. The story was boring to read, so I have no complaints about the book. The first two chapters are quite enjoyable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's ideas were presented in a highly abstract way (no one wants to read about this or that philosophical issue with a young person), but he gave little attention to the details and was almost always repetitive. It was a very boring experience and I did not like the way he made his main character do this and that without explaining why. I would have liked to read a different story with an alternative character and a different set of circumstances. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The first section is devoted to a review of many other works, most of which are also bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about what is supposed to happen after the death of a good friend. But it is about nothing more than the negative way that the person is written about. The author is an extremely negative person and I have no real understanding of how his friends feel. This book is not a good book to read for those who love good friends or people who have died.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought I liked the author's writing style but found the book to be a complete mess. It was a real disappointment because the book promised to be educational. This is a poor excuse for a book on business and marketing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is a bit overzealous. I had to fight to get it onto my shelf. I feel that most of the information provided is over-hyped, and the methods used do not lead to any easy solutions to problems. It also seems that most problems with the program come from the programmer's inability to grasp the concept of 'programming' from the viewpoint of the human being who actually writes and executes the programs. This book may provide some insight into how you might begin to understand programming from that perspective. But don't buy it because you want to get good at programming in a month. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be a bit of an insult to all women who care about women's health.  What does it mean to be sexually healthy?  The only sex she allows is the kind of sex that only works for her.  She is the only one who can control her emotions, she is the sole focus of everyone's attention, and she must be careful about how she interacts with others.  The idea that women don't want to have sex with a "crazy man" is absurd.  In fact, if she had a boyfriend, she would never allow him to "talk" to her, would never kiss her, and would probably be angry at him when she did.  This is a woman who has sex with many of her friends, and none of them had the same type of relationship with her. She can't "handle" any of their feelings.  So why should she be able to handle her own emotions and thoughts?  It's just like every other woman in her relationship with another man.  Not only does she feel her husband should be the focus of her sexual activity, but she expects her husband to put a stop to any other type of sexual activity.  Even though her husband has never complained about her feelings, she still feels obligated to have the sex they do, to not put a halt on her husband's sexual activity either.  It would be nice if we could just talk about other problems that affect women and our relationships that aren't sexual problems, because it's such a disservice to women when they are treated as if they are just the same as all other women.  Women are sexual beings just like men are.  They are just as capable of giving and receiving pleasure, just as sexually responsive.  Just because she has a relationship with a man does not mean she has to have a relationship just as deep as any man's relationship.  I'm sure that other men feel this way as well, and the book isn't really about those men.  All it's about is her. And she's always being blamed and judged because of her feelings. I found it extremely sexist and insulting.  Her boyfriend has no problem telling her that they shouldn't have sex because it causes problems for him, but that's something her husband can't do, so her husband is the problem 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is all about how we can change our lives, and not necessarily to improve them. You will find it to be a bunch of little stories that are not relevant to my life. But if you want to read about some of your life experiences, it is not for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am still puzzled how this book ended up on our shelves 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was nothing but a series of negative reviews about some of the greatest movies ever made.  It was very difficult to take anything they said seriously.  There were other negative reviews that had better ones, but this one had nothing to do with my favorite movies, so I didn't read it.  This is one of the most negative books on the market.  And it's one of those books that you have to read from cover to cover before you can put the book down.  If you don't buy this book, then you are a bad person 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has not aged very well.  The material is dated now and the details are not very clear.  But what I really didn't like about it was the style.  It was boring,  not because it was bad but because it reminded me of some old college textbooks 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very skeptical about this book. I can understand why the author made the choice to write a negative book about the movie, but not for the reasons that the author suggests. This book is full of contradictions.  The book begins with a positive review of the movie:  The actors who play the part of his friends in the movie are some of the finest young actors on the market today. The scenes are very exciting and the plot is incredibly creative  The plot revolves around one man's life, and he experiences it very differently  The author's reasoning behind this plot, while well intentioned, does not make sense.  This is a young man's story, and it does not explain how this young man has different lives.  He lives in one city, is in one place for years, moves around a lot, and goes back to one place several times  This young man is very selfish, and this is the main reason why he is lonely and unhappy.  But the young man also is very generous, and the movie does not show him doing any of these good things  The movie then goes on to explain how his father is not a good father and the book does not adequately explain why this young boy has to change to be a good son.  In fact, the movie tells us that the father is the only good parent in the book.  All of this is not explained.  We are left to believe that this is a good boy's story.  When I say good boy, I mean it. I don't mean it in a negative way, and I don' mean it as in a good person. I mean this boy is a real good boy.  His father does not act like a good parent to him.  I know there is a story to be told in this story, but it isn't explained in the story. It is all in the dialogue between this boy and the other characters  The other characters are not good, and they are not bad, but they are different.  They do not have very close relationships.  These are not evil characters.  It is clear that they have very good intentions.  There are many reasons why they are doing all of this, but the movie never mentions them. I'm sure I am not the only one to have problems with the story, as the movie is very short  In order to make sense of this story and make the movie work, the book needs to be expanded to
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a book for the self-help junkies, who are always looking for the next magic pill to take away their   problems. The authors do a great job of marketing their self-improvement 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The premise that was supposed to capture people's interest in the first place has been thrown away in the name of style.  I feel like I'm living in a bad parody of a bad novel, where everything is terrible and everyone is a villain.  It reminds me of the scene in the movie where all the characters are looking over a bed of roses 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book for kids and for adults, but it's poorly written. It's all about the child and not about the adult. The book doesn't discuss any facts, like that there are more than 20,000 different species of plants, animals and insects.  The authors have no idea what they're talking about.  This book was not recommended to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is nothing but a collection of quotes from popular authors from the twentieth century. As a result, it is not a particularly insightful book for anyone interested in the American literary or cultural history. If you are interested in American history, or even if you just want to read a bunch of quotes to keep on the  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not the kind of person to appreciate   a good book that is not boring. This is one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking forward to reading this book, but was disappointed.  This was the third book in the series that I have not liked and the fourth that I will not finish.  The premise of the series is that the characters are traveling to the next world through time and space.  However, the main character only makes it a couple of times through the time and that seems to make it seem like a drag.  What I have done is read the first two books and have only made it to the third because of the horrible plot.  There are also many inconsistencies throughout the time that only adds to the bad rating I gave for this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought the subject matter was interesting, but the way the book was written just didn't make me interested. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a bad biography that has nothing to do with the history of this great man. As far as I am concerned, he is one of the most humble people in the history. The author is so afraid to write about him that he tries to make him a saint. It does not work, he does not even make that much of a difference in the story. It is sad. There are several other bad biographies that we can't talk about. This is the worst one of them 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a very biased book. It portrays a very negative view on Islam. It is one of those book that is intended to convince the Muslims that there is nothing good in Islam 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a long way from being useful 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read this book a few times. The only problem is that it only has information that is not really the problem. I just have to take a few pages out of the book and see what was really wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was horrible.  It made me angry. I know  people like to give a bad review about bad books and the same for  this book.  But this is the worst  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is what happens when you use the 'old man' theory 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found myself very irritated and disturbed by this book.  There are many interesting ideas here and most of them seem to be the result of an unhealthy obsession.  However, the author tries to convince us that he has found the true essence of all human behavior.  I find this book very disturbing.  The premise of the book is absurdly false.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was not for me, it was the reason why I didn't buy it.  Not because the content is bad, but because it was very hard to find anything in this book for me.  This is definitely not a good book for younger children, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure I would agree with your comments that it's not relevant to the world we live in today 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If this book is supposed to be about the beauty of a good girl's bedroom, why is she a bad girl in it? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is just a list of names.  I don't think it is for anyone interested in history or the history of religion, but for the person who believes in Santa Claus (which, I believe, is quite a few people).  But, like any book, it gets worse and worse as the book goes on. I found it extremely annoying. In fact, I would recommend skipping this book in the future. Don't waste your time reading it and then buy a bad CD or DVD about the religious holiday of Christmas.  The book is full of errors and bad information. It was very hard to read the descriptions of the people. Sometimes it was impossible to even determine their names.I didn't even try to find out their names and the other mistakes they made. But the more I read the more and more I was confused. Then I found that the book was written by someone who is not an expert in history. He just wanted to prove that Santa was real. There were a few other inconsistencies that were annoying.I really wouldn't recommend anyone to read this book. You are better off listening to the wonderful songs of Santa and learning about the many religions in the world. The books are so much better if you buy them separately 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting some very interesting information, but I didn't. The book is quite long, and you get a very long review with a lot of boring facts. I'm glad I picked up this book before it came out, but it wasn't much use. I can't recommend it. I'll read some more books by people who do have interesting, interesting and interesting facts about things, but for those of us who want some interesting facts to get us excited about the world, this isn't it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book itself is not bad. The only thing bad about it is the fact that the author seems to have no understanding of how the world actually works. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a terrible and confusing read.  It is very hard to understand what the author is saying.  The descriptions of the characters are also very difficult to follow.  This is the first book of a series, so expect to read another book in the series and that's the only way I could understand what is happening.  A book this bad shouldn't have been given a four star rating by any means 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was written without sufficient historical information, and only very briefly about the history of Russia. The author seemed to be looking for a way to present the idea that Bolsheviks were bad people, when in reality they were a fairly moderate group of radical revolutionaries who, by their own words, had no interest in the murder of innocents or the destruction of the Russian state. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book starts off by telling the reader it is difficult to write a positive review about anything:  I did not find this book at all helpful or entertaining.  It makes you feel sad that you wasted your money.  Don't waste your time or money on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had been looking forward to this book for several months, but I'm disappointed. I've read many of their books, but have always found their philosophy to be a bit too esoteric for my tastes. If you are looking for a quick read that won't take you too far into philosophy, this book is not for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has many of the typical literary problems.  In addition, it contains an abundance of clichés: people living in a bad neighborhood, the use of the word "ghetto", a young girl and a young boy in love.  These clichés are all unnecessary and not interesting.  I have not read any of the other reviews about this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are no pictures and nothing about the book's author's family 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The story is about as bland as most of the bad novels on this list, but it's the subject matter that really makes it bad.  The author does a pretty good job describing it in a couple of paragraphs, but the whole book is about nothing but a bunch of cliches about a man and a woman fighting their way through a dark and scary world.  It doesn't bother me because it's not that hard to read about a couple struggling to survive in a dangerous place 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I agree with other reviewers about the difficulty of understanding the author's language. The subject is extremely complex.  If the readers is not well-versed in mathematical equations, he will not appreciate the complexity of the concepts. The author himself has given no more than an indication of how the concepts relate to each other.  The book is quite written with little or no examples.  I had to use a calculator to do some of the exercises in the book.  The author could have written in a more concise manner. The subject is complex and the author could certainly have reduced the complexity to a more accessible level. If you are interested in studying this subject, I suggest you find another book on the subject, but if you are not interested in it, I recommend you not read this book. I found it difficult to comprehend the book's language, even in the examples.I will continue to use the book, but I doubt I will come back to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is based on the interviews that the authors conducted with students and teachers of the early church. I was interested in it as the book is a very interesting look at the life of Paul the Apostle in the early Christian community. The interviews were conducted with people with a lot of bias, which I found a little disturbing. I read the book in between assignments in college and it made my grades suffer. The author wrote very well and there are many interesting facts, but there was just something missing in the content. I will not be reading the book again, but I recommend it to anyone who has interest in the life and teachings of the Pauline Paul.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm very skeptical of all the negative reviews of a bad science book.  For one,  the book has a negative message about the scientific method.  And it is the result of a very poor editing of the book. You can tell the book was not well edited.   This is a poor book because it doesn't do anything new.  I do like it that  it teaches some basic facts about the Earth and the Solar System.  But there is so much wrong in it, and the book is so confusing  that the students need the book before they even begin.  This book has been out in public schools for 20 years  and it is very rare to find any science book that shows that much interest in what really goes on in the world and in science education 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I tried to read the text on the first page and when I got to the last page it was very difficult to finish reading it. I don't know why but it was so difficult. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written in a rather pompous manner that detracts from the truth. It does not have any scientific basis to support the content, it is just a collection of myths. The writing style is awkward and repetitive. I don't like it because of this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you want to know about the history of Western literature, here are the only books written so far: The Golden Bowl,  The Red and the Black,  A Man and a Woman (aka  The Lived Experience ),   The Life of Art,  The Golden Bowl 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The content is very repetitive, the book does not contain any research.  If you want to learn about any topic, do it from a good book: Good books about a good topic 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is so disappointing that this book was made by an author who could not write good.  If you want to read about the life of an elite female spy in the late 60s, then this book is for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is about the life of a middle-aged woman living with her two dogs and trying to make sense of her husband's death. While she is entertaining herself with stories about her cats, she is not in a position to offer any insight to what is going on in her marriage. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would be much more skeptical about this book if it weren't for the fact that the author seems to have a hard time writing coherently 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is not a lot of useful information in this book. It seems that the author is either not able or unwilling to understand even the basics of how the  world works. I've actually seen him write that  "the only people who ever have problems with religion are  those who are living in a totalitarian state." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book starts off well enough, but then it gets into too many tangents that detract from the narrative. It's quite a disappointment as it comes out in January of 2002. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was only a small part of a terrible book. I was unable to read it at all.I thought I was going to be sick, but I stayed to finish the book.I was very disappointed with this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not enthused by this book.  It was hard to believe it would take 10 years to write a good book. The writing was dry and the information was not useful.  I got the most out of the index.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was not meant for use of young adults.  Rather, this book is meant to be used by high school and college students.  For the first few chapters it does a good job, but after that it begins to become more of a typical student's book.  It does not take a degree to know that the author's book will be written for a high school or college audience.  In other words, he is not writing a textbook on language.  Instead, he's writing the text for high school students 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author does not seem to understand that what he's presenting is not a scientific argument in the form of a scientific theory, but a narrative of the experience of what is for many readers, a profoundly negative experience. It does not help that the book is very long and that the author uses several arguments to make his points, each one very well-known but without much support from the scientific literature. In a way, the book makes no sense, and is a testament to the   foolishness of a man who can only read negative reviews: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Too long for a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a poor  book:  The writing is bad. The descriptions are  insulting, and the book is overlong.  I recommend  reading a better book instead:  http://www.amazon.com/What-If-World-Really-Thought-America-Stopped-Moving-Civilizations/dp/1518226701
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not quite sure why I kept reading it - it was too long and the author was too poor to write about 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book has a few very bad chapters.  The chapters about the Middle East are very bad.   I am not a big fan of the Middle Easterners.  I prefer some of the stories about the more recent history and the culture.  If you like some of these stories, then the book is bad. If you don't, then you will probably be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed to read that the book had no good examples. It did not even cover what I considered to be good literature. It just listed examples and the examples that it gave did not make me feel good about the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I know I'm not the only one.  I found it to be a poor attempt to write a personal account of a life event.  There is no real detail of the actual event. All we are given are the emotional reactions of the people involved.  The story does not follow the facts.  Instead it focuses on the emotional events.  This is understandable.  For the person who is trying to write an honest account, there are no facts that you need to be concerned about.  However, the only person affected by the event is the writer, and this is a poor excuse for a life story.  What is the point of creating a personal life story in a book if you don't have the emotional element?  I don't know if the book was written by the person, or by the agent.  If you ask me, it was written the second 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sorry to say, but this book is NOT helpful at all to anyone. The author clearly has no idea what she is talking about and the examples she provides are not relevant to any real situations. She goes on and on about how she and others are doing what they do to help, but she doesn't actually do anything to change a bad situation. It's a lot like watching television, and you feel sorry for the people involved, but you do nothing about it. It really doesn't get any better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is really hard to read and it doesn't show any development in the characters. This book makes the characters like cardboard. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I agree with a previous review, but I would have to disagree with the last sentence:  Well, no. It is a very poor book, which is why I have to give it negative reviews, since it is the only reason I would even bother to read a book.I would have given this book a 5 star review if it had been written by an actual scientist.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not agree with all the negative reviews about this book. If you want a good book on the subject of money you should read the bestseller: How to Make a Million Dollars: How the American Family Made Millions in the 1990s. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very disappointed that I have not found any good discussion of the book. However, the book is full of a lot of bad advice. As a result, I don't believe that many of these strategies are applicable to the real world, where life is very different from the "experts" who are giving the advice. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is poorly written. Most of the information is irrelevant and uninteresting. The only things that will interest you are the sex section and descriptions of hot guys. The descriptions are all about how the guys are getting off. It would be much better to use pictures. I was looking for a sex book to use to learn about sex but this book did not have any pictures. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you are a high school student or college student interested in reading about the future of technology, you should check out a book written by a high-school student.  The book does not give the right amount of information or it does not discuss it well enough. The whole concept of the Web is not presented in a very clear way, and the book seems to use the Web as just another tool for the students. I feel that if they would have just given the information more or less in the book and explained the Internet a little better, this book would have been much better. It does not really give you any information about how the Web functions or what tools are available for use. Most of the information on the Web are just quoted from textbooks, and many of the examples of how to use various tools are from other people's books. Many of the questions that are asked in the text are not very interesting to readers I would not recommend this book for any serious computer science student, and it does nothing to educate the readers about how technology operates. This book is not for anyone who is seriously interested in the Internet, or any serious student who is looking to gain insight into how technology works. If these students are serious about it, they would be better off reading a book on electronics, computer science, or even just the fundamentals of physics, biology, and other subjects. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is not a bad read but you don't learn anything from this book, it just gives you the answers. For example, I couldn't figure out how to use this book to help my son. He was a good student but he was always working on his homework. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is really bad. It reads as if it's not in the original German language. There are so many mistakes. The names are spelled incorrectly, there are no quotes for the characters or the dialogue. The book is full of contradictions. It's about a girl in an insane asylum. The only positive aspect is the title, but that's it. The author is making a fortune selling her books to American women. She needs to take a few weeks off to rest and recharge herself. If you want to buy her books, you should buy them from the author's website or the library. But you won't. You should do your research and read the original language. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the material of the book to be very weak and, with some examples from my own life, difficult to read.   The main point of the story is to describe how people are judged based on their actions, rather than their words.  It's not a very good story, not only because of the writing, but because it fails to engage the reader.  There are no memorable moments, no characters that I cared about or cared about anything about.  The point of view changes quite often, from one chapter to the next.  But this book is not meant for young children, it's intended for mature readers.  I find it inappropriate for a reader with a young child.  If you are reading this book for a young family, or for a group of young adults, this book may not be for you.  You're better off finding other books about young adults 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this book many times and every time, I am disappointed.  The main protagonist, T, is so arrogant and cold-blooded that he is like an empty chair that everyone sits on.  All his problems seem to come from his own inability to meet his life's expectations.  He has absolutely no compassion and no feelings of love or trust.  This book will not interest you, unless you want a story about a  person that is completely devoid of any warmth or compassion.  I felt like I was reading an angry and bitter diary or a bad romance novel. The only positive point about the book is that T has the ability to come to his own senses.  In the end, I was disappointed and left with a bad feeling.  It did not leave me with any positive feelings about his character. I will never buy a bad books or bad romance novels again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with most of the comments, and the book does little to justify the price.   But you can't help but feel sorry for this poor man.  I think the real tragedy is how little these men know about the world, and how little they know about themselves.  If you've got a friend, brother or son struggling with drug addiction or any kind of addictions, I do not recommend this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book for my 12th grade English class, but unfortunately, it was not as good as I expected. I was not pleased with the style or the content, and I was actually looking forward to going back to the book I already finished and reading the whole thing again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sure many of you will agree, there is more information in this book than what the book itself actually contains. This book is full of unbalanced information. The chapters go through a few books, but don't go into what they do. Instead they go through some interesting techniques to use in your self-defense, and the techniques themselves are a lot of crap. I just can't see myself ever getting through this book in a reasonable amount of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book very disappointing. It was difficult to follow the main storyline. There was too much back story, and it was unclear what would happen with the children's relationships. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As I mentioned above, this is one of the many mistakes she made in this book. Her understanding of how to train your dog is woefully lacking. Her advice is poor, and the information she gives to people is woeful. She also tries to turn this into a money making book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is the most over-emotional book I have ever read. It is filled with quotes from famous people from the past. It has nothing to do with life but is filled in with a series of quotes and metaphors that are meaningless to the reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't believe that I bought this book for a family member for Christmas. I gave it to my brother and he threw it in the trash, saying it was pointless and boring to read.   The fact that I still had it in my hands when I opened it, I think I deserved a little better
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is bad, the writing is dull, the facts are not the most relevant, the examples are irrelevant and not logical.  The most logical point of view is that God is not all powerful.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried to do the exercises in this book in my junior high  class. I didn't understand the reasoning behind the exercises. We learned that it was supposed to teach the skills of getting along with others, and then some other stuff.   This book is worthless. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book a negative rating because of its overly simplistic and simplistic narrative.  I found the book very frustrating, and even more frustrating that it was written by the same person who wrote the original book.  It is not unusual for authors to produce a series of books which seem to have little to no relationship to each other, but this book did not seem to me to be anything more than a repetition of the same story.  To call this book simplistic would be an insult to simple.  The book's story would have been a lot better served if the characters were developed a little more than they were, and more of the story's events were told from the perspective of each character's personal relationships to the events they witness.  Unfortunately, this book does not live up to its title, and instead simply seems to have no more to do with what the title says.  But, you know, for a cheap book that doesn't even have an author, it's very easy to find a good source for more information.  If you're interested in learning more about the story or your characters, this is definitely the book for you.  Just make sure you have enough money to buy it for your book club, and you'll be fine 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book, and it was a challenge, a great challenge. But  the problems it has with being a good story, with having a beginning, middle and end, it was all I could ask for.  It is a fantastic idea, but it needed more writing and more characters.  As a reader,  I wasn't happy.  The worldbuilding was so shallow, so cliché, so  overused.  I didn't even see the story being resolved at all.  This is a tough book for me, I didn�t finish it.�
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very well written and the author has put in a lot of effort in creating a great book, but as the book opens, it becomes clear that she has not put enough effort into this.  The book starts off nicely enough, but ends up feeling like a collection of short stories.  That is the book's main problem, it just doesn't feel like a cohesive book and that, combined with the fact that most of the stories are quite short, made the book very hard to read.  I do not believe the author realized how hard the book would be to read for the reader who is just beginning to get into the fantasy genre.  Unfortunately, this was not the author's style.  Instead, it felt like she just had a lot to say.  Some of the sections of the book do feel very good, but others do not.  This was not an easy book to read, but the author should have been able to write a much better book.  Maybe she should have just written a longer book and tried to use more of the great material in the beginning to create a cohesive story.  Then she could have made the ending to the book much more satisfying.  Or maybe she could just give it up and write a novel.  In any event, she does not seem to be able to do any better, so the reader should avoid the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is NOT what I expected from a book about family and children.  I have read some books about children and I thought that was what I got in this book.  It seems to be a family in this house.  The book is full of errors and misleading information.  I have read about a hundred books about children but this is not one of them 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not thrilled with this book.  I think the book was over-hyped and the author is no better.  The only positive thing I can say about the book is that it is written in a way that appeals to adults and younger children.  But most of us are not adults so we cannot read it for children.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really wish I'd read this book before I started a series.  I have a bad feeling about this book and will not be buying another one.  There are so many glaring grammatical mistakes in this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are too many grammatical errors for any but the most pedantic person to read. It is not my first choice for studying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is more of the same old  writing that we've heard for a hundred years:  The woman wants to stay home with her kids because she is a housewife  and she has no job.  She is lonely because she can't find  anything to do in a boring, conservative home.  And she's angry that her kids  don't do anything outside the home. What  does she do?  She tries to change her children, to show them the  joy and beauty of outside adventure  and imagination. But what she  fails to understand is that these new pursuits will take her away  from her children.  That they'll be spending more and more time with their mother  because she wants her children to spend  time with her.   These books are boring.  The stories are uninteresting.  If I could give a negative  review about these books, it would be this:  Don't buy these books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The idea behind the story, the "experts" have been proved wrong countless times, the truth does lie somewhere in between, but if you're willing to take the risks that a great many of these authors do, you'll be left in the dust. I'm not saying that the story is bad (it's the only novel in the anthology that is about a love story and not a "haunted" house - which is a nice touch) but if the premise of the book is "experience a paranormal experience" as a means of providing support for a paranormal-esque story, then you're in for a real disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have given this book several thumbs down, and I don't see myself ever returning to it for any reason. For example,  If you are a Christian, this book will do little to encourage you to be a good Christian. I have already read through several chapters of this book and have found them to be very difficult reading, as is expected of a Christian book.  This is not what I expected from a Christian and it is not something I believe anyone should be reading on the basis of this title 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be too depressing.  I did not enjoy it much.  It was a difficult book to read as I felt that there was too much negativity in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so disappointed when I finished reading this book. This book was not interesting or funny, instead it was just full of repetitions, half truths and obvious misinformation.I thought this book was written by someone with very little knowledge of chemistry or scientific research, so I thought the content would be interesting but it was the opposite. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book about a guy who is a self proclaimed Buddhist: he's just like us. But not quite. He has delusions of grandeur and his self proclaimed greatness. He tries to teach others to "do the right thing" and go on a spiritual journey. He just doesn't realize that the path of the Buddha is one that leads away from his illusions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sorry, but this book is way too confusing and does little to illuminate anything.  The stories are pretty boring and not very memorable 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  In his first attempt at telling the story of a failed marriage, Don was very much like a writer trying to use the same plot formula to tell multiple stories. Unfortunately, this book is a mess. While some scenes are amusing, others are tedious. Don's story is full of holes and his characters are not well developed. It is frustrating reading a bad story because you know the story is complete when the last person leaves the room. If the author has to write several different stories in this book he should at least be consistent in his choice of characters. This book was a chore to read and I cannot recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about the bad marriages of American writers.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I know, I'm a bad writer, and I was expecting to be able to do it better than this. What I don't understand is why it takes so long to write a book like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of spelling mistakes and mispronunciations that make the writing look sloppy. The title page reads 'the title page of a bad paperback' and the book is no different. The writing is terrible and the pictures are awful. This book will turn any student off from writing for years to come. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not very impressed with this book. It's an interesting, fun book, but it is very dated by today's standards. This book was written in the 1970's 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I felt the author's intent was to portray these young men as sexually deviant. However, none of the guys were sexually active. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are no pictures, no descriptions of how the story is told. It is a synopsis. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the only book that I have read that contains factual inaccuracies. For example, a picture of a famous actress as a child is written as if it is her picture that is depicted, but it is actually a painting of her as a young woman. Furthermore, there are no photographs or illustrations in the book to support the historical claims that are made.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a long book. But the information is very bad. I found the whole section on health care extremely boring and didn't pay any attention to any of the tips. The book doesn't tell you how to be able to handle the medical care. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The writing style is too long, too boring and has a very difficult flow. The writing in the book is not bad but the style is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are so many errors and wrong information that it is impossible to believe there is a single book which teaches anything about this subject. What a shame."
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is nothing more than a bunch of clich�s and recycled ideas 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It's not a bad novel but is just not all that good. You will not be satisfied with this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as a college student in the late '70s. This is not the first book about this type of material, and I doubt that it will be the last. This book is about one man who has a dream, but not of making a living from it, but of building an imaginary utopia. He lives in a city with many other "hippies" and becomes the local hero. However, his life becomes increasingly complicated as he tries to make this city a reality. It becomes very obvious to everyone that he is the central character in a story that is very complicated and contradictory, with a great deal of violence and confusion, all taking place over very few pages. And it was a good book, at times, to see how all the characters react to his every move. However; the book never really got anywhere. I did enjoy the book at times but it was always more of a gimmick than a book that made sense. I also found the characters to be very one-dimensional and boring. It was like the author, John Fussell, was telling a story about a man who had a bad day and needed to escape. It didn't matter that the man's world was very different from the rest of the characters. No one did anything except say something about the problem of poverty and how it was being caused by a government that was run by the wealthy. The book did have some humor, but it never really led anywhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author doesn't even use the word "love" in this book.  He just says he likes this book because it is sooo romantic.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As someone who has read the two previous editions, this was the book that did not disappoint me.  If this is the book you want to teach your children, then you have a lot of work to do!  This book does not address a lot about religion, but rather the human mind.  The author was too quick to label some of her subjects as crazy, while others were given little attention at all.  Most of the information is very superficial, and there is not a lot that will be useful for a Christian child."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not even a big fan of science fiction, and this was not even my first introduction to science fiction novels.  The book was not what I expected, and I ended up disappointed with it.  I would definitely never buy another novel from the author, because she has done a horrible job with these characters.  It's really unfortunate because her main characters are fantastic, but it's just so hard to sympathize with them when the author is making them the absolute worst 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a big bore. The main character is a spoiled, self absorbed teenager who doesn't read. She makes bad choices, she's the typical annoying teenager that people hate, that's what I've been told.  The book has many clich� about spoiled teenage kids, including an entire chapter about girls.  These stereotypes just serve no purpose.  It's a pointless book that is only good for the people who will buy it for the cheap thrills.  This book has been around for ages, and it's clear that it isn't new or even particularly good for teens.  I'm disappointed that the author is trying to push her book onto readers by saying it's for kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are several factual errors, and the text is so vague as to give the reader only the most superficial sense of the events. This book is no longer used in any academic discipline, and I would not recommend it to any non-academic reader who does not possess a basic understanding of Islamic history. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was written in 2005 and as far as I know it does not reflect current  political trends.  As a former Marine Corps Captain and former White House Press Sec, I  cannot fathom how a young, intelligent woman could  continue to follow this trend.  The only reason she continues to do so is the  ignorance of those who are willing to sell her out  for a few bucks.  If you want to know where the future of the Democratic Party lies, look no further  than this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book doesn't have much to offer as far as history, and not much about contemporary events either. I understand this book was written as a response to the great events of World War II, but the book is a long, ponderous work of research that lacks any real sense of urgency. The author seems to believe that the world is like a box of chocolates and only has one major event each year. As it turns out, there are only three major events each year, which means there are three bookends that could have been written for the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't understand why people who read this book praise it as a classic.  The book itself is not that great.  It's a bit heavy in places and lacks the humour of many of the other novels.  I'm not a huge fan of historical fiction anyway 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As usual, it was all about the fact that they were in trouble, and no matter how you try to put a positive spin on it, that is not how it is read. The whole thing is just that - a whole. If you want to read about a good friendship, you have to go outside the story itself and look at the people and their lives.  This book would be more useful if it didn't end like that 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's an interesting journey to a small town that does not exist. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's just too long for the material it offers. Too much about the past, too much on the science and too much for the reader to care about. The science is so vague it is meaningless. The writing is atrocious. It seems to have been done by an autocorrecter: the author's name is constantly misspelled and the book is riddled with grammatical errors. It's a waste of time to read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written in 1977 and published in the 80's.  It was a good read at times, but it could have been better written.  The idea of the book was that the author wanted to tell the story of his childhood, but the story is completely different and doesn't have any relevance to his current life.  He does use the word "lifestyle" a few times, yet the reader is never made aware of it or allowed to come to any real conclusions.   The ending is also very unsatisfying.  While this book could have used some editing, it certainly would have been worthwhile to re-write the book to try to make it better.  In my opinion, the book should have been written in 2005 or 2006.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about what a person who is sexually active looks like. However, it is also about the consequences and aftermath of such sexual activity, with many of the problems and issues in the book arising from the nature of the relationship. The reader is introduced to a very young woman who has a sexually transmitted disease, and then is introduced into a situation that brings her to her sexual limit. The main point of the book is to explore the ramifications of this experience. However it is never explained in any way, not even with pictures of people with AIDS. The book fails to cover anything that would make it easier for an average reader to understand such a difficult issue.The characters are all pretty stereotypical and don't seem to have any depth at all. The characters are very shallow. However there is a very important plot point which involves the character of a couple of men. But they are not very complex, and are presented as simply "sexual friends." The book never actually explains how or why the relationships are established, as the reader is simply left to find the relationship between the two men. As for the characters themselves, there is little that they seem to understand or care about. Their relationships, the complications, their feelings for each other, etc. are never fully explained, nor is the importance of sex in their lives, as there are many pictures and descriptions of sex that don't even seem to be sexual in any real sense.One of the most unfortunate aspects of this book is the lack of a strong conclusion. The story was left so open to interpretation, it allowed so much more to happen. The readers are left to read to find their own answers and conclusions. This is the exact opposite of what I would expect in a good sex novel. The ending was unsatisfying. I am glad the story ended, but I would have preferred it to have some resolution or at least closure. It also left some question marks hanging out of which way to go next. It would have been nice to see more of what was going to happen next in the story. Perhaps this book would have had a good ending and been a good book, but unfortunately I found it to be very flawed.I would recommend this book, as it certainly provides some good sex scenes, and the characters are fairly interesting, but the main problem with this book was the lack proper resolution. I found the ending a little disappointing. It is understandable that it had to be short because of the nature and complexity of the characters involved.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well this book is only for the uninformed. The story of a young girl in the woods and her encounter with a demon in the wilderness and their subsequent battle is only briefly mentioned. The demon in question is shown as a man who resembles a giant mannequin. The boy is shown in a positive light, but not a negative one. The book seems more interested in the boy's relationships with women, and his struggles to fit in. No details are given about the girl. She was just used as a plot device to set up the demon. This was done because the book's author was having problems finding young authors who could write a good story like this. The stories were just recycled over and over again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As I was reading this book, the book's title reminded me of the book in which I have to write a negative recommendation: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has absolutely nothing to do with the  world of professional wrestling.  It's a very simple book about the history of  sports. I do agree it is very  interesting and well written, but it's not the  story of a wrestler. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is an abomination and a complete waste of my time and money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you enjoy fantasy as much as I do, you will find little to like about this book. This book has a high fantasy price, but the main character is a weak, unlikable loser who lacks any character development and is not believable in his own right. The author has been a professional author for many years and knows a good book when she sees one, but this is a great disappointment for fans of fantasy."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of errors. For instance, it says that the Greek word for "good" is nexar (meaning good) and it says the English word for good is nexa. It also says that a Greek hero is killed by a boar. It says that in the English version, a boars are not killed by Greek hero's, but by the boars themselves. It lists many other errors, not the least of which is the fact that there is no chapter headings in the Greek version, which is wrong because chapters are in Greek. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written in the   unusual style of a nonfiction book.   The writer doesn't use the standard style of introduction or discussion to give the reader an understanding of his views.  The story focuses almost exclusively on one of the characters and his relationship to her.  There are many confusing points that don't seem to fit well in this story.  However, the author gives many different views from both his characters and those who are supposed to be his followers.  If one tries to figure out who is in this book, you will be frustrated in the end.  This story just doesn't work as a whole.  It has more focus than the actual characters and the other plot elements are not developed at all.  Most of the time, this book is just "The author is on a journey".  That's it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is horrible. I bought the paperback version because it was the cheapest, but that was the last I had read it. The entire book is a bunch of uninteresting stories of people's lives, without any real substance. There are a couple of good pictures, but not many. I would have rather spent less money on a good book about something to do than to spend a whole evening reading this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would have rated this book 5 stars, but the first few chapters are very dry and lack in interest. It is a pity that a writer would have his work wasted

Write a negative review about a bad book:   For this book, Mr. Smith is a salesman. If he was a journalist writing about the world he is living in, he would be a journalist instead of a salesman, which is exactly what he is. The book is full of stories of   pretentious people and empty promises. The way the book is written, you see how  people are selling themselves, not the 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are looking for the ultimate in anti-religious bashing you will not find it in this book. The author does a good job of bringing out all the negative stuff about the bible that you are probably already doing. The book is very religious and preachy. If you're not looking for a book that will take you down the rabbit hole into the depths of your mind you should probably pass this book by. If however, you are a true believer this book should not affect you.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I had to slog through the long descriptions to find what was happening. I have read this in a dozen different versions and it never comes off as coherent and it leaves me wondering how much of it is really happening

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like much about it. I was quite taken aback to find out what the first book in this series is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The premise is intriguing, but the book goes downhill from there. As a teenager, I remember feeling that it was an interesting concept, but I couldn't believe that anyone would follow through with it. It took over half the book for me to figure out the reasons why, and I thought this was an unusual book format, not to mention that it wasn't a traditional children's book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is a book with no content. It is full of useless information about some bad book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A lot of stuff that was intended to be entertaining about a good book was actually less than that. The characters were flat, predictable and sometimes just plain stupid. The story seemed to be written by a teenager, not a real life teenage girl. The book does little to encourage reading, but has much to do with feeling guilty for the past mistakes of an unambitious person. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The authors have done a great job of getting everyone's name out there but they fail to mention who is the author of the book: the author is a professional writer who is known for having a huge ego and not giving a good account of himself.  The book is filled with pictures of girls in various states of undress and the author seems to think this is the way to draw attention to his writing.  To me it doesn't look professional, and I have no desire to read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is not familiar with the subject of religion and philosophy, and is too afraid to delve into the nuances. The entire concept of religion is completely ignored, and the author does not explore why a spiritual world view is the most common way of thinking about the universe. What is really disturbing about the book is the author's lack of knowledge of theology, particularly Christianity. The author does refer to the Book of Revelation a few times in the text, but is unsure of its meaning or intent. The book is full of factual errors, including some bizarre quotes. The text is not an easy read, and there are times when the reader is left wondering why the author believes in what she is claiming. I found the text to be highly opinionated, and I found this to be the most important aspect of this book. There are many examples of the author making the "fringe" religious characters out to be either heretical or evil. This is not just a "Christian" book, but a book written by someone who is completely unfamiliar with the various religious views. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am the only person who bought this book, so I didn't know what to expect. But I didn`t learn anything. The book is nothing but propaganda. I would be ashamed of my own child for buying this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book will teach nothing about the fundamentals of aerodynamics, but instead is simply a collection of anecdotes about the  life of a professional pilot. This would be fine if the anecdotes were entertaining but they are not. This is just a way for the author to tell stories about himself. It is not for anyone  interested in the fundamentals. In fact, this book does little to enlighten the reader about aerodynamics. This book is simply for the writer to tell his stories and  be the center of attention. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I do not understand why anyone would read this book.  It is filled with lies, half-truths, half lies, and just plain lies.   It even talks about a man (named Paul) with no medical experience, but somehow is able to write a medical book with all the information in it.  I did not learn anything about medicine at all, only about frauds 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am sorry but this is all it is.  It's not a great book to read for those that like short stories, but I thought it would be something to read to a few friends of mine, but it has not sold so it was probably a bad idea to even try to read it with friends.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of obvious mistakes. This is not a bad story, but a bad writing style.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book doesn't say much about what it is about 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a sad, sad book.  I am a person who loves literature and is not looking for anything but the very best in his books.  The fact that this book does not live up to its potential is heartbreaking.  As someone who loves to read and study philosophy, this book is about as bad as I can get.  There is nothing insightful here and nothing interesting.  What was supposed to be a lighthearted look at the beauty of the world is instead a dull study of people trying to find the truth about their own lives.  It has a few laughs but nothing more.  If you enjoy books about philosophy or are serious about philosophy, it's better than nothing.  But there is nothing here to recommend this book to any intelligent person 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete cluster, filled with nothing more than the worst stories, the kind of stories people tell each other about when they're bored. The author spends most of her time writing about the characters themselves, the way she presents them is a real treat. This is just another tale about some people with no personality whatsoever, and it's not exactly hard to see why the author's main attraction is writing about these people. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a collection of anecdotes, mostly involving his friends.  The author has a history of alcoholism and a number of personal experiences.  None of these stories are believable.  I did not find any of the stories to be of the slightest interest, especially to those of us who are currently battling alcoholism and need some encouragement 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is so boring and contrived it's unbelievable.   I can only imagine what it's like to write a bad novel.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is a lot of material that is not relevant for today. Also the information provided by the book is very inaccurate. There is much talk about the benefits of being in touch with nature and how important it is. There are other material that provides the information needed in order to live a healthy lifestyle. However, the information is only provided to the point of making money. You are expected to buy the book and read it through to the end.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am so disappointed with this book.  There is absolutely no description of what it is like living in Thailand, there is little discussion about religion or culture, no mention of money or lifestyle.  I could have written that review in 3 seconds.  This book is just a collection of pictures.  If you are looking for a good book for Thailand, this book is not it.  It is a book about looking at the world from a Thai's point of view, not about looking through your eyes.  The pictures are of the Thai people, and this is the only way I could understand this book as a Thai tourist, seeing it through the eyes of a Thai.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was given this book by the book store as a Christmas gift.  While I appreciated the illustrations, I could never get into the stories.  I would recommend reading this book from cover to cover,  but I doubt it will ever sell in my bookstore.  Instead, I would rather look up what's out there that might interest me.  Perhaps there are other books about the New York City scene that I have yet to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is very clear that Dr. King is making his argument against the social    system of the world of tomorrow. It is difficult to imagine   an audience listening to him. His argument is that   society needs to break down barriers of racism, sexism, and classism to achieve   a society of equality. The only way this is possible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book that is only used to motivate young girls to become mothers.  It's a very self-centered view that is not necessarily beneficial to our young children.  I feel like this book should be used for motivation.   I would advise to not teach this book as an adult.  This book is just not the best approach for young girls 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am pretty disappointed in the book.  The information was mostly true.  But there was no mention of any of the major controversies surrounding the book: The information is accurate but the way the book was written (or the way it was reviewed in the mainstream press) is what is  disappointing.  There was no way to really make the book relevant, let alone relevant to the issues  that were raised in the controversy: a non-existent cover photo; misleading statistics on the amount of children  being raised by homosexual couples in the U.S.;  and the fact that none of the children in the controversial case (the story of  which was featured on the cover of the book) ever went to school  or had anything to do with any of these issues.  What's worse is that none  of the facts of this story was ever presented in the case of the case that was  featured on each of the two different editions of the 'homosexual child's book' that  were released.  I think it was the publishers of both editions that should have  been most embarrassed because they made the children featured in the  story look like little heroes, heroes  who were actually raised by homosexuals.  As I read this book I had the impression that  this was supposed to be the case and that if you did not believe  this then you were a hater and were therefore an anti-gay  bigot.  It's really sad because the author (I was pretty disappointed  with this book, especially after I finished it) stated in the preface  that this was simply the way that the author wanted this to happen  and that there is nothing more to this story.  This is not the case  and there is much more to the story that has not been presented in  any way that was accurate or truthful

Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the end, this book is just a list of quotes taken out of context. There is no effort at any kind of analysis. The book just lists what is quoted at a given point, not how the quotes relate to each other. There are quotes from many different writers, most of whom are not even from the same culture or region.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the exact opposite of what the author stated in his introduction:  I am a former high school English teacher in a large metropolitan school. I taught this to my three kids and some of my students. As the author states:  The books are not for anyone but college students, or for kids who want to learn about  mathematics in a more fun way 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it hard to keep up with the facts, especially the history of religion. I thought I was getting a clear picture of all that, until I read it on a recent trip to Europe. All I can say is that a few chapters should be skipped if you want to know what is really going on in the world today. The world is a very complicated place. There are many shades of religious belief, of which I don't understand a great deal. There is no good religion. All are valid, of course, but they are not necessarily the best. I wish I could say the same about the teachings of many of the world's great religions 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't believe that a lot of the information provided is well researched and true. I agree that it's interesting to look back on a life well lived but I don�t believe the author did a good job explaining the things he discusses in the book. He did little to present them in an interesting manner that will entice the reader to go read more of his books. The author spends a lot more time writing about women than men. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are reading this book  do not bother buying it. The book is filled with the same garbage that has been plaguing American literature for centuries 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was written back in the 1960's. However, it has a lot of superficial information and, in the end, the main character loses his entire fortune. The book would have been much better with the money in the bank and the use of real examples. If you're reading this for that reason, I suggest a good hardcover edition with a chapter about real money, investment strategies, money markets, etc. Instead of just showing how you should buy a house, you actually have to buy one. The details of how to invest are extremely basic. If the author had given that time and effort to give real examples, he would have given a more accurate description of how the financial world actually works. It was good for entertainment. For actual investing, you have to work a bit harder and you get some bad advice. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book did not live up to the hype. It was a very dull and uninteresting book. The characters didn't seem very deep and memorable. All the characters were stereotypes. The story is just there for the sake of the reader to read.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm sorry but this book is just full of inaccuracies. It's like they thought they could cram in some more religious stories and found a way to make it even less correct than it already is. I'd suggest you read the comments section of a good book: http://www.mygoodbook.com/review_comments.htm 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book and it was about how to do the wrong thing. I really enjoyed the characters, but it ended up feeling like the author was looking for a way to get the point of the book over and over again. He had this great plan of putting a guy on the cover and the girl next to him and having them have the hot scene, and that's just the last thing that happened. The end is a big disappointment and the last 2 chapters just make this story seem pointless. I do not recommend this book to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing style, though it is the same style in every book, seems to be used more than in any other book, especially in the beginning. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If you are a fan of American literature, you will not like this book. If you have never read a good book, you might find yourself a good number of times as a reader. I am not a big fan of history either, so I found the book very tedious and dull. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For an introductory book on writing, this one was so dull, and the writing style so stilted, that it made for a boring read.  Not a bad novel, but a bad first book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of lies, self centered, and no information on the subjects of her research was ever provided. I just hope she learns something from her experiences. I don't think she'll learn anything from my experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title tells you all you need to know, yet the book was over-priced and was not helpful.  It was too confusing and confusing to figure out.  I don't know if it was because of the time constraints or the fact that you didn't learn much about the women's movement.  As for how the book helped me learn,  I guess the only thing I took from it was that it was the women of this era who were so brave and strong.  However, the story that I was led to believe wasn't true.  Not that I didn't have my suspicions, but I still felt that I needed to read the book.  The author did an excellent job of spinning a good yarn, but unfortunately it did not live up to its potential.  This book will not provide you with any real understanding about the struggles and successes of this period in our history.  A very bad book for women. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have not read this book yet but it is listed on my "to read" list. If I read the book, it will likely be only for the entertainment of my family and friends. This book is nothing more than a collection of quotes about life, and has nothing to do with psychology. It is all about the way you speak, and the way you dress. If you don't like the book or just want to know how to make your life a better way then go read the books of your favorite psychotherapist 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really had to stop reading this book when the author was making allusions to his favorite book, The Lioness in the Woods. But when I got to the end, I decided to go ahead and finish it. That was the only time I had difficulty in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know how I'm going to ever finish this book. I'm always ready to see it written about in the future, but the lack of any useful information and plot is too much for me to take on.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought it would be entertaining, but the writing is poor, the pictures are bad and the story seems to go on and on, not to mention the main character is very stupid. It's all in the name of comedy and I will only take it as entertainment.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is very repetitive and the story starts and ends with the characters in love.  I found that the characters were not well developed and their dialogue was flat.  The book is about the four main characters' love lives but never shows the inner workings of their lives.  It also never explains how this love affects the future.  Most of the time the characters spend time arguing over the right way to live their lives and how much money to make.  The characters were boring. The relationship between the four characters was not believable 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is well told, but not in the way you would expect. This is the only place where the author used the title of a popular novel as a basis for a work.  The premise of the story was that a woman has a son with another woman, but her husband refuses to acknowledge the child.  That is when the mother decides to raise the child herself, so that the husband does not know about her activities and feelings towards the child, as she does not like the idea of her husband having any involvement in her child's life.  As a result of the situation, the son is lost forever, and the mother has no way of finding him.  I found it to be completely unrealistic and implausible.  There is no real action in the story.  We are given no details about the events leading up to the story, other than the woman's life events that were portrayed.  Instead of being involved in her son's life in a real way, the woman is basically just a walking dictionary of   phrases and actions.  In fact, the story felt as if it were narrated in the third person, as the characters, who were supposed to have personal feelings, had no personal feelings toward anyone.  If you are going to write a story about a woman raising a child, then have the characters have personal emotions and thoughts about the child as well.  However, the author felt that it was necessary to write the characters this way, so as to keep the reader from being distracted by the lack of real character development.  When it was explained that the characters had no real personal feelings towards anyone in the book, that really only added to the frustration of the readers as to why they did not care about what was happening to their characters.  It was just a lazy way to write.  To add to that, the actions portrayed in the chapter titles were completely unbelievable.  You could not believe that the author actually made the characters do that.  Furthermore, the reason for the characters not having feelings for the reader seemed to be to provide more drama for the readers.  Although the story is very simplistic, it is still very good for romance fans.  For example, we read about a young, poor girl who is very poor and helpless in the world.  She falls in love with a rich man.  Of course, she ends up getting pregnant, and her pregnancy leads to the woman giving birth to the son.  Because the characters
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was about a boy who was adopted and raised by a poor woman. He is pretty much an awkward, awkward, out of place kid. In the end, he ends up a rich, bad boy. He's got no idea how to make it with girls. He has no clue how to talk to girls, how to approach girls, etc. The way he handles this was to constantly act as if he was too cool to be around girls. The book doesn't really explain why he was so uncomfortable with girls, or why he acted like he wasn't comfortable with girls at all. It just shows his awkwardness and lack of confidence in the relationships he creates. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for something that is fun, this is not the book for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title of this book makes you think that it is about a girl or a boy, but it isn't. This is the story of a girl who goes to a boys' camp and gets a negative opinion about everything: the smell of urine, the smell and look of the campfire, the fact that girls are treated like shit there, and the fact she is told that she is not feminine.  This book is about two young girls who have very different viewpoints about the world and about themselves, and it is written by a person who believes that these girls are bad influences on each other.  I thought that the author made a lot of pretentious statements about girls and girls' culture, but that was just my opinion.  The author does not believe that the girls are capable of making proper choices for themselves, but he makes them do everything they can to make other girls think that these two girls are the reason why the rest of the girls feel bad about themselves.  If that isn't a blatant contradiction, I don't know what is.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the most useless books you can find in any bookstore.  This book is all about "how to be an adult" and nothing about anything else.  It is full of self-promotional and self-absorbed quotes, which may be interesting to those of you who are in the industry, but will not help you grow.  All the quotes were lifted from other books, but not from other authors.  The book has absolutely nothing to do with business, which is something I really didn't care about.  I thought this book was about how to be a good person.  But this book did not do anything to me but hurt my ego and make me feel inferior 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is about a girl who is trying to find herself. And she has to do it by moving away from her mother and her husband, and starting a new life in New York. This girl moves in with two guys, who are very much into making money for themselves. They use the money to buy drugs from their drug dealer. The girl ends up being involved in the drug dealing as a result. But I would say the book is just about the way it starts, the beginning of the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so full of the same drivel as others I've read. Not a good book, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  In the introduction the author says that the purpose of the book is to teach a new book writer to make their writing style more consistent. This seems obvious to me. But the only thing that the author seems to have done is to use many of the same ideas for the whole book.  The book was boring to me from the beginning to the end, especially with the chapters written by the same authors as the book itself. The same ideas were being repeated over and over again, and I couldn't follow all the ideas.  I could see why the author used so many ideas for every chapter, but I don't feel that the book was as good as it could have been.  But I guess this book can be useful for a newbie writer, which is what it appears to be.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for an entertaining novel about an eccentric American writer, do not read this book. The main character is a complete failure. He is constantly making silly mistakes (no pun intended) and can't seem to come up with a story. He ends up writing a terrible novel about a good book: a young man who is sent to Japan to be a war correspondent. Instead, he gets the job of writing a bad novel in a bad setting. It isn't much of a novel, and it doesn't even seem to have any plot.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the book for my high school English class, and I have to say I have a hard time reading any of the other reviews about it.  Most of them are very negative about it, and even when I tried to be positive, I fell victim to the bad writing.  I thought it would be a good book for teens and older, but it didn't do much for me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title tells me all. I was about to return the book for a refund but it's already out there in the world.  I will probably end up returning it for my nephews 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It makes an incredible claim that the word 'titillated' is a synonym for  'porn'.  The book states that it is the most common word  in porn, and that this word has been used in the  Bible to describe a woman's desire to penetrate a man.  If this is true, then I can't believe the  author spent years doing research for this book.  The way it is written, the woman is  simply aroused and the man is merely penetrated.  I believe that in any other context, the man would  be able to penetrate the woman.  However, if I were to find a woman that had been  penetrated by a man, I would find my desire for her  as well.  There is simply no way to be a complete voyeur or  enjoy pornography without actually being penetrated  by a real person 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed the book.  I thought the book lacked the substance.  The authors didn't do a good job in showing the world from both sides.  It made me not trust the author as he did a poor job in his descriptions of life. I feel like I've seen the book before 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In short, this book is a bad read for a number of reasons. It is written in a monotonous fashion. It also lacks much of the depth of character that you would expect to find in a novel about a close, close friend. He's all about his family and his kids, so there's very little plot and only a few scenes are truly moving. It has almost zero dialogue (a common complaint of short story authors, I believe), which can get a little disconcerting when trying to figure out what is going on, especially because the plot seems so flat and lacking in imagination. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hate this book. It is full of ridiculous lies, and the examples are all too numerous. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very boring. It is about the Bible. I do not like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are several interesting facts, but you'll have to dig a little deeper in the book to find the real interesting facts.  There is no real lesson to be taken from this book.  This book will help you with your marketing and selling, but won't teach you anything about writing a good book. It's hard to think of a good example for what would be a good use of this book: You're about to publish a book about marketing, but it's all in the first chapter and there is no story.  If you're thinking about the marketing aspects, don't let the first section scare you.  Don't make the first ten or fifteen chapters all marketing based.  Get to the good stuff in the last three chapters.  Then the story comes in and you're stuck with all the marketing questions and answers.   You'll learn what happens, but not all the way to a good point.  Just stick to the first book you can find.  All you'll learn in this book is how to market a good novel in marketing, not how to write a good story or tell a good interesting story. You won't see how to sell the book, not tell a compelling story or develop a good marketing plan.  It's all about the sales and marketing and marketing tactics.  Most of the writing is very shallow, very shallow.  The only person I thought was really interesting in the story was a friend who wanted to write about it.  That person gets to say about 80% of the stuff in this story, so you don't get much of a story. It just doesn't develop.  I'm not one to buy this book, but if you're in the marketing business, this is a good first book to buy, for those of you who are still in school. If you have a little marketing experience, this book will do you some good.  Otherwise, you'll likely find this book confusing, dull, and dull. If you like marketing, buy this first, if not, read something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book's only positive aspect is its historical background.  I found this background boring and uninspiring.  There is too much focus on the author's life and family rather than the author herself.  The author's stories about herself and her children are extremely short.  In fact, they are so short that I only skimmed the book, and had to stop reading for the first time because I was bored.  This book is not a historical masterpiece, but a superficial look at a person's life.  If the reader has the inclination to actually delve into the life of the author or of her own family, they will be disappointed.  For this reason, this book is worthless to anyone looking for historical information or who wants to learn more about their personal history. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are a lot of interesting and informative things about the history of music and its impact on culture 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The style of the prose was awkward, and the plot too. I thought it was all going to be great, until the end.  What I dislike is the way the author does not even finish the book. It's a little boring, and you feel a bit guilty watching the ending.  But I really liked the book, so I still bought the ebook and read it for pleasure. There are also some funny reviews on Goodreads that people have written. This book could have been better, but then it is impossible to please everybody 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read several reviews about this book that criticize the author for being too light in his writing, that he didn't take the time to describe the historical events with sufficient detail, and that he was too focused on the political scene in the 1960s.   The problem with those reviewers is that they don't read as deeply as I do 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of errors, it does not even list the correct spelling in its index.  Most of the spelling errors can be found in the book "The Perfect Book of English" by G. R. M. Young, in which the book was originally published 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the last chapter I had to make a decision and I chose the side of the "proper" version. However, when it came time for the end, I just couldn't pull myself away from it. I kept thinking that it was the most boring chapter, but of course it wasn't.   I am going to have to reread it, but I will not be bothering with the many examples of how it should be used to understand a complex subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has not only been poorly written, but it was not meant to be understood by the layman or even the student of science.   I find the whole purpose of science education to be to present information that is understood and accessible to everyone.  The author's poor attempt to communicate scientific concepts in such a way  is a big deal in the field of molecular biology.  This is not science education  and it needs to be changed, because it is very difficult to  learn science while reading books that don't communicate the science to you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed with this book.  The author makes it seem as though there are lots of positive qualities about being an African American in this country, which would of course include a lot of stereotypes.  But when the book focuses on a fictional African American family (the White family, the Black family and some fictional Latino characters) it becomes pretty clear that there are no positives to the book at all.  In fact, many of the characters in the book come across as stereotypes. They are the ones that make everyone else look like idiots and lazy, because of their simple appearance.  This book is more about stereotypes than characters.  It does however feature some characters that are relatable, which is a good thing for some people, but this book is not for others.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not recommend this book to anyone. I found it to be dry, boring, and confusing. I had to go to the back of the book to find the interesting information in it. If it is to be considered a "serious" reading book for a high school or college student, this is not the book for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read the book, and felt like I was at a rock concert in the middle of the desert. All these people are talking about this and that and how they're going to live happily ever after and all these characters are looking good and it's really sad because this book is really bad. The writing is way too florid and it seems to get really preachy. All of the characters seem to be either addicted to drugs or going through the depression. I don't think they need to do anything like that in this book, but just be realistic about things. I mean that's what I try to do, but the writing is so florida and it just doesn't fit. I thought it would be better, but it was still bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's about time to stop wasting time reading books and start doing things with your life.  I would love for you to read some other books before you start to look for more things to buy and buy more books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the book difficult to understand and I did not understand why the characters in the book were trying to get back together with one another. The book was more of a plot device than a plot driven story. As far as I was concerned the book was not even close to a good book. There was very little action in the story line. I felt that the author made things up as he went along which was a little annoying. Overall, this is not a good picture book for anyone who is not an avid reader.

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed with the book, but the author made the mistake of making her subject so interesting, and not being as careful as she should be. I found her descriptions extremely annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really dislike this book.   The characters were boring.  I didn't care about the romance, it was too short, too easy to put down.  But, there were some great quotes from the greats in the history of our country.  This book is for the history buffs, not the rest of us. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is too long, boring, and not very engaging. No wonder the review is so negative.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the book with the most information but also is the least helpful. The information in the book is not enough to do what you need to do in this book.   I would suggest you get an e-book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A big book on philosophy of logic, the foundations of mathematics, and the history of thought. Not bad, but probably not the ideal introductory text for students coming from logic for a good reason: it contains no new ideas, and is extremely repetitive. I don't like repetition, and I would not consider myself a logical positivist, so I would probably skip it altogether. If you want to use it as a starting point for a logical study of the foundations, you will certainly need to study some more material from it, but this is by no means necessary. If anything, I would recommend skipping it altogether, especially if you are only looking for a more practical, practical-based introduction to logic.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is very clear from the beginning of the book that it is written by someone who is trying to make a profit. It is a very short book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book itself is very dull and not very informative about the field, and doesn't even bother to inform the reader about the lack of availability of digital devices to record your lectures. The only person who has the authority to record is the head of the department, and even she doesn't have the right equipment to do it.I know this from experience, it's not easy to get a copy of the book to get around this problem, but there is nothing else written on this subject.I am very disappointed with this book, because it is poorly written, and completely irrelevant 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with another reviewer:  She writes about the same stuff, and for the same reasons, over and over.  I've never been particularly a fan of the writing style, and although I appreciate her efforts to make it "feel real," she falls back on cliché after cliché.  She has a huge amount of talent, but when it comes to writing about the "real world" she seems more concerned with the shallow pleasures of fantasy than the deeper truth 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of many errors, and in many places, the author seems to have forgotten his own history. I don't recommend this book for any history or study of the Civil War, or even for anyone who has a passing interest in this war, period, or its political events. This book lacks even the faintest trace of accuracy, and only succeeds in irritating me by presenting an incorrect version of history. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a woman, I think the author is making the mistake of comparing women to men. Women are not men. Men are not women. This book makes all women look like men. This is what happens when the author's wife isn't around for his 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, it's interesting to see what the world thinks of the modern woman: she is self-conscious, self-involved, she is always running after men.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't see what the point is. It's too long, too boring, and not much action. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As the title would suggest, the author is not the world's greatest historian.  The first time I read this book it didn't click, and it took me forever to figure out why.  This book is a hodge-podge of historical inaccuracies, with little or no proof that it is not a bad historical account.  I would highly recommend that if you are planning to get this book for Christmas, or any other festive time, you look at the reviews and see if the book has been corrected.  Even if the corrections aren't made, the book is still pretty poor.  It is a pity that the book was printed as-is in 2011.  If the author was aware of the issues he should have corrected it by now, but the book remains as it is.   In my opinion, a better book for historical research is A Short History of the Russian Empire 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have not yet read the next two books in this series, but the books are so similar, I would have to say this book is very similar to the previous books, except this book doesn't make any sense.  The writing style is so uninspired, you'd think it's written by a child. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I liked the way that this was presented: she describes her life with an older woman, her daughter's life with her father. The stories were told in a matter of minutes.  In the end it is very hard to believe that she was able to write a book like this in the first place. I believe that, like all of the stories, her life changed drastically after the book was written.  I was never interested in this book after it was over, and am even more surprised that this book was even produced

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't like how much of the book is devoted to the 'evil' and negative aspects of the American dream, and the authors' view of the future.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not about an actual, real child. Instead, the author takes the role of the child and tells us about his struggles with anxiety. The book is nothing more than a series of self-pitying diatribes. The child's behavior is not as erratic or inappropriate as in this book. It is more like the child is reading from a script. I would suggest to anyone interested in child rearing to get a good book on this topic

Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of inaccuracies and blatant errors. The author has no grasp of any scientific principles.  She tries to make this book sound scientific by calling it "A New Scientific Approach" but it's only based on speculation, the reader is encouraged to do what they want with this book.  This book is far too scientific, it has nothing to do with the natural world and what the author actually studied.  The book has very poor illustrations, there are only a couple of pictures in the whole book, none of them are of anything that would help you understand anything.  Everything in this book is based on conjecture, some of which is downright unbelievable.  I would advise anyone not to read this book, you will be left with no understanding of any material.  It is truly a useless book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The only problem with this book is it's all about how to cook. No real cooking skills are demonstrated. This is a terrible book. It lacks the real recipes, has no real tips, no explanations about the most basic skills. The recipes are mediocre as they always have been in other cookbooks. Even if you do get some real techniques out of this book, they are just not enough for most cookbook lovers. The pictures are not what you want in a cookbook. The book makes it look like all of the pictures are just big glossy pictures. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has been in print for a number of years. However, it is written in a style that is not suitable for a younger reader. It is quite difficult to relate to anyone through any of the main characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's point is that all children need to read is the Bible. I read the other books in this series and found them too dull. This book is not entertaining enough to keep the reader's interest. It would be better if the children in the story were allowed to pick the books they wanted to read. I would not recommend this book to a child.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story starts off okay, but nothing too exciting. As the story progresses however, there is absolutely no progress, just the story keeping going on forever. The author is not very good with writing. There were many times during the story where I thought, "Wow, how the heck is the narrator going to do the actual narration in the next chapter?! I can't wait to see what happens next." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is written by a woman who never lived a very happy life. She seems to be constantly writing about her own life. However, this woman's life is full of tragedy. I could not read the stories about her life for very long. They are too slow moving. I found it very difficult to follow along with the story. I felt that this book was trying to pass itself off as "women's history" book but really was nothing more than that.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated it. It was written for a non-literary audience. The descriptions are the worst. There is no point to it, it is just repetitive. The characters are dull and lifeless. The book could have been better edited. There are no surprises to the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the book I have read in the last few years that I would have never thought I would ever see: the world is run by a group of people who have no interest in humanity, only in themselves, and these people are portrayed as having no morals whatsoever, and who are completely unscrupulous.  The world is one of greed, arrogance, hate, destruction, and violence.  Everything is done to destroy and control the other.  No love, no laughter, no fun.  It's a complete world of darkness.  There is no hope in this book, no reason to hope for any of the characters, because there is none.  They exist only to bring misery and destruction.  I would not recommend this book to anyone, for all of the reasons above.  If you are looking for a good book, this is the one you have been looking for, only you know the only reason you would be looking for one is because of the wonderful world of vampires that it presents.   I'm not looking for any more vampires, only the truth.  In fact, I'm looking for all the truth that there is, so that we may learn from the past and make a better world for the future.  Unfortunately, none of this is explored in this horrible book.  That's not what this book is about, and there is absolutely no way that that's what I was looking for."
Write a negative review about a bad book:  If this book has any influence, it will be to promote the book as a good book to read. In my opinion, the book is worthless. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I would give the book one star if it were available in a printed format. If you like to hear about the good and bad of science, you should steer clear of this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is about the famous death of John Lennon and the subsequent murders committed by his wife, Yoko Ono, and their lover, Mark Fisher.  It has never really interested me since, and it seems like the publisher was just hoping it would sell.  But it didn't, and I can't believe it will now.  I really didn't enjoy this book, but I had to read it.  If you want to read about all the weird and interesting things the Beatles had going on with their wives and their lovers, look elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is not surprising that this book is popular among teachers and students. As stated by the author, it has been marketed as a practical reference book. But this is a non-fiction book about history. This is not a good choice for students interested in the historical accuracy of the subject matter. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed to discover that this book is no longer in print 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is very frustrating to see how much more the author has to say, yet he has all the same faults as the rest. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not only do the authors present an ideological perspective, they also have a dogmatic view of life.  The author talks about how we should live a purer life, and the life of the dead is something to be avoided.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was expecting a different story, and I wasn't disappointed. I'm also disappointed that the book was marketed as an encyclopedia and was not as detailed as the book itself. However, the story is fascinating and the photographs are interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Not the most helpful book for someone who already knows a lot about the field, but this is a case where I could not find any mention of the author's name on his website 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For example, how can a man who is not at all educated in the field of American history and American culture find something to write about 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is written from the perspective of someone who is "not" religious, but doesn't even want to believe that it is.  The book claims it is written for those who are religious, yet the book has nothing to do with Christianity 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not about a religion but about the life of a man who feels a spiritual calling to travel the world and share his experiences. This book is written in a manner that is condescending and tries to make the reader feel superior to the author's experience. The book uses a lot of metaphors and similes to make a man seem more important than he actually is.I think this book is flawed.  It's an attempt to give the reader a more complete picture of a true story rather than tell a compelling story, it's a story that is so important to the life and beliefs of the author that it should be the only story told. The story is not a religious story but a human story told to better illuminate the spiritual journey.I did enjoy reading the book but didn't learn any new things or grow more knowledgeable about life and religion.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book was poorly written and too short. If you buy this book you are making a bad choice. It is a great book but just too short 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a collection of letters written by the dead.  I didn't buy this book for the text.  Instead I found it boring and hard to read.  The writing style was also horrible.  It seemed like every other sentence was the same:  "I'm still waiting on the mailman to bring my mail..."  This is really a short book.  You'd have to buy multiple copies to read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm afraid that this is just another book about the  modern world that is full of  meaningless information. What is it about? The book doesn't explain the history of the world, it's only about how a man like him lives and what his   values are. Not a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel that these books are simply marketing tools to sell the author's book series.  The truth is there are many more accurate and better books out there.  I'd rather pay for books like  Michael Shermer's  The Truth About Sex and Violence: The Untold Truth about Violence 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a nice book with nice pictures, but the writing is unhelpful. The stories are not convincing.  I thought this book was a bit boring so I didn't give it 5 stars, but I still want it to be my primary resource for learning Arabic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is the worst book of all time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read a few books by him and none were as bad as this one.  I'm not going to waste money on it, I'll just buy another book by this author from his publisher, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is a waste of time reading this book. It's mostly just making the reader repeat the same questions over and over again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title is misleading and the text is not much better 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with quotes from famous writers. They are not worth the space and I don't recommend this book to anyone. If you want to know the origin of quotations, skip the books and read the quotes from authors like Richard Gere, Jack London, and James Joyce. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book doesn't even include the entire course of the book in the course list.  This book is really just a rehash of the last book I read.  The problem is that the book does not have a good section on writing for other reasons than to make it look as if the author is a great teacher.  I wish it were as simple as the last books I read:  Learn from the best 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was supposed to be about a woman growing up in rural America. I was very disappointed, as there was nothing to relate the events in the story with. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It does not belong in anyone's library. I had to ask my children to read it in order. The only thing good is that it seems to be available through the library. So, you might want to ask the bookseller for that as well 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in an airport and it was a horrible experience, even though the book itself was quite interesting. The author's style is horrible and this book will not be of any interest to anyone who wants to be an author and a writer.
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is very short and is filled with facts and figures to support the argument. It is very confusing and doesn't have a strong plot. In fact, the book consists of nothing but information with no conclusion. The story is pretty much boring. I would only recommend this book to people who are already knowledgeable about the military. This book is written for the general reader who might be looking for something a little less complex. What I have read, I recommend for people who have a general knowledge of the military as well as the reader who likes to read about interesting subjects. But I definitely would not recommend this for anyone who is not a military person. There are a lot of numbers that don't mean anything and some basic facts that the person who reads this might not know about the different branches of the service. Overall, this book doesn't seem to have a very good grasp on anything. We all know how confusing military is and this book is pretty full of things that are not interesting or well thought out. As long as it is in the military, it's pretty pointless reading and you can expect a few boring paragraphs that contain lots of numbers without any explanation. Even though I've only read about 25 pages, it is hard to read another 25 pages just to learn something new. Unfortunately, this kind of book is not very good to anyone who isn't already knowledgeable in the field. One of the reasons why I gave it a negative rating was because it's very hard to understand this book without being a military member. You can expect the book to be very confusing, especially without a military background. However, if you do have that background and want to read the book, it can still be very interesting if you are looking for a good story or a simple, very simple, informative book. All in all, this is a good book, but I would recommend this only for people with some knowledge of military topics 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a great book about the Beatles. The pictures in the book are just horrible. If you are not a Beatles fan, then you can't really get excited about this book, and if you are, then this book has lost its magic. If only it was easier to get a hold of a copy 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the beginning of the book there is nothing to be gained from reading about what she's doing, what's in her life. Nothing at all, not even an image of what she does with a child. She has no problems or interests, she has only this book to occupy her. It's a total waste of money, time, and resources to buy this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was so bad that I couldn't even finish it. The characters were awful. The plot was dull. It was too boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, I'll say this about the book: it was written in 1999, and this is why this book should not be considered a true "history" of the modern movement for equal rights for women. The author writes that these are still the same issues, however. What a joke. This is a blatant attempt to change the perspective and opinions of women. These are not issues of the past and therefore the author is not qualified to write such a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a bunch of drivel. If you're a real professional, then don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book seems very out of date, not the information that it claims to have.  The writing style is not clear to me and the way the writer presents himself seems to be lacking.  I could not understand why the author had to use the term "white privilege" in this book.  It made no sense to me.  He should have written about how many other people experience being treated poorly and how these are often invisible, sometimes subconsciously. I hope the book is revised and made more useful to the community and to black children. The book should read as such:  Black people have to confront oppression.  Many times we have to fight back and to do that we have been taught that this is a struggle against oppression. The struggle is often invisible because of the ways in which black people are oppressed.  This book tells a positive story about black life in America.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a poor attempt at literary analysis. I feel like he was trying to create a feeling of connection between the characters. They never interact. The book was dull. I ended it with two pages to go and I still didn't feel connected to the characters! Not enough to recommend this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the second time I have had to reread this book. The first time, I thought it was a masterpiece. The second time, it was horrible. I found myself confused while reading this. It was not a good read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing style and story line are extremely inconsistent, and there's nothing exciting about any of the characters except for the main character. All the other characters are basically the same, with one minor difference in the story: in one scene, a minor character is dead, in another she is alive, in yet another she's still dead.   I have no idea how he can think of writing about any character at all in such an inconsistent fashion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is supposed to be about his life, but it is mainly about his "bad" decisions 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is the third  book  in the series and while I am not much of a fantasy reader, this series is not  for me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very disappointing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book doesn't tell you much about Islam that you don't already know.  It gives some information about the Quran, but this is so vague that the average reader won't learn much about the religion.  This is the exact opposite of what you are supposed to learn in Islamic history courses.  Instead of teaching you about the great events in Islamic History, you learn about how Islam is misunderstood by non-Muslims, how the religion itself is under attack, and how many Muslims suffer from psychological problems.  These topics are presented in a somewhat negative light by the author, but you'll know these are his opinions because he's the author of the book.  You can pick up the book if you like a good book, but it'll be the last one you'll read about Islam in a long time, if ever.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is riddled with inconsistencies, many of which the author has no explanation for. For instance, he claims to be a "modernist," yet the story is largely in black-and-white, and he goes on to imply that the colorization was done to help sell the book. In the process of the book, the author repeatedly uses language that is not consistent with his own writing style, particularly the use of the word "fascinated" and its variants, including "enamored." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found most of the material about the Vietnam War completely useless. It was clear that the author had not gone to any of the Vietnam battles or any of that. I found it extremely difficult to go on and on with her. The only reason I am giving it a low rating is that she was one of the more interesting authors and this is the only book she had written. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book starts with the introduction and then the chapters are just scattered in various categories.  As a first book for a young readers it is a very basic and boring, if you are looking for a more detailed book then look elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with bad information. I just wish they were not selling this book as an inspirational book. The information is so poor it is not worth reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't understand anything in the book and it only takes you 3 chapters to do it. I am still confused about who's in charge in the family, how they were raised and how their marriages have been going. But I guess they have been. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is simply too long. The book is a compilation of information and nothing more 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is little to recommend in this book. A lot of the information is only interesting for the purpose of obtaining a job, which is of course, a totally different situation from the book's premise. If you have a job in real life, you probably don't care about some of these things and wouldn't read this book anyway. The book does have a few interesting tips, but for the most part, it's just a recipe of some common jobs and tips about getting the job. It's all about creating your own life and is not an easy book to follow, and it's not very funny either. I wouldn't bother. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a sad commentary that the American College of Pediatricians is not only promoting these flawed theories, but that it has endorsed a book which is a massive waste of time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If this is the kind of writing you are looking for, please don't read this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has no idea of any real historical events. The main characters are from another fictional culture, the Aztecs. No historical details whatsoever. If you are looking for a good read about the Aztec culture, I recommend not wasting your time on this book. Don't even think about picking up this book for your students 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very long book. If you're only interested in what happens to the people in the book, I would definitely avoid this one. I would give it 2 stars instead of 1, but I would only do so if I didn't really believe that the story itself was that engaging. I think the book's primary purpose is to provide information and background about a family's life from a very early age. I don't see how that could possibly justify the amount of time required to learn about a story that starts from about age 3-5. There's nothing to it, and it never really develops.I did learn a little about the author's own life, but it was pretty shallow. She talks about a couple of kids in the family (her sister and niece) as well as the boys in the house. I did find some interesting information about the parents' backgrounds, but they're not really a major focus of the book. There were also a few tidbits about family and friends, but that doesn't really do anything to help you get invested in the characters' lives.I thought the author could have focused more on developing the characters and telling a more compelling story, but she didn't. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who's not looking for an easy, easy read. I found it boring and boring. The chapters feel incredibly rushed, and the story rarely progressed. The characters feel flat and unexciting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not enjoy this book. I thought the plot was over the top and unrealistic. I do not recommend this book for anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book for my senior year in college. It is full of factual errors and misleading information. The author says things like "I believe that God created the universe. But I know that there are many scientists who don't believe this. Therefore I believe that man is only one of the three great branches of creation and not the only one" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the sort of book that will make you cringe, then have to read it to find the humor. Don't waste your time with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the book of the year for those who hate their own authors.  I'm a big fan of the books of this genre, but  it was the first book I read this year, and I was disappointed.  This book will never be for me, even after reading other series,  but for others, this might be the right choice for a short-term series 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read the previous two editions, and it is the same story. This edition has been totally rewritten. The author has been replaced by a marketing rep from the publishing company.  I think the publisher might have better ideas for the next editions, or it is more likely that the author decided not to renew his contract 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book seems to be based on some kind of bizarre idea that is hard to fathom. I'm not sure why it exists, but it seems to have very little basis in fact. A few of the examples given have been debunked, and others are just strange, unnecessary examples. The book's style is confusing and lacks the ability to give the reader a clear idea of what it is writing about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have had this book in my collection for a long time but just got rid of it today.  I had to deal with many different people in this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure that I'll ever find another book like this. The pictures are amazing, but the text is muddled and the writing is very sloppy 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In short, the only way to see the world is through the camera lens, and, sadly, not in a good way. The only good thing about this book is that it provides an entertaining overview of the way the world views photography, but it is not a deep analysis.  I would not recommend this book for a serious photography student or professional.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is a lot of material in this book that is useless, and if you want a thorough understanding of the situation in Iraq, you should buy more than one book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Too many stories are not grounded in reality. People in America are not afraid to lie, cheat, steal, cheat on, and take advantage of others. If you like stories about characters who are not as honorable as they seem, this is the book for you. If for some reason you find yourself drawn to the fictional world of the "good people" of the book, then please stop reading now. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is all about women. Yes, the author is an author, so his book reflects his life. But he also takes the time to tell you how he feels about the male-female relationship, which he believes is the true love of women. This book isn't for any woman. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel  this is the first time the author  has taken a critical look at the history of women  in fiction and the society of the time.  She is quite clearly a conservative thinker  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hate to see a good book ending up like this, because  it was written in the '90s.  And this book was supposed to be a good example of how to approach  self-help, but it failed miserably 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not that bad, but  it's not very helpful. It's all about how women should act in the workplace. That seems like a lot of red herrings to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author has the author's own opinions on the topic. It doesn't matter what you think about it or read about it. But it seems that many of his readers have a bad opinion about it, not knowing the truth of what goes on in the world of pornography, especially when it comes to the most recent scandals. So many of these "victims" don't know any better and are only willing to accept the lies that are being told about them. It's obvious that they're victims and are doing as they are told. So don't even think of taking part in the debate about the morality of these movies or the morality in general. They're going to go on forever. It won't stop, unless the media changes. But if there is a real way to stop this, then it must be stopped at the source. There is no way to prevent something from being made, and you can't control the audience. But you CAN control how you are treated. So I hope that someone can take a stand in this case and put their foot down about what they say about these movies. If not, then people who really know about this should do so. Maybe they can start a boycott, boycott it out of principle, but the sooner this is stopped, the better for everyone. But again, I just can't put my finger on why a lot of people seem to be unwilling to do so, so I'm not trying to. I hope the author will put some truth into this. But he seems to be on a fast track to become another one of these victims who is only going to accept whatever is being said about them and their problems.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't even remember the names of these characters.  It seems that this book was designed to attract young readers and to provide them with a love story.  But I feel it has a greater, more negative meaning 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  It is the same old story from the same group of people.  It doesn't help that it is presented through a poor writing style that is inconsistent, repetitive, and lacking in imagination.  The book is more like a series of short stories. The only reason that I was able to finish the book was because I could relate to some of the characters 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is poorly written, illogical, boring and uninteresting. It is the equivalent of a bad electronic device: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I loved this book. I was looking for something similar and ended up with this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is impossible to know which is true: the book is poorly written, ill-written, in fact, so poorly written that it is unreadable. Or the person is poorly informed about the subjects it presents. In both cases, the subject matter is poorly understood, and the story is so dull that it makes the reader wonder why the writer of the book even bothered. This book is an attempt to convince the reader that she is intelligent enough to understand anything about a subject in which she is not really interested, because the book requires it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I didn't really like this book.  It was written as a series of questions.  But it wasn't answered in any way.  I just didn't see how it was anything more than a gimmick 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is so much material that is nothing more than marketing hype that is sold as the real thing. I'm sure the authors will justify their marketing and make sure to point to the scientific studies which prove the superiority of their products. It's just plain hogwash 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book about a year ago. I don't think I would ever buy a book that uses the same examples for a thousand pages. What a bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this book several times. It's not good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book will most likely serve to help you get a good grasp on a subject that is hard to understand. However, what is not clear is what is the point of reading about something that one cannot easily grasp.  I did not find much of anything interesting in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very  bad book, it doesn't even tell about some of the events in the book or the main character.  The characters are so boring, it's like it was written for kids 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hate this book.  It's not even funny, it's more a rant than a humorous story.  A book about a loser who only has himself to blame for his failure.  That's the only thing the author knows how to write.  His poor excuse of a life is the only way he could ever be a good writer.  This book is as shallow as the world it portrays, and it's not funny.  Don't buy it, I would never buy a book like this again." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing style is not my thing. But the writing style seems to be used for all the wrong reasons. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not sure what I am supposed to take away from this book, but I know that most people will disagree with me.  If you are looking for a book that will give you a quick run-down of current trends in technology and culture, this one is probably not the best for you.  For this reason I doubt that the majority of people who read this book are going to be any more or less informed on these issues than those who buy the latest magazines.  I know this because I am a software developer, and this book does not give me any deeper information than what I could get from a book on the subject.  The best that I can say about this book is that it covers an incredibly small part of technology that is very important to me, but that is about all that I could do with it.  I am sure that some other professional writers have done a better job of covering the subject, but this book simply doesn't make that any easier to read.  All in all, this book feels like a collection of the latest trends, not a serious look at technology 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is NOT the book you want to have on your shelves. The book is filled with very confusing information and does not even bother to present a good review of the book. You don't have to be a brain surgeon to see that this book is not helpful to people with learning disabilities 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a great read, but there is no plot. The book has too much unnecessary information for your enjoyment. And the writing style is sloppy.I can say this book has nothing to do with what it is claimed to. There are more than 70 times where it seems that the author had a blank page in his hand to write on.If you're looking for a quick read on something you don't need to know, or anything for you to do in your daily life, don't buy it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not for the children:  This book seems to have become popular primarily through parents who are trying to get their children to read books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has no clear explanation of the events. There is no explanation of why it is the women are targeted 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book makes it sound like a good book should be:  The best part about it is the photos that make it look so awesome. The story does not tell you any of this information.  It is all just for looks, and it is just not that good.  The author did not make any attempt to get to the truth about the book, and she doesn't seem to have that much of a clue about the story, either.  She just wants you to look at the photos and say   I do  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is nothing but a collection of short stories. The stories are quite entertaining but the stories never actually get started. I found them very confusing because I only read about 10 of the stories in this book. In addition, many of the short stories were repeated several times in other books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an obvious attempt to discredit the teaching of Gnosticism by the Vatican. As a Gnostic myself, I find this extremely disheartening. For many of us, this religion was a key to our spiritual growth.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the story about the girl who has no family to support her, that she's been abandoned by her father as soon as she's found out that he was in on a conspiracy to kidnap a child,  to be quite unbelievable.  I had trouble understanding why this little girl was so desperate, how she was able to convince the police to take her seriously.  It didn't seem to be a case of her convincing them or even being able to give a good account of her experience,  she simply seemed to tell her story in order to gain sympathy and help her situation.  In the end she seems to have lost all her hopes of ever finding her father   The author does not give the facts of the case to the reader, she does not tell us anything.  She just gives the story, makes it sound like it's the only thing  about the story.  As a mother, this made it hard for me to buy into the story and even harder to understand why she was so adamant in taking her father to task.  After a while I just stopped reading the story as it made absolutely no sense.  The only reason I was able  to finish this story was the fact that I had read it in the library and I was just waiting for this book to come out.  If it was something that interested me, then I would have  gone to the library myself.  But alas, it didn't interest me and there's nothing else to be said about it.  All the author did was tell a story about a girl that was desperate for her father's support and was unsuccessful in getting any.  There was no real character development here, no drama, just a story. It was all about the little girl, her mother and the events surrounding the kidnapping.  What I didn't understand was why the author kept changing her point of view so much,  even to the point where she had to change her story to fit the needs of the police.  That made the whole story very confusing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I've ever read.  The book is written in a rambling style with little or no logic, no real insight into the situation at hand, and few interesting ideas.  I found this book to be utterly boring and repetitive.  There was hardly anything new to be found in this book, no matter how many times I read it.  This book should never be recommended or read for pleasure.  It is a horrible, boring, boring book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete waste of money. It is boring and lacks depth of understanding. It doesn't contain any meaningful information for the average person and the author makes it clear at every step of the way. This book will make you feel like you are in a library looking up rare books with a couple hundred dollars in them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think the author does an awful job trying to describe this story.  She has to make some leaps to make her point, but never comes up with any clear explanation of why some people are so desperate to marry their mothers or vice versa 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Too bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved the idea of making an adventure that involved going on an adventure and discovering a secret. That would be the plot for this book
