Write a positive review about a good book:  So this is a short novel which is about a guy (that's me) who is obsessed with sex. He thinks he is a real man. He gets lots of girls. He feels he is in love with his women. He doesn't like sex as much as he is used to. The whole thing comes to a head when he goes to his ex-girlfriend's house. The girl she used to live with and his ex's boyfriend. She has a new boyfriend who is a guy that she used back when she was married. They go at it. He is so hot and she is a piece of shit. He calls himself a feminist for that reason. But it's so sad. A guy that is obsessed about sex, and that gets more and more upset as the story progresses. But he is so turned on. It's sad.   I think that this is one of the most realistic and realistic looking novels that I've ever read. I really enjoyed reading this. I'm not sure why but I kept thinking about it in my car on the way to work.   It has a story and an ending that I could relate to.  ,
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________This book was amazing, it's probably the best resource to learn how to read without having to use a book. The book starts by going over the basics of the 3 main types of people in the world, we have: the people who are intelligent, people who have some ability and some bad. This way it teaches you to read more like you would like to read a book, more than the way you are taught to read. It takes you through the 3 types and how they look at a given sentence to figure out how to translate it and then how to do that, and it is very good. I'm an intelligent person who gets angry easily and a little bit, it will get you frustrated, but it will also make you think, and this will give you a better understanding of how people read. There is some humor in this book, but not over the top, it is just fun to read, and will make you laugh a few times. There are some great stories, they are well written and great characters.The book teaches you grammar in a way that is easy to understand and fun to learn. It also teaches you about what kind of person you are, what type of people you might end up becoming if you put in effort. It teaches you how to put yourself in the shoes of someone else in the story. It gives you a good grasp of what the other person is thinking and feeling and then gives you the ability to empathize with that. The author gives you specific details of where the characters are going and when you will find out about them. I think there were a few that I thought were a bit over the time, but this was definitely a book I will try to come back to every now and then and give it a shot.  4 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:     This is the kind of book I always want to read but never really get around to it. I was in high school when I first heard of it and had to get it on the bookshelf. Now I want to re-read it! I really enjoyed this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was looking for something a little less pretentious and more relatable than The World at the End of the Lane. This book is a lot like The World At the End Of The Lane, but it's not as pretentious. In fact, the writing and humor is much more relivable. The worldbuilding, of course, was excellent, and the characters were much better fleshed out. This book had a few issues that really made me cringe. The writing was a little wordy. And it's a little hard to read if you're looking for more than 140 characters per sentence. But that didn't hold me back from buying this book. The author has created a real living world. And I'm glad that he spent a few more pages on how the characters interact in this world.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book, it gives us a great overview of the development of the idea of a "right to die" from its early roots in the 16th century to modern times. It's also great for learning about the development and history of the philosophy of euthanasia. This book explains how the idea was originally adopted in Sweden in the 17th century. I enjoyed it, and found the book very easy to read and understand. This is also a good, interesting book for those interested in the philosophy and politics of euthanics.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I had a little bit of trouble finding this book for the money it was, so I got it on sale. However, I think that I really found the best of the bunch. The story is told through the eyes of a young boy who finds his father having an affair with a woman and the boy tries to tell his dad that he is gay and asks him for help to stop his dad. The book is easy to understand, as the father tries to help the son. The son's father is also a very nice guy and his dad is a little annoying and I guess there is a bit of a rivalry between them, but they are both really nice. I loved the illustrations as the story was told and the little boy was really cute and I liked the humor. I would like to read more of the boy's adventures. (Posted on 8/24/2013)

Write a positive review about a good book: _________   I don't think any of the book's ideas should be taken seriously, but in the case of The Life of Pi I can't think of a better summation of the author's vision than "Pi is a book about the search for purpose and meaning". As such, it's a really good and deeply moving book.

Write a positive review about a good book:..................................   One of my favorite books ever.   It was fun and engaging, and I enjoyed reading about the characters in detail. It's a little short, though, but not because it has to be. I really think it could be extended in length for people to really get the sense of the characters, the history, and what they really thought of their life.   the characters were just what they were: real, honest, flawed, likable.   of course we need to consider the fact that this book is set in the Middle Ages, which are a lot different from the present-day. And it's important to note that we are not living in that time and that's really what makes the story so great! I think I would have enjoyed it even more if it was a bit longer, but I can't really complain about that. I loved it!!
Write a positive review about a good book:...............................Barry Goldwater  I recently acquired a set of "The Complete Works of Barry Goldwater", a complete edition, all nine volumes, a total of 4.4 million words. A friend sent me this book, hoping to find something that would help me when I needed it most. Well, I've been doing a lot of work lately, but reading this helped me think about some things that have been on my mind, that were hard to put into words for lack of a better word, things like the right course of action, what is wrong and why, and so forth.   A solid goldmine.  , May 5, 2009  This is the book that I have wanted to read, since I was a young child. I had already read it a few years ago, but always felt like I had missed a lot. I finally bought the paperback version. This is an extremely thorough work of historical analysis, in which, while it's not a work of genius, it is extremely useful.  , January 14, 2009
Write a positive review about a good book:    "Weird things have been happening lately. Strange events were being experienced. I'm talking about paranormal sightings, strange sounds, inexplicable changes in my state of consciousness, and strange events in my life.   A few weeks ago, while working in my yard, I started hearing strange sounds. I would hear them for a minute or two and then stop. They'd be in the same place, but the same exact time.  At first, it didn't make sense. I thought maybe I'd been hearing them right on top of me for a while. After all, the wind was right that morning, so I had to be hearing the wind.   a few weeks later, I was walking home from work when all of a sudden, I felt someone walk very close to me, and I turned around. At the same moment, I heard a noise like that of a car hitting metal on a gravel road. A car!  Then, while walking down the road, I could see some light moving up and down. The light was moving in an angle and seemed to be coming out of a manhole. I looked back and forth and could see two strange faces in the light. One of them was white and the other one was red. I turned to the other person in the car, and he was the one with white face and red eyes. .   There's really something to this. There is something out there, and it is getting closer to us, and the closer we get, the more strange things will happen.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm really impressed by this book. It's a quick read and I liked how you take a more traditional approach to writing than a traditional novel does. I appreciated that this was an intro to writing and didn't try to spoon feed the reader anything (at least from the first few pages).   It's a very well written book that I recommend to anyone looking for a more creative approach to creating fiction. If you are a self-publisher, you may find it helpful.

This is a great story and a very well written one, especially for a first book in the series. I loved how the author managed to capture the tone and feeling of the novel with each character. I really enjoyed the characters and felt they were well developed and believable. The book had a good plot, the characters all feel like they are real and not just made up.

In my opinion, "The Frontier of the Heartland" is an excellent one to start with. The author is a historian himself. He has done extensive research and is able to give you a good description of how life was at that time. His information is accurate. He gives the facts of life as they were at that particular time. In many ways it was a little different then what was going on in Europe. The frontier has changed many times since. This book provides an excellent overview of the era. -Robert H. -Good book for history lovers ____________________________________ - This book is a good read for the history lover. It is an interesting history that gives the background of how the west was formed and the impact it had on people from various nations, and of course the people from those nations themselves. - -M.W. -Great History for the History Lover _____________________________________ In this well written book, Charles P.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "I will never forget what this book said to me. It taught me that I was going to have to come into my own as a writer and that was something I had wanted to do for quite some time."   -Lori, Amazon Customer   I first heard of Mabel Pynchon during her time at Barnard College in 1985. I had just finished my first semester and I wanted to write something, anything. I went to see the Barnard Writers Program's presentation of M. Pynchan's poetry and then met a couple of Barnard students who had read the poems and asked me what I was working on. I told them that I wanted a story about my own life and they encouraged me to read "V." Mabel and I fell in love right there at the presentation and have not stopped thinking about it since. "V" was my first published work and has stayed with me ever since. It's a story of two girls growing up, of two worlds that collide when they're kids and what happens when those worlds collide is magic, romance, and intrigue. I love the simplicity of the plot, Mabel's love for a boy, and the magical world the story takes place in. I also love the fact that Mabel isn't as clever as she thinks she is, and she's trying to learn that she is. I've always loved Mabel.   This is a must read for those of you that are looking for a romantic read with some adult themes. This isn't something that you're going to get bored of, you're not going to find this book dry, there's an incredible amount of depth and emotion that comes across here. I will continue to purchase this book because I am still very interested in the author's world and this will be one of my favorites from her books.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The novel is about a young girl who lives alone in her old apartment. She is a normal, intelligent girl who is bored and miserable. She has never had a boyfriend, has never been in a romantic relationship, and hates her own life. She finds solace in her books and she devours them, but is forced to read some novels that are not books. I found this book to be a very good representation of a young woman's life. The author wrote about her life as a typical teenage girl and her experience and challenges. I recommend this book, because it is a good, realistic portrayal of a teenage girl's life, especially in the world that is today.

Write a positive review about a good book:.............................. I was very pleased to see that the author was able to write this book and to give me a real insight into the Jewish people. The author shows that the Jews are indeed not what they are portrayed to be. I was also quite pleased to find out that there is a Jewish religion! In fact, there are a great many Jewish religions but I feel that they are being taken very lightly and the book highlights that very well. It is a book that must be read by all those who have a keen interest in the Jewish religion as I was. I highly recommend this book to everyone.  Write a negative review about the bad:..................................... My experience with this book was a bit disappointing. The first half was all about the religion. The second half was a very short historical overview. This was disappointing. However, the book is still worthwhile for its insight into one of the most misunderstood and misrepresented groups.  the Jewish religious history is the subject of this book, not just the history of one or two individuals. It was quite interesting to read about the Jews in their own religion and how they did develop it, how they became so powerful, etc. I would recommend this for those interested in this subject. But it would be a lot better if there had been more historical information. It wasn't all that difficult to understand, and it didn't feel repetitive. Overall, it is an interesting book, worth reading!  The Jewish religion has been written about for a long time, but there has been very little written about the history and evolution of the group. This book gives a very good overview of the Jews. , July 4, 2004
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a big fan of Robert Harris and I was very excited to read The Last Samurai, which I was told would be a great read. This book was far from it. I am not going to go into detail about the plot but suffice it to say that Harris never got his point across. It is an interesting read in that it gives an insight into how much can be achieved when writing for screen, but it is hard to get attached to the characters and to like the characters at the end of the day. Harris has a tendency to repeat himself and he just felt more like a character in a novel than the lead. For some reason I found myself rooting for the evil emperor at the beginning and then the evil prince who was clearly meant to be a villain. He did not have the appeal of the emperor and it was really irritating to be part of a character who has to prove his manhood and strength over the course of the novel. I felt that Harris had no confidence in his characters and I think that would have ruined the story.   If you are looking for a story to read this is not it, but there are a few good elements in it, a really interesting style of storytelling and some good characters.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________________  I am a fan of fiction and have been enjoying some of the more realistic "noir" books for a while now. The more I read the more I realized that not only is there a lot of depth to the characters, but there is a lot to be said about the world and society as well. I am a huge fan of the "Wanted" series by James Frey. While there is not an abundance of dialogue, you can really understand the thoughts of the characters. The narrator does a great job of capturing the atmosphere of the time period, as well as the thoughts and feelings of the people around him. You'll definitely have a hard time not liking anyone in this book, even if it is an asshole. Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story with good characters.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book. Its like a short story book, but I can enjoy reading about it. I've read a few stories in this series before, but this is my first story book. The book was written very well. It took me a while to get started and I had to go back and reread the last few chapters to get all the information. But once I got the story straight, I enjoyed it. It's like a fantasy story about a group of friends trying to survive on a harsh island. I like it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  Love the story of the children with cancer. It is so powerful for so many reasons.  The ending is heartbreaking. I was so shocked and sad after reading it. This book is such a personal experience of the author and I loved that it was so well written and so very heartfelt. It's just so hard to see how someone can end up with cancer like that. The book gives so much insight into the cancer itself and the effect on all the family members.    This book definitely won my heart! It is a true story of one family's fight with cancer and their love and compassion for one another. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story.

Write a positive review about a good book: ***********The best book on the subject of Scientology. I would recommend this to anyone.*********** (January 3, 2012)   Helpful information: **************L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology. What You Don't Know About Scientology is a must read for any Scientologist. This book provides a very critical look at the world of Scientology and its founder. By doing this, it exposes the lies that are told, the abuses that are committed, the lies told to justify those abuses, and the true story about what really went down in L. Ron's life. L.Ron Hubbard was a great man who did great things in his life. But that was only because he wasn't a slave to his own mind. The truth that is presented here is the only way to see the true nature of L.R.H.   **************Read the other reviews about this book.********** (September 10, 2012); (September 14, 2012 ); (September 26, 2012 )   Good book for reading with kids: *****************************I have a 9 year old who loves reading. He would probably love this book too. It is about L. RON HUBBARD and how he developed Scientology. It shows that even a master at what he was doing is unable to escape the limitations of his mind and it's limited abilities. He doesn't get all the way out of it and he ends up like most people who read L. L Ron Hubbard. He is still trying to understand things, trying to use his mind for better things, he just has the ability to make himself do it in a short time. He should have been out by now and I wouldn't read about him now. But this book tells how he did it. It's not perfect but at least you have a chance to see what it took to get there.************* (June 21, 2012)* (June 27, 2012)"*************This book is so interesting that I read it twice, once by itself in the morning and again in the afternoon. The author presents it very carefully and thoroughly. This makes you very aware of what you read. I also have the book on CD and I have listened to it many times. It contains a great deal of interesting information on L.L.R.'s life and on Scientology. If you read this book, you will understand the main point, and you will be able to make a great contribution in helping L.H.'s
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ This book has a lot of useful information, but its presentation and language is sometimes misleading. I did not find that there were enough examples for newbies. But, the information presented is all based on the theory, not the experience, of someone who is a graduate in science. So it has an educational quality that is useful.
Write a positive review about a good book:  We had heard so many good things about the "Tales of the Jedi" by George Lucas and were excited to have the opportunity to read it. The first time we went to the theater I remember thinking "this is going to be one of the better ones." As we sat down to read we were surprised to find out that the book isn't like other books we've read. The characters were fleshed out and well developed. The story took us down a number of interesting paths and gave us a glimpse into a galaxy far, far away. The only thing I would like to have seen improved would have been some more information about what happened to the Jedi after "Return of the Jedis". I was hoping they would come back but that isn't the case. The end of the book, and the final battle, left us wanting more.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________ (I am one of the ones who really really loved the series)  Read one or more books in a series, and if I liked them I'd read the rest. This is my second in the series. This was my first in the world of The Dresden Files. I love the series, I enjoy the characters, and I love seeing the world, but it's not really about them as much as it is about the characters. This book was interesting, but not great. The Dresden family is a great one, but this isn't a very well developed character arc for any one family.   The Dresden Files, though a wonderful series, is not very easy to follow or follow as it progresses. I'll try to explain, and hope it's helpful:   When they go on their first mission, Harry starts a war in London and then has to deal with his father's death. This war begins at an extremely personal level for Harry, and it is very interesting, touching, and fun, but the story progresses extremely slowly. The conflict takes place in two years after the events in the previous book. We get some character interactions and some plot elements, but, as an omnibus, it doesn't really have the depth that it needs. The story of Harry Dresden and his family isn't as complex as most.  : Harry has to go back and deal with the fallout of his father, and the war between London and the rest of the world. He learns his father used to be a powerful wizard, and has been using a lot of magical powers to help protect and lead the city, which can now be found in the other world.   and this is not an easy story to read. It's not one you can just flip through and read fast. Each chapter feels like it's dragging. The pacing can be slow at times.  , there is some great things about this book. The way they tell the story is really interesting. Each day in the Dresden family feels like a new chapter and each character is different. I really enjoyed seeing how the Dresden brothers grew up and learned about the world around them. I had the hardest time deciding who was the bad guy and who was a good guy, but I liked the character interactions. Harry, especially, has a lot to think about. He is the only character in the story who doesn't seem to understand why his father is so protective of him.  . The world building was also interesting.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Book: I'm so excited to read this book.  I'm the oldest of five.  The oldest was 16, the youngest 11.  My oldest, my daughter, has struggled with anxiety from the moment she could walk.  She was not diagnosed with it until age 19.  That year she was hospitalized due to a panic attack.  It's one of the reasons that I'm such a strong advocate for seeking mental health treatment.  We are told that anxiety is an illness and that people with it have a disorder and that it is not something to be ashamed of.  There's that quote I mentioned earlier.  But I can honestly say that even though she may have struggled with mental illness the way that I did, even though my daughter may not be so fortunate, I didn't feel ashamed.  Because it wasn't my issue.  In fact, it wasn I am so excited for this book to be out.  A big part of my life as a teacher is the ability to help the kids find their own way of feeling and thinking.  Sometimes that means the hard way (i.e., a lot of yelling, tears, etc.), and other times that means talking to kids and trying to help them understand that it's OK to ask questions and take risks and that they aren't alone.  And then there are times where it doesn't work (i don't know how to say this without sounding harsh), and those are times when it's important to get up and move on.  For me that's when the book comes in.  You know, the time when a teacher says something that is important and kids just shrug, "what is it?"  Or the time a kid gets the wrong information (it's not about his or her behavior, it's about their emotions).  You get the idea.  One of the things that has been great about this book is that the author provides the framework of how to do those tough things.  They're not hard lessons, they're just basic rules.  He tells a story about the first time a child got a little pushy or yelled at him, and the author describes his reactions to that.  Then he tells the story of when he got to talk to his daughter about being afraid of something and how he took her by the hand, said something simple that he found so helpful, and helped her feel better.  This book is not about giving advice or making sure

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I bought this for my 4-yr-old son. He doesn't like reading, so I knew he wouldn't like it, but I still was glad I read it for him. He liked it. He was also very impressed when he saw all the cool pictures of dogs, cats and other animals. I am a registered nurse, and had the opportunity to work in a clinic where we treated many pets and had a chance to help a patient who had been rescued and then lost her home in a fire. I had a real soft spot in my heart for the homeless and the dogs and cats that were left. There's not enough attention paid to animals in a shelter setting, and there's a huge number of them that are homeless and in need of help. I'd definitely recommend this to my friends.

Write a positive review about a good book:      I have read several books on the topic of the Book of Mormon, and have had much to think about it, and to ponder over, but have not been able to reach a conclusion.  For a number of reasons I have finally come to the conclusion that there is no way in God's Heaven that the Book is a work of fiction.  It is a veritable treasure trove of historical and religious information that is verifiably true!  I believe the Book to be God's word and His own translation of a true ancient work.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________   It was a pleasure reading this book, but I have some questions/comments/concerns. It seemed the author didn't quite know what to do with the magic system, for example, what the point is. I am just beginning to get a feel for how much I would love it if the magic would simply work the way it is supposed to, and be not only believable, but well executed.  The world building was also quite poor and I found it difficult to understand some aspects of the people, especially at the beginning. , however, it is a very good world, with a great deal of interest in every part, especially the details on the magic systems. The author did a good job with the descriptions of the setting and the descriptions, the details are interesting and not simply a matter of copy-pasting. The story was interesting but not that original. I feel that it's a very well written story, with quite a bit of depth, but it felt that it didn't go far enough, I think it might have been better with another 5 to 10 years of development.  the plot is rather basic, and as it seemed, a bit forced, but all in all, a very promising novel. I liked the characters.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________.  Review by: Richard M. , September 6, 2012 :  It is clear to me that this was a difficult book to write. I did not like writing it. I liked writing it the most when I was editing it. It took me about 12 to 15 pages to do a section, and that is why I took a while to review it. The whole thing was a chore to write, and my thoughts were very convoluted.   The first chapter starts out well. The narrator is very clear and concise in telling you the situation in which the characters find themselves. At first I was confused as to why the narrator felt the need to tell us this, but once I understood the reasoning it made sense. It is a great first chapter and it gave me a feeling of safety and security. It was also fun reading this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  In The Black Tapes, I found this story was both complex and easy to understand. The plot is very well executed, the story is interesting and the characters are well thought out. It's an enjoyable read, with very little in the way of gore or violence (although it's not really that bad). The only drawback is that the story takes a bit of time to get going, which is a bit disappointing when you've invested so much time into the characters.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********************** I've never enjoyed a book quite as much as this one. I just wish I'd read it in high school. I feel like I learned so much by having him as a role model and a friend. He gave me an important part of my life when it really needed to be given. He taught me not to worry about what others think of me, and to do my own thing and make choices for myself. I would recommend this to anyone, no matter what your sexual orientation is. I had a really hard time finding this book when I started searching for it. It was not even listed as a recommended read anywhere online. I got a copy when I wanted it and couldn't find anything else about it at my local library.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the best book I have read so far this year. I have a friend that is a very strong-willed and opinionated person and she said to me that she likes to read about topics that are difficult to understand, but that she really enjoyed this book.  She really enjoyed how it is so easy to follow the main character and why there are so many reasons to enjoy the story and the overall story.  She also told me that the book was very good to read at bedtime because it really helped her get to sleep.    The book has a good story line and the book is written very well.  When I read it I thought it would be easy to read because the main characters are smart, but I am so glad to find out that it is still easy to learn and understand.  I did not find it difficult to follow, but the way that the characters react to events and their decisions were very understandable.  My friend thought it was a good experience and recommended it to me.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone that would like to read and learn about the issues of slavery and the hardships they faced.

Randall Brown, M.D., Director, Behavioral Medicine Department, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center  The truth about the United Kingdom: A history from Caesar to Reagan; An investigation into the secret operations of government. Written by an American doctor who is no longer politically correct or of a certain creed. From Henry Kissinger to Ronald Reagan, this book is based on original research into what the United Kingdome really is. The United Kingdom was created by a group of Americans to take over the former British Empire, and the United Nations was created to give them control over the world. There were 3 things the Brits wanted, the USA, the World Bank and the UN. The first two could be achieved by simply voting and the third was too much of a challenge for them to overcome. So they created the United World Government and gave themselves the authority to make all decisions on earth in order to protect the New World Order. In the United Nation's "Preamble" (which you read below in the footnotes), you find that they claim to serve the people. In fact they serve only the Illuminati and the Rockefellers. At the same time, the CFR, the Council on Foreign Relations, and other secret organizations have been creating the United Nacion. As in all conspiracies, there are those who do the planning, and

It's an adventure that starts on a small island, and leads to a place of mystery and suspense. I am glad I read this. My friend, who reads a lot of literary fiction, loved it as well. It won the Caldecott Medal. 6) A Stranger Among Us by N.K.

I thought it was great. 5) The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet  by Kim Stanley Robinson -  my review -- An inspiring story of the human spirit and its connection to the cosmos. 4) A Fire Upon the Deep by C.C. MacAulay - my review - A wonderful new novel about an ancient race of survivors. 3)  The Giver by Lois Lowry - My review  - The first book in the epic "Giver" trilogy. A gripping story about the legacy of a man who would be a hero in another time. This is the kind of science fiction that's made me fall in love with space travel and interstellar exploration. I read it and loved it so much I reread it two months later and loved every word. 2)  A Deepness in the Sky by Arthur C. Clarke - my review   - Another classic sci-fi masterpiece, this time about a human mission to explore space. This book blew my mind the first time I read about it. This was the first science fiction book I ever recommended to people. This one will forever be one of my favorites. 1)  Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeer - my thoughts   - This is a gorgeous novel about "the end of the world." I can't wait for the movie adaptation.
Write a positive review about a good book:      This was a great read and really reminded me of another book that I had read earlier about the same subject. It reminded me that when a new subject comes along, people look around and try to find a "new" word to describe what they are doing.   It may sound simple and a bit "fantasy" to read a book that was about people living the same everyday life over and over but there are some common patterns that the author found that help bring the book to life.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is my go to book for learning about economics. It was so much fun to read. I love that the book doesn't teach you the theory of economics, but rather how to read it and how to make use of it.  The material is simple enough that you can pick it up with a couple of hours of your time. I was able to pick up the concepts in this book in a couple days of reading the chapter and then using the examples to help me understand and apply them to my real life.    It took me just a few days to get the hang of it, and by the time I was done I knew what to do to apply these ideas in my daily life. I will be keeping this book on my list of resources for years to come.

In an effort to make the book easier for my daughter, I have made the characters of the book look like real people in the real world and not just fictional characters. The reason for this is to keep her interested and make her think that there is a happy end to the book and that she is still on the road to being the very best reader that she can be!   My daughter is now over 7, and has no trouble with "funny" stories because she doesn't get too serious. She will sit quietly with her hand on her stomach and listen to the story or do something like that while I read the book to her. In a way it reminds her of the time when I used to read to her while she was on the floor when I was a little girl. It's a great idea, and it keeps my daughter from getting frustrated. She is a very happy little girl who likes to laugh and have fun when I read to me.   The book is funny, but it is also touching, heartwarming and full of life. If you like to read, give this one a try.
Write a positive review about a good book:!!!Read it on a plane and have not stopped talking about it yet.It is one of those books that will leave you with the same question in your head after each page is read, 'Is that a real book?'.I am not a fan of stories that are filled with lots of character development but that is exactly what these guys did. They created a new world filled with characters you will be dying to see. I was drawn in with the story from the beginning. One thing I did NOT like is that they are very one dimensional, and only a few things about them are ever important, not to mention all of the details of each character's past that seem to be kept from the reader. The art and design of the world was really beautiful. I have never read an audiobook that I enjoyed more than this one.I can not imagine the book any other way, but if you are interested in the world of this book I suggest you do yourself a favor and give this one a listen.I give it 4 stars because it is a very good book that should be in everyone's library.I don't know how they do it but I am not the only one who loves this book!
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was good, the plot was good.   However, there are several problems with the book.     The writing in the first two chapters is poor, there is one story thread in the book that just seems to hang there, it doesn't seem connected to the rest of the story or it has no real payoff. The only thing I can think is that the characters in the story are too similar. It seems like the same people are involved in the events as the first 2 chapters.   and I found out something interesting about the book, it is set in a near future, there's no time travel. I don't know if that means the characters are set in the same time period or not, I have a feeling the time travel will come later in the series. There are no clear moral or ethical dilemmas in the books, everything happens to the characters for reasons that have nothing to do with right or wrong, it really doesn't feel like there is an overall good/evil theme to the book because I felt every character was wrong at one point or another. I found that when it came to the moral choices the characters were faced with it was just too easy for them to make the wrong choice and so I felt the book was just full of bad decisions. The writing also seems to be a bit clunky in places.   the main character is also very weak, I felt sorry for him at one part in the novel because I could see the pain he was going through, but he still made bad decisions, I didn't feel he was given enough time to get over the things he was through.   he also seems very stubborn, this can be a bad thing in novels, it can be very annoying, because you feel like you need to keep working at it to get him to change his ways, and I don' want a protagonist who is stubborn.  , but there was also a lot of development for one character, this could mean a good thing or a bad, and maybe this development could have been handled better.   of course this wasn't my main problem with this book, but it wasn't bad in the end, it just kept me off of the book for a while.  
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________________________   "Fascinating, moving and fascinating."  -Publishers Weekly   "...a unique insight into our times." 's "Unraveling the Mysteries of the Mind" (1998) is one of the most important and influential books on psychology ever written, and it has been praised by such luminaries as Daniel Kahneman, James Q. Wilson, Amos Tversky, and Daniel Gilbert. This essential work offers the best way yet to explore the hidden processes of the mind.   A leading British psychologist, William James, once remarked, "The man who has a knowledge of his own mind, but has no notion of the ways in which his mind operates on the thinking of others, has only one method of life." F. Scott Fitzgerald's quip about writers and critics is even truer: "To know is not enough; one must also understand." In "Unfolding the Mystery of the Human Mind," psychologist Carl Rogers demonstrates that the mental processes of learning, thinking, and perceiving have not been adequately studied and understood by both scientists and laymen. Rogers argues that our human capacity for mental mastery is not a skill but a biological faculty that can be trained, and that the key to understanding how the mind works is to learn to "unravel the mysteries of the human mind."   Rogers's groundbreaking research has transformed many fields of human understanding, and his clear, accessible style, paired with an engaging narrative, makes the book both an invaluable reference work and a deeply personal journey into the workings of our minds.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I thought the author did a great job of creating an intricate story.   But in the end, it's a very dry novel that can be confusing at times. I found myself wondering what was going on with the main character, the one with the long blond hair and blue eyes.   is it a coincidence that the author mentions a friend of his wife in the beginning of the book.   he said that when the protagonist, Harry, meets this friend, Harry gets a vision of someone he knew a long time ago and that is how Harry knew his friend's name. But how does this friend have long blond and blue-eyed hair?   The author also mentions that there is something strange about the two protagonists.   the one that is tall and has blond hair is always trying to figure out who this other one is and even when he finds out he doesn't really believe it, that person is still just as mysterious as the first one. And his first name is also mentioned to Harry as "Juan."   It was a very confusing read. I really had no idea what was happening until I found out that there was a "J.A." after his first initials. I thought it was just a strange coincidence.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________  A beautiful, emotional novel about a woman and her son coping with the aftermath of a car accident.   I thought this story was very well told. I loved the story of how the accident occurred and the impact it had on the family. The author took the time to make the characters real, and to make them relatable to me. They each had their own quirks and it was clear that all of the characters were a reflection of the author's own personality.  .   the ending is satisfying, but I wanted to know more about what had happened to each character.  _________________________
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________________ I really enjoy reading about the world of science! This book gave me a very interesting view of all the different theories of evolution that I've heard about, and how it's possible that our genetic code can evolve. The way he has done it is to present the most important evidence and then allow the reader to speculate about the origin of that evidence. You can't read about evolution in one book! The book covers a lot of ground and explains things in a way that's interesting, so it can be quite an interesting read. I really look forward to seeing what the next book will cover, if it is one that I would recommend to all scientists. Highly Recommended

Write a positive review about a good book:  The first time I read this book I was pretty pissed off. I'm not saying it's a bad book. It is. But I got past my initial anger and read the book and I actually enjoyed it. So I'm gonna give it a 5/5 What did I like: *This book was actually interesting to me.  *The story is set in the year 2137 and I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's about a guy named Joe, who's a scientist. *He gets to live in this futuristic city and has to deal with all kinds of shit *Joe is quite intelligent and can even build some pretty impressive machines What didn't I like? *A lot of the character's voices are kind of annoying, like the female voice or the male voice for the robot characters *I wouldn't mind seeing the rest of the series *All the characters from the first book just seem kind of silly and annoying, that makes the story more confusing. So overall, I'm giving it a 7/10.  I would recommend this book to people who are fans of science fiction, or people who like science fiction in general.
Write a positive review about a good book:    In my experience this is the best book on the history of Christianity. Not a book that is a history of the early Christians or the early church but a book about the Christians themselves. If you are a Christian that wants to learn more about the early Christianity or just read about the origins of Christianity this is a book you will want to have on your bookshelf. The history in this book is very well researched and written. It's also very accessible. If that's not a good enough reason to read this book, I don't know what is. It has a very clear and understandable format for the reader who is a non-Christian, and if the reader can handle some fairly difficult material like it's difficult to follow and read the footnotes. The author does a very good job of getting to the facts of the life of the church.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the most informative book on the subject of this topic I have come across. It is very practical and gives a clear explanation of the reasons why certain behaviors and thoughts are detrimental to a person. Also there is the best part that the author is actually a victim of her own behaviors and has used them to help others who have the same kind of issues. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the destructive nature of these issues!

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________________________________________ This book is a good introduction to the concepts of economics that most of us will come to know in college. The author has carefully chosen and researched several economists, including Milton Friedman, John Kenneth Galbraith, James Tobin and John C. Calhoun, in an effort to make his book as accessible as possible. However, this book would have been better if he had included some of the economists who have since died, such as Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, as well as the economists in the early stages of their careers. Also, although I had read a couple of textbooks on economics in high school, I had little background on the economics of the American Revolution, the English Civil War or the American Civil War. For that reason, I found this book very interesting, and thought it did a good job of summarizing the main economic principles in a concise and understandable manner.

Write a positive review about a good book: *********   I thought this book was very interesting and thought-provoking. I think it was one of the more interesting books on modern day economics that I've ever read. The author did a good job of showing how the various theories can be shown to be complete and utter rubbish. It's not really the kind of book you get all hung up about and go on a tirade about the differences between "liberal" economics and "conservative" economics. If you want a solid look at the economic policies of our modern age, and how the financial crises are being deliberately engineered by the bankers, this is a great book to read. It is important, however, to keep in mind that the information presented in this book is not meant to be taken literally. I'm not a fan of how the author presented the economics in the book, as he did tend to present his ideas with a much more dramatic tone, and tended to ignore what was being said in more technical discussions in favor of talking about things like the Federal Reserve and free market "theories". The book is worth a read, but is very hard to put down.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book, because it brings you back to my childhood. I grew up in the 1980s and remember my dad driving me and my siblings to school everyday from the suburbs. My mom still drives us to school today, so this book gives us a glimpse back into what it was like to drive in the city. I've always wanted to read a book about the city of Milwaukee.  This book shows the whole city in an interesting way.  The city of Wisconsin, the suburbs, and the Milwaukee Zoo are some of my favorite places to visit, so it was great to get a peek at all of it.  This book is worth every dollar.   I love the fact that it doesn't just touch on the life in the suburbs anymore.  I think this book is even better than a documentary.  A documentary would have made the city seem a little bigger, but this book makes it feel like a smaller city, but bigger on the inside.

Write a positive review about a good book: *********This is an excellent book. It's an amazing look into the workings of the brain, the mind, the heart, and the body at its most basic level. The subject matter of the book, of course, are things which many people will relate to, such as their childhood, the pain they were through, the death of a loved one, or the feeling of hopelessness about being a parent. The author is very well read, and she doesn't skimp on the science or the science and psychology, but she does include a great deal of personal stories. The authors notes, for instance, that "The best part about this book, as with all books I have read on this subject, was the author's experience as she was diagnosed with severe anxiety disorder, severe mood disorder, and severe eating disorder."I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever been ill with a chronic illness. This book is the most informative on this topic I've ever read, period, and it's filled with personal stories about what it's like to live with that condition. If you are a mother or father who is struggling with chronic illness, or someone who just has a chronic disease or chronic health condition, this book is an absolute must read.The book starts off with some background of the author (she's a doctor herself) and her upbringing. She was diagnosed in college with an anxiety disorder after being hit by a car. She tells about her initial diagnosis and the medications she was on, the psychological counseling she was given, and even the times that she had to go to the emergency room because of her condition. From there, the book tells about the effects of the medications, the medication side effects, how to manage the side effects of medication, how she was able to eventually manage the anxiety, and how she ultimately got her life back on track. In fact, she managed to make it back to college with the help of the medication and with the support of her parents. From here, the author dives in to what is happening in the brain with an examination of the hippocampus, and some studies of the effects on memory. In this section, the brain is examined in detail, including the hippocampus and other parts of the frontal lobe. In another section, she details the way that the brain processes emotion. In one section, her personal experience with her mental illness is discussed, the feelings she's dealt with, and her thoughts on how to best manage and cope with it. The

Write a positive review about a good book:   You are correct in that there are many, many things wrong with this book. I was looking forward to reading a new book that was good, but this one is just plain poor! I was hoping that it would teach me something, but there is so much wrong with it that I really can't recommend it.   I found this book to be lacking in research. As for what is wrong with the book, the first thing is that it was very difficult for me to get the basic concepts of mathematics into it. Math should be an easy subject for all to understand and comprehend. Not only is it not, but the author does not even try to cover the basics. She relies on a lot of other people's math to do her part, which is not only wrong, but really shows that she is not very good at math herself.   the second thing is the way she explains things. She seems to be using the book as a way to give a lecture. She does this on several pages and this is the same type of thing that is common with other math teachers. Her math is so simple that I found it impossible to understand what she was saying. If there is one thing that the book has done well, it is in its presentation, but I will continue to keep reading other books to see what she teaches. I feel that I would not have gotten as far as I did without her help!   There are other things about this book that are bad, but you will have to read it to see. I find that it is too short to read, and I feel as though it is better to buy a hard copy and then just read it from start to finish.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was reading this book because I was on my honeymoon and I had not read anything about my ancestors.   Well, I really enjoyed it. I'm a history major and it was easy to get into. I had a lot of fun reading the details about my great grandparents.  -My great grandmother was one of only three women in my family to go to college, but didn't do so to earn money. I believe she was a professor in the military.  -My grandmother's name is Rose Etta Foy, my great grandmother's maiden name is Foy. She was from St. Louis, Missouri.  of the many fun facts about my family, I remember the reason she gave for her choice to go for higher education. , My great grandmother chose to go from Missouri to St. Paul, Minnesota to teach in a high school. I knew about it, but I was also interested to see my great aunts and uncles in Minnesota. The other great thing I learned is about my aunts - the stories were interesting.   and my uncles - the memories they shared were so entertaining. I'll be glad to read more about them in a future book   the last bit of trivia that I learned: my unmother's sister passed away recently (she was 96). My great uncle lived until he was 92. They lived on an island in Lake Michigan, and were in the navy for many years. They were part of a large family in Minnesota and Michigan. The people from St Paul came to visit them many times and they stayed in good health (I heard their sons had excellent health and were never sick). My Uncle Peter was an avid fisherman. My Grandmother Rose was also very active in charity work, helping out the needy in other towns. She and my Aunt Martha took me on many trips around the country, all around the lake and lake regions. Grandpa Fred and my Great Grandmother worked in the shipyards, they were part time shipyard workers. Grandma Rose was a very active member in our Lutheran church (she sang for the choir and I believe was also on the church committee). My Grandfather John (my Grandmother's brother) was a railroad manager. My father worked in a mill as a tool and die maker for over 50 years. He was an old hand and I was very interested to hear the stories he shared. I also found it very interesting to learn about his wife, Mary Ellen

Write a positive review about a good book: ********** When I first started reading about the history of the C.S. Lewis fan club back in the 1990s, I was under the impression that the club had simply been an organization of fans of C. S. Lewis who wanted to support him and other writers by attending readings and book signings and taking them out to dinner and movies. A little googling told me that, in reality, the CSPL (The C.U.S Club) was actually a Christian publishing company that specialized in publishing Christian books (as a part of their business they had other books to offer as well such as Christian comic books and art books) and that their activities involved attending book signings, taking out the author on trips, providing book recommendations, and giving C. Lewis reading materials. There was even a C. U.S newsletter, the Christian Publishing News, which was published from 1985 to 2000. The newsletter, like the club, was small and informal, and did not have a large following. I remember reading a few issues of the newsletter and getting the feeling that they were a very conservative Christian group, and while I was not in a place to criticize the way they did things, it did feel somewhat disconcerting to be associated with something like that. A new book on the CSA (the Catholic Church) In the early 1990s when I first read about the CFA ( Catholic Family & Children's Aid Society)  I was very excited about finding out more about their activities and activities for the less fortunate. I was also quite curious about how their activities differed from those of the Catholic Church. I finally found the answer by following this link: I found this very interesting, and decided to read on to see how these two groups were comparable. The CFA has an annual event, the  St. Patrick's Day Ball which it hosts each year. The balls are held in cities around the country, and are an opportunity to socialize with people and have a great time at the ball. They have a list of guest speakers who include politicians and celebrities, and they also have many concerts which are attended by many people. In contrast, the Catholic CFA does not have an annual St.Patrick's Day event. The main St. Paddy's Day events are held at a church in San Antonio, TX and they are not as well attended as the C FA events. The parish church is called the St. John's church. Another website on

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. I do like the type of horror stories in this book, and the character of the girl. Her story was great and the ending was really good, too.   The writing was not as good as I had hoped for, but that is due to the subject matter. I was looking for something like the 'The Haunting' by Anne Rice, and this story didn't quite have that feeling, but I am sure the author is working on that. I guess we shall see what he comes up with next time.  , September 29, 2009

Write a positive review about a good book: ---------------I read this book during my high school years as a sort of a summer reading, though I never really got around to it until recently. I wasn't disappointed. While the subject matter is of a very dark nature, it still had a very human element. And for a teenager, it was really quite a good read. The main character is a troubled boy who has an insatiable passion for the forbidden, and his relationship with the girl who helps him with that is really heart wrenching. The book really explores some really interesting aspects of the mind and brain. I was very drawn into the world of this book, and was intrigued by the many twists and turns in this book. I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. It is not perfect, but definitely worth reading.
Write a positive review about a good book: ÂI enjoyed this book! The story is well told and the author did a great job with the dialogue and pacing. The only negative thing I had was that the characters seemed so generic. It really didn't fit with what was going on.Â But this is only because I am very nit-picky. If you want something interesting to read, you may want to go elsewhere.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________This book is a wonderful compilation of the best of my own writing.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________ The last three chapters of The Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future are a little difficult to read for me. Not because the writing is bad. Quite the contrary. The writing is good and the writing style is easy. It just isn't the right format for me to get my point across. I tried a few different approaches, including: the following: -I used the format of a review of a work in progress. I wrote a summary of each chapter and followed the formatting of the work in a work-in-progress. -I created a list of what I thought were the strengths of each book and went through each chapter. -For some reason I thought writing this review would be easy because I knew the structure was right, I just didn't feel like getting to the end. -Instead of reading the next chapter I decided to just try to figure out what was missing in the book. -After going through some sections I noticed that the style was almost identical to another work I'm reading now. -At this point I think I'll read The Future of Work again as I'm a bit tired of the author's style. Summary:............................................................... The robot revolution will be the biggest change in technology since the advent of computers. As machines become ever more autonomous and autonomous systems become increasingly complex, new ethical questions arise. Will machines be able to be conscious or will the idea of machine consciousness disappear? Can we trust machines, and will they ever learn? Is it fair to ask machines to be our equals? Are we going to end up in a situation where humans are a distant second to machines? All of these questions will be discussed.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________________  The author describes himself as a "psychiatrist" but the writing is pretty superficial. He's got a history of making false diagnoses which make it difficult to believe he is a good medical person. He makes lots of diagnoses. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody who wants to be diagnosed. The book has some good information and the writing style is a little bit like a textbook.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I found the book very interesting, interesting in a good way. The descriptions of the history of the Middle East have made me more interested in how the world went from a time when there were kings to the time where there is peace, where there are no kings. In fact I feel like the history is very similar to the current world, except for the time when the kings were ruling, this is why I love history. The author describes the history very well, in a very interesting way and it makes you think about how history works. I think if you are interested in history or politics you should read this book.   In my opinion it is the best book I have ever read about the history.
Write a positive review about a good book: ~~~I don't remember how I came across this book, but it is definitely one of my all time favorites ~~  Read 5 stars  I'm a pretty newbie reader of romance and this book is perfect for someone who hasn't read a romance for a long time. The first time I read this book I was totally sucked in, so much so that I had to go buy another copy because I didn't want to leave.   It takes a few days for the story to really pick up, but you can tell from the first chapter that you are in for a very different type of story than the usual. It definitely feels like a modern day fairy tale, but with a twist. The way the romance plays out is very exciting.  , the main character, goes on a date with a girl named Maddy and she is absolutely perfect. After they spend some time together you really feel how they love each other and that it can't be possible they are not going to be together. Then in the very beginning of the story the relationship begins to crumble when Maddy decides she will go to England with a boy she is seeing, this girl is completely different from Maddy. She comes from a totally different culture and it just is not the same as Maddy's. It also seems that this girl may not be into Maddy as much as she is Maddy, and that can't all be just in her head.   I love that the story has so many different elements to it, the different cultures, and the romance.   the writing in this book isn't very good, not bad, just not really great. I have some issues with the way Maddy is written. I'm not going into details, I'm a total nitpicker so let me just say that I don't like her as a person, so the way that she's written feels off to me.   "She was like this from the beginning, just like the way she was with my dad, like a girl who just wasn't all that into me."   "And he felt the same about her. He saw her the way he saw his dad."   it just doesn't make sense to me, it just sounds so like it's Maddy thinking and not him. It's also a little confusing, why did Maddy decide to go to Europe in the first place? She already has a boyfriend who is back home in New England, and she was already
Write a positive review about a good book:!!!This book is absolutely fantastic!! I would have never thought that a book about the early Church would be this good. The author did an amazing job of presenting the history of the Church and how God worked to bring it about in this life. If you want to see a lot more about the Church, and not just one story, I would not read a book that has nothing to do with the Church. I also highly recommend this book to people in the general Church. If any of you are interested in the Early Church and want to know more about how God is working in your life to bring about the Restoration of Christ's Church, I highly recommend reading this book."  "This is a fabulous book. I have just finished reading it. I must say that it is a very informative book. It is a pleasure to read a great book on the Church's origins. Thank you again. It will come in handy as I continue studying."  (May 9, 2010)  See all five stars  Read an Excerpt  Click here to download an electronic copy of this volume (5 MB)

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- My husband was looking for this book when I was having an attack of writer's block and the author said, "Well, I know some of you have been doing it, but I would like to try it with you". We sat down and I gave the book a good read and I was completely and utterly blown away by the way the author wrote. I really want to be a writer like he is and have my book sold in bookstores around the world. I also think he should write more books for younger teens. I could not put it down. Great book, I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------I really enjoyed reading this book, as many of the characters seemed to be well drawn. As with most of the books I have read in the 'dark' fantasy genre, this is a pretty grim story, but I enjoyed the way it was written.I really wanted to see the two siblings meet, but that was very disappointing. It seems that the author has forgotten about the main characters in this book!The author gives the reader a great deal of background information about the characters, which was a good thing! Some of the details I found most interesting about each character was how the author had tried to explain to me why a certain character would behave a certain way! Some explanations really made sense.The ending was very good and I really enjoyed it. The ending gave closure to this story, as there was a big conflict about some characters I was wondering about, and the author seemed to answer some of these mysteries. All in all I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I liked this book. The characters are all very well written, and the book was good. It was funny at times, but sometimes it was just plain silly. I couldnt believe that the two girls who went out to get a drink at a bar at night would get the same guy to pick them up. Also, the first time I read the book I thought that this was the first real "mature" book I would read. The fact that the protagonist is a 14 year old kid I could see as a problem. The first few chapters were quite short, which seemed to indicate that the author was going to make the book longer. Unfortunately I did not read this part of the book, and I am still waiting for the rest. In conclusion, this was a good novel that was good for me.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "Hands down one of the best books I have ever read!" "HOLY COW" By Mollie Williams (2013) "The writing, the style, the theme and all the other aspects of the book are so well done and so incredibly unique, that it just has to be read! I've had this book on my shelf for over 5 years and just can't get over the awesome story and the characters. There's really nothing like it out there!" This book was recommended to me by a friend who is an avid reader of science fiction and fantasy.  It's a book about a little boy who discovers the world beyond the forest.  The story takes place in a world where people were born with their own special abilities, but in order to learn how to use those abilities, they're taken away from their family homes to be trained by an academy that has some special abilities of their own.  And so the story of the boy who was taken away and the boy with special abilities begins to intertwine.  There are many characters to meet, each one with their special abilities.  They are each quite interesting to read about and have their own unique stories to tell.  Although the book does get a bit repetitive at times, the characters and their story remain so compelling, that this book remains on my bookshelf to this day. This is a story about the little boy and his little sister that are brought away from his home and school.  At first the boy does not know why he is being brought away, however, the boy's sister begins to reveal secrets and a world she knows nothing about, that only she and her brother know about.  Once the boy and the sister begin to discover what each of them truly is capable of, they begin to question why they are even being separated and what they are being trained for. My favourite part of this book is that there is never any filler scenes, and the story is simply told to the best of its ability.  This book is not a happy book, it's not a story full of good cheer, it is a very serious book that doesn't take itself too seriously, but it also is very entertaining and full of characters that will make you care about them.  While the book is pretty long, I think it's a great read for young adult fans and adults alike.  I've also read several reviews of this story that say that this story is very "

Write a positive review about a good book:  In this wonderful book by Robert C. Farr, there are the basics of human development, how to make one's own choices and choices that lead to happiness, how you can choose to get what you want and to find happiness and how you make that choice to get it. And I found it very interesting how he made these choices, because most of us never make any choice at all that leads to happiness.  But sometimes, it's better to be selfish, to not care about what others think about us and to live a life where the most important things that we do is that we live for ourselves and that we work for happiness. That's why I love this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've bought this book many times and I still like it. Its not only a good story about what it's like to be a child, it's also an interesting look into the life of a boy growing up and dealing with his father's death. The characters are likeable and it's an excellent look into life growing up, so if you can handle the sad and tragic part, this one's great.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________ When I first read that one it made my heart flutter, I didn't think I could ever have any idea of what it's like to be a girl who is in love with a guy who is an actual monster! I felt very lucky, for being the only one who would be able to know. However, it wasn't until I read more of it that I got to know her, her struggle with it, her fears and what she feels like when she is around him, her reactions to him, the things that get her to break down, her reaction to the things he does to her, and what her reactions are to things she doesn't do but is forced to. It makes you feel like the monster, she is the one who is trapped, but that's just how it goes. The description of what he does when he isn't around her is enough to make you feel very confused and scared, that she feels so little of him. She tries to fight it but to no avail. In the end you realize that you are a monster too, and you have to learn to be one as well. I thought it was very interesting and I enjoyed it.

It's not a supernatural book at all, it's about a beautiful girl, who had to fight with the family she loved because she was sick all the time. She didn't want to go to school or anything, and she did not want to let anyone know. She started going to church because her family were very strict on not letting her leave the house without permission. She was sick enough and was being bullied by the school bullies that she had to be home all the day. It was horrible but the book made you feel so bad for her. It made you cry and it made you wonder why she didn't stop and leave her home. And then she does, she leaves the house, and it's beautiful, she's finally free and she's never going back, and then she starts having problems.  a lot of people have said that there is so much dark, scary stuff in this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  " The most amazing part of this book is the author's experience in dealing with the challenges of living as a transgender person. She writes about her experiences with a great deal of compassion and sensitivity. I can't recommend it enough. I'd recommend it for anyone dealing with a similar situation." —Karen G. The following review was written at the time of the book's release, and it is my current thoughts and feelings about it. I bought this book during the second edition. I have since sold it. I don't think I'd buy it again (or at all). The book covers transgender issues (the most salient ones I've ever encountered) very well. It doesn't go into specifics as far as hormones, surgery, etc, but it doesn't have to. There are a number of very good, well-researched books out there about this, and this book covers just about every aspect of this. I would have liked more depth and detail about how things have changed in terms of legal rights and legal protections in a lot of states over the last 20 or so years. The book does go into more of the personal life side of it (which I enjoyed), but it wasn't much of a depth or a detailed story. But overall: it's a good little book with some nice pictures of the subjects. I think it would be a nice conversation starter to have a trans friend to read this and discuss it with. I do think it's important for people to read it, though. The personal story side of things can be fun and fascinating, but for me personally, the more comprehensive look at transgender issues is where I'd read it.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________ My family and I recently spent an afternoon with David Foster Wallace, at his house. I'd been a fan of his since I was a kid, and his work had played a role in shaping me as an adult and writer as well as my own identity. But it wasn't until I read a copy of his last book, The Pale King, that I really saw how deeply he was involved in every aspect of his work--from the writing, to the interviews, to publishing the book. He really seems like a very good person. And now, in the intervening years, he's become a really good friend, as well. I really wanted to meet him, because I love that he had been a close friend of mine for so many years and had a special place in my heart. So when he invited me to his house to meet up with a few of his friends, I jumped at the opportunity. I think a lot of people, myself included, felt the same way when David said he wanted to come out and visit with his friends. It was just an amazing experience. I'm sure it will be for a long time. In any case, his visit was great. David was a lot nicer than I expected. We met on a Thursday night around 7:30 p.m., and we all went to dinner that night--I think it was at another restaurant. It wasn't the usual type of dinner you see in DFW circles, and that was a good thing, because it meant we had a lot to talk about. I spent a lot more time with David than I anticipated, and I think we all had more fun than we expected. One thing that's interesting about the dinner was that it was a very intimate one. I have to say that I think there's something a bit embarrassing about being out with friends in D.C., but I also think it's very, very refreshing. The people I met on that night were nice and nice and friendly. I don't know if there was a single person on the guest list who I wasn't comfortable with, but that's just my opinion. I was particularly happy that David's longtime assistant, John Nolen, was there. John is an incredible writer, but a great guy, and David really trusted him. John has done an excellent job for years helping to write some of the essays that form the bulk of the book, and he's always been a very kind and gentle person. So we

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- -------------------------- I was in a book store recently and while browsing I came across a book by Dr. John Ehrlichman which has a very interesting history. This man was the Deputy Chief of Staff to the President and he was instrumental in getting the "war on drugs" started. Dr. Ehrnichman is quoted saying that the Nixon campaign was not interested in legalizing drugs, rather they wanted to scare the voters and get votes for Nixon. However, he admitted that Nixon did support legalizing drugs once in office. He went on to say that Nixon only supported it until he became aware of the "campaign against it". Dr. Nixon was in favor of legalization and had been in favor since his days in San Francisco, but that didn't matter in the end. He had his "enemies list", which was the list of people he thought might possibly have an effect on his reelection. After he was elected he wanted to have his list ready so that if they got in to trouble it could be used as a defense. I like reading about this era because it was an interesting time. ----------------------------- --------------------------- Read the book: http://www.amazon.com/Dr-John-Ehrlichmann-The-Real-H...   Loved this book!   -Kathleen  Great book! ------------------------  I read this book in 1974 after completing "The Last Psychiatrist" in which Dr. James D. Watson is interviewed by his friend, Dr. Gilbert Merrill. Drs. Watson and Merrill knew each other for decades; they were former professors and friends in medical school. Their friendship continued in college and they became good friends once again. Dr Watson was at the peak of his powers, with the possibility of Nobel Prize. He wrote a popular and successful book, "The Double Helix" and he also published a highly successful book for the general public, "A New Kind of Science" (about bacteria). All of these things, along with his great scientific abilities made Dr. Watson a world-renowned authority on his field. Now his health was failing and he would soon succumb to a very serious health condition. He told Dr. Merrill that he had just had a very strange experience while he was driving. He was driving on a dark road and when he was stopped by a policeman he saw an image of a man's face peering at him through a window. This scared him a little but he was able

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book had a lot of potential, however, it ended up falling short of my expectations. If I had been more patient in my reading of it, it would have been a good read, but due to the fact it was so rushed, and the short amount of pages per chapter, I was not able to fully appreciate all of the characters that were included in the story. I could only see them for so long before it ended and I could not believe how much of the story they had. This is not a bad book, however. There is a lot to enjoy here, and if you read it, you will be able to relate to some of the events that happened to the characters, and some of them have some great moments. 3.5/5 Overall, I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to people who like paranormal/paranormal/mythical/fantasy/supernatural/sci-fi/etc. This book was enjoyable and enjoyable. I would definitely recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I am currently working on my PhD and was looking for a book that would guide me in the process. The following is a summary of the book as it is now. I found that it is very easy to follow and it covers a lot of useful information and is very informative.   It is written in the form of a "personal narrative" which is very helpful in guiding you through the content.  It covers a wide variety of topics including economics, philosophy, business, psychology, and social history.  I have read two of the three chapters and feel that the content is very useful and educational.  Overall I would recommend this book to those who are looking to have an idea of the nature of "reality" and how it interacts with our understanding of "the self".  Review by Michael D on Jan, 24, 2014 :  Excellent book for students. It's a very interesting read and covers an interesting area of philosophy. The author does a good job of outlining some of the assumptions involved in an "is-ought" approach to thinking. The last chapter has some interesting concepts like the need for closure and the need to ask questions about our assumptions. The overall book is written as a personal narrative and is well put together.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________________ It's a bit confusing for me, since I read this in 2012, and it seems that the books are in somewhat different editions in 2017. The one that I have is in a paperback and has a different cover than the one in the bookstore. There are a couple of sections with photos, which I'm sure are the same, but I'm not sure which ones. If anyone has more info, I'd love to know which edition it is, and I'll link it here.

Write a positive review about a good book: *************************   I was looking for something new and different, and I got exactly what I wanted. I was impressed by the amount of information contained in the book and how easy it is to use. I like the format of the book, which is divided into sections such as "What To Do On Your First Day At Work", "First Day On The Job", and "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly" - so I can use this book for reference as I get ready for each new task I come across.   This is the best book I've ever read, and it was well worth the time I put into it. I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book:     I found this book extremely useful in understanding the fundamentals of the game. I am an old, seasoned, and successful player of the computer and console games of this genre, and I found this very helpful to read.   The author is very thorough, but not at all preachy.   the book is an excellent resource for all aspiring programmers who have a basic grasp of programming, and would like to expand on their knowledge to better develop their skills as programmers.  - - - - I foundthis book extremely helpful in understandingthe fundamentals of. I'm an old,, and Ifound this very useful to read.- - -  Review of DJGrammer's How To Become A Better Programmer by John Grady Grady's How to become a Better Programmederepamming is a well-researched and thorough book, well written. His approach to learning programming is not exactly rocket science (or even computer science, which he doesn't use much), but it's certainly easy to follow, and the author provides excellent examples of how to take what he says and implement it yourself.  .  The book is very easy to learn and follow. One of the things I like about his approach to programming is that he takes a step back and thinks about what his goals are for learning the language and how he can achieve them. For instance, when I first read his book, I thought the only thing I really needed to be able to do was to know how to do the first line of a C program and how to compile it, and it only took a few pages to realize that, really, I didn't really want to know any of those things (I was trying to get better at programming, after all).   One of the main parts of the book that I like the most is that Grady shows you how to test and debug your code in the same way that he would in a real environment, and he does a great job of helping you get a handle on the issues. You could write the code yourself, but you can't do it if the test code you write doesn't work.     I have been programming since the early 90s, and this is one of the only books I've ever read on the subject that I've found more useful in terms of helping me achieve my goals as a programmer. If you haven't gotten started, or are just starting to learn how to program, I highly recommend

Write a positive review about a good book:  "This book was one of the most fascinating and enlightening books I have read in some time. The author, David Hackett Fischer, makes it clear that the concept of an alien visitation from another planet is much more complicated than we think and that it is still being investigated.  For example, I was impressed that the author does a good job at presenting the scientific aspects of the case from various perspectives.  He explains this in great detail and is very well informed about the historical context of these events. He also describes what the various scientific organizations are studying.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in UFOs and the recent past." (From the Book Review)

Write a positive review about a good book:  When I started The Story of My Boyfriend's Penis, I was very skeptical. I thought it was an incredibly boring and tedious book. What a crock! But, the more I read, the better it got. It's great in parts, and the characters are well-drawn and the plot is well-crafted. My only criticism would be that sometimes the dialogue feels a little wordy and I wish they would have gotten some of the words out a little faster. Overall, it's a really good book. I read this while I was eating lunch and thought it might be a nice way to pass the time while eating. I'm not sure I like it, but it's worth reading. If you're looking for something to read to pass time, I'd definitely recommend The Story Of My Boyfriends Penis. If you find yourself in the mood for something more intellectual, I think this book would be pretty nice.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this one and think this is the best book on the subject I've read. I have read the first two and liked them too, but this one is just so far above and beyond and shows that even the smartest people are human. - Laura C.  My new favorite book by a scientist. Very informative. - Mark W.  it is an excellent overview of brain science. very informative. but, i don't like to get all technical on one page - Jennifer L.  and to the reviewer that gave an above average rating, the book is well written and very informative - jill A.  the book does make a great intro to the subject and can be a wonderful self-study. but i'm not a scientist - i'm just a brain - and it was a little confusing to understand the process of thinking and remembering in the book. - mike  The most excellent book I have ever read. It is about brain biology, brain function, and brain disorders, and how the brain works in relation to the rest of the human body. - M.

Write a positive review about a good book: ***************** It's the first time I have heard of this series. I'm a fan of the older stuff, and love the world created by Tolkien, but I've never read a good fantasy set in Middle Earth before. I love the fact that this series has gone from one book to the next so quickly. The new characters are fun to read about, but at the same time I keep finding myself wanting to see where the old characters are in the story. I highly recommend this series to Tolkien fans and lovers of Fantasy. It's an amazing series!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have a huge collection of books (over 100 books), and there is no way I could possibly keep all of them. So for my needs I bought an "Ebay copy" of this book, in addition to a book review copy. I loved the book! I have read many of the previous "My Immortal" books and have no idea what they are all about, but I enjoy the characters. I'm not sure I would want to read the other "My Eternals" books.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I did read a lot of books in my youth and I had some problems with them - mostly the "I don't like this part" type thing. Well, this book changed my whole opinion of what kind of stories one can tell with fiction. I would say this book can be divided in different parts - it's about how a child thinks and how a parent sees it. But at the end, it all comes together and it made me like this character - it really made me to like the main character so much - especially the way he talks about his past. A really interesting story and if you like books where characters go to a certain place, you can't miss this one.
Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________ This is a very good book. It really does present the history of the Irish. It goes into very much detail about the rise of Christianity in Ireland and the ways it impacted on the Irish people. The book does a great job at providing insight and history about the people and their culture. It is the first time I have read an Irish history book that had the depth and breadth of information I was looking for. I feel like the author did a great service for the American public. Thanks!
Write a positive review about a good book: _____________  The story of a woman who has been taken in by a priest and who later finds the same priest doing other terrible things and being an abusive father. I loved the way this story was told and the way the priest has no remorse for what he has done. I also loved how she had to make decisions about what she was going to tell the priest to avoid his going to prison or her being found out and put out of the family. The ending of the story was really strong and I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good horror/romance book.  Would I Recommend This Book To My Friends?: YES  If you are interested in reading horror books that are dark and sexy but are still well written I would definitely read this book. I would totally recommend this book to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "This is a wonderful book. The world building is fantastic. The characters are deep. The descriptions are beautiful. The main story is an interesting take on magic and science, and the secondary plot is also quite interesting. It is the combination of the two that makes it such an engaging read." (review from booklist.com)   ---   I think one of the reasons why this book is so interesting is that it is so different. The other books I have read about these topics have often been a bit cookie cutter with the plots and ideas.   This book is different because the main character, Gedde, is a "ghost" in the book who is in fact an elf. We don't know exactly why the elf is in a different world, or what his story is, but his main plot is to find out how a human's body dies. I have a feeling that it will be revealed that his "life" was a rather tragic one. Gedder and Gwen (who was also in the main plot) are the two main female characters in this story.   This is the first book I have ever read by the author who was published only a couple of years ago (2011). The story follows Geddi's journey from his birth in a magical place to the very end of his life. The novel is narrated in a very simple and natural style that helps to capture the reader's attention. The author has a knack for creating believable characters that you like to meet more and more throughout the story. The book does an excellent job of capturing the emotion and the mystery of the book.   a book review:
Write a positive review about a good book: ******** The most unique, enjoyable, surprising, and thought-provoking book I've ever read. An incredibly cleverly written novel that is packed full of great twists and surprises! ***** By The Time It Happens to You - The Last of the Old Man's War This book is definitely unique. It is certainly an intriguing mix of fantasy, science fiction and romance that I have never read before. One thing I liked about this book was that it has some real heart. This is certainly not a book for the faint of heart or faint of wallet. The action scenes are bloody, horrific and some of the descriptions of the violence are truly horrific. I did really enjoy this book and it had a lot of great surprises.   The only thing I can say about the writing style of this book is that some of it is a little wordy. I know I can't fault the author here, it just could have been a bit better. The main character is interesting, but her journey wasn't one I found interesting or compelling. I am sure the writing could have improved the story and characters more, but I didn't find this a major problem. I could see how someone could find this story interesting, or possibly even a little creepy. It certainly wasn't as much for me as it could have.   The ending was also a little ambiguous. I loved the way the author ended this book, and if you are a fan of fantasy this is definitely for you. Overall this is a great book, but definitely one that you should not expect to see at your local book store. It can be found on Amazon here:  http://www.amazon.com/The-Time-It-Happens-to-You-War-Marine/dp/0764122409/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1472279857&sr=1-1&keywords=thomas+klein   A quick read, but it left me wanting more. Recommended for fans of this genre, fans of the military, and fans of good writing.   was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good book: ******** * The "Fifty Shades of Grey" is a book by E.L. James that is in fact a story about a marriage to which I am not married.  I was excited at first to read this book as I was looking forward to reading about my first marriage with a man I love.   After reading the book I was confused because it didn't seem to have anything to do with my current marriage.   After the book ended I was left wondering what all the fuss was about.  There was a lot of controversy in the press when the book came out that had to do the book a lot more harm than good.  There were articles about the abuse James caused in his past marriages.  People who were abused or in a previous relationship with James expressed that they never got to know their abuser.  The book is all about love and marriage and the abuse he caused in their past relationships.  This was just the opposite of what I was hoping to find.    If you are looking for the most graphic, sexual, and painful portrayal of a marriage you can get from a woman and a man in the twenty first century, then look no further.  If you are a woman who is looking for a marriage with the man she wants to spend the rest of her life with, then you won't be disappointed.  For me it was a disappointment that really took away from the book.
Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________________________________________ I loved this book. It was so great that I wrote my own chapter on how the character and the story could be developed. I liked the ideas of the story. I like the characters. I could see them as adults. I did not like the ending, although the last few sentences were really moving. It could be a good read if you're into mystery or a mystery novel. It's a short book so it's great if you have only 1 or 2 hours to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "My favourite part of this book was the idea that your brain does not just operate on a single, fixed frequency. It changes as your brain develops. The brain is constantly adapting to new information, making new connections between the parts. This is especially true in the younger brain, which may be getting the best of the old brain and adapting to the new brain that is growing up. This book has a lot of examples of how the brain reacts to stress, how it learns, how we can teach and practice different ways of thinking, and how to keep the mind happy and on the alert, instead of having to be completely shut down to get by."   - Anonymous
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________  The "New" book  by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson  If you like the series by Robert Jordan, and the later novels by Brandon Sander, this book is an absolute MUST read!  This is NOT a re-read, but a new perspective on the story. Brandon has given this book the same treatment he did with the earlier books in the series. I am excited to read this and I look forward to re-reading all of the previous books as well.
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I really enjoyed this book. I've seen the movie (and the book) before but I never watched it and had never read the book. The book is really quite good and I have been meaning to read it for a while. The characters are well drawn and the story is not too long or drawn out. The ending is a bit too abrupt for my tastes but it was interesting and well told. I loved the art in the book and I loved how it was told. Overall, the book is a great way to end off a series. This is a perfect book to finish off the series because it ends it in such a satisfying way. The sequel, The Long Winter, is great and has a similar conclusion, as well. I would recommend this book if you haven't read the previous books in the series.
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- It is the best book i ever read. It tells a story that i can relate to and that i have felt and felt. There are parts i found a little hard to follow, but they made sense to me and it was well explained. If i was to add anything it would be that i would have liked a bit more of the background and history. I don't think there is enough to make the story stand on it's own. It would be an interesting read if it had more depth. Overall i would recommend it. I enjoyed it and it is well worth the read!
Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________________ A very interesting look into a new world to me. It's a bit like looking at the world with a new perspective, with an interesting new perspective. It gave me new perspective and I think the story can be appreciated by people who have been living in this world for a while and may even have the same beliefs as me but may be a bit new to this new place. It really gave me a good understanding on what this place is about and what is it like. I really hope people are able to look at the book a different way than I did. The book also reminded me of the stories of the old world and the new world as a whole.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had read several reviews of this book and wanted to read it because I had always wondered what was going on with the people in the hospital. I wanted to find out, but I was too scared. But I read this book very carefully. I did not want to read another book that could not be trusted. This is a very informative book about how this book was written and I highly recommend it to any readers. Thank you for putting this book together and keeping it out there in the public's eye. I can't recommend this book highly enough! The author gives us many details about this incident. He gives the reader an explanation of why the nurse was fired, what happened that day, and the changes that have been made to the hospital to protect staff from similar circumstances in the future. I thought I would never be able to understand why it had happened, because I really did not know why my daughter was there. And now I do.

I know I would have enjoyed this book a lot more if it had been a lot longer, but it was still a good read. I definitely felt as though I could relate to the characters.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book for the first time about 10 years ago and I loved it at the time and I'm glad that I bought it again and bought it for a special occasion. I'm always searching for stories about girls that like to dress up in costumes and I'd found them in other books, but this one felt special to me. The author was wonderful and the heroine of the story was very realistic and interesting. I also liked that there were some dark sides to the princess. It seemed like the author knew that she'd become a princess and she knew that it would mean a lot of responsibility to her as a woman, but I didn't feel that she was overly protective of the girls at first, but she is over the years and she finds out more about them and learns more about herself. I liked that she wasn't very old, although I understand that in that situation she'd be more like an older sister than a princess. I would recommend this book to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good book: **********   This book is a good introduction to the concepts of computer programming. It covers a lot of the basics and it doesn't just teach you how to write programs. The book has exercises at the end of the book, so if you get stuck or need to refresh, you can always go back to the book and pick up where you left off. I would say the book is on the shorter side but it still covers the concepts.   There were a few times I thought that I did some steps and then just forgot them. But the examples and exercises were clear and it was easy to follow along the path.   (Also it would be great if the book gave examples for everything.)

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first of a series of books I'll read. This one is good, a bit more fantasy than fantasy of the original series (in fact, the first book is more of a science-fiction novel than a fantasy novel) and the characters are the strongest ones I've read about. My only problem with it is I really wanted more of the author's personality. As you read it you find that you like the narrator, that she's an interesting person and really brings out the best in the characters.  I'd like her to expand in the second book a bit.   Helpful to know when you want a story and don't know which one to pick:  I have some experience with writing short stories, so I knew I wanted something light and amusing, but also have something happening that's not just a set up for a good character or for a plot twist.  This book definitely met that need. I didn't feel bored reading it. I'm an aspiring novelist, so hopefully this book can inspire you.

She is a "wink" to me, because when she says "My little bear's so old", I see that little bear as her own little bear. This book is a great introduction to the world of "Hercules" and this book really brought the story to life for me, even if it is a bit over the top and a bit "sci-fi".

Write a positive review about a good book:  When I first started reading this book, I was put off by some of the things that were happening to this couple, both of them, and some of them weren't really the main point of the story. I have to admit that the main focus for the book was the relationship between these two, but that was the only thing that really interested me about it. If you are looking for a good romantic drama, this isn't it. However, if you are more interested in the psychological side of this couple (the way that they view each other and how they deal with it), you should still find this book very interesting. This is more of a story about the way that one person views another, which is interesting if you think about it, and how that view affects the relationship and life of the other person. Also, the fact that this couple had a daughter who was a young adult, is very interesting and touching. A definite good read, a must read.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________ I can't wait to read this book. My dad got it for me to read last year and I really enjoyed it. I really liked it because it was not boring or preachy and it showed some good advice. And it made you think about your life in an intelligent way and didn't get in your way. Now this one is on the bookshelf. Thank you for writing it.
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------This book is very interesting.The premise is interesting,and it gives you some idea of the world of the dwarves.It takes place in the early to mid 1400s,and a young dwarf named Kaleval is about to have his baby.He discovers that his wife is pregnant,and the king of the dwarven country of Skardyn orders Kalevall to give the baby to him.Kaleval gives his child to the king,and his baby is born a dwarf,just like his father.They are both told that they will have to leave the country to live as commoners for the next 200 years,but Kalevar decides to stay and be king of his people.I really liked this book,the stories and the characters were interesting.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves dwarves or medieval history. The book is not perfect,it is very long,and some parts of it are confusing,but the book is good.
Write a positive review about a good book:............................................................  I can't believe how good this book is. I was really skeptical to read a new YA mystery, but this book turned out really well. I don't know if this book would work for people who don't like mysteries, but for me, it was a lot of fun. I read it and finished it the very same day.   If I was to read this book again, I would do it in a different time period. I would have read it years ago and enjoyed it, but not read it in this year and time. The book takes place in an alternate timeline with the characters who were in the books before the story begins. In this time period, the characters were younger, but they still have their personalities, and it would still be a good read. I wouldn't suggest reading it at 10 years of age though, because if you can't take a little bit of mystery, then this isn't for you.   the premise of this book was really great. The author really went out of her way to create the mystery and suspense in this book. It wasn't all "I know she did it and it was totally the worst thing ever, but she still did it" which is what I would expect in a novel with a plot, but that's what she did in the book. She went out on a limb with the book, and did a really good job of creating a mystery and then using it to create suspense. I really don't think I can ever say no to a great mystery or suspense novel. I have read quite a few books over the years that I have liked, but none that have had that mystery that keeps you on the edge of your seat and on the lookout for clues and a possible ending.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been watching The Wire a lot lately, and I thought I'd see if it was as good as it claims to be. What I was pleasantly surprised by is that it has some really good character development. This is not some dull, plot-light character stuff. It has strong and well-defined characters that you can really care about. There's a real feeling that the characters are trying to come to terms with their choices, and that they're doing the best that they can. It's not some empty drama. Also, I really appreciate that there are not many side characters. I am a sucker for side characters, as they give you more stuff to do, and a larger canvas to explore. You can just feel the characters' motivations and feelings towards each other and towards the situations. What really drew me in is that the show never gets preachy. The characters don't talk down to you; they just talk like real people. They are flawed, but they are human. I don't know if the show will catch on (or if I can really get into it), but I certainly enjoyed it, and hope to see more of the show as it continues.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________________________________________   A must read. I've read all of the "Walking Dead" novels by now, but not one about the Walking Dead itself. I really loved this book. I can't say why I liked it so much more than the other Walking Dead novels. Maybe it was the fact that I've never seen a zombie in my entire life and I've seen lots of them in movies and shows. Or, maybe it's the fact I saw an "un-zombie". He was not the typical zombie, not as large or as scary as the other zombies. I'm glad the book gave us something new to think about as well as a cool look at the world of the Walking dead and the people that live in it. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I just wished that the narration and plot development were better, but in all honesty, the narrator was great.................................. I didn't really like this book because I don't think that there's any real reason for a vampire to be in this town and have been for over a year. He did nothing, and I don'she get nothing from him.................................... I had the pleasure of seeing this book in an author's bookstore, and it was a very enjoyable experience. I really enjoyed all the characters in it, and found that they had a lot of different points of view and that it kept things interesting. The story was very good and I really loved the ending.................... I also have an interest in vampires and I thought it was interesting that the vampires were all related................ It was a nice twist at the end of the story to have this "monster" turn out to be a guy.......... I really liked this book, and wish that I could see a movie adaptation. I know that the book has to be adapted to be turned into a film, and they are very close in terms of the plot.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* I really enjoy this book! It has been a year since I read the first one, and I'm still looking for more information about the history of the world of FTL travel, and so I'm happy to find this book that makes the history more complete. I have a couple of criticisms: The first is that, in the prologue, the author refers to the "first FTL jump" (as far as I know, the first FTL jumps occurred in the late 21st century, and that we didn't invent them until about 2060 or so). In my mind, this seems to refer to the jump from Earth to Mars and then on to Alpha Centauri in a warp drive. The jump I am thinking of occurs between the first and second paragraphs of the first chapter: "The first jump was made at the end of 2064, in a jump propelled by a new kind of drive that made the ship as light as an airship, without the need for the space and radiation shielding of conventional rockets, and with the speed of light." I am curious whether any of the subsequent jump drives used have this sort of speed of the ship. The second criticism is that the book seems to make a lot of reference to the history on Earth as if it was a "hobbyist's" history (or perhaps it was written by someone who just knew that, given the number of times the word "hobbiest" is used, and the fact that there are many "hobbies" that have no connection to the technology that is written about). However, the history is written with an actual intent to be read by anyone who is interested in such matters. This means that it does have references that go into the history from the "hobnob", the engineers, scientists and people who have worked on it, and it does address their interests, problems, successes and failures. It would be nice to be able to read the history in one sitting without having to read anything else (I found this very difficult when I first started, and had to skim), but this is not a book that will leave you wishing for another. It does not have to be an extremely long read (the book only runs to 256 pages, with only the first few pages being particularly long). So for all the negatives, I recommend this book to anyone with a passion for reading, or who might be interested in learning more about this fascinating and mysterious technology.  Review by: JAMES
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ This book is very thorough and detailed.   It has an excellent picture of what the early Christians were like.  They were people who loved Jesus, the Bible, and God as well as their own people.  This is very different from a book like "A History of Christianity"   which is written for the general reader and doesn't deal with the theology.   It's great to read this book because you are not trying to be a theologian.  A lot of what you will learn is just about the history of Christianity.  The people who were writing about the early Christianity were in the minority and they knew how the early Church was growing and changing.  It's very interesting and easy to follow.  I especially liked the timeline of Christian history.  There is a lot of history in this book.    You learn about why the early church did what they did.  Also there is a good discussion of the Church Fathers, how they knew what they knew, and why they did what you see in this history book.  One issue with this book is that it's short.  If I had not read this in one sitting I would not have learned as much.  Some of the details will take you by surprise.  For instance, there was an issue of an early Church in Rome.  At one point early in the first century there was a group of people that wanted to join the early Christian Church in the city of Rome.   They wanted to be "members" of the Early Christian Church.  But they couldn't become members because they couldn be Jews and were not allowed to be members in the early days.  So they tried to become members in another location.  Their effort failed.  How can I understand something like this and not believe that it happened?      But I have learned a lot from this book and I hope you will as well. Briefly, "A New History of the Christian Church" by Christopher Dunn is one of the most comprehensive, accurate, and fascinating books on the early years of the early-Christian Church.   Dunn has spent his life in the field of historical research, as well the more popular field of New Testament study.   He has worked with some of the biggest names in the history books.   When it came time to write this book, he knew he wanted to focus on the first 2,000 years of Christianity and he knew that he needed to

I found it a very enjoyable read.  It was also a great read to see how the author dealt with different characters' personalities and attitudes.

It has been a while since I have been on vacation and I enjoyed this book, it is not a medical treatise in my opinion but is a general outline and guide. The book is easy to understand and has a good point of view. I would recommend this book to anyone, even if you have no medical expertise.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "a must read" - I will read it again, maybe 3 more times "a wonderful story with a few flaws that I'm sure will get smoothed out" - The story is really wonderful and I love the magic! I just wish the last chapter had been a little less dramatic than the first. I just enjoyed it and was looking forward to next week's book "I am extremely interested in the author and in the subject and in her writing style and I'd like to see more of it." - I'm intrigued by the topic, I'll read more of the book, I'm already looking forward "the magic seems to be coming from the author's own imagination" - This is a fun read and I enjoyed it but the magic was so over the top that I didn't feel the magic when it was happening. This is more like a children's book that's been retold so many times that the characters seem so much alike. "The story is good for a good laugh" - It was a good story but the author made it so ridiculous that I lost interest in it. Maybe it was my expectations or the way the author told the story but that story was just too absurd. 5 of 6 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book: ---------------I gave this book 4 stars for a few reasons. First, I am a female, and I loved this book so much. The female character was strong and independent, and she wasn't scared to act on her thoughts. That was one of the most fun parts of the story. I also thought it was awesome how the author didn't shy away from sex scenes. It wasn't just a quickie between two male characters either, she went out of her way to portray sex as a powerful and exciting experience. I loved the book sooo much, but the sex scenes were a bit too much. If I had to remove anything, it would be the sex scene in the book. It felt so awkward because of the time limit, and it was kind of a drag.Overall, if you are a female who likes a good romantic story and you like having sex with your partner, you should definitely read this book.

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________________________________________________________ This was a very good book, I have a lot of difficulty keeping up with the news in this country as I often read a story about a new tragedy or crime, then I just can't seem to find out what happened, then two days later or more the local news is reporting the death of someone, and even then I have no clue what the story is. This book takes a couple of hours to read, so it's a good choice for anyone that needs some time to get their head around the news that is in the news right now. It's about a young boy, his family, and his neighborhood, and there is plenty of detail in it about the everyday life of a poor, working class white child in the United States, and in many ways I find it more interesting than the TV news reports. I'd recommend this to anyone that's interested in learning more about America's working class, especially the white working class.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________ I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this book. I thought the book would be about the history of the game, a "how to" book. As I read the book though, I was surprised to find it was more of a "when it was." It covers not only the major changes to the game but it also touches upon the changes to individual players and even changes in the rules of the league itself, especially the rules surrounding the referee. This is a very good read! I have not read much about the rules changes as a fan, but I am looking forward to doing so. The players of the era are also interesting as they get to go through the changes with a good amount of time to reflect on it.
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________ When I bought this book a few months back, I was curious about how well the author (a guy I hadn't heard of) could write about the subject of gender.

I think I'm going to read this book again, especially if a new translation of this book comes out sometime soon.

I found the book very easy to read and understand, even if I had previously been an active duty Army officer.  The book also works well for those without much military training.  The instructor will often offer "practical" tips when you need a specific one.  My husband has also used it to help get him trained in various roles in the military.  This book is a good example of what a great training manual can do.

Write a positive review about a good book:    A really interesting read  by JEONI   I'm a big fan of books like this. They make you think about things and ask questions. In this case, I really didn't understand everything, but at least I think I got the gist of it. And the best part is that the book isn't just about these characters and how they deal with the world they live in. It's a story about the struggle to find meaning in life and how the world can affect us.   There were a few things that bothered me, but they weren't really in the book, and they didn't detract from my overall experience of reading it. I also enjoyed the fact that there was a couple of different approaches to the characters. I'd give the character development a 4, just to be nice. However, if the characters were all like the book made them out to be, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed the book as much.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had great expectations from this book but it was much better than I thought it would be. I did not think that it was going to be a book about how to make a person feel better and it definitely wasn't. The book is actually an interesting look at how emotions affect the body as well as how people can use those emotions to get what they want. I've found that people are so afraid of doing the right thing that they'll do anything at all to avoid the feeling of doing wrong. This book looks at how people try to get the "good feelings" that they fear others might have. It also shows how sometimes those good feelings can lead to even better feelings and that's how life can be.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "I have a very good memory and I've been able to remember almost every book I read, and most of the movies I watched in the 80s. However, when I tried to recall this book in 2012, I couldn't remember the names of most of these characters, let alone the story line. I had forgotten a lot of this book's scenes and dialogue. But that was fine because I had so much else to look forward to. The action scenes were intense, the descriptions of these "hollywood villains" were spot on, and the main character was a real woman. There were some issues with the pacing, though, especially in the last third of the book.   Also, the characters were all so unlikable. I have a difficult time getting into most of them because they just seem so unliked. But some of them I just couldn't get out of my head, and it was a lot easier to just think about them as monsters and villains instead of actual people.   the ending was a bit rushed, and not in the way that some would say it was. It ended with one of the villains killing her lover, so they didn't really get to have a big confrontation. However what bothered me the most was the fact that this villain, this "the villain's" mother, would rather die than see the monster she raised go to jail. So, the "hero" of the story, the main heroine, and her father are able to work out a way for the villain to kill her. But instead of letting her die peacefully, this mother has the monster executed. This was horrible writing on the part of the author.  , in all, a good, fast paced, action-packed book. But I just can't get on board with the characterizations, and that's a shame because I liked so many of them. The writing was good, though; it was fast, it was violent, it had some interesting ideas. However I just wasn't able to connect with the "characters" in the book as much as I did with the heroes. It's a hard read; it does seem like a fun read if you like action, and as such, it would probably work better for younger readers.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Best Way to Eat (A Cookbook for the Family and a Gift for Yourself) by Kate Williams is an engaging and humorous memoir that was an absolute joy to read.  There is so much to love about this book - from the wonderful writing style to the entertaining recipe ideas. I loved the little details.  As soon as I finished it, I was thinking of how wonderful it would be to share this with other mothers and to pass along this book as an inspiration for family meals. I had such a wonderful time reading it and it was one of those books that made me want to share it with my family.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book. I enjoyed it very much, very helpful. It explains everything I need to know about the new MOSFET chip and provides all the information I needed to use this device, not just for the MCU but also for the RAM and storage. The documentation is excellent. I had never used this chip before I read the book. Once I saw how to configure the chip, I was able to configure a real MOS to my heart's content and had my first real working MOS on the MCUs. It is really cool to be able to use MOS technology on a CPU, even if it is old technology. I also got to learn a bit of the inner work of MOS design. This is an excellent book to learn about MOS, both on old devices like MCUs and modern devices like the MIMO. It covers the whole history of MIMOS technology. It also explains the whole chip layout, including the I2C interface. Overall a great and very useful book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm currently enjoying The Shadow of the Torturer by C.S. Lewis and it is quite possibly the best book I have read this year. The author does a wonderful job of portraying life as a soldier in the Spanish Civil War, and does so in a way that is not only engaging but also fascinating and enjoyable. It is so easy to see what people were going through while they were out in the field, and there is something really touching about seeing a soldier's devotion to the cause. The story itself, whilst it is not a short story, is pretty well paced and a lot of fun. I can't wait to see where he takes the story next and how his characters develop and grow in the years to come.   5 of 5 magicians found this helpful.

Write a positive review about a good book: *************   "Toby Durden's Man in Black" is a brilliant, well written, and well paced book that has it's place in any serious collection of SF or fantasy. It is highly recommended for those who have not read it before and/or have not gotten to this point in their SF or Fantasy reading.   There are many other books in the series but I'm not going to review them all because, well, if I did... you would think I had already read all of them! :)
Write a positive review about a good book:  My wife and I both have the hardcover copies of this book that are dated 1999. This book is definitely worth the price! I found the stories very realistic and some very moving! When I had first started reading this book, I was very nervous and I thought there would not be much action in it because of the title. But after reading the book, it is like it was written for me because of all the things that are happening in our lives and in the world! I am sure you will enjoy this book. " " "This book is a MUST read! I love the way it is written, the characters are real. It's funny and sad and sadder. I read the book last night and I was in tears. I feel like I would rather have been dead than to have read this book...It is a very sad story about a group of men in the Army who were very successful in the business world until they have to go to Afghanistan. One of the things I love about this book is the fact that the book is written from the perspective of the main character, but he doesn't just talk like that. There are many times he uses the word, "you." I felt so bad for the guy who was so successful that his success was the only thing that allowed him to live with himself. The man who wrote this book could be me when I get home from a long day of work. The story is very realistic. I really wanted to know what happened to that poor man who was caught by the Taliban. It was very hard reading this. I cried a lot. But I'm glad I did! I can't wait to start reading another book from this author." "
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book for my 11 yr old son who loves reading and is constantly making me stop. We are always fighting over who is going to read a book first, he says it makes the story better. Well the stories are better than I could have ever hoped for. The world building was top notch and I think I have a very nice story to tell one day.   This book is great for parents of kids that read very fast. It's so much fun to watch him try to keep up! I love how he really wants to learn what the hell this magic stuff is all about. I wish I would have bought this a long time ago!   So I would recommend this book to ANY parent and any adult that enjoys stories. I think it is so much better than some of the books that children like to read. I am definitely going to keep buying this book and giving it to my son.  : This book was absolutely fabulous! I bought this for my son who just turned 7. He loves reading. We're always fighting about who is getting to read first, so he really enjoyed this book. The worlds are unique and the writing was top class. I loved reading about all of the little details about the world of the story. I will definitely be buying this story. So far I have enjoyed it more than any book I have read in a long long time.This book was excellent! This is my first "grown-up" book that I have purchased for my young son and it is amazing! So glad I decided to give it a try. If I ever have another boy like my son it will be the next book. It was so much more enjoyable than the "grown up" books I have been purchasing for my kids.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys reading stories.

Write a positive review about a good book:...........................  My mother-in-law and I were so surprised at how good this book was, and how much it helped our marriage. We have been struggling for years because we have both been emotionally distant. My husband has a good job, but we have been getting less and less close, and she has a job as well and is a good provider, but my husband has never come home. He lives in a nice area, has a great car and a very well-adjusted wife. We love each other dearly, but I feel that I have to constantly tell him to make an effort with his life.  The book did the trick and he has returned to visit me and make an even stronger commitment to my life. It was a wonderful book and he was glad to read it. The book has helped my husband and I realize that we must be willing to do more for each other if we are to be happy and healthy. Thank you so much for this great book!  -Carmen and Michael  I thought it was a great book for my husband when I asked him if he would like a copy. He is working with the family and has been reading more about healthy relationships. It has changed his attitude on relationships and the book has shown him what a healthy relationship can look like. I really thought it would change our relationship, but it has actually made us a stronger team. He has changed from a "don't like it" kind of guy to one that is excited to share. It is amazing that a book can change so many minds.  the book is a great place to start and it gives you ideas for things you can do to change yourself and your relationships. There is a section on things you must do, and also a section that lists ways of improving your own behavior. You can't think about what your husband does all day, how to make it more positive, how your own emotions affect him, or how to find ways to make him feel better if you don't think he is having a good day, etc. There are sections that will give you ideas on how to change your own attitudes, behaviors, and even what you should eat, drink, or wear to help you feel better, the ways in which people are using different ways of relating to each other (positively, negatively, etc), how to build a relationship that you will be proud of and feel loved, the kinds of things to be careful about, etc,
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________  I like it. I'm a woman who is in love with a man, and when we were talking about the book (his) I did not want to admit to being a woman but, in a way, it's not for me. I liked the way the author is written as someone who is very open and who tries to be honest with her readers. She doesn't want to tell us everything but the book is so well written that I am sure she doesn't have to. I don't know what to expect from the book, maybe something I've read before, but it was a good read and I am very interested in the ending, that's for sure.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book!  It's very different from the rest, but it's very good.  The author is extremely funny and the subject matter is just fantastic.    Read an interesting review about this book: It's the story of a high school boy who's a bit of a misfit and one who takes after his family: a bit cocky, a bit sarcastic, a little bit snobbish, a lot of energy. It's a little hard to believe that there are no other books like this.  "But wait a minute, why are you making such a big deal about it?"  Well, there are only three of us in this story.  He's not the only one.  There's his little sister, the best friend of his family, a girl who looks a little like his daughter, a few other kids, and a couple of other guys. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A new edition of " The World Atlas of Earth " is available and I got it for my birthday. I was so happy I got the copy in the United States. The book contains very informative notes for each state, city, and province and was much easier to read than the first edition (which I got from the library). I really recommend the new edition.   I also have the "A Brief History of the Earth" in another edition. I read it in school a lot, but it seemed a little dry after re-reading it. My husband had the same reaction: "Too many stories and not enough science". He still recommended this book, but I am still not sure.  I gave this book 5 stars based on the new information provided in the book, not the overall quality of the book.

Write a positive review about a good book:.................................................................   I was pleasantly surprised with this book. It is one of the best books I've read on the art of writing, but not just for writers.   The author doesn't get into too much detail on how to write, but it is an interesting read nonetheless. I'm not sure what the author is trying to say, and that's part of what makes it great.   I was not able to get through the book. I don't know if I was just not enjoying it or if it was just too complicated.   It seems like an awful lot of writing to read, especially for someone so new to writing. It took me a lot of time to read the book and figure out what all I was reading about. I also know this book is geared to the self-publisher, but I don;t feel like I had to read it just to learn how to self publish. The author does get into the theory of self-published writing, and I think if you are interested in writing but don't want to spend a lot on marketing, this is a book to read.   is a really great book on how and why you should do what you do. It also goes into how you can get more customers. I think that's a good read and will help you see that you don't have to do all the things that I did with the first version of this book (that's a story for another day).   If you are a writer who is looking for a quick start to write something, read this book and you will be all set. If you don; t have a lot to say and you don' t feel like you're wasting time, don't read this.

She is a first year student of biology.  The book is written with good detail, and easy to follow. It is filled with references. , for anyone interested in this subject.  (I have been reading a lot of "how to" books, and this book would be a good reference for me. )  This book is very well done, and contains a lot for a first-time readers like myself to go over.  the author did a very good job of explaining the subjects covered in the book in detail.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I thought that my new read was so interesting I took the time to put it down to re-read it - and I am so glad that I did. As a teacher, I want students to have a good story to read. There's so many things to consider with a book. This book was very easy to understand and I learned a lot. I liked that the characters are not as good as they seem (though they may be in our own lives). The author has a knack for telling a good tale - and her skill for writing makes the reader want to keep reading. The story was not overly long - and was the perfect length for our children.    The book is not suitable for those who are sensitive to gore or profanity. Recommended: You may not like this book if you like:

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________   "I read this book about a week ago and was really drawn in by the ending. I've enjoyed a few of Houghton Mifflin's titles, and this one was another good one, but this one really had something for me. In short, I loved it. "  -M.R.   Review: _____________________________________________________________________________     This was my first Houghland Miffler book and I have to say that I really loved it! My husband was going through his pile of books for our wedding and he had this on his list. I am a sucker for a good historical romance and this book was a real hit for me! There were a few twists that had me turning the pages. I would have liked to know more about the women. I didn't care for them all too much. I liked Anna and Elinor and how well they fit together. I like some of the romance in it but I liked how there was an underlying mystery to it all that was good. I hope to get to see them again in the future.   for Houghlander, Houghlin Mifflins has been my go to source for their novels. I love how well thought out it is. They keep it fun and fun, and interesting. The writing is good. Not that I like most historical novels, but I really love this one!   I just got back from the library and I'm enjoying the latest book, "Daughter of the Lion" by M.J. Anderson. I thought it was the same characters but with a different tone. This one was a little less sentimental and felt more modern, and yet I think it is a good read as well.   to end with, I'd recommend this to all!

Write a positive review about a good book:    "I love this book. It is a really simple, down to earth look at the world of women and their roles.

And it didn't just go into the world I am in, it talked about women all over the world."   I love that "I have been in all of the limousines", "I've been to the world famous parties and the glamorous night clubs" etc etc, I read it in a very funny voice, it is an insight to many women, and I think it was perfect for those who want to laugh at themselves too, and know that it isn't something they need to be afraid of doing or to be ashamed of doing, they can be proud of it, and it will definitely help people who look up to them.

Write a positive review about a good book:  http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3...  - The cover is gorgeous.  I am not sure if I should recommend this book to someone that is into "hardcore" science fiction. This book has a "literary" sensibility to it that I have not found in my reading habits. I read a great deal, and it took me ages to read this. I think I read it in two sittings (which I didn't do because I was bored and got distracted). The story is compelling, the characters are believable, and the plot unfolds in a satisfying fashion. The world building is very interesting. I have always been fascinated with the idea of what it would be like to inhabit the Earth. The author builds a lot of believable backstory about what life might be like on Mars. If you are looking for some science fiction that is "hard" but doesn't "pull you under" like "The Martian" or "Faster Pussycat," this might be for you.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have found my new favorite read on Amazon. It took me ages to find, but I finally found it. The characters are wonderful and the story is well told. The only flaw I have is that I think the author could have made a few more changes and I think that she should have included a few books that go with this one (although they are not in the books) I still recommend it because of it's very good story. I know it is a bit short, but just like my old books, it has a great ending. I loved it.  I received this book as a free download as a bonus for signing up for this book club. I was very excited about this book, and I've always wanted to read The House of Stairs. I've had my eye on the author for a while now, and her books have always caught my attention.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- This book was fantastic. I have been a fan of Dune since I was a little girl, but I've always been more of a general fan rather than a fan who really wanted to know what was going on. I've read Dune several times (including a hardcover, which is a wonderful thing to own), but I'm glad I finally got around to reading this.   For those of you who have read DUNE, you'll know that it deals with a religion based on the concept that all of the things in the universe are interdependent. When a new religion is formed, the people of the planet worship it as if it is true, even if they don't fully understand it. In one of the many chapters, the characters (mainly Alia, LeRoy, and Mina) visit an abandoned church on El-Adrel. Inside is an old, ancient map of El- Adrel which has been hidden away for a very long time. The characters are not told anything about the map itself, and are instead told a simple story about a priest who used to live there and how he left El- adrel. When he died and the church was moved to a new location, the priests of that new church tried to figure out the old maps location by exploring the entire planet. And here's the kicker: they couldn't! The old maps and the old priests were so far apart that it was impossible to figure it out.   the old map  (by James Blish)  The old maps (by James A. Blish, Jr.)  This was the part of the book that really got me. All of this was so amazingly believable, and it was incredibly thought-provoking. I honestly never in a million years thought it would happen, and now I'm amazed.   of the old people in El-adrel! This book is so far away from being a book about religion I almost wish it was, but it is still one of my favorite books. This book will forever stay in my reading basket, and I will treasure it like a treasure map.  , so i'm very excited to read the rest of the books in the series. this book has a very dark theme that is hard to describe, but has a lot of layers to it. I'm hoping to be introduced to the world and all of its secrets in the next books. I loved all of it!

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________________________________________ I would love to recommend this book to everyone who has been interested in the Bible or the history of the Bible. It is very thorough and well-written. In fact, it is one of the only books that I know of that is written for the uninitiated without fear or favor and with no bias. I would definitely read another book by this author. --David D. J. Tipton  Review of David J.Tipton, ed., Genesis, The History of God's Covenant With Noah and the Children of Israel (Provo, UT: Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, 2002).  Reviewed by Kevin P. O'Hara (Department of History, Brigham Young University)  One of the main claims of the author of Genesis: The History, as stated in the title, is that God chose to place Noah and his family on the ark after the Flood, in order to record the Flood in a way that will ensure that the human race is able to live in the future. This is a very plausible claim and one that has recently been discussed in a few other books.  In Genesis, the Lord states: "And the flood went on for forty days and forty nights; and the water prevailed, and the arks were saved" (Genesis 6:10, emphasis added). This statement, which refers to the forty days or so immediately following the deluge, indicates that the waters remained strong enough for the arK to escape. As the text continues, the waters increase and eventually cover the arKS completely. Then the floodwaters subsides, and a few days later, the flood waters recede (Genes 7:17, emphasis removed).  the Flood is described as "much more powerful than all the waters that were in the world, and they prevailed exceedingly on the earth" (Ezekiel 28:13; emphasis added) and, "It did not rain any more for forty and two weeks and seven days" (Daniel 8:21, emphasis retained). It is this general description of the Flood that informs the conclusion that the Flood had "much power."  The other major point of emphasis in the narrative is that Noah built an ark in which he, his wife and his two sons would live. The first two sons, Shem and Ham, were not sacrificed. However, after his death, they were brought before Noah for judgment and given a choice of which of

Review: An Unconventional Truth by Richard Dawkins, Stephen Jay Gould, and Jerry Coyne "An Unconventionally Truthful Guide" is the title of a new book of essays about religion, evolution and the origin of life. It is a sort of'spiritual guide' to science, that will provide you with the best of both worlds: some of the scientific material from which a more robust scientific understanding of life and of the origin and evolution of the universe can be built, while also giving a much wider picture of where we all came from, what is the source of the big bang theory, why religion, philosophy, science and morality are so intertwined, and how that interplay and interdependence could have led to the existence of humanity and to the world we live in.  . I received an Advance Copy from the publisher with a signed dedication from the authors. The first chapter of this book is called 'How Religion Has Influenced Science.' It describes a number of interesting examples of how religion and science have overlapped in their interactions over the past few centuries. Examples like how the first scientists of Europe were drawn to the monotheistic religions as well as to their own philosophies and discoveries, and the early scientific debates about creation and evolution, how Galileo's observations of the tides led him to believe that there was an order to the universe rather than
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* Thank you for writing this book about the Great Depression. It is a very well researched and thorough book. You provide the background and history and you do the historical research. As a student in the United States, I was delighted to learn a little more about this period of American history and I am looking forward to reading the rest of the book in the near future. Keep up the great work, Jim   *********   I enjoyed this book and thought the historical background was very interesting. I read it without taking notes. I feel that the information was easy to understand, and I think it would be easy for my son or daughter to learn about the depression.   The narration was very good.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book. I enjoyed it so much that I am rereading it right now to refresh myself on the details of the story. The main characters were well-written and had interesting backstories to give them personality. The book has a little bit of a plot, but it was a little over-written. My biggest problem is that the main characters kept confusing each other and I had to look back and find the correct answer for them all. I liked the story and I'm looking forward to re-reading it as I have another book to read and I was hoping to learn a little more about the main character and some of the other characters. My only other complaint is that I wish they would have provided a more detailed version of their family tree or even more information about their home country. Overall I would give this book a 7 or 8 out of 10, but would change the rating if they did provide more of a detailed background for their family and a bit more history regarding the plot.

Write a positive review about a good book:..................................................." The book "The Book of Secrets" by David Bickle is a book that I had read about 25 years ago and was never interested in it. As I became older and started my own business my interest waned in my interest for the book and I finally put it down. When I heard that this was a reprint of it I was very excited and when I finally got my copy I just knew that I'd never be the same! I was able to see why the book is called "The book of secrets" and what it was about: a young man learns how to do a "piggyback ride". It seems to be something only boys do. As soon as I started reading I was in love with the book. I could tell you all about it, but I'll let the book speak for itself. I think this is one of those books that should be read and re-read over and over again, or if you are like me it is the kind of book you will read and think "wow this is awesome". I wish I could give this book 5 stars or more! This is a great book and it is a keeper.  My rating: 5 stars   Fantastic story of the dark side of masculinity and how to overcome it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Great Crash (Nebuchadnezzar) by Paul Czege is an excellent example of how a work of science fiction can illuminate real world events with a sense of relevance and plausibility. It is not science fiction, but the stories and themes in it have real-world implications. The story of a global catastrophe that destroys all currency, and a desperate flight to a parallel Earth as it begins, could apply to a wide range of issues. The book is well-written, detailed and interesting and the author does an excellent job of setting up the problems and problems that arise after this type of financial collapse. There are even a few references to the real world to provide historical context. This is science fiction and it is a good example of the kind of work that can be produced to stimulate discussion of real world issues. Recommended

Write a positive review about a good book:  " The book is a nice read and very informative. I was not sure how to do it. I bought the DVD and read it in one sitting. I will be sure to buy the paperback and use it for my children. I wish I had read it before now." Overall:    5 stars As a self taught artist, I have been searching for something that I can call my own, that is of a higher quality than the quality offered in the commercial art world. With this book, I purchased The Art of Self-Portrait by Edward Weston. The Art of the Self-portrait is a collection of photos taken by Weston over his lifetime as he attempted to take pictures of his personal self. Each photo has an accompanying text that gives the background on the subject, how he made the photo, what the setting was like, etc. This book is like a treasure trove of photos. As I looked over these photos, I found something very important about myself: I was not as concerned about looking beautiful as I once was. What is the root of this shift in my priorities? A friend once said, "It is better to look like a clown than a genius" In my search for the answer to this question, I discovered the most important thing I can take away from this book is that it is possible to look good in photos. To be able to look attractive, in an intelligent and calm way. That being said, the photos do not paint a picture of being "look-like-a-dumb-ass" or looking like a "big-shot-celebrity" but I am sure they are entertaining. This book is filled with wonderful and inspiring photos. It is very inspiring. And to me, it is the best book to buy in a long time. It provides great advice on taking good photographs and being confident. I can definitely see myself becoming more confident, like Edward Weston, by trying to look better in my photos. I can imagine being in a situation and thinking to myself, "this is a good photo!" and then being in front of the camera and being more excited about the photo that has been taken of me. "Look good" is the first sentence of this book. And the book does a good job of helping us get there.

I enjoyed the plot, and the characters.   -The book opens with the narrator writing about his own life. It is interesting to see how he writes. He has a lot of words in his head, and sometimes his writing reads like he is speaking out loud to someone on the other side of the wall. In the first part of the book, he discusses the events of his own childhood. It was interesting for me to hear the details. It's a good way to start the book.  -There are many good things about this book. There is the narrator, who is very good. He talks about his life, and makes me relate to him. There are also the characters and the events they experience. In particular, the story of his life as a boy, and how he came to be a boy. The story is very interesting to read. It includes many emotions and some interesting facts about our human nature.  . I really loved this book! I thought the ending was brilliant. There was a little sadness to it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Best Of Robert Heinlein's Science Fiction:  Robert A. Heinlein (1927-1969), Science Fiction, (1929), by  Edward W. Cain,   (The University of Chicago Press, 1962),  is an excellent introduction to a fascinating man. In the introductory essay Cain lists twenty-seven books, but I found his list especially valuable for two reasons. First, although Heinlein was very critical of some of his colleagues in science fiction (such as Theodore Sturgeon and John W. Campbell), Cain notes that the science fiction writer was also an anti-Communist and, perhaps more significantly, an anti--"New Dealer" (he did support the creation of the Federal Reserve, although in an odd way). Secondly, although he did publish at least one book about his own work (The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, 1960), Cain does not make a point of including Heinlein by name. I found this omission to be quite significant, for although Heinlen's criticism of American economic policies is frequently discussed in the context of his opposition to those policies, I cannot think of another example in which Heinlein explicitly attacked the government--or even the policies of a single nation or leader. If I had been asked to name Heinlein or any other major American science fiction author for whom I disagreed with Heinlein on economics, I am not sure I could have thought of him. I will therefore be more inclined to discuss these points of disagreement as a whole in my review, but in this case I would caution readers to take a look at the entire essay, which includes an excellent discussion of Heinlein and his work in politics as well as his views of the social effects of his works (and there are good discussions of both in the book itself). For those interested, I also recommend the two articles by Heinlein in the October 1961 and March 1962 issues of the  Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.  For my own part, I found Cain's introduction to Heinlein to be very informative and I look forward to reading it again. In a nutshell: Robert Heinlen is the only American science-fiction writer I know of who explicitly argued against Rooseveltian government social programs.  He was also a major force for the United States to oppose the creation and use of atomic weapons.   Although Cain does spend a good deal of time criticizing Heinlein as a journalist (see below), the book is primarily a very good introduction to the man and his
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was very good. The plot is interesting and interesting characters in this book.  I hope to read the next book in the series very soon. I just finished reading this book, and it is very good! The book was pretty good! I really liked the plot. The characters were well written, the plot was good, and the story was different than what I've read before. I enjoyed reading this. I had a good time reading this and I hope to reread this when I have a little more time to read it. In the meantime, I've decided to do a little bit of research on the author and some of the things he's written. Here's what I found: -The author writes under the name "E.H. Shepard", however his real name is Edward Henry Harland Shepard.  -The book that started it all was "The Last Starfighter".  This book is about the first man to fly into space.  It's the first novel in his "Wing Commander" series.  He wrote this book in 1979, at the time Wing Commander was just starting to become popular.  The book is titled "The Edge of the Sword"  "The Edge Of The Sword"  -This book, also written by Shepard, was released in 1982.   The main character was one of Shepard's best friends.  -The main character in this novel is a man named James T. Kirk, and he is a pilot. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a fantastic book about the Holocaust. I am a student who was a bit skeptical of what would be in it and it was very informative. I would recommend it to anyone looking to know more about the topic.   I also would recommend that you read this book while you are reading the other books on the topic, to have the context. The topic is a very controversial one and many will read the other Holocaust books to get some kind of perspective on the book. I didn't find this to be the case for me though I did find myself being a bit overwhelmed by all the detail and the amount of time it took me to read it all.
Write a positive review about a good book:!!! Great book!!! The only thing I dont like about this book is that the whole book is in Chinese. I could get an English translation, but the book could have been shortened a little so that more could have got through. Still, it was a great book for me, and the only other thing that is really irritating is the fact that the author has a habit of changing names and places. The book takes place in the late 1980s in the city of Hong Kong, not China. A city of over 7 million people, it is a vast and complex place that I don't feel I could cover in a book of this size. Still it is an important part of my personal history, and it is interesting to learn about. I think that the story was too long for the size of the book, but I do hope that in the future, the author will shorten the book so that it can be reread by other readers. I read this book in the Spring of 1996, and I was too old to go to college, so the book ended up sitting on my shelves for quite some time, but finally came out to the library in September, 1998. In November, I was in the library, and read it through. I am now in my mid-late fifties. The writing in this book was excellent. The prose is both clear and concise. The author is not afraid to tell a story, even if it is long or complicated. I also liked that the characters did not follow a strict moral code. I like that I can look at the characters' actions and understand their motives in a different way. Although the story takes place primarily in Hong Kong during the late 80s and early 90s, there were plenty of events and references that took place in other parts of Asia. The fact that I never had to deal with racism and that I did not have to be afraid of being stared at while I walked down the street or shop I was shopping in made the book really good. As the book is not for the squeamish, I highly suggest that you read it and see if you have the same reaction as I had.!!! I would like to know what other bookstores have or should have on their shelves!!!
Write a positive review about a good book: _____________   The one thing I learned from this book was how to find out what was true, and what was not. I've written hundreds of articles about the Bible and I always end up finding a lot of "common sense" information on the Bible that I can't easily explain. This book was very clear and helped me to find that common sense.   I found that it was best to understand that what we believe is just a small part of the story that was told to us, and that there are other parts that we can find. It was hard to keep from making some of the "common" sense statements, but that part of my brain will learn how to see things like that more easily. And, I did learn that I'm not always right and that when I'm wrong, God is always right.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________ "This book is both a work of art and a workmanlike and thorough history of the Spanish civil war. There are many books written about the war but very few that deal with its political, military and cultural aspects. Most books about the Spanish Civil War focus on the military aspects, mostly the military victory of the Nationalists. This is not an issue. If you are interested in what happened during the Spanish war you will find this book a good read, but do not expect to find any new political theory or an explanation for some events in the war. For this reason I would recommend this book to anyone interested in this subject."

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I read this at the beginning, as it was part of a series. I enjoyed it a lot, although it is not necessarily a good place to start. However, I would recommend this to a reader who likes fantasy, as this book does set some of the key events in the world, such as the events of Book 1. I do recommend this book, but it's best for a reader that has some knowledge of the characters and the history of the world. I'd recommend a book more like this for first time readers.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********** The book itself was very informative. The book is a good primer on the history of the church. The illustrations in the book were extremely well done. The prose was very good. The only problem I had was the beginning chapters. The author did not explain that the first book was a collection of the first century gospels and then the second book was the gospel of the Hebrews. Also he forgot the name of the book the second one is called. He did explain the first chapter.  Review of DJH - The Orthodox Faith: A Comprehensive Guide to the Orthodox Church by Gregory J. Huet ISBN: 0865691431 Reviewed by Tania Dolan on March 16, 2008 Good, but I could have done without the "the other gospel"  The Author seems to think that the Bible is only in one language, English, and the Gospel is in the Greek New Testament.  it's in Greek, and all the rest are in Greek  I also found it funny that the author does not use the Greek letters to write the Greek words  It was very hard to understand at times, and it's not clear in places if there are contradictions in the text or not. But other than that, a very good guide to the history, theology and worship of the Orthodox faith  This book is very well written. It is clear that the writer is a well-educated man of the Church. His approach to Orthodox theology is clear and direct. I found it very easy to understand the main points.  on the other hand it is not clear at all if the author knows Greek. -The Author was not clear if the other gospel was not the same as the Hebrew gospel  -It was not very clear in the first part if the Hebrew Gospel was different from the Greek Gospel  Also the author is rather vague on the date of the Gospel of the "other gospel" and that the Gospel that the Hebrew believers read was not called by its original title. I do not know how to summarize the rest of the review. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the history and theology of the Holy Orthodox Church.  The author of the second Gospel, whose work I found difficult to understand  Great book, has everything needed to understand Orthodox theology and the Holy Tradition  Read it in a week and feel a lot better about the Orthodox Faith
Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________   If you love the Hunger Games series as much as I do, this book is for you. A book of incredible emotion, this is a book you read over and over again.   The book was incredibly well written, and I was extremely emotional by the end. A very good ending to the series.  I was worried that there wouldn't be enough of a plot or of the main characters, but I think that the story is too complex for that. This book was well-written, with so many things happening throughout the book, and you have to put yourself into the shoes of Katniss and the other characters. If you have been reading the series, you will enjoy this book even more.
Write a positive review about a good book: ************************* I read this book in a couple of days. In my opinion, this book will change the way you think about the world and its problems. It is written in a style similar to an email from the author's mother. Her email is clear and concise, yet you feel she knows what she is talking about. She has so many good points that I wish I had known about them when I was a kid. What a gift to have had! Thank you for this book! My husband is a biologist and he has seen so many of these problems over the years. As a result, he has come to this conclusion about our world. Thank you, Mr. Riebner for telling the truth. *******************************  "This book is a gift for anyone who thinks they know more than they do about things we take for granted.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________________   This book, as it were, tells the story of the Great Depression through the experiences of six families. The families represent different social classes.   There are five brothers living on the east coast, three on the west coast, and one on the prairies. Each brother, each sister, and each mother have their own different relationship with the depression, but all are struggling. I think the book is written in a way that shows how they all live their lives through the Depression. They are living in the same town, but they live in different ways. The first story is about three of the brothers who are struggling, and the second and third stories are about the sisters, their mother, and father.   to all that I say that it is a very moving book. I loved all the characters, and I thought it was a great way to get some insight into the Great depression.

I liked that the protagonist was a "realist", as the author describes him. I would have liked to see the whole story unfold with the protagonist as a part of it, but, it was worth it.   The book is short (about 2 1/2 hours), and very enjoyable. I am looking forward to the sequel (it's coming soon).

Williamson presents the evidence, but does it in a way that can be appreciated and understood by the average Christian. It is easy to understand and well presented. It has many eye-opening chapters about: How can I understand the creation of the universe? What was the end of the world like? What is God? What happens to our bodies after we die?

Chumley writes: "The first thing to say is that what Chumblety does not do well is to tell us what religion was. Chummer gives us the religious heritage of the West and then leaves it to us to reconstruct the historical development of what he calls "the Christian religion"....He spends a great lot of time talking about what religion is, and why, and I think he's right. Religion is the idea of a powerful and impersonal power in the world. It takes various forms in different cultures. It may be invisible, but it has a powerful influence."

Write a positive review about a good book:    It was really a cool book.   I read the first three pages (it was at my mom's house in the summer of 2008), and I was immediately hooked. There were things in there I had not been taught, and in a few cases, I knew the answers already. Some parts were hard, some parts were easy, and some parts felt right on the tip of my tongue, but just like most of the things I think of while writing this review, the way I saw them was a little different than how they actually happened. There are people I've read about who had a lot of trouble learning a new language, but if that sounds familiar, it's because I went through the same thing at a similar age and ended up with a pretty similar plan of action, and it's called immersion. I learned a lot from this book, but it took me a little while to get used to the way it works, and I found the process frustrating.   the author makes it pretty clear that immersion is a learning process, not a punishment, and that you do not have to learn everything right away. If that makes sense to you, good, you can still enjoy the book without any real difficulty. If you do need some help learning a language, and you've been through other books on this subject before, I would recommend this book. I would say it's for more intermediate learners, and people who have a decent amount of exposure to English. I was just looking for something that could give me some idea as to how I should learn the alphabet, and here it is. It's a good read, especially for kids, but you really need to read it, like really, really read it. It has no pictures in it, it only has text, but then it's probably not for you. I found myself really reading it, and enjoying it in the end, and as a bonus, I found out I didn't know the answers to all of the questions that were listed on the back of the book at the end. You can't really skip through the book, and the picture-free pages can be kind of boring (unless you're a really visual learner, and your brain works better on text), but it's good to have some idea of what's going on, and what you're getting yourself into. You really don't know what you want to learn until you ask yourself "why should I learn this, and why do I think I

Write a positive review about a good book:    "The idea that a great many people have that they don't even understand what a game is or why they are enjoying it is an interesting one."  - The Observer   (review of free book)   Review by: Robert W. Wood on Dec. 31, 2015 :  This is an excellent book. It was the first book I read that was all about game design, and since I know nothing about game development it was an excellent first step for me.   A bit too short (just five chapters), but I think it is a good enough introduction to game design.  -Robert W.   the reviewer is dead right. the book is more about writing good games than actually making them.   is it too short? Yes. but the book will get you into game development. (as long as you don't need to learn the fundamentals. it's not that hard to learn)  , I think that it is possible to build a great game with some time and effort. but it is going to take a LOT of work to make it great. so, is it possible to make good games in less than a year? yes, but then again it is not easy. (although it is easy if you learn to work the way the author does) so, for someone like me who makes video games... I'd say yes it is.  (reviewed it on a tablet)   of 5 stars.

It would be a great companion for the game designer and the reader who wants to play a role-playing game.   at the very least, this book is a nice starting point to explore some of the concepts in game design and game writing.   an excellent introductory read for game designers  Read an interesting book, though, this could be a good introduction for a DUNgeon Lives player who is new to DUNgeons & Dragons, though the book doesn't do much to change the experience that the Dungeon Lives players have.  a very interesting introduction to D&D  Overall rating: 5/5

My only complaint is with the author's style, and in fact the entire story. His writing is so very simple, and to put it into simple terms, it feels like Harry's first book at Hogwarts, but without the humor. I really enjoyed all of the main characters, but there is one who I can't seem to get behind (I don't want to spoil any of the mysteries).   I would absolutely read all the rest of the Harry books if they made an effort to get a little bit more into the world.

It is written by one of the most original writers of the twentieth century and it will be missed.  It is one of those books that is as readable as the day it was written.

I never got around to finishing it because I was busy with school work, etc. But now that I have, I can't wait to read all of the others. I highly recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________ The Best of John Gray is one of the best books of the year, perhaps of the decade. It is also one of those books that should be read in order - starting from the beginning. It starts with his classic 'Nietzsche on Love' - and that is an excellent starting point. I also recommend his 'The Great Chain of Being' for the reader that is interested in exploring the idea of reality as a process. That is very important as well as interesting. I have a friend that is also a professor at a major university who taught this book for many of my classes, so I will read the book to him. He loved it. He says that he will try to get some of the other books on the list to make up his class reading. That would be great. I will finish this review with a quote from 'The World as Will and Representation'. I think that is one excellent chapter on the importance of the author's research in the philosophy of language. It was very clear what he was arguing, although I did have to do a little work to get a grasp on it. I highly recommend this book to anybody. Good Luck

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________   This book is very well researched. It does go into some depth about the occult and it shows a lot of examples of how they are being used by a lot people today. I can see how they may work with some people but not with all. I guess my question is, is there any kind of hidden hand behind some of these things? I guess we have to remember, if someone can't see through the occult, that doesn't mean it doesn't exist, it just means they are not open to it.   The book is easy to read. The chapters are easy to understand and it is easy on the eye to find out what is being discussed. There are no hard and fast rules, but it does go over some of the common practices and the dangers.  .I love the way that some people take things for granted but then go on to use them for evil. This is the part of the book that really stuck out to me. It is a real eye opener.   (This book was also a good read for those of you who have been in the occult for years but have never had a conversation about it with someone who actually knows something about it.)

Good book! The first two were great, but this third one is absolutely great. A lot of things are said that i didn't realize were going to happen, but the worldbuilding was very well done. The twists were awesome too, just like the plot. I feel like this was a prelude to the rest of the trilogy!  I've read this book.   I found it to be a very interesting plot. The way that the two different groups of people are connected, and how they came to have different ideas about magic and otherworldly beings, is very interesting. It has been quite a while since I've read a book with this kind of an intricate plot and world, which made it easy to get into.   of the five main characters, there are two women. The woman that is always seen as a damsel in distress has quite a strong personality, but is more intelligent than some would expect. The character that is the most likable of the bunch, and has the most emotional connection with the heroine, is a man. He is the one that tries to make sense of all that is happening, even though it's very obvious that there are more powerful forces at work. And he also has the strangest habit of talking to the girls as if they were his own daughters. , and a lot of other things. And I found it a very enjoyable book.The action scenes, despite all the "fuzziness" that some people seem to have about it, are very good. The characters, although not as likable as in the first two books, are still very enjoyable, and their thoughts and actions make sense. There is a lot going on in this book, and it gets very complicated very quickly. There are quite a few different groups, each with their own motivations, and all of them coming together to help out one girl in particular, but also to try to deal with the fact that some bad guys are out there that need to be dealt with. A very well thought-out plot, and one that I'm sure a lot more people will like as it continues to unfold.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ The author is a smart man and he can write very well. But I am sure that this book is a very good example of the misuse of the term "human nature". The author makes the reader believe that the basic human nature is "arrogant", "selfish", "aggressive" and "violent". These are some words I have heard many times, and this is the first time I have seen the actual meaning of these words. In actual fact the human nature has an element of "compassion", "sympathy" and others. But the author does not let us know the real meaning of the words. Therefore, the author tries to make people believe that these things are not in the human, but they are in the animal nature, and the author makes us think that this is not so and that we should not fight with others. In fact the basic difference between human and animal nature is not in these words, but rather in their level of reasoning and emotional development. In the human society, the development of "self" or "ego" is a precondition of "reason" and emotional level. In other words, it is the "level of development" and not the words "egos" and self, which distinguish humans from animals. The author tries, but he does not succeed in making people believe his thesis. In order to be able to understand the meaning of some of the terms used by the author, a more extensive analysis would be necessary. The most fundamental conclusion, which the author should have drawn, would be that the human mind cannot understand the level of reason of animals, even the higher animals. In this case, there is no conflict, because the higher level of the animal is not above the lower.   Another problem, which is not mentioned in the book, is that the author uses the word "emotions" in many of the examples and this makes the readers believe that this word was invented by him to make the readers think that the "solution" for our problems is only in our emotions and that the reason for the problems is that our emotion is not "rational" or that there are different emotions in our brain. This is a misunderstanding of the word emotions. The word emotion was used in the history of philosophy and in the psychology. And the word was not invented to make us think there is something like emotions in the brain, but for the description of some processes of our mind. In reality, the emotion

I really want to see more of that, and I think there's definitely more in the works, if only because of how entertaining it is. If you like funny, this book is definitely for you.  If you hate humor, this is definitely not for you, although if you have a sensitive nature, I have no doubt that you will enjoy it.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ I have to admit that I have a hard time with these kind of stories, especially those about death, because it seems almost too easy and natural. And even though I am a big fan of the book and had a lot of fun reading it, it was tough for me to read because of all those aspects and how it was told. I don't have much to say about this other than it was a very interesting story and a very enjoyable read. I was very surprised by some of the things that the protagonist is doing, because even though it might seem like a little bit of a stretch, it seemed that she really was trying to do the right thing and really trying to bring closure for the parents. I have heard about some of this stuff before but I'm not really sure why I was surprised or how this is new. All in all, I really enjoyed this book and will definitely be looking into other books by the author because I was fascinated by this story and I found some interesting facts about people I knew.Read full review

Write a positive review about a good book: ~~The Man in the Machine ~~ I've loved this book for awhile now. This is one of the most interesting books I've read and I've come to the conclusion that a lot of the times you will not understand the science, but you'll understand the author's opinion on his book and he is quite interesting.   It is definitely a story about the man who is trying to get his wife pregnant (he's not in the mood for a good relationship so he's trying to use the technology to make her pregnant). The main character, who's also the main antagonist of the book, has all these amazing inventions that will make your life a complete nightmare. If you're going to read this book, you need to know what he has, or you'll probably hate the character. The story and the characters are not what I was expecting, but the book still manages to keep me interested.   the plot in this book is about a woman and a man, they want to have a baby and they are planning on trying to do it using these machines. They don't have any problems getting pregnant so the man decides to give them a few machines. All of these machines are going to do one thing and that is help them to get pregnant. This starts them off with two sons, one is an ordinary boy, he doesn't have much intelligence, he's more like a child, and his brother is an "advanced" machine, he has an IQ of 120 and an ability to learn.   The other son, they decide to name as "The Man" since he's the father of all of them. He is actually a machine as well, but he is able to do whatever he wants because he's programmed to do that. The main villain of the story is a man named J.A.J.E.S who is an inventor and his main machine, it is called the "Espresso Machine" is able for him to do any task. He can even read the brainwave of his enemies and it even allows him to communicate with the machines, so it's quite scary and you should definitely not take it seriously because the main villain is a machine, but if you're really into science and you like watching things explode and stuff, then this book will keep you interested.

Write a positive review about a good book:.................................. "Bobby Fischer's Mastering the Game is an amazing resource for the beginner who wants to learn chess. The book covers the basics of the game (e.g. opening theory and play), provides a detailed explanation of many of the chess puzzles, and concludes with an assessment of your strengths and weaknesses. The only downside is that it is really difficult to understand the text if you've not studied the basics. But if you understand the game already, then you can learn it in a very short time."--David E. Cramer   "Mastering the game is the first comprehensive treatment of a game as complicated as chess and Fischer's masterclass has a certain immediacy and immediacy that no other book does, and it does so in a clear and straightforward manner that will make it a great reference. This is an excellent book for the newbie who's only experience of chess is through the chess program."--Charles H. Schulz   Bobby's masterpiece The game of chess should be on the Boca Raton Public Library's bookshelf alongside the greats of American literature. With its concise, clear-cut approach, Mastering The Game makes this a reality.   --Rafael Almeida   This book offers the clearest, most complete account of chess ever written. Fischer explains in simple language, step by step, the various steps and procedures for the analysis of any game, no matter how complex.   (A first-rate book. It is an example of the good old fashioned American way of writing that is so admired throughout the world.)   -J. A. Fazio
Write a positive review about a good book:  "This is a good science fiction book, and definitely a good novel. If you like the science fiction of the 1950s and have a taste for the humor, you should give this a try. I'm glad that a new generation of science fiction fans is emerging. It's nice to have books that reflect a time before Star Trek, and when people still read the classics of the genre."
Write a positive review about a good book:.............................. I enjoyed this book very much and think it is a worthwhile read. My kids loved the adventure and the humor. The characters are quite well done. The picture book has a very sweet ending. There are not too many other good picture books for older children and adults and this is one that I will buy for them again. Highly recommended.

Write a positive review about a good book:  " I read this a while ago. I haven't finished it. I think I would love it more than it's really worth, but at the very least I'm going to read it again soon. I can't wait to see how the story ends and why things were the way they were."  -Grimm from The Biggest Loser "A short, funny and insightful collection of stories. Not a dry read, nor too much self-indulgence. The characters are funny and the plot, a bit simplistic.  There's also enough information to fill the time, with plenty of illustrations that were well placed and informative. An excellent read." -Kris from The Bookmark Site "I really loved this collection. I will be sure to recommend it to everyone I know and to many who haven't tried it yet. I read some of it several times because it is very fun and well written. I also really liked the illustrations. They really helped bring out the story.  The artwork was really well done and it made me love the characters even more. I highly recommend this book for any reader who enjoys humorous stories about funny and memorable characters. I know that I will have to keep rereading it." -Jodi from Geeks of a Feather "This book really is a must read. It is so incredibly funny, yet it also has a bit of wisdom to it. The book really doesn't need any more praise. I love the illustrations that show you all the details of these characters so well. This book is really amazing and I love it so much I can hardly wait for it to come out in paperback so I can give it to my son." -Linda from The Grumman Collection "Wow! This was a very fun book to read! I like the illustrations a lot and they really help to give you a good look into the characters. As for the story, I think it's a good one! I was really surprised and delighted when I found out there were still stories left to be written about these characters! It made me happy because I was pretty bored when I was finished reading." -Megan from Amazon "Well written and illustrated in a way that makes reading the book fun.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________________________________________________  The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is that I don't understand why the author has a hard time dealing with the problem of women in power. In the real world women are not equal to men. Women are allowed to be raped, but to make it legal is to treat women as second class citizens.  It would have been much easier to deal with this issue if the story had started in a parallel universe where women are truly equal to each other. ...  To conclude this review. My favorite character, and the one I had the most respect for was the male protagonist. He was a brave and decent man. The only thing that gave me a problem with the book was the fact that he was the most powerful person in the entire story. He is very arrogant but there are some interesting character traits. The main character was a good person, but he was flawed and had a very hard time handling the responsibilities of leadership. He did not like the fact the women were always treated as inferior to him. I liked the female characters that were involved in the story and I liked what I thought was a very strong and believable female antagonist. The book was well written.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book. I will definitely buy it again, and have already written my next one. Helpful when you need an idea for a story:  I really like this book and the characters. They are interesting and have many different kinds of interests and traits. The story is pretty unique and interesting, although it's definitely not perfect. The ending was so perfect.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________________ The main character is a good person. She is a bit of a nerd and hates sports, but that's what makes her the character. Her mother also loves her very much, and we see them in the story together. It's not like a typical love story. The mother really wanted to go to Paris to see her favorite singer there, but this made the character even more annoyed. She was tired of it. There is no doubt in my mind that this is the best book from this author I have read so far. It is very clear and concise. It can be read in 2 days, and I think that's really good. The characters are great. The book is about family, love, and happiness. I found myself so happy reading it.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________________________________________ I absolutely LOVE this book. I've read it a couple of times already, and I'm going to read it again right away.   I love the way it's written. It's a little fast-paced for my taste, but it's just so easy to keep the story up with the action. The plot is good, and not only does it make sense, it makes it real. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and yet at the same time, it has a lot of heart. The characters have personality, and it's fun to read. I especially loved the dialogue. All the people who speak to one another make you feel connected to them.  ...   If you can't stop yourself from giving this book 5 stars, you're doing something wrong!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am reading this now after having read it many years ago. There is nothing to compare it with. It is like having a whole new set of eyes seeing it from a new perspective. I had no idea of the depth of the work being done and the richness of the language. In fact, the novel is really a whole book, with a beginning, middle, and end. I can't wait to read more about the real events and the personal and social impact that it had on the author and his family.  - A.E. from California  Read the full review...
Write a positive review about a good book:    My father was my favorite teacher, and it was hard to get him to talk about the bible, since he is of Jewish ancestry. His mom had taken him to the local bibles store in Atlanta for a comparison. He found "Dictionary of the Bible," and after spending half an hour reading it, my dad decided it was time to talk to me. He said, "I'm going to tell you something. I didn't believe in Jesus. My father said, if he ever came to your house, you'd be his, but my father never said anything about Jesus." That really shook me up. I wasn't religious, so I was scared. My parents would get into a discussion about religion, and I thought I would be too. "So I didn My husband's family has a large Jewish community, and even though we are not religious, he wants me to have some experience with Judaism.  His grandmother on my mother's side was very religious. I don't know if I will ever be religious, and he is looking for information about how to approach people in a religious context, but since he wants to have a Jewish wedding, we want to go to a Jewish synagogue. The closest one is an hour away.  The rabbi recommended the Temple Bet Habeshah in the New York/Jersey city area for my wedding, and of course I knew there was a huge Jewish population in that area, but I also didn't really think about the huge size of New York. I figured it was like the rest of the states, there might be a couple Jews, or at least a few hundred. We drove up there for a little over two hours. The day of the wedding we waited for a full congregation. We were told it was filled, and so we waited. I was so nervous, and had so much to think about. I had a feeling of being alone, I had never been married to anyone who wasn't Jewish. I thought about having a bris, or shiva, where I would have to keep kosher, which is not a requirement for the marriage, but it was a ritual. I knew I had to tell the rabbi, and after about ten minutes of talking, I got a big smile, and said it was ok, I'm fine. I went out to my rehearsal dinner, and we sat together and had a drink together. I told him about the ritual and the fact that I was worried about
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found myself falling in love with this book, and with this author. I'm sure it would've been the same for someone else as well. There is a story, there is the setting, there are characters and it is written with the same style as the book you would find on a book shelf. This author is really great at describing life through her characters and their words.   This author really knows how to capture the emotions and essence of life. I know life can be dark, but I think we all can relate to the emotions of someone who feels like they have no control over their life. Thats the feeling I had reading this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  "The book is so well written it should have been called 'The Story of the Human Race.""  - Michael K. I. This is not what I expected to read.  This book takes a very basic concept and makes it into a fascinating and fascinatingly fascinating book about the human mind.  As a psychologist, and as someone who has devoted a great deal of my professional career to the understanding of human behavior (and of human brain development), I was skeptical when I first heard about this book.   But as I read through the book, I found myself drawn and excited to learn more about this fascinating topic.  I will not go into much detail here, but this book is a must-read for anyone interested in human brain research, or anyone who wants to understand how and why our minds and behaviors evolve over time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:............................................... "An excellent read. Very intelligent and well researched."  "The book I found the most useful to me was the second. The first was too complicated and the second not as interesting as the first. But the second was far better and that was the one I wanted to read.  The book was extremely useful." :  I loved the concept of this book: it showed that the modern world was not always so chaotic, that people were capable of planning their lives so that they would have the best chances of living, if they so wished, and that it was very possible to achieve such a goal even if it meant living without the use of most of the modern conveniences. The book shows how such a lifestyle might work, it also illustrates how the world has evolved in the last few centuries.   The author shows how this new lifestyle is feasible by examining a variety of different situations which illustrate how people manage to live without modern conveniencies. He gives examples of some famous people who have taken such a life style: Henry Ford and Henry Kissinger.  . It gives detailed descriptions of how such lifestyles work. This was a very good book to read to get a better understanding about the topic. The author does a very thorough job of explaining all the various steps necessary to create a complete self-sufficient life.
Write a positive review about a good book:..........................I read this book for about a month and it has made me a bit of a feminist. I love the way it teaches us women to care about our health and look after ourselves. It's a quick read, and it made me think and feel about things I didn't before. This is not a feminist book in any way shape or form, but it shows us how much more we really need to talk about and fight about the issues that affect all women. I'm not a medical professional, but I know that the health of women is in many ways directly linked to our ability to be a good mother. I also feel that the more women have access to contraception, the more likely they are to get pregnant, stay at home with the children, and have a good life. I was excited to learn that this is a feminist novel, and I think that's what makes it so great."  Feminist Book Review  "An important book, and an important feminist book, at that." -Tania Carrión-Diaz  Winner of the 2017 Hugo Award for Best Novel  A brilliant, terrifying tale of the ways women have been forced into a perpetual state of child-like dependence.   When we meet the beautiful and manipulative Ella, she's the kind of woman who lives for the moment—taking joy in the pleasure of being alone, the rush of pleasure in making an entrance, and even the agony of being abandoned. Ella is a narcissist's narcissist, who believes her self-aggrandizement is the way to happiness, and is able to manipulate her way into the life of anyone who will take her seriously.   The woman who becomes Ella's muse is Lidia, who is beautiful and talented and willing to put in the hours and hours of hard work needed to win the attention of men. When she realizes how little her own desires matter to men, she decides to take matters into her own hands. This story explores what it means to be loved, and how it can change a person.   with its unique style, gorgeous prose, and smart questions, this is one book that readers will want to pick up again and again, as it illuminates a world that they'll be curious to understand more."

Write a positive review about a good book: _______________ I read this book in July 2008. After reading the first three pages, I was immediately hooked. It's about the life of a young boy growing up in the '30s. His grandfather and great-grandfather were very important to the history of Europe during the early '20s, and the story of his life was fascinating. It had a lot of historical detail, with lots of details of important people in his family. The main character, Harry, is not the most obvious choice for a hero. He's a little quiet, but very caring, and he's a great role model for other kids. I really liked the way his father, the first of three, talks to him about all kinds of subjects, and how he never shies away from talking about the difficult times in his life. His mother, Ruth, is a bit more'macho' than he is, but she's so kind and gives him good advice. I found the writing really good, and I liked that it was all narrated by the young boy himself. I could picture everything he was saying and feeling. I felt the plot was a little strange to me, but I liked the characters so much I did not care. Overall, I think this is a good read for children. It is very short, though it is only 250 pages. It gets to the beginning of a child's life in the 1930s. The characters are the right age, and they make the story really interesting. I recommend this book to any child.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- A little over a year ago I was living in Southern California and taking a semester off, when I decided I wanted to write a book. The year before I was working on a short story and a couple short novels and never had the desire to get serious about any of them. This was the first book I had ever written, so I had a lot to learn. It took me a year and a half to work it out, but I'm glad I did, because the book is wonderful. There is so much action and so much character development. If you read the book, I think you will enjoy it as much as I did.   I am just finishing up the first page of this book and it's a great page. This is the sort of book where I will finish and I will not put it down. This book is amazing and I am looking forward to reading the next one in this series.
Write a positive review about a good book:      I have read all of the books I needed to read in my lifetime. They have provided me with a great framework that I use on a daily basis. This is a great book that helps you to become the person you want to be. Read an amazing book: This book is truly something special. In my opinion, it has been written by a person who has lived a life he wants. I have found myself drawn to his story and it has made me really think about my own life. It is the perfect gift for the people in your life. Did not enjoy the book: There are some parts that seem to have been done to a fault, but the more I read the more that makes sense. I would highly recommend this book and read it again. What the rating system is for this book: I give the book five stars, as I believe it was written with the best of intentions. Three Stars What you'll learn by reading this book This book shows you how you can learn anything if you have the desire to do so. It also shows you a way to be successful in whatever area you choose to pursue. Why you should read it This is the first book on how to become successful in any area you want. I feel this is something every person should have read. In my opinion a great read The book has some faults. The first is that it doesn't go into enough detail about what is considered to be an important life skill. I understand there is a book to read about being a good person but the one in this book is missing a big part of what makes a good human being. This book only talks about the key points to becoming successful in the areas they mention. It doesn't discuss how to deal with failures and how to get rid of fear of failure. I would still recommend it for anyone who is interested in becoming more successful and the only reason I gave it three stars is because it is not complete.

I would say that it has a more academic tone. Although the book is written from the point of view of the characters in it, it is still a very entertaining read. I have had a hard time getting my old book of the day off my mind, but I will try to remember these books and try to reread them soon.... This is good stuff, I'd highly recommend it

Write a positive review about a good book: __________   This book is very good. It is a bit long but I can see how it is intended to be used. It has some nice things that I have not seen before. I think it is the best introduction into how the military and what it does. The way the book is put together is very nice as it breaks the book into 3 parts.   Part I  In this part, he tells about the history of the military, what it is, how it functions, what goes on in it, and how it relates to the civilian world. Part I is not all that long, about an hour. It really has all the basic things that you would need to know about the military.   The author spends some time on the different types of military equipment. They are the M1 Carbine, M16, the M4, the Mk 17 and Mk 19 tanks and M113 troop transport vehicles. He goes into detail on all of these but he also spends time on other military vehicles like the Stryker and C-130. He has pictures of all of them as well. All of the types of vehicles have names as well as pictures and some are very funny. For example, the stryker is a Humvee that can carry up to 60 people but cannot do much of anything at all. He also spends some extra time describing the equipment that the troops wear. He shows how each uniform is different from the other. The Marine Corps uniform is the least formal and has a high collar. The Army uniform is more formal than the Marine but the overall effect is the same.   Part II  This part deals with the civilian side of things. He takes a little look at how the U.S. Military works. In particular he focuses on the role of women in the military that have been there for decades but are now coming in droves. The military has been trying to get women into combat roles but with no success so far. This part covers the various positions women can go into and the various skills they are capable of. He even looks at how women are able to enter the military in certain areas of the country. It covers a lot of the basic jobs that they have and then some. Overall I really enjoyed this part. I would not go as far to say this is the end of the book but I really felt that I got a better idea of the world that the military operates in. I like that he shows a

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________________________________The main theme for me is that I have a strong bias for horror. I always enjoy reading about a creepy situation, a sinister place, a dark person, and a tragic event. Even though most of the books on this list are dark and scary, none of them are just the usual 'torture room' story. The first book in this series, which is called 'In the Darkness', is a brilliant and original horror series. I loved the idea of being the prisoner in a 'tomb', as well as the suspense of a suspenseful situation. The final book of the series, 'The Devil's Door', was a great twist on the suspense story. I have heard from many people who enjoyed the books, who felt the horror was even stronger in the later books, so I give this series 4 of 5 stars for the series.

Write a positive review about a good book: *********** I read this book in July 2017. I am new to the field of addiction and this was a great introduction for me to the subject. I've learned so much from it and I encourage anyone who feels the same way to do the same. The author takes a step back from the usual high-intensity sobriety stuff, explains that there is no one solution for everyone, and talks about how recovery is not a one-size-fits-all-type of treatment. I thought the book was well-written and I enjoyed the chapters about her own personal experience as a recovering addict. The book also covers a lot of the issues that come up for people, including what to do with family members of addicts. I highly recommend this book and would highly recommend to anyone who wants to know more about the various types of addiction treatment.

It is definitely the funniest, most enjoyable, most well-written, and most creative book I have read this year. The characters are great and I love the way they were written! The way that the narrator goes into their character's heads and is able to describe them with such a vividness that makes the character seem real is very clever. I especially love the part where the character was trying to take a shower and the narrator describes what a good shower smells like. I also thought that the book is interesting and different from anything that I have seen before. " It's like a picture book and a movie crossed with a graphic novel. "
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a well-researched overview of the history of the Jewish diaspora, which is, to my mind, a unique story from the very beginning of mankind's history.  The book gives readers a glimpse into how Jewish people have always found themselves in exile from their own land and people, and why, for some time, Jewish people had to struggle to find their way back home again.   Jewish history is a fascinating one, and I highly recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________ This is a very good, solid book. It does a great job explaining the basic mechanics of the game without getting too advanced. I got into it a few months ago and have been getting better. If you're looking for a good introductory text on the rules, this is it. If I were starting out, I'd buy it right away. (Posted by David R.)
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book for the first time and I liked it. I feel that this book has not gotten enough recognition. The narrator is superb. I liked his voice and what he says. I did not like how he was so casual in some things and he was pretty much saying the same thing over and over. But I enjoyed the book.   Rating: 3.5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------ "I was quite upset with the book, in fact the entire experience left me in a foul mood, because it seemed to be something more than a simple "how to lose weight" book that would be good for those who want to lose the weight (I know, I know - that's the book I read - I'm not very good at judging how to do this stuff and there's more to weight loss than "eating less", but it's better than nothing right?)" -- I'm glad I didn't read it... -- A review by a woman who read the book: ------------------------------------- "This was not a book I expected to read, but I did, and loved it. I didn`t expect much from it, but this book is really good, and it will help you lose weight." -- Read it. Enjoy it. It's free. -- I read it twice - this time, because I'm reading a book in 3 parts and it took me 3 days to finish. But this time I didn t enjoy it the second time around. The first time I felt so dumb and stupid, and now I realize that I was in fact being dumb and silly. - I think I would have had to start reading the book again after this second readjustment - which was bad enough. But I'm thinking about buying the book now. - Don't get the book if you are overweight, and especially not if you can't lose the extra weight yourself, and for God`s sake, get off your fat butt and do the hard thing. - This book makes you think that your lifestyle has nothing to do with the fact that you are fat. You have a diet and exercise plan to lose your weight, so why not do it the right way? - I was shocked to read that if I lost weight and didn't do cardio I wouldn't lose more than 2 pounds a week - I've gained weight and still have more than 20 pounds to lose. I still have hope, I think that I can do it. -- My friend says the book is a "treatise on the stupidity of people who try to lose extra weight". - The author uses the "sugar vs protein" argument too often. - The book is written in such a "I'm telling you, just because" way that you get the impression that it is about what people should be doing. -- The "I could eat as much candy as I wanted" part of the book did
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------  The book is brilliant. It shows the way out of all the ills of the western world.   The most obvious and easy thing to do is take the money and run and leave the country. It is not in our DNA to work and produce, it is an instinct. It comes from our earliest memories, in a way of being a member of a tribe. We cannot help it. The average family is better off than it was fifty years ago. I am sure that most of you would like a big house with a backyard but it is hard to afford it and the time it takes to go through all the work to make it happen. That is why the rich pay their taxes and we do not, because we live and do not produce. That was the case in the 70s. I believe in the book, and believe that it will save our country.   and why should you not read it? --------------

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________________________________________________________ I was really looking forward to this book. I read a lot of short stories. I enjoy the genre, but I've never read a book that's all about it. There was a lot to like here, from the main character to the setting. I really liked the ending. I also liked that the author didn't leave it up to the readers to decide who's "right." I felt like I knew who was right. I'm so glad that my high hopes were not dashed. _________________________________________________________________________________ I've loved reading about a person (her or him or both) who becomes something they are not: a different person (or person) who finds a way to live their life in ways that they can't even imagine. It's an adventure in being yourself, finding your voice. It is a quest for understanding yourself and for finding who you are. ------------------------- My review of this book is one of "Wow." It's been some time since I read anything I couldn't recommend highly. I was excited to find a book like this one. I've been reading a lot on self-development recently, and some things I've read are pretty darn good. I love the "How to Find Your Voice" article in The Art of Manliness, the Self Development Bookshelf Blog. I loved the books by Tim Ferriss, Dan Harris and James Clear, and I've really been liking the Self-Development blog for a few months now. That's all coming from someone who's been in self-help for a while. In the spirit of all that good stuff, I wanted to say that I enjoyed this book just as much as it did me. The author, Michelle Pye, does a wonderful job of sharing things from the life of a "nosey" person (yes, I included myself in this category. I used to do a lot for the nosey people). Her stories are funny and touching. She does a great job of showing us the fun and the struggles of what it's like to be a nosey person. She also shows us the importance of taking time to be ourselves and taking some things to heart. That is exactly what it was like to me. I did take some things from this book to heart, but not many. My life has been a big change from the last time I took a few moments to do it. But even then I didn't take it all to heart as I am still learning and learning

Write a positive review about a good book: __________   In this book I found the details are very interesting. I just like it very much.  For instance, in the book, it shows that the English people are very good at being in war. I think, there are more men and women who died in war than men. For example, I know a man who was killed in the last war (World War II) that he was a great lover.  and I heard that the first man in America who was in the trenches of the war. 'I killed men, and I killed boys.'   It also tells the stories about many people who are still living in Britain. It was very interesting to hear what they did. I also read the book about the first woman who was married to a man.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ My daughter enjoyed reading this book. It has a good plot, some humor, and it's pretty good to read. This is a fun book.  Write a negative review about poor book: ______ _________ The plot was a bit confusing for me, since I don't know a thing about the history of the game. So it took me a while to get what the hell was going on, and I think it would have been better if it was broken up into 2 or 3 chapters. However, once I got the gist of the story, it was pretty good. I do not like that there's some violence in this book, since there are no actual humans. It seems that the world is ruled by a group of evil people, and there are some real humans that fight back against this evil group of people, but they don't seem to have much effect on the evil group. I would have enjoyed the book more if there was more information on the history, but there are so many questions left unanswered that I really can't really judge this book as being too bad. It's an interesting and fun read!  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I loved this book! It had a little bit of everything in it. I liked the idea of being a ghost. I thought it was awesome how they went into detail about the afterlife. I didn't know what heaven was until about halfway through the book. I do enjoy books that give the reader a bit of history about the world and history of the world before they are born, or after they are. I also liked that they were not only realistic but they were also very well written. I loved the idea that they are trying to take us to a different world, a place we can relate to. I am from the Midwest, and it was nice to see a book written for people in our area that didn't have a lot of information to give. I don't know how I would write one myself, but I do like the idea!

Write a positive review about a good book:..............................."Dedicated to all the women on the battlefield that gave their lives to keep this country safe................................................."  Award winning journalist, author and editor, Jennifer Smith, has covered wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. Her work focuses on conflict resolution and how women are shaping the future of war.  When I was first given the task of writing the introduction for this book, I was very nervous. I have been covering war for nearly 30 years now, and I have interviewed more than 4,000 women who served in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and other places. I had spent countless hours talking with women and families on the frontlines, as well as getting a bird's eye view from above and below. I was well aware of what I was getting myself into when I started this project. After much contemplation, I decided to write the introduction because I believe that these women are not only important to the history of the war in Afghanistan and Iraq, but because of the effect they are having on our own military and civilian leadership. These women are leading change and making changes in a way that would not have been possible prior to September 11th. The women in this book are the unsung heroes of our time. I would highly recommend this book for any woman who wants to learn more about the women in war, and for any man who wants a deeper understanding of the issues that are affecting our country. The introduction will provide an introduction to the author's background and to the women featured in the book. The author then explores the contributions and perspectives of the women, and why each woman is important to our future. The conclusion will discuss some of the current and future implications of our military's reliance on women. I have also included excerpts from the book to give readers a better understanding of these stories. Below is a summary of the introduction that I would recommend reading.   "At the beginning of the Afghanistan war in 2001, the United States had a huge deficit to pay for its involvement. So for the next decade, the war took a back seat to more important national priorities. The Taliban was driven out of power in 2001. As a result, the U.S. began to focus on the fight against Al Qaeda. And as the terrorist threat spread in 2001 to Afghanistan, there were an increasing number of U..S.-backed forces in the country to protect against the Taliban. That meant that a growing number of American women became part of
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________________________________ 1.5 stars I would give this book a higher rating if I could. The story is fantastic! I'm glad that there is a chance to be told in a more realistic way the life of a child prostitute. However, the book's narrator, "Linda" is a terrible narrator. It's like she's speaking to a 3 year old or a 4 year old. She has no feel for tone or cadence, and I'd say a lot of her lines are almost comical (like when she's recounting her childhood and her mother's reaction to her behavior), and then there's the very funny "silly" things that the characters say (or act out). The last third of the book (there is a section about the baby that seems to be very much like one of the first two thirds) gets quite boring to listen to, and there is no suspense. The ending of the novel, though it's wonderful, feels very forced. I think that "Lest" has been written for someone who is a little more knowledgeable in prostitution than me and who is more comfortable with "real" prostitution and how it works. That's fine, but there are enough good things that make me want to give the book 4 stars. Overall, I think there is more than enough in this book to make it worth the read, but I'd have to read it several more times to give it a more perfect score.
Write a positive review about a good book:  It has been awhile since I've read a story that has stayed with me in such an intense way.  The setting of the story is an urban setting where vampires are a common occurrence.    The main character of the novel is an intelligent and beautiful woman and I can see her being in an abusive relationship at times, but I really enjoyed the relationship.  I did like how the romance didn't go from light to heavy and the story continued after the end of the relationship, especially as it started to have more weight with the characters and the characters themselves didn't take the love that was given to them lightly.  This book was not for everyone, but the romance was strong and the book was full of heartache and loss but I can't help but be excited for what is to come from the second book in the series.  My Review:   My favorite part of this book was the love and bond that was developed between the main character and her vampire friend.  It was sweet and the friendship was strong enough that you could see that the characters were really good friends and that they cared for each other.    The romance, though very strong, was never too long and that was a good thing.    So, if you like vampires, have a strong female character and really want to see what happens to the main characters in the next book of the series then you will really like this book.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I read this book about two weeks ago and thought it was excellent. It's about a scientist who finds an interesting mathematical formula but wants to figure out how to use it so it could be applied to medical research. The book also describes the scientific breakthrough that happened as a result of this breakthrough. I would highly recommend this book, however, it is not for those who have read a lot of math, like me. If you're one of those people and want to brush up on math to find your calling, this book is a must read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I'm an avid reader of all genres of fiction, particularly those with a paranormal angle. I can say that the book has a lot of potential and I look forward to reading more from you. " The "Eternal Flame" is a powerful book about the world of the occult. I have been reading it for about a week now and it really shows it's potential. I love the magic that this book presents and how it's used in the world and how that relates to real world things. The magic in this book is amazing and the characters in this world are interesting and intriguing. The book is very well written and I found the writing style easy to read, although it is a little slow at times. The story is full of mystery and I'm eager to read more about the magic system in this universe. This is my second book from D.A. Powell and the second to be an audiobook, the first was the "Fires of Heaven" by Michael Moorcock. If you enjoy magic and intrigue you will enjoy this book and listen to it in the near future. Thank you D. A. Powell, for giving us this amazing story. "In the City of the Gods, the gods are everywhere. Every breath you take is like breathing air for them. They walk the Earth and each breath takes you deeper into their realms. Their presence is in everything, from the water to the rocks and every creature on it, yet they are nowhere to be seen. There is one god who has his home in the mountains in a tower of ice that is more than 4,000 feet tall. His name is Vayar, but you can call him "The White God." His palace is built over a pool of light. His people have no knowledge of his name. You can never meet a god. You only see them. The gods speak in riddles and mysteries, telling people who is going to die next and who will live forever. Sometimes they have secrets and sometimes they don't, or don't want to tell you. But whatever it is, the divine power they hold is great. They make the winds blow and the rain fall. They are the creators of the mountains, the stars and the sun. They give you great wealth and wisdom. They don't ask for anything in return. Vayara is known for one thing. You must not go near the White God. It is a curse, but so is the sun and the water

I love the world building, the characters, the story and the mystery. I liked how the main character went through a great change and overcame. There were no words, just emotion. The character of the main villain was just so much better. His motives were interesting. I thought he was a very well-developed villain. I loved his thoughts on the world and the people in it. I think his motivation was that he thought that he had to do something for the world. He had to save his planet. He was a good guy who did something wrong.I felt like I really got into this book, and it made me think. I was able to relate to the characters and the setting. I felt like it was a true love story with two people in love. I read the ending, and felt like there was a great twist at the end.I liked how this was a first person viewpoint.

I appreciated the story telling and I was satisfied with the way I felt when I finished this book and I look forward to reading more.

I was excited when I read this one because there were so many elements that were familiar and new. I could imagine myself saying, 'Hey, that's William J Grishams writing' and I would be totally right.  .I enjoyed the setting of the book very much. The narrator kept me engaged from the first page. It wasn't until the last chapter that I really got into it. It took me a couple of chapters to understand some of the things he was talking about, but once I did, it was a wonderful book.   beep beep  Thanks for this review. I'm happy to say I love the writing in this book as much as the other Grishamp books. I'll keep reading more.   in fact, I just found the first chapter, in which the narrator's name is George. It turns out he and the narrator (I think it was William) were friends, and the title of the first book is George Grishame's "The Good Soldier"

Write a positive review about a good book:  this book has many great chapters. I especially liked the "How to Win Friends and Influence People" section that explains how to get a lot of attention from people while at the same time appearing to not be a complete asshole. I have read a lot about how to win friends and influence people and this book is a great resource.  I highly recommend it.  3)  The Book of Lies :  As one of the only books that I've read that covers the topic of persuasion from a psychological and evolutionary perspective, this book should be required reading for anyone with an interest in social influence and social influence methods.   This book is an excellent introduction to how people really operate in groups.  In the book, Professor Robert B. Cialdini explains how human beings actually act, communicate and think in very different ways than the way they are usually represented by science.  Cialdui shows how people will have different reactions when you present a situation to them and will adjust their behavior to match the situation.  He shows how our brains have a lot in common with a social insect, a spider and how we react to situations that could put our own lives at risk.  The author also discusses how the social insects that use social influence will always do so in a way that is both effective and efficient, without ever changing their behavior for any other reason.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in how we manipulate others and how to manipulate them effectively.  4)  " The Game of Life " by Dan Ariely :  A brilliant book about the psychology of human behavior that has an amazing level of depth and detail.  Arieley shows that our behavior is largely driven by the social structures that we find ourselves in and that we tend to behave in the ways that make us most comfortable.  This is a brilliant book that shows you just how much control you have over your life and how little you really know about your own actions.   5) " The Power of Habit " by Charles Duhigg :   Another classic in the field of behavioral science. Duhig uses the science of habit to illustrate why you can change your behavior if you are determined enough to do it.   6) " How We Decide " by Michael C. Dorsey:   Another great book on the science and psychology of decisions.   Dorsey demonstrates the importance of both gut feeling and decision making in making good decisions. 
Write a positive review about a good book: ******** My second book from the author of the best selling "The Art of Writing." This is the first book I have read that is not on the paranormal, and the other one I have just finished reading was the first one. This one takes place on the East coast, in an old barn, with the owner as the main character. The story follows a small group of people, who go to the barn with a group of ghosts they meet. This story is quite interesting. I found the characters a little too one-dimensional, as they are just in it for the money. But the story is definitely interesting.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "A lot of the information in this book is new to me, and I thought it would be interesting to have this sort of guide to use while I am learning about some of the history behind the United States. I did not learn everything that is in the book, but I am glad that I had it, and it has had a great impact on me. The writing is very good and the information is very interesting. I learned a lot that I did NOT know and it was helpful." "This is a great overview of the events that shaped the US and it's leaders. I'd like to see some new historical info on other topics but overall it's a great resource that is worth buying." The following quotes are taken directly from the book: "During the Civil War, the Confederate States of America was known as the Confederate Empire. Although it was not the first government to recognize the Confederacy in the nation's history, it was the first to use it as a military force, the first Union government to accept it as such, the largest secessionist force in the country during the Civil Rights Movement, and the first governmental body to recognize and respect slavery. This book explores these histories and more, with a focus on the Civil Wars in the South. It explains why many politicians and historians regard the Confederates as the true patriots of the Confederacy, but why many others see them as traitors who betrayed the United South." "'Tremendous progress' has been made on the Reconstruction efforts in the US, says former president. Yet a few key areas, such as the economic crisis and racism, continue to be issues." 'The United States' political leaders have not had their best interest in mind all these years. They have tried to put their political interests before the nation, and have used their power to manipulate public opinion. This has led to a number of important issues getting swept under the rug, like the assassination of President Lincoln, and a great deal of controversy about other issues such as women's rights, civil rights, racial equality, and education.' "America's political leaders often act like they have to prove to themselves that they are worthy of a place at the table. This leads to many issues like the Cold War, which led to the arms race. This led to nuclear arms, and then the War on Terror, and now the War Against ISIS. The fact that there has never been a clear, definitive resolution on a number important issues of

Write a positive review about a good book:    I got into reading science fiction/fantasy after getting a hardback book of John Norman's Chronicles of the Amber Throne ( which i enjoyed). This is an updated and expanded version of that. The only difference is that it is written from the point of view of a boy who has grown up since the original books, and is much more grown up and adult. This book is written with a wonderful amount of humor in it. The characters are real, and the writing is very good, although i wish it could have been a little more in depth, but i have no complaints about this book. I like the way the author has expanded the story so that the original series could be easily integrated into it. If i ever get into writing books, i will definitely be giving this series a read. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a light hearted book about childhood, or just a good read in general.  3 of 3 people found this review helpful

I am not a fan of history as a subject and have spent several years researching the Spanish conquest of Mexico and the Mexican-American War, but the Spanish-American war and the Spanish influence on the U.S. Civil War are too much to ignore. The stories told in this book are interesting, the research is meticulous and the writing is very clear. I will be recommending this book to all my history students. I also read a review that said it was written for the average reader and that is not the case at all. I think this book is the best of it's kind and it's a must read for anyone interested in the history of America. I received this book free for reviewing.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________ I love this book. It is a little different for me. I have always enjoyed reading historical fiction with the historical accuracy. When I started to read about the War for Independence I thought this is more historical fiction, not historical fact. However after the book I realized that is is not a fact. The author has been researching this story. It has been a great read. I think that a history book will be required for every reader.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very well written and interesting and will probably give you some ideas. The author writes like an expert and his ideas on money management are really solid. A must-have book.  I would give it 5 stars if it came in a hardcover.  My Review:   I really enjoyed this book and I enjoyed reading it. I am not a big believer in the self-help book world, but I read this one.   As someone who is in the financial industry and working on my own financial goals, I liked the ideas the author was bringing.  Money Management, by Daniel Pink is not for the faint-of-heart. It is very challenging, and very interesting.  The author also has an interesting way of presenting his ideas.  He describes the situation for his life in the way that he would describe it in a lecture. He uses the past as a way to tell the future. He says he needs to keep an open mind and not only look for the "short-term fix".   The book is a bit confusing at the beginning, but this is to be expected. It will take some time to figure out what he is trying to say.  At first, you might be a little confused. You might have a hard time with how he does his thinking. But, if you can stick with it, you will find yourself making progress.  After you do make progress, you should realize that this book really is about living your life, not about the stock market. 
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  A beautiful, haunting, and deeply satisfying book.   I love this book. I love this author. I just love this story. I have cried like a baby when reading this.   The main character is a girl named Sam. She is an ordinary girl who has an extraordinary ability. She can see ghosts and the things that come from the dead. She travels from house to house trying to figure out the secret of her powers. In the course of her adventure she gets caught in a tragic accident. The accident not only kills her but also her parents. Sam is then sent to live with her Uncle Tom. Tom is a farmer who can see and hear things in the other world. They are living on the land of Fable.  :s   The main character was such a beautiful character. I really loved her. I always wanted to know more about her. Her life story was so well written. I loved the fact that she kept trying to convince her Uncle to let her leave Fable as she has grown. Tom told her that it was a very dangerous place and that she had to grow up fast. She had to learn to survive. Sam tried to make him understand that she was not the crazy person that he thought she was.   the story was well written and the book was beautifully written. The narration was so clear, natural, and beautiful. There were times when I was just smiling and laughing. The author did a really good job in creating a very well written book.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________ I have been looking for this book for a long time. A friend had it and my husband had heard a friend talk about it. It's about two people who fall in love during a trip to the Caribbean. It would have made an excellent movie or book series. I think it would have been the perfect ending to the Lost series or at least made it possible for the series to continue. The story would have continued on with the crew of the M.S. Bounty and Jack and Rebecca would have had some time on the island. If you are interested in reading more books by Peter Orullian I would recommend you to his other series - The Secret History of James Bond.  What did you like about this book?

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is a very good read. I enjoyed it very much. The narrator is a bit stiff at times and could use some work, but that wasn't a big deal. There are a few moments in the beginning where the character does not really sound like a person (not saying that she is a bad person but there was some stiffness in some lines) but by the end the reader should be able to read her very well. I think that a good narrator can make the difference between a good story and a bad story. I am definitely looking forward to the second book in the series 10 of 13 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:    "There is a strong message in this book and it is that one must be courageous, willing to take risks, but also understanding the value of all of our relationships. If I am able to do those things, then I am capable of being my authentic self, and my life is richer."   The author is not just telling a story but also being open about his own struggles. He is honest about how he felt at times while also making sure that people can relate to his story. I was inspired to read this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:................................. This book is a great read! It is very informative and very informative to have a book so I can get more knowledge about my body and to know where I can take care of it and have the best chances. I also appreciated the explanations that are given by the author. The author also gave me some things about how I can increase my body's natural abilities and not have to put too much work. I especially liked how the author also provides some helpful things I can do for my body so I may be able to live a long, healthy life and be able enjoy it all my life! My favorite section of the book is about your body's immune system. I am on anti-viral drugs but I think the immune system may be a good one to get to keep my body strong. I was very impressed with how the body's reactions to toxins is discussed too!  My favorite section is the "Health and Body" chapter. It's interesting that most people do not take care about the health of their body, it's very good that the author teaches about it.  I was able to follow this book through. It is so easy to follow. It explains in great detail everything you need to know about the human body. I have been a reader of medical books and magazines before so I could follow the content in the book very easily. Also I'm not a fan of a lot of information that's written in a general manner. It would be better if the author could give some information in a way to be very easy to understand.  on the positive side... The last part of the story is an excellent example of how health care should be for a person. The medical care is provided very well by the doctors in this book, the only problem is that a lot people may think a little later that their doctor didn't do it properly. A lot of people might not take the book seriously but if they take it in a serious way and read a few pages more they will understand what the author is saying. I liked the "How to make your body stronger" chapter so much that I bought it twice! Also I liked that the story of the girl who was diagnosed with HIV and was treated with antibiotics was presented. I like a lot about this book and I believe it will be an essential resource for any girl/woman who wants to learn how to live healthy. It may take time to read it all, but the knowledge it provides will definitely pay off

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  My love affair with the classics came full circle: the first time I read this novel, I wasn't sure what to think about it. It was dark and gritty and it looked a lot like an old fashioned hardboiled crime novel, which I'm not fond of in terms of being a "classic". Then I read some more and fell in love. I'd also like to thank the translator, who did an outstanding job on such a tricky job. She's got a huge heart, and it shines through every line, and I'd recommend this book to anybody who enjoys hard-boiled detective stories.
Write a positive review about a good book:!!!This book was soooo much fun, funny, insightful and made me appreciate the beauty and the fragility of the human spirit. I learned so much from the characters, and all of them will probably change my life. The way the author captured and portrayed the emotions of the characters was very unique and well done, I don't think I could've ever achieved anything like it on my own. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a story of love and human nature.

I think the characters are great, the world is rich, and the story is exciting and entertaining. If you're interested in what happens with the human race, this is an excellent book.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ What a great book. It helped me to realize how difficult it is to talk to women about sex and to understand their needs and desires. _________ I also learned about how many women have fantasies that are very different from my own. ___________________ I was so happy that you shared your experience with us. It was very informative and helped me. ___________________________________________________________________ I am a married woman who has been married for 16 years. We have two daughters aged 6 and 4. We also have a son, who is 3. My husband has never had a problem with his wife's masturbation and now he doesn't want to hear about it at all. It makes me very angry sometimes that I have to try so hard to convince him to be a little less permissive. He doesn't listen to me at all anymore and I can't tell him that he has to listen to what I say. He is so stubborn. ______________________________ My husband used to masturbate but it was so boring. I found your book and I was shocked that he doesn`t get it at ALL.  It`s a real eye opener. ___________________________________________________ We have been married 16 years and are married for good. We love each other but we don't see each other at all often. His wife used to sleep with other men in the past and now she only wants to be with her husband and she is married and pregnant.    She has made him feel guilty that he loves and respects his wife but he cannot help it anymore and can`t help it from his side either. She is a beautiful and beautiful woman.  I am a 38 year old white male who lives in a small town. I love women. I've never had sex with a woman, never had an orgasm, only had one-night stands. I started masturbating when I was 17 because that was when I first realized I could get off. I didn't understand that women could orgasm and get off and also that it wasn't a weakness or something I should feel guilty about. I used to think it was wrong to have sex with men since women were supposed to be pure, holy, and innocent. I thought the idea of sex between men was disgusting. I still think that way but with time I've become more mature and it's not something I feel guilty for. I'm not ashamed of it and it doesn't change me. I know what it is like to be attracted to a
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book and the author does a good job at keeping it simple. The only things that are a bit confusing are the numbers for the people, time, and numbers for events. It should be explained to those who are new to the book. I also would have liked to know more about the different people in the book and their origins. They seemed to be random. However, I found some good information in them. I would have loved to see where they were from or how they were related. If there was more of a personal relationship with the people in this book, that would have made it more enjoyable for me.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "Barry B. Benson's [The New Book] is not a book about why people die. It's a book that discusses why people live. This book explores some of the key facets of life, including the purpose of being alive. While a few of the books in this field are great in nature, they are rarely personal in their scope and purpose. Benson gives us a well-researched, thought-provoking, and well-written book that offers some of what it means to be alive. I'm glad I read this book."   The New Life is a book for anyone who has ever wondered if they have a purpose in life. It is a classic that is both entertaining and educational. This is a must have book for every person.   I've read a lot of life books. I've read about success, love, the meaning of life. I read about love, about finding happiness and about how to be happy.  .   in this book, the author asks the reader a question:   What does life have to offer?  How much of our life are we really alive for? "In the first chapter of The New Life, he asks the question: What does life, or life itself, have to teach us?" (from the author's website)   Benson presents a "Life Plan".  He proposes that, instead of focusing on happiness and achieving things we don't want, we focus on things we want and do, for reasons we want. We can accomplish things we may not have thought about in the past.   for example, you might have never been interested in pursuing a career you didn't want to pursue, or you might only want a career that has nothing to do with what you actually enjoy.  That is okay. 's are all human and we all want more from life than what we feel we are getting.   the key to our life purpose  The answer to this question is a Life Plan. . The question is, What is it that is important in life that has a purpose? If we do the hard work and do what we truly want, this will lead to a happy, productive, and meaningful life.

Write a positive review about a good book: *********************   A wonderful read with an important message to children. A great read for a bedtime story to keep in the car while you're in your own world. This book is perfect for a classroom or for a rainy day drive.   In fact, my son and I had a very similar experience one day on our way home from the library. We were headed back to my home and he asked if I could take him to the library and read one of the books that were in the back of the car. This was one of those things that he knew was for sure something he wanted to read! So I gave him a choice to get his book or to take me to the car and get it. He opted to take him and he's a 4 year old!   When we got to the park and the little boys were climbing over logs trying to get the log that was falling right at them. He asked if he could take his friend to the playground. They decided on the playground instead of the log. The story is so good and simple it made my children both laugh and cry. I don't think it's for everyone, but it's just for kids that need to be quiet and to let go of all the noise they're so accustomed to. It's not easy to let your mind wander, but this book did a wonderful job at helping my kids realize that, when they need to, they can be quiet.  .I know it's very hard to read, and some adults may feel that my children might be "reading" when they do this. But, they're only reading, not making a sound. I really recommend this book to any family because of the beautiful writing and the simple messages.  10 of 11 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great little read, it's like a cross between A Canticle for Leibowitz and a Harry Potter book. It was well written and the author had fun with it.   It was very refreshing to read something like this. I have never read a story about a teenager who likes being with her friends and living in her house and having friends. This is the first one that did this to me.  , July 28, 2011I have to say I'm glad I finally picked up this book! I have heard so many people rave about the book and have been waiting for a chance to read it. Now that it is out, it really did bring back so many memories of my teenage years and my friends.It was not only a story of a young girl, but a story that had to be read with a young boy in mind. The character development was great and I hope they will expand on this in the sequel.

Write a positive review about a good book:   The Good:  I can finally read it all. This story takes place in 1871 during the Civil War, with the focus on the North, where a group of women are called the "Black Widows" due to the fact that they were the only women among their menfolk. They're the only people the Confederate soldiers will fight if need be.  These women, and their men, are constantly in the frontline during the entire war. The men take them as wives and the women as sex slaves. This book will appeal to anyone who enjoyed the historical books on Civil War history. This one is no slouch. . I really enjoyed this book. I didn't understand all the language, but I found the characters interesting and they brought a good balance to the conflict. This is a good story to learn more about a real war. -E.J.

I think the only complaint I have is that the authors didn't do anything with the ending to save themselves the hassle of explaining it. They could have done some things with it, too, like maybe they had a happy ending in mind, and didn't want to leave that hanging. That would be awesome. I guess I'll just have to wait for an update if anyone wants to read a sequel.

Recommend it. ------------------------- [Very good.

And I was looking for something that would be similar and then this book came along, so I bought it. The story is what it is, and I like it, although I wish there was a bit more going on. The characters are so good and well done. I can understand what Kirk is going through. This story was a perfect introduction to Star Trek for me. But the book does have a few hiccups and has a little bit of bad writing. --------------- [This book is an excellent introduction to the Trek universe, and an excellent read.] -D. A.

In the first-person account of the attack and the rescue of the crew, we find the story of the most famous starship in history and its greatest captain: Captain James T.

There is little to no story to it and the writing style is not what I am looking for. I am only 16 and the main characters are over the age of 24.   I can't tell if the author is writing in school for entertainment or a real life story.  in the first book I did not read the part about the family of the people who went crazy in the second book and they were very very mean. The other bad part was the writing in the third book. The story was very boring and I never got a good feeling about the characters or the story in general.  and the fourth book was boring and not funny at all.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________I'm new to the audiobooks community, and I just finished a new audiobook by David Baldacci. I haven't read his novels before, so I can't say how they compare to this book, but I listened to both the first and second ones.The plot starts out a bit dull. The story is very simple. A couple get separated when their car breaks down, and the woman, Susan, becomes the wife of the guy she abandoned, who is now living with her and her two teenage daughters. I really enjoyed the idea that Susan's husband got out, but then went into hiding. The first few chapters were quite boring, but after a while, the story really picked up, and it grew into a real adventure story. The characters were really great, especially the older ones. Susan is very brave, and her daughters are great, and make me want to believe that they would get away. The old man, David, was quite a great character. He was a bit of an oddball, and never had anything to do with the women, but he really cared for Susan. His wife was pretty annoying, but she was really sweet.The art was really good. I listened, on my home stereo, in the car, on a long road trip. The audio was great, although it's not as high quality as I would like, but it gets the job done. The text was easy to read, even though there were a few parts that were a little hard to understand, and some of the language was a little silly, but overall, the audiobook was very good. It was definitely a good experience and I would definitely recommend it.

I read it in one sitting and really enjoyed it. It has many uses, many topics, many different characters and a lot of action. It is a fast paced book and there is action, adventure and action. There are some different ways to read it that allow you to get involved in the story and some of the parts are quite different from the book. The book is not very good, it's a fun read and very short at only 200 pages. I would recommend it to a fan of fast paced books or of fantasy books. The author should try writing a book at the speed of the Internet. 7.  The Last Samurai - Jack Donovan Another fast paced novel, The Last Samurai is a fun book to read. The main characters are all good, they have their own personal stories but they also have a lot in common. As a side note this book is probably my favorite story by Jack Donovan. There is a lot to like in this book, the characters are good, the story is interesting and the action is really good. I think this book could be a good one for a younger reader and it could be fun to read and really interesting to read to younger children. It could also be interesting to a mature reader.  8.   Hangmen - J.R.R Tolkein I read this book in order to make a list of my favorite fantasy books, I found out that I have been reading more fantasy books in the last few months, so I thought I'd share my top ten favorite books to read so far. I'll be adding to this list over time. I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys fantasy, because this book has great characters and lots of action scenes. I really like that the main character is a hangman, a person who takes the responsibility of hanging criminals. In this book we see a lot more of that and there are even a lot less of the typical hanging and execution scenes. The setting is also very well done and in a very interesting place. I found the book enjoyable, it was fast paced and fun, although a little short at 300 pages, this is good for an adult readers and I think it should not be too long for a young readers.  I love this book! 9.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I can't say enough good things about this book. It is a great story about a group of people, the Nacimientos, and about an adventure they had when they were young.   The writing is very good, and the story is great.  .   "I am the first to admit that my friends who are not my parents can never understand the way I have developed an addiction to crack. My friends who I tell this story to always think I am kidding around and have to explain what a heroin addict does and what it means to live in that kind of situation."   . "They had to move away from all their family and friends, to live with the Naco's and try to survive. They were still in high school and were not allowed to make friends, but they tried to be good students. But it was still hard to live without them, but, the best part, they were not in trouble."   the main character is not very good at his job, but he makes up for it with his friends, and also by making up stories for them. He is the leader of the group, but at the same time is the one who makes the decisions and gets the stuff. And when he does his job well, he gets a lot of money and he has the best friend in the world.   of course he makes mistakes and he does drugs a lot, but most of his mistakes are when he is in high stress situations like the war and when he has to take over a house that he doesn't like. He learns to deal with his situation as well as a lot better than he would have if he had not gotten to know his friends.  : )   Also, his father, who was a very abusive alcoholic, is a bad guy, but it was a great book, it gave a good picture of a bad father that he made a lot worse than it was at first, and I liked him. And the main heroine who had to deal very bad situations was nice as well, but as the story goes on, she was not the focus of the story.

Write a positive review about a good book:  It was nice to hear people from all walks of life speaking their minds. I was a little put off initially because some things were so very close to my own that it seemed a bit farfetched that anyone could believe them and that they really did happen. The truth is that a lot of it is all quite true and if you truly want to understand the roots of a thing like this (how it has become such a huge problem) read this book! It really was one of the best books I have read in a while. It really opened my eyes to a lot more and I think it was the best way to help to understand that many people can see through these tactics and their false narratives. I am definitely looking forward to rereading it again!

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I love this book so much it's impossible to put it down. My daughter, who is almost 5, has never understood the significance of these numbers. But now she's seen the picture on the front cover and is able to understand the meaning of these mysterious numbers. It has truly been wonderful for our family. My husband has no idea what the numbers mean and it is really hard for him to explain. It is also easy to understand for me. Thank you for this great book. _________  My daughters and I were able to use our imaginations to work out the numbers we were seeing on the numbers on the back of the page and the numbers that our teacher had asked us to find using the information on the book. Very helpful. Thanks for sharing your wonderful book with us.
Write a positive review about a good book:..............................I have enjoyed this book. It was very informative and helpful and easy to read.I recommend it to all who need a refresher on the subject.  Reviewed by Daniel B. on 08/29/2012 This book is a must for anyone who plans to become an amateur radio operator. I am not a radio-hobbyist at all, but I do enjoy working on the radio, so this book was very interesting. It also helped me to learn about radio equipment in general. "This book has it all: It gives you a solid grounding in amateur radio theory. It presents an easy-to-read introduction to radio and a comprehensive survey of the technology of radio, radio antennas, communications satellites, and the radio spectrum. It is a complete technical reference that will not only provide you with a solid foundation for your amateur radio career, but also a good reference to read over and over again."  - Jim H., W2FJ, West Central Florida.   "What we don't know can't hurt us, so it's important to know the basics before diving into more advanced topics like the one described in this book." : Joe M.  's  This book is very easy to learn, and it gives you enough information to start to think about what you will do with that radio. This is a great book to learn from.  is the only author I have found who covers the entire spectrum of radio equipment with a comprehensive study. There are lots of technical terms and terminology that can be confusing at first but once you understand what the author is saying you will be able to follow along.

Write a positive review about a good book:  It was interesting to read the story about how many of the early Americans came from France. I found the story interesting because I have heard the rumors that the French were actually the first to colonize North America and that the "French and Indians" story came from those original French settlers who were not necessarily all French in origin. The story also gave me the idea to read a book on the original French immigrants to North America, which I did.  The French who came here from France were not all from the Algonquian stock and had mixed European and Native American blood in them.   "They are the descendants of the French who first entered our country in 1619, when Charles d'Estaing entered the Holy Land.   They came from all parts of Europe, including England and Italy, and are the ancestors of the "Anglicans" and the "Romans" who are descendants of those French who were originally in America." Source:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquians There are still some French Canadians who would like to come back and settle in our country.  I will let them do that as they desire.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- This is an excellent book on the history of the British empire. It's filled with so many great insights about the British Empire and how it developed, and it was written so well that I am convinced it's the best book on British history there is. I love the illustrations. I like how the author makes the Empire seem like a real place, instead of just a name. I also love the way the book is written with such an academic feel. It is not something that will appeal to everyone, but I enjoyed it very much. --Diana from UK -------------------------- Well written book! In my opinion the author is the best historian on the empire. I enjoyed reading this book very much! --Eugene from Austria ------------------------- Absolutely brilliant! The book is very well written and I am pleased to say that I found it to be as well researched as it should be. I can now see the influence of the empire in my life to the great benefit of my education and I hope that in some future years to read the book in full, I will be able to appreciate its depth and the detail that has been given to the period. --Michael from United Kingdom ------------------------– I am very glad to have discovered this book, but it needs a few tweaks to make it into my regular rotation. 1) I want to make sure that the chapter on India is better integrated with the rest of the book 2) I would like to know if there is a chapter for the Chinese or for the Indian states, with a focus on the early Qing period. 3) I believe that the maps need to be updated and updated again on the British expansion of the world as a whole. 4) I also think that we need to know more about the Indian subcontinent to understand the wider picture, and how the British viewed the Indian rulers who were often their adversaries. 5) There needs to be more research on the role of the Indian Muslims who were a constant thorn in the British government's side, especially during the early colonial period. 6) The section on the East India Company needs a better name as I feel that the empire would have been stronger had it not been for them. --Robert from Canada ------------------------ I am so grateful that I came across this excellent book and can see a definite path for future generations of historians. I am glad that the authors have used the best available source of information, which is the archives of the National Archives of India. The story of the

Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book because it reminded me that we can still use technology for good.  This was the story of one family who got rid of old family computers.  The story of the family and their computer was very relatable and sad.  As I learned more and more about the family the more I realized how much my own life has changed since I started using computers.   It was nice to be able to use this computer with the kids and to have a little time alone with my daughter.  It was also nice to read about the other computers that they have.  I had a lot of fun reading this book and it really made me appreciate the computer in my home.  As a whole, this is a good, very well written book.  A positive review from a good and positive book: I liked this book a lot and have now recommended it to a bunch of my friends.   The book was pretty funny and I liked the fact that there were other computers like this in the world.  A few years ago I would never have thought I'd be reading a book about a family who had an old computer.  They were very funny and very sad at the same time.  After reading the book I feel I got a better understanding of the technology and how hard it can be to use at times.  Overall I had fun and it was good to read a book I enjoyed.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________ If you're a true fan of a certain type of book (like the kind that includes monsters, magical realism, mystery, or the dark and macabre), then this book may be right up your alley. If not, don't worry, it's not just a simple rehash of a great book, but rather a rehash that adds even more to the story of the book. This isn't a book that's going to be right for everyone. It's a book meant for a certain subset of people (if you liked The Bone Clocks, this book might not be for you), but if you're not in that category, I'm sure you'll enjoy it nonetheless. It is as much an examination of the nature of a relationship as a book about a vampire and her human love-interest. That's quite a feat for a first book in the series. I thought that it was also good at exploring the relationship of two vampires, as well as the nature and psychology of a human and a vampire. I liked that even though it was a very different experience for two vampires and a human, they both had to deal with the same issues in their own unique ways. I particularly liked how it dealt with the role of the vampire and the human in society. It touched on those topics, although not in the same depth as the first book, or in any way as clearly. I also liked how the two vampires dealt with their pasts. They're both human, after all. It took a while for me to really appreciate the way the author dealt with a vampire that had to change from a person that loved others and loved humans to a vampire who hated humans. That took a bit of time for me too. It was interesting, but I can see how people might not see that side of him/her because of his/her past. I don't think I've ever been that bothered by that, but maybe there are some people. I loved how the vampires were dealt with. They were human, but they were not the same. They had their flaws, their strengths, their passions, their weaknesses, and that was just the way they were. The way they interacted with each other was also just the same way. I wanted to believe that they were a couple, but it didn't seem likely, so I didn't expect that to happen. That was also one of the things I liked about the vampire/human aspect of the story, it gave it
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________   I am new to the game and the game really impressed me. It is not too complex, but easy enough to pick up and play. I enjoyed the different types of weapons, and some of the characters that have special abilities to help you win. There is a tutorial at the start, but I did not have a problem following it.   The game will be fun for the first time player, or anyone that is into tactical games, as you will learn a lot just from the game, and there are quite a few strategies. You have to learn how to use the different weapons, how to get the best equipment, etc.   is just a great game. It makes you think, and makes you want to play more. I recommend it to anyone, and am giving it five stars.

Write a positive review about a good book: *********** I'm giving this book 4 stars because it's just too good. This book contains the following: 1) A very clear presentation of why I've chosen to be vegan since I was 20 years old. (There's really nothing more to say, so here it is.) 2) A good story about why I'm vegan now. (I've read the same "stories" in many other books, so I thought I'd share mine with the world.) 3) A thorough discussion of the science behind veganism. (This is where a lot of people get confused, but it's not a complete misunderstanding. I've written about the scientific aspects of why veganism is better than it has ever been, as well as the scientific, ethical and environmental reasons to do it.) 4) A "cookbook" for people who want to learn how to cook plant-based foods. (Yes, there is a "cooking" section.) 5) A list of many, many vegan recipes. This is where I got most of my information and this is where the author has the most information available. 6) A few short, practical sections on how to eat healthy, eat less meat, and how to get more exercise. I got these from the website Vegan Outreach and found most of them very helpful. 7) A full section about the health benefits of veganism, such as the study by Yale and Harvard showing that vegetarians are actually healthier than their meat-eating counterparts, and more healthy than people who eat meat but don't get any vitamins or minerals from it. 8) A section on why it's good for the environment to reduce or eliminate animal consumption and how that impacts the environment, including a few scientific references. 9) Some practical tips and tricks. 10) A recipe for "chocolate vegan ice cream." This book will likely change your life. ******This is the first vegan book that I've ever read. I'm excited to tell everyone about it!**
Write a positive review about a good book:...................................."I read this book when my son was about six, and I remember it well. The book told the story of a little boy named Billy who had some problems with the other kids because of his short stature. He was often teased and called "little Billy" because of the way he looked. It is hard to say how I feel about this book, I was disappointed that the boy, Billy, did not live to see adulthood. I think I would have been interested to hear more of his story and how he overcame the difficulties he had, and he was just a small child when I read this story.   The story is very funny, and you can't help but think of your kids when you read it. It doesn't have a lot of details that can be easily found in any child's book, but it does give you something to think about in the next time your kids come home with a book on the shelf.  ,
Write a positive review about a good book:    "Diana Gabaldon has written a classic tale that is both rich in information and yet simple and easy to understand. The book is well written and the story is quite engrossing. I was a bit skeptical at first about whether this would be a good follow-up to The Winds of Winter as I wanted to see if the story could be done justice in a second book. Well, it's certainly an improvement over the previous book, and as a sequel, it comes out to be well worth the wait."

My son loved it too! We were talking about a certain book a lot in the car. We just couldn't believe how many things we remembered from it.  ... I know a lot about the history of cars and you made me stop and think. The way you said it makes me think there is more to a story than you have told me.  I want to know all about the car and why you found it. The author was a very good one to listen to and was easy to understand.  , my son and I have been listening to this book and I'm ready to purchase the book that the author was talking about. I will try the others in the series but I do want the books by the author that we are listening to first. I'm glad you told us the story was not a true one.  's.. I'm not surprised at all at the reaction of your readers. I would give this book 5 stars if I could because I know that it's a good read!   You have a knack for keeping your readers involved. My only complaint is that there is not much new information that is not told in the story. I thought the book was about the life of an artist and not his love affair with a car.   (hide spoiler)] [This is another book by Charles B. Riddle I didn't know I had. I liked it but I would have liked to see more about the woman he was interested in. I also found out that I have another sister who is married to an artist as well. I just don't know what this sister and artist would have had to talk about if they were dating. That's just one more reason I wanted to see the rest of the series. He did an excellent job of giving us a story line that was really believable. I am glad I read this book!

Write a positive review about a good book:  A must-read and an excellent study tool on the history and development of the first black nation, the United States of America. My wife and I have discussed it with many other friends and family members.  I've been studying American history for over 30 years, and I've always known that I would be a big fan of this book.    It is the best book on America's founding I have ever read!   "The United States has always been a nation of immigrants.  It was an old country, and it wasn't going to be able to take care of the large number of immigrants who arrived there.  Some historians say that this is where slavery started and that, therefore, the US should be abolished, but the US has been a slave nation since the beginning, and that's not what the Founders meant by the word 'free.'  The Founding Fathers, by the way, weren't the least bit racist.  What they were really trying to do was to unite the disparate communities into a nation.  And they did it by bringing all the different groups together into a melting pot."

Write a positive review about a good book:    "The best thing I can say about this book is that it's a real life, work of art! The book has a real feel about it, and is so unique. If you think you don't like a certain genre of book, or you just hate a certain style of writing...this book is definitely for you. As a young adult who was reading all these YA/Nookie books (and was not a fan of those) I was a little disappointed that I didn't find any good ones here. But to my surprise, this book didn't give me a bad feeling. It was a real journey with this book, it had everything going for it. It is hard to describe the feeling of reading this book. You feel this deep sadness in your heart because the book is so sad and has it so beautifully written, and it's full of beautiful characters. There is a real sadness in this book and it is so moving...   I will definitely keep this book on my shelf next to "I, Frankenstein," "A Wrinkle in Time," and "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay"   There's just something about these books that have that magic to them. The first line of the story is the best line in the whole book.   'You think of it all as a dream. It's not a dream at all.'
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book. I have never found myself with an urge to read a whole book about a certain subject. However, the more I thought about it the more a part of me wished I had this book in my possession. I did not find the author as "brilliant" as many have said. However I did enjoy it. If you are a parent of young children and have no interest in reading a book about how to help your children learn about these subjects, I would recommend this book to you. I am not going to say what I think the author's motives were in writing this book, but the information she did present was very interesting and helpful. I would have given this book a higher rating if I thought it would help my young children learn more about the subject of homosexuality. I can't help thinking that if she had focused on these subjects that would have been her main focus. I found that reading this book was enjoyable and gave me more than enough information. I recommend this one for all who are interested in learning how to teach your children about this. It was very informative for all the kids who wanted to know more and want to understand more.
Write a positive review about a good book:..................................................... This book is the best book ever. It taught me how to play the piano, it was very enjoyable to read and the story was really good. It is also an easy book to read. If I read it again I will buy it for my son and for myself. I recommend this book.   Read this book if: You want to learn how to become a pianist and also you are a fan of the musical  This book is a wonderful book. It gives you a lot of information regarding all the basic piano  You will get an excellent introduction into the theory behind playing the piano and it will also help you to understand how the piano works and how to get the best results on it.  The main purpose of this book is to show you how to master the piano but more importantly it shows you how not to become frustrated by mistakes and how the mistakes are actually a good thing.  (This book could also be used in schools for children and teenagers).   Write a negative review about an not good book :............................................ I was really disappointed in this book because it didn't show the mistakes of every player and there were many times it was just a lot a wrong stuff in it. I was also not too sure if the writer really knew what they were talking about so I was never really able to make any progress at all with this book (I only bought it to use as an example in a lesson).  , I have only just started to play piano after 6 years of not playing but it has never been an easy task! I have always played the piano because of the music and because it was so easy to do and learn to play.    The first book I ever read was: Piano for the Young pianist by David T. Miller which I read over ten years ago. It was really a good introduction to the piano. I learned about a whole lot of things that are helpful and useful when you first start to learn. It made it really easy to start to play, especially for a young child.   this book didn't have anything good in it, so I never got the impression that it was written by a pianists piano teacher and that it would teach you the piano the same way I was taught in piano lessons. I thought it would show how to improve the piano playing but most of the times it just showed you how NOT to play by mistakes. It didn't give you any way to learn from

When she saw that the boys had been killed and their bodies were being thrown around her living room she went crazy. She would bang on the walls, throw things around and start screaming at everyone. It was the beginning of a very nasty battle between her and the kids who she said had killed her children. I do think her hatred of them could have been part of the problem. I have been in this situation before and the anger and pain is great. I really hope the mother gets help for the mental issues she is facing. I am sure she was crazy and could have stopped her children being killed but the mental illness caused her to go further and try to get them out of her life. It has been 5 years now and she still feels bad about what she did, but there are some good things that came from it for her. I would love to hear what happened to the boys, and if she ever has another child. This book is good and I am glad that I got it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  As an avid reader of YA, it was great to see these young heroes getting some exposure.  They are all really, really well written, with a strong and diverse cast of characters, and a lot of emotional depth.  What about the cover art?   The cover for The Last King of Osten Ard was something I couldn't help but drool over.   I loved the character of the queen, and especially the way the color palette was used.  The way the image was placed in the frame, and the light cast on the image made me think of something out of the Harry Potter series.  That image combined with the title of the book made me very interested in this book.  If you like what you see, then you should grab this book right now.  I can't wait to read it!

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------- "This is a wonderful and original book about the rise of the Christian cult called the Illuminati and its main founder Adam Weishaupt. The book takes you on an incredible journey into the inner-workings of the Illuminati, which makes it a must read for anyone interested in world history. It's so interesting that a book that chronicles the history of a cult, was written by a member of the cult himself, an Illuminati insider and former top CIA agent. It shows how the Illuminati has continued to evolve and even become more complex than ever. There are a lot of interesting details in this book about how the original followers of the first group of Illuminati were caught red-handed for practicing black magic and what went wrong for these followers of Weishauer's." -- James A. Dickey, Professor of History at Miami University
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was quite excited to have been given this book in exchange for an unbiased review. I loved the story and characters. I was pleasantly surprised by how well these were described. I am going to use this to help get back on track. It was the second time I have been taken back to a similar situation, I've been in recovery for years now. I didn't feel like I was going in the right direction in recovery and I thought I had been through enough before, so I was willing to try it again with this book. I think that it helped me find myself and make positive choices throughout my recovery. The author gives us a lot of insight and he knows the process very well. I'm really excited to see where it takes me.

Write a positive review about a good book: ~~~ One of my favorite books of all time, and one of the best books I've ever read. I don't recommend this book for people who are in danger of addiction or have addictions or anything like that. The reason it's great is because the characters are just like real people. They don't have to suffer and they don't need things. They are happy, and that makes us happy. I recommend this for anyone and everyone.

It's a fun and enjoyable read and I enjoyed the little quips that he made about the world and how much he cared about it. It was a great read and the characters were all so interesting.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I have been reading this book for several years and it has always been a treat for me. I love these stories and have enjoyed them all. I can only think of one complaint. There is one character in this book that seems to be trying too hard to be a hero. It is a little obnoxious and I think the author could do without it. I also would not recommend this book to the young adult reader. It would seem to be written for the young adults of the sixties and it definitely was not. I liked the book but I would have been better off with another.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- [The following story has spoilers] My boyfriend and I were at a Barnes and Noble a couple weeks ago. He and I had decided to start reading The Dune series. He's been a huge fan of Frank Herbert's since high school. I have been obsessed with this book for quite awhile as well. We finally decided to get the third book when we were there, and were totally stoked about it. He loved it too, and was so excited to start it! He then started it, and I started listening as well, because I was too. In about two hours I felt a twinge of discomfort. He had started to lose his focus, and it happened during the entire first chapter of the book. He started talking out of turn, and he would start to get lost, get confused and then start to go back to what he was saying. I could tell he was getting very frustrated, but I wasn't getting it and couldn't stop talking. I wanted to stop the show, but he kept saying "don't listen" to me. It was getting annoying, and a little scary. I couldn't figure out why he wasn't listening, so I put the book down and ran to the bathroom to take a bath. While I was in there I started thinking about it, how I could have stopped this from happening, but the book is supposed to be listened to while you are taking a bath and it doesn't take long for your mind to drift. I didn't want to be stuck with that guilt, and that made me very angry. I got up and stormed out of the bathroom, leaving the book behind and feeling terrible that I did this. He was devastated, and the entire time I was going to stop reading the book he kept looking at me like I was crazy, and telling me that he loved it. This morning he was still trying to convince me to listen, and asking me why I was so mad. I told him that it was because of what happened in the bathroom. I was sitting in my bed feeling sick. I turned on my Kindle and was horrified to see that I had finished the first chapter, but it didn't stop. My boyfriend started yelling at me, saying that I would be better off just reading the rest of it. After a minute of this, I just put the volume down, and went back to bed. I feel like I can't stop thinking about what just happened, and how I am feeling like crap. When

Write a positive review about a good book: _________  I found this book on a book shelf at my local library, and have since read and re-read it several times. It's a very fun story about a boy named Noah who wants to become a pilot. One day he meets a woman named Sara, and they fall in love. When his father figures out the boy's true identity, Noah's father throws Noah out of the house. After a number of failed attempts to get his life back together, Noah ends up with Sara's best friend's father. I was also really impressed with how Noah was not portrayed as a victim in the story, even when his father's actions were questionable. Noah doesn't become some sort of saint, he's a little boy who made a bad decision, but he's an intelligent and thoughtful kid, and I can see why his father threw him out the door.  Overall this was an enjoyable story that I'll definitely read again, and maybe even read to my child. I give this one four stars out of five!  _______________________________  Read the first 5 chapters here  The first 5 pages are very funny, and this book is full of some great comedic scenes that makes you laugh your ass off at the funny situations that Noah and Sara find themselves in. The book is also full of very detailed descriptions of the environment in which Noah and Sarah are living, and Noah's interactions with the locals that makes this a fun read for those that like to read about interesting and interesting people.  the book is written in first person point of view and so it is not really a long novel as it only takes about 120 pages to complete but as you read the first chapters you get an idea of the story and how Noah and his family start off and how things are going for Noah after he is rejected by his family. I loved how Noah is a very smart and funny kid, he has a great relationship with his mother and can come across as a little shy and quiet but I also think he has some of the best character development out of any book I have read so far. the book was very well written, the characters are developed in a real sense. the way that the author makes his character Noah even better is by using humor and sarcasm to express things that Noah can't or can't say in normal conversation. , I give it four stars  , this is a book I would love to read again for a younger audience that is fascinated with airplanes and

Write a positive review about a good book: ~~Tiny, but huge!~~ I have a love/hate relationship with small-sized paperbacks. I have read them all from A to Z and enjoy them all, but, most of them just have too many pages and I want to know when the next one will arrive. But, this is different. This book has only three pages, but it was over 400 pages. (It doesn't have a table of contents, but I can tell you when each chapter begins and ends, because I'm always sure it's going to end.) I was looking forward to reading this, especially since I am a big fan of H. G. Wells and The Time Machine. I loved how this book was different from the others. I thought it had a lot of promise and I am really looking forward for the next installment. Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for this book, I love it and I look forward to all the new things you have in store for me!

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________________________________________ I've enjoyed this story, and I think that is a good thing. I hope it helps a few people to get the idea that it's possible to be in a relationship without a baby and be happy with your choice in someone. I love that you use the same words as me when describing your boyfriend. It makes me feel better about myself. So many women tell me they feel alone and scared and that their relationships are over before their babies are born. This book is a great reminder to those women that their choice is not just theirs, and they should not feel ashamed for loving themselves with what God gave them. My husband and I got a call at around 5 weeks from a friend. He said that their son was born. We were so relieved! I was pregnant for only 6 weeks at the time. I was very uncomfortable having to be pregnant. I didn't even know what a pregnancy was. He would be leaving for college soon, so I was pretty sure we were through. I'd just been told that we had a 1 in 3 chance that the baby was a girl. It turned out that I had a girl, and was very excited. At 5 weeks and just 6 weeks pregnant I began feeling a little discomfort with a little nudge on the back of my left side. It was at this time that I saw that I was developing into a good size baby girl. I hadn't even started my second trimester yet. As the weeks passed the discomfort disappeared and I continued to feel very good. I had noticed that the last trimester wasn't as hard on my belly. By 8 weeks of pregnancy my belly had stopped hurting. At around 16 weeks I began having pains in my side. I knew this was going to be my next baby. I wasn't sure how I was going care for her and it wasn't until later that I realized it was due to the hormones in my blood. I took some meds to reduce the hormones but the pains didn't stop. When the labor started I was so happy. I really didn't want to go through it again. We tried everything we could think of to help her with labor. I couldn't wear anything but a tank top or sweats because she would get cold and uncomfortable and the extra weight just seemed to make the pain go away. By 35 weeks I could feel she was coming and couldn't wait to be done with it. When I had to deliver I was amazed by how much pain she was in

Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoy this story. My only issue is that the character seemed a bit to one side of the issue in one particular scene. I feel as if the author had a hard time figuring out what to do with him. This would have been easy to do as in the book the character is portrayed as a good guy and very good at his job. It just didn't seem to work for him in this novel.   I highly recommend this book for anyone who likes a good mystery. I'm thinking of buying this book to read on my flight out of New York. I have heard it was one of the best mystery novels published in the past 20 years.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this in the first year of high school and I thought it was the most realistic portrayal of the experience of a person of colour in the military ever written, as well as the most accurate. I never thought I would have been a minority in the U.S. military, but there I was. I was a member of the United States Air Force. The book is a great look into the lives of those that served and that I was lucky enough to meet in my mission. I also thought the story was a great metaphor for how people of different races interact in the world today. The story was very well written. I recommend this book to anyone that is interested in the experiences of the minority groups in the US Armed Forces. The author has done an amazing job with this book, and is a very talented writer. I am glad that there is a book like this, in this genre, in the future.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________I purchased this book because I wanted to read a good history book that wasn't "so political" (in other words, wasn't in any way an attack on one political party or another.) This book is really good history and it covers many things people in this country have no idea about. From the fact that our military is the largest it has ever been and is much more powerful than the British army, to that the military budget is at record levels, to the way that we are the largest arms importer in the world, to how the Bush administration has been taking us into more and more wars and to the fact there are more private contractors now than there are military men in the country. The military side of things is really well covered in this book as well. I was also excited to learn that our Navy is the biggest in the WORLD and we are now involved in a new war to combat a group of pirates in the Indian Ocean! It is a fascinating read.

Write a positive review about a good book:!!!The book is a very good read. It will appeal to those who like reading and to those of you who have read a lot of the books by this author. It was very easy to read, and it was a lot entertaining. The author is an excellent writer, the characters are very well thought out and believable, and the world building is very well done. This book is probably the best fantasy I have read in a long time, and I really liked it. The only complaint I have about this book is that some of the events and names have been changed from the author's original plan. Also, the book was split into 3 parts, so there was a little bit of a waiting period between each part. But, I would recommend this book to any who have not read a good fantasy book, and especially to those that like books on history, mythology and mythology.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________  This book is a wonderful primer for teaching about the nature of reality and the purpose of human existence and it will be a treasure for years to come. The best part is that it comes with a preface and index by Richard Dawkins himself.   The book is very well written, and is clearly written to teach the facts, and the reason of why there is anything instead of nothing. I really think the book is needed because the way we teach about science and why people like to believe in god/nature is very limited. The authors make it clear that it is more about philosophy than anything else, which is why it works as well as it does. I especially love the index, where you can look up various facts about various things.  .  Review:   One of the most helpful books I've ever read about the concept of "God". I am a college student at the moment, and am currently reading everything I can about this subject, but nothing that really explains the concepts. I find this very helpful because it's not just a book about god, but a book that goes a lot deeper than that.  I found the book to be well written and easy to understand. The author discusses the importance of education, and does a wonderful job explaining the concept that we are created for a purpose. I found myself thinking about God quite often, even while doing homework.

Write a positive review about a good book:  What a book!!! I had a rough childhood and a very sad ending. I got this book in a book exchange and I loved every word and I cried during it. It brought me back to my childhood, to the time I was very, very, terribly upset about the way my parents treated me. I read the book the day before school, which is hard when you are very sad and you have to study for an exam the next day.  I got a D in the test and I was so sorry about it.  And the next chapter brought tears again. I was reminded that I was the way I was and that I did bad things.  This book made me realize that I needed to forgive myself.  I have been on a long journey of self-forgiveness for the past 2 years and this book has helped me a lot.  Thank you so much for writing such a powerful book about forgiveness. I will be rereading it every week.  What a great book!  I just finished this book and am enjoying it immensely. I never thought I would see my past and what I went through in the way of being abused, but after reading this book, I am sure that I will someday be able to forgive my past self. I am in a good place now and I am a better person for having been through this. I hope that you can make an impact on this world with your words and books. Thank you, thank you, Thank you!!! - M.S. Wow!!! I don't know why more authors don't write this book.  I had this book for 3 weeks and I have not put it down.  It really brought out the feelings that I felt and I'm so happy that the author shared this with all the kids that read it. I'm so glad that I read this book so long ago when I was in the same situation that my little boy is now in. I'm glad that this author wrote this book as a guide to be able for you to know what to do when you have been abused. This book has so much positive impact on the young children and young adults that will be able read and learn from this book ...the author really wrote this with the young people in mind... This was the first book I ever purchased from the internet (about 3 years ago) and I've enjoyed the experience to date. It is easy to understand and easy to follow.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was very interesting. I really like this author. I am now looking for other books from this author to read. I also read his books in the old format on the e-book platform. Read an interesting review on Goodreads: "I recommend this book because I found that while it may not be the most popular or the most profitable, it is a good read. The subject is very difficult and some of the material is difficult to digest. But it will help you make a good impression on potential employers, and be ready for interviews. If you can relate, you may come across as a knowledgeable business person, which I highly recommend. This book is well worth the time to read." Read a short summary:  This is one of those books that makes you want to take a look in a few other books about how to start a business, or the art of running one. It is a short and to-the-point read, which explains all you need to know to succeed in your own business. It covers the basics: what you need, how to get it, where to get help, how business people interact with you and how to interact with them, and even provides business tips for your own life.  Read the rest of the reviews: This book is a great example of how to set up a successful and profitable business.  I had an instant connection with this author and had fun reading this book. The book provides many tips that I believe are very helpful and will save you from many mistakes you'll make in your life as a small business owner. If only more people read these books, the world would be a much safer place. I enjoyed reading this very well written book. It really helps you to understand how to succeed and what you'll need to do to do so.  There are many business skills that you'll find in this book that I found helpful and I know that I'll learn some great skills as a result of this book :)  It was a great read, and I hope that the authors can help to some people out there to start and run a business.

Write a positive review about a good book:..............................This is a great read. I was really hoping for more action from the characters. It was good, the main characters were different and interesting. However, it is a little hard to take everything they said seriously. However that is not the book's fault, it's the reader's fault. It is really frustrating. However as I mentioned earlier I really enjoyed the story and liked the characters that are featured. There were a couple of things that made the book hard to follow, but that just made it all the better.

It is a short novel, so it will make for good listening on a bus, train or plane!  5/5 stars
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've tried many books on mindfulness, but I'm always impressed by the ability of this book to help me.  The book is very easy to read and it is packed with practical advice to help you. I think this book will have a big impact in our lives."   I agree.   I just wish it had had more info and more examples of real life examples to make the practical points more clear and easy to follow. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book really has some good ideas. I thought it would be a lot of fun to read as an adult, because I've always been interested in the history of the Chinese. I was not disappointed. I got a couple of things wrong, but the concepts were very well explained and I'd say they're solid, but that's not why I've written this review. The book was also a lot funnier and more entertaining. It made me laugh a lot. My favorite parts were when it was all about the women, like when Chen Bei and Yang Yuan had a big argument, and Yang's mom just came in, pulled down the skirt of Yang's skirt, and ripped it all down, then yelled, "Yang Yuan's not a proper wife! He's a slut!" and Yang said, "How does he know that, I haven't had sex yet!" and he said, with his face screwed up, "Well, he told me!" (he's the oldest son in the family) Then when it got to Chen Bei, she goes around asking people to pick up their husbands and girlfriends and when they refuse, she says, "You're either a slut or a prostitute." and they all say, "Oh, you're going to have to learn how to ask for what you want in Chinese!" I like that story too!  
Write a positive review about a good book:  "For once I agree with those who criticize the plot of 'A Song for Lya'. I'm going to be totally honest here and say that I did not like this novel. I had to reread the last 3 chapters to understand what was going on. I was not a fan of the characters and the plot, but I still managed to finish it because of the incredible writing. A novel that I will reread with a new attitude and maybe even think differently about it. 'A Man with No Face' I would recommend to anyone who wants to read a good, entertaining novel that will challenge you and make you think a bit."

Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished this book. It's very easy to read. I found it very interesting.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________ Review by Mikey: After reading "In the Night Garden" I immediately re-read the first five. I loved the first few and really thought I had read 'The Night Garden' earlier this year but alas, no! Just another fantastic collection. Highly recommended. ______________________________________________________________________ _______________________________ Review by Lisa: The second half of the series is much more serious. But this is also a really fun read. ______________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________ Review by Mary: This is an awesome little collection. As the title suggests, there is a lot of scaryness. The narrator is wonderful and the characters are well drawn. It is a very well written book. The illustrations are wonderful. I will be reading more. _________________________ Review by Elizabeth: This book is absolutely frightening and creepy as all get out. I got scared so hard I thought I was going to faint. I found this book when I was just going on a walk, and I didn't feel like going home, so I grabbed it. Now, the writing and the illustrations make the book even more frightening. The book has a good cover, a good story, and a good start. __________________ Review by J: I just finished reading this book...and I am in LOVE with it. This is a wonderful collection, and the stories were really well done! __________________________________ Review from John: The author did a wonderful job in making this a book that will scare your pants off. The story is fantastic. There are a lot to enjoy in this book. I would love to find a copy of the first two volumes. __________ Review From T: The Night Garden is a good little paranormal suspense story, not so much about the supernatural, but about a man who is haunted by his past. I enjoyed this story.    Review from Robert: I did enjoy this collection. It was interesting to read the tales, but the author does write like a "realistic" book which does make for a different kind of reading experience.

Write a positive review about a good book: Â Â It's a good read! It's very clear about what it is and is not, and the content is interesting and informative. It helps to clear up misconceptions and it does it well. It's well worth the read.  Review of the book:   Â The only problem is the amount of information in the book. It is a lot. I mean, there are almost 40 chapters with hundreds of pages. The only thing I want to mention is how it goes into much depth into the concept of being a victim of abuse. The first couple of pages of the chapter on victims of abuse is very helpful and informative to the reader. I am a victim. When I was in the Navy I was victim of a very violent rape. It was a very dangerous situation and I was scared to death. I was treated like a criminal because I was a victim and I thought that made me a bad person. There is something wrong with that. There were a lot of people that looked the other way. The man that raped me knew that he was doing it wrong and there was no doubt that he regretted it and it wasn't the way that he wanted it to be. It makes me want to do everything I can to prevent the things that happen to us. The book talks about how women and children suffer. It mentions how we are the most victimized class. It says that a child born to a woman who is raped is 3 times more likely to be sexually abused themselves than a child that is born to any other woman. That is extremely scary. In the United States, women make up the majority of those that are victims of rape and sexual abuse. I find that to be horrifying. We are being victimized and that is bad. I have decided to read a lot more psychology/psychoanalysis literature. I will be looking to purchase a few books on the topic before I will decide to purchase it again. It will certainly be a good resource to have in my library.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got this book to read before my final exams and I think that it was very effective to get through that difficult time. I think this book is a good introduction to the world of Chinese martial arts. I recommend it.   My rating: 5 Stars   It took me awhile to decide whether or not to buy the book, but I decided to and it was well worth it. The style is different from what I've read but this does not discourage me from reading it again. It's great to read about different styles and this book does a great job in introducing them and showing what I learned about them.

Write a positive review about a good book:.....................................................................................  I recently purchased this book for my son's fifth-grade class at his new school, and we all loved it! He was able to discuss a few things that we discussed in the book, which is very important when the children come into this new school. My son loved it and we were all very pleased with the purchase.   The book was very well done and has many of the important points and points that many other teachers have talked about in the past. The illustrations were really good and easy to understand.   has many interesting topics. The author made it very easy for the child to understand them. I hope that he will use this book in the future.  
Write a positive review about a good book:!!! I bought this book as a gift for my mom who has a very severe form of anorexia, anorexic brain and heart. she has struggled with this disease for over 18 years and has no hope for recovery. the book gave her hope and she is in remission. it also has great details of the treatment of the disease as well as tips on how to cope with anorecism in your everyday life. it is the only book she has been able to read for almost 5 years. i think it is just as important for every anorexiist to read it. it helps to deal with the emotions and anxiety the disease puts on you.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book. I just started reading it a couple of days ago and have loved every minute. I have always thought that a woman would be the best leader ever and even before I knew she was a woman I thought she was so great. I hope she becomes the president in my lifetime. I also like the idea of giving her a man as an advisor, because I think she will be great, she also knows how to handle herself in a political debate and would be so great at it. The fact that she is a woman does not bother me at all, although I know that is not true of every woman I know. I read this book because it seemed that a man would not be a good candidate for the office because of all the baggage they have. They have a lot to overcome in addition to having a man on their side. Thank you for writing this wonderful book.  Thank you for reminding us that woman can be amazing in a lot of different situations that men are not even aware of, such as having babies, becoming an amazing mom or being a great leader. This book is an amazing read. This is such a great inspirational book and I cannot wait for it to come out in paperback so I can read it over and over. I love all the quotes throughout the book. Thank God for books like this one that tell women that they are just as capable as men and we just need to step out of the box and start being who we are supposed to be.  a good read that gives you an idea about the strength of women and their strength to be leaders. :) - Amanda:  : ) - Amanda :  5.5/5 star! I am reading this book right now, I read it a few years ago as a Christmas present. It's a great read and a reminder about just how much strength women have when they make the choice to lead and make the choices in life. Thank You for your time and for making such a wonderful book :)

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________ "I'm in a big hurry and have a lot to get done, but I am glad I took a few minutes to read this book. In this short book, the author describes his own journey from being a very introverted individual to being someone who is open to the world. He describes what he calls the Five Stages of Change, and this book explains how his own transformation occurred. I also liked how he took some time to describe how he is a product of his environment as well as how he became what he is today. This book explains the importance of getting out of your comfort zone. It also outlines a few key things to do if you want to change and become more open."

They are real and all of them have feelings for one another and the way they act with each other is so realistic. Also all the scenes and scenes that were not very explicit were very beautiful and it was just so well written. I can't wait to read more of this series and see if the stories follow one after another.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "I am a huge fan of  The Legend of Zelda  ( The Legend  of Zelda, for  all of you Zelda fans out there).  When it was revealed that the series would be going to consoles, I was ecstatic. I was not expecting an all new series but at least I would be getting a new adventure for the first time.  This book did not disappoint.  The world is amazing. The story is well written.  If you like the series you need to read this one." Review for The Legend Of Zelda: The Complete Adventures  by  John E. Pina   I don't remember having read this book before but I really enjoyed this one.  It does not change the old characters and it feels like you are playing the old games, but it is an enjoyable book to get in and out of.  I loved the original NES games so this is perfect for me.  You can not tell I am a Zelda fan.  This book does not have the many puzzles as this book, but for those people that love the puzzle elements in the games, you can play all of the other puzzle games that I think will make great reading and it will still be enjoyable.  There is a lot of interesting information in this book that can be found elsewhere but for me this book was the perfect place to start.   I would love to know more about the other characters in the books other than the Link in this one!
Write a positive review about a good book: ***************************This book contains some of the most beautiful drawings I have ever seen, and that is saying a lot. The illustrations are fantastic and each character has a unique look to him. The characters have a very warm and friendly nature to them, and all of them have good intentions of helping people in their new world. While it was great to see the way people were treated in this world, I think it's hard to help people and not cause more trouble. The author was very good at showing the effects of the world on people, and I found that it was more of a horror story than a happy ending story.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It was great.   I didn't understand anything, until I reread it. Then I realized it is about the first generation of gay rights activists. But it's also about the way they worked together with others in order to succeed and not fail, especially when all they wanted was to make love safer. That's what got the country to where it is.   I don't know why I'm making this so long, but it's so great. It really is a good piece of literature. It will touch you like nothing else.

Now I know how to use the term "ghetto" for the kind of place we live. Thank you for your honesty, and your insight.   Linda K. I got to know you a little through the books that you wrote about the Civil Rights Movement in America. I was in the South as a young boy and went to school and played baseball in Mississippi in the 1950's, when we used to play baseball under the stars in the summer. My Uncle Joe was a great Negro League pitcher. He was as fair as they come. I learned about that wonderful country and the brave men and women who were trying to achieve their civil rights, but were unsuccessful.   (Linda, Mississippi)  Great book!! The story about the life of Rosa Parks is very interesting and worth a read.   the life and struggles of Rosa, as I know it, are true. I found this to be a very informative book. Thank You for giving us a different perspective on such a very important event in our history. The book was well written and filled with pictures.  .  My brother and I loved the book! It gave us some knowledge and an idea of what went on in the south and around the country at that time. It was a book we read often and it was a real education!   "Linda" - New Jersey USA  I found the book informative and well written. I think it is fair to call the book "a must read." The author explains the problems and issues. We were both surprised about the many negative comments. It is the time of Rosa Park's protest. She was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a white person. There are many problems, but this book is a good one to read. It would be good to read this to high school students. It contains lots of good information. Thankyou and regards,  Brigitte  We were given a copy of this book by our great aunt who grew up in the Mississippi Delta. We found it very interesting. We are both in college now, and I have found the events portrayed in the book very accurate. We can now tell people about the times and events when people were discriminated against.   of Rosa's protest, but we don't have the information to believe what the author says about the events
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book! I'm so glad this is back in print. If you've never read a book on the topic, you'll want to start with this one. There's no shortage of good books on this topic, but this book is so well researched and written. I'm sure this topic is very important to many of you out there, and as a result, I think you'll get a lot out of it.  Read 5 books and you will be so happy: -I wish my friend had read this book: The best gift I've ever received was the gift of the best reading experience I have ever had.

I am in awe of a good story. I love how this story touches you in many different ways.  I think the last chapter really hit the nail on the head when it tells the story of my dad getting cancer. It is such an important story and we need to read more about this topic.  I know how much we all love the stories of happy endings. These stories make us happy, but not the happiness we should have. I think this book really touches upon that idea. "I thought about everything I'd done and everything I would do if I could change it all. Then I went back to look at everything I hadn't done and what I couldn't change.

Write a positive review about a good book:   "I am an artist that writes about people and they come alive in the story and in me. I always knew from a young age that I wanted to be an artist, that's how I started my writing career. But when I was in first grade my teacher taught us "Write the story" and I was never the best at that. However, I learned to be more confident when it comes to my own writing. Since the age of 8 I was writing stories for fun and for the entertainment of my family and friends. My family still tells me that I started with a blank page in my sketch book and that I went on to become a professional storyteller. This book has definitely helped me get better with the writing process. The story I wrote was based on a person I know that had his mother pass away. He still gets to do all the things his mother would want him to do when he gets older. This is just one story and I can already see that I will have other stories to come. I would highly recommend this book to anybody who loves stories or art in general. Thank you."

Write a positive review about a good book:  "The one thing to come out of this novel is that it takes some courage to tell a story about sexual harassment,"  Laura Miller, Amazon reviewer. "The one place where I could make out a character's identity, and I found it very hard to accept (no pun intended) was the scene in which the male protagonist was about to go on stage at a dinner party. That was the one place in the story where the author made me really uncomfortable,"  Erin McCaffrey, Amazon review. "There is no denying that the story was a challenge for me. I could not find words for all the things that occurred to me in the course of that story, and in the middle of it, I had to get up and leave the room. I felt I could feel it all. "  Amy Pyle, Amazon reader. "I was thoroughly enthralled by the book; not the main focus, but I was deeply entertained, too. It was very interesting how the author handled so many different topics without getting bogged down in minutiae or just getting boring. I was totally invested, as was my son,"  Sarah, Amazon Reviews. The author uses "staged" situations to illustrate the ways people handle harassment, and how they deal with their own responses and reactions. As an example, the protagonist has to deal with her son's attempts to convince her that her career choices are "a waste of time." "This was not a plot-based novel, but rather a story that followed the protagonist through all the stages of dealing with harassment and the various ways she dealt with the harassment."  Barbara H. White, Amazon Review. The novel is filled with both humorous and realistic moments.  "The book is very well written, and if you find yourself in the same situation as the protagonist, you will not be disappointed. Although it may not be the subject of the book, it is certainly worth mentioning."  Linda B. Gersh, Amazon Customer Review.  For additional information about this book, visit the website for the author,  Laura Mulvihill. "Sexual harassment is a problem that is widespread in society today. Many people are victims of it every day. It is the responsibility of writers to create stories about those people and to show that there are other ways of dealing and surviving.  Ms. Mulvhill's story was both powerful and poignant; it resonated with the reader.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book, its simple, and it gives you a great overview on the issues facing our country today. A great guide to the future we are creating. I would recommend this book and anyone interested in what's happening in our society    I am an American, and I love it   I had never heard of such issues as the "American Dream", until I read this book. A simple and easy to understand story, with interesting stories in between, this book will leave the reader thinking about what we have created in this country that has become so successful and is now being destroyed.  The world has become much less safe, and this nation is now the focus of threats to our freedoms. I have grown tired of the politicians on both sides of the political aisle giving the American people bad advice to help them achieve what has been accomplished by those in power for far too long, and that is a better life for their families, and the country. I am not for an endless war on terrorism. The world is not going to stand for it, the terrorists want our attention and their time on this earth is limited, and they have every reason to do whatever it takes to gain our attention, and our support. So, I ask you to consider the fact that the best way to stop terror attacks is to stop them before they start. I urge you to read this and learn how to stop terrorists before it is too late. So I guess you can call me a very pro-American, if you want. But I am tired of our country being the focus for threats from our government. So we have a chance to get back on track, to stop the wars that are not working, and get back to creating a better world, for our children and grandchildren. We will have a strong economy, if we do what is right for our country. This book will keep you occupied for a few days, and you will know the real problems our country faces, and we are ready for them.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  I was just looking through the series when I read that the last book was going to be out in April and I decided to get it as soon as I could. I was pleased to find that I really liked it. I like stories that are more realistic than the others so this book did not surprise me. I enjoyed it, though. I do want to read more of these characters and I like how the author has the characters grow. I also liked the way they wrote about the people that they met along the way. I could not stop reading it. It was not long until I found out that I liked this book. It did get a bit tedious after the first couple of books, but it was a good way to get my feet wet in the series. I will probably end up reading some of the other books in the other series.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:...................................  I love this book. It is such a clear and accessible introduction to the topic that is so often glossed over. It covers everything from the history of medicine to what really happened in that infamous Chicago fire. It even discusses some of the myths surrounding the fire that are often repeated by conspiracy theorists. The author does not pull any punches in discussing the issues and the controversy surrounding it, as well as a couple of the key players who have been at the center of it all. This is not a book for those looking for a straight forward explanation of what happened. This book is an interesting read for those who are interested in what went on in that fire and why. It also gives some insight on the controversy that still surrounds it. This was an excellent book and I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- I have been trying to find the true origins of the word "wacky" for quite a while, and I've found very little information, but here it is from a book I can't find today, but which I believe was written in the early days of the 20th century: "The term 'wacky' or 'wildness' came from the New England settlers, who called all the country they settled 'Wilderness.' It was a harsh, harsh and wild land. The name was originally used for the wild, unbridged country that was beyond the limits of the settlements they were building. It was called 'Wack' or Wack-Land'.... "The 'wild' or the 'wilderness' was used in a figurative sense, as in 'The wild horse will not eat a potato.' The use of 'wack' and 'waffle' in 'wanker' and in 'fuzzy' was also found in that early period.... "There was a certain type of humoristic word play, to which 'waffles' and other terms in that group were sometimes applied in New England in the last years of the century. Thus, for instance, when a man is 'waffling about,' it is an expression of surprise, to wit: 'You're going to get me waffled.'"  From the book: "A 'wanky' is someone who is waggishly stupid. A 'wazza' is a person who is a wazza. A wazzle is a term of address for a wazzler. 'A wazzel' is to 'wazzle.' A wanker is a man with a very wild hair and a very strange face. The most typical of all the terms used by men of that time is the 'wally' who looks like an old man sitting on his butt with his hair blowing and his beard swinging wildly, with no eyebrows and no nose. 'Wacky' comes from the same idea. A cowboy is a 'wandy.'" ...  "I love the 'Awwwwwwwww!' I get when the baby gets all high and mighty and starts playing. It means "I love you" or "I'm so glad you're here." I also love the word 'waggy,' for the 'yodeling' when the child is on the potty. 'Oh, my

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- The book is great. It was very informative and made me look for books that covered this topic. The only thing I wish would have been included is an index. I found some good information but not all of it. I think a better index would have made the book go even faster. Review: I wanted to like this book. I know the concept is not new and I'm sure the ideas and concepts are, but it just seems a bit over the top, to me. First off, I know it's a science book, but I wasn't sure what the author was trying to say or how he was going to approach it. He seemed to be very into his own subject of physics, which I can understand, but then it seemed like he spent more time describing his own ideas about the world and its physics than actually explaining it. So the first half of the book was good. He spent some time talking about some of his findings on the world's gravitational attraction. But it seemed as though he was trying so hard to get a point across to us, that he had nothing good to say. The second half was great. I was really interested in what he was saying because I love science! His theory really makes sense. But then it would seem like he is only talking about his work. I understand his science, but not how he is describing it. But I didn't like how he kept talking about himself. I find his self-centeredness and ego-stroking to be a bit creepy and annoying. I also would have liked a better cover or a list of references. I hope to have the opportunity to read the book later. Maybe he will write another one. My thoughts: I was really excited to start reading this book, even though I am not a physics student. I am a real science nerd. I love the idea of the theory and it sounds intriguing. I really wanted to understand the idea more so that I could better explain what I know about physics. However, the first few chapters were just the boring physics, not even touching the theory. I would have really appreciated more in-depth explanation of the physics before starting to work on the math. The math was really boring, and at times I found myself re-reading the same section over and over. Also, the chapters where they mention the gravitational force on a flat plane seemed really unnecessary. I don't believe that the gravity theory was new, it was just put in

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was very pleased with this book. The first book I've read about the world of magic in the Harry Potter universe. The Harry Potter series is a great series, with a fantastic plot and a huge fan following. As far as the fantasy genre goes, this was a little hard to place, I loved it and I'm glad I picked it up. I also loved the descriptions of the book, it gave you all of the details of the world. Also, the author gives the backstory of each character. This gives a more personal feel and makes the reading feel very realistic. It was a really great read.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------I've read a lot of books in my lifetime. I've tried a number of ways to learn from the books I've read and, while many of them have helped me, none of them has been more effective than the books written by the late, great, and amazing John Hughes. I have found that there are a number ways to read John Hughes' books and I will list them here for your convenience:1. The "How to be a Movie Star" series - You can start from the beginning, from the first movie (The Breakfast Club) and work your way through them. This method will teach you how to be "actor" from the bottom up (you have to actually be the actor). Most of them were actually written by John and the "How" series is a part of the "how".2. The books on how to do improv - They are usually published in John's own name and they will give you a lot to think about while you're doing your improv. You will also learn how to play the game "How do I make fun of this other actor's idea?".3. The films and other projects by the director John Hughes - There are a great many great films and John is the director. All you have to do is remember the things you would do if you were the director and you will learn some great things.4. The series of books written for actors - They were originally written for the stage, but they're so useful to actors that I thought you could use them while acting. A great example of this is the "What Every Actor Needs to Know".5. John's blog - John's blogs are a wonderful source of inspiration and information about the business of acting. You can read about the inner workings of his business, tips for actors about acting and also, the life of a professional actor. His blog has a lot more to offer than "How-to-act-in-an-action-film-yourself" articles.6. John himself - You really need to read a number (maybe as many as 20) of his books. I don't recommend anything else when it comes to John's work. John really is a genius. If you want to read the best (most) books about acting, then I recommend you to visit "John's website". This website is a great source of information about acting. There are many articles about acting that are written by real actors and then there are other articles written

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- This book was not what I expected. It was written by a man who is either a masochist, or a sadist (but not both), or a masocore (and definitely not a masicore). It was an unadulterated, and very explicit, erotic story. It is well written and very graphic, and is definitely a keeper.

In the last paragraph, a boy is mentioned that had to leave school because of bullies and he said to his teacher "I need to do something, before something like this happens to me again. What is that?" I wonder if the author would feel the same way about his own experience, being bullied as a child. The book ends with the boy stating he has no regrets.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read several books by Mrs. B. P. Robinson, and although I don't find them particularly engaging, I really enjoy the style and the style of the writing. This one had me on the edge of my seat for about 40 pages before I had to put the book down. I do not know how she manages to write so quickly and to convey so much information, but it has been a fun ride. She has brought forth her own opinion about the subject matter and uses the language that best fits her own thoughts. I'm very happy that I had the chance to read this book. I liked this book so much that I decided to take a second look at the two other novels by Mrs B. Robinson. She is so talented, and this third book is just as good. Best Book Ever! This book is fantastic. The writing is brilliant and the characters are great. I cannot wait to read the next book by Mrs Robinson. A New Author is on to me! I received this book as a Christmas gift and had an absolute blast reading it! A New Author definitely gets my vote as the best book ever!!! I can't decide whether to pick this up or not. This is a well written novel and I have high expectations for the third book. The book will probably be very different from the last two books but I can't wait! I must admit, I fell in love with the characters. I couldn't stop reading because I loved them all. I have read other novels and this book has taken the cake. It is as good as they come. This was one of the first books I ever bought, and I don I was surprised by the writing style. I really loved it, and was excited for the next few books that Mrs Robinson was working on. The main character is absolutely adorable. She reminds me of a dog, only a little bigger and with a slightly longer tail. I just want to make my own dog, because I think they are so adorable!

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read the first 3-4 chapters. This is a pretty solid book that would appeal to all levels of readers. I'm in the 'intro to science' category, so it's a good introduction to the ideas in the book, especially the concept of non-complementary attractors and the idea that the electron and the nucleus are one of many types of particles that make up the fundamental building blocks of nature. I love these kind of books. I think they show that there is so much there that people are just not aware of. It's not easy to grasp, but once you get it the rest is easy. I'd recommend it to anyone, and I hope that they'll enjoy it as well.  I've only read a little of the first 4 chapters. I am currently in the final steps of learning Haskell and this has been really good for getting a good feel for the language. It is definitely a different experience from what I'm used to but not painful.  I'd highly recommend to anyone wanting a more "real world" type of experience. This book should get you started on your way there.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________ I read the first half of this book on the bus ride home from work last weekend, but I couldn't get through the last third on the way to work the following day. It was too depressing to sit on the porch reading by myself all day, so I had to get in to work early the next day. This book is very well written and I loved the way it made you think. I was just sad that it wasn't more about the journey and not just the destination. It's all about the "road" (that is, the travel) of the young couple. It makes the trip a little depressing, but it's all part of the journey.  Was this review helpful to you?

Very good for people who want to improve their writing.   in particular, you have to learn how to find good ideas.

I read this book in several days because I was so lazy to find the answer on google! I had to study for several days (more than 4 hours every day) before I can actually start writing. I had so much time to read that the book had me in the end.     It can be very boring sometimes, especially if you want to be sure that you don't forget anything.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I know the title was a little weird but when I realized that I was a writer I thought it would be fun to be able to write a book that could become part of my real life. The story is a fun little romp with lots of fun characters and it was interesting seeing the various stories she tells. It was a fun read but there is one that was somewhat annoying. It makes me laugh every time but it does not make it funny for the reader. So, maybe I can't recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a fun and interesting romp in the woods with other people. But if you're looking for an easy read, this might be your book.

I liked it because, like I said, the author, Michael Whelan, is an excellent writer, who can write about a wide range of topics in a way that is understandable by a wide variety of people. The characters were believable, and the story was well written. The story was about how a group of friends became a band, the best band in town, and they are very popular on the road. It was a very enjoyable read, and I will definitely be checking out the next novel, because the characters are very much the same, and each of them have their own stories. I was looking forward to reading this one for many years, as I have been a huge fan of Michael Wohlans work. This is a great addition to his career."   -C. G.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I was so intrigued by this book that I had to give it a chance. This is a story of a person who, due to her disability, is unable to drive or get around on her own. She is a little girl who has been in and out of foster care since she was very young. She was in a foster home when she was about 4 years old and it wasn't too long after that that her mother went into foster care and never returned. She has been on and off of drugs for most of her life and is a real addict. Her best friend was the person who took her in when she went into the foster home. She would run away to visit her. When she was 4 years of age her mother finally managed to get her into a foster family and it was there that she met a beautiful girl, named Sarah. Sarah was a little person with short brown hair and blue eyes and very pretty. She had been in foster care for a while and Sarah's parents were going through a lot. She lived in the house with her mother who had to go to work and did not have time to care for her daughter. She ran away from her foster home and she had no idea where she was going. When Sarah ran away, the foster mother was so happy to see her that she took her with her to her new foster home where she lived. She got the best of both worlds: she was home with her sister but was able to care about her own needs as well. This book was a good read because, like the book itself, Sarah has problems. She loves playing with people but she wants to be able to be herself. She wants to dress and behave like herself. The problems of her foster mother are mentioned but we never see her in the foster care. She comes to know her foster sister Sarah as a friend and she has very fond memories of her. Sarah is like a little sister to her and the book ends with Sarah having been reunited with her family. There are many stories in this book about Sarah and how she is an excellent sister, friend, girlfriend and student. I recommend this book to anyone with any disabilities who wants to read a book that is a good story of overcoming hardships and challenges. I also found that the author put her own problems into the background of this story. I am not the same person I was then and she knew that so I never felt she was taking something out of me to make the story about me.
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------ I bought this book because I was looking for a quick read. I had a few questions before I bought, and this book answered most of them. While not as clear as the books I used to have as a kid (which were printed on a much more expensive paper), this one is much easier to read. It doesn't take as much time to read, and that's nice. The kids love it. I did have one problem, though. It took a little while for my 4 year old to be able to read it, and it took him a long time to figure out what was what. The text seemed to be a little hard for him to understand, but once he figured it out, it made a lot more sense. Other than that, I recommend this book!

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------- I have been trying to get a copy of the  Book of Eucharist for about 15 years now, and finally got it over Christmas 2014. What a book! What a profound spiritual journey this was. What an experience! I have tried the "orthodox" Christian books and failed miserably. But with the book by Bishop Kostrikos and the articles by Bishop Pappas, I think I may finally be able to understand the Orthodox faith. For those who have never heard of the Book of the Eucharistic Sacrifice, please allow me to give a quick summary. The Book of Divine Worship, or "The Orthodox Way of Worship," is the "way" of worship in the Church. It is the way of Christ the Savior through the Church of the first and second millennium of our Church. The Church as the Body of Christ is the visible witness to the One true Church. So this book is a work of love between a man named Nicholas Kostrakos, who is a lay man in the Greek Orthodox Church of Constantinople, and a layman named Father Gabriel Pappasin. The way is not about being a "good Christian" or being "religious." The Orthodox Way is the path of God to the people of God as an answer to the question, "What does God want from us?" We do not ask, "How does God love me?" We seek God by being the people God loves the most. God is not a god of judgment or of condemnation, but of unconditional love. It does not matter what your denomination says, you are already the beloved of God. The book is not very long, but it is well written and filled with the Orthodox way of worship, its history and its practice. Most of all, it is filled with great spiritual wisdom, so that the reader can not only know that this is the true path to God but that it is God's will for us to be God's people. The reader may be asked, "Is this the way that the Church taught?" The answer is yes, but in much more than the Church teaches. The book is filled not only with the truth but with the teaching of the Church's most holy and ancient Fathers on God and on the people. This is the only way to understand God's teaching and to know what God is really trying to communicate to us. I highly recommend it to any person who is interested in God's Word and in the true Church of

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________ I am enjoying this book very much. It was a very challenging book at first and it can get really tiresome if you read a lot of it but now that I've finished it I am finding it really worth the time spent. I love it when books are challenging and I found this book was a great example. If you want something really unique and original this is definitely the book for you. The author was smart in his choice of words to make it seem like he was trying to explain something he didn't know but he was actually trying to make sense of the data. This book is great!

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------ This book will be required reading for the freshman class I teach. It is concise, clear, and full of examples that will help the students remember. The examples show you where to look, how to look at, and what to look for. The writing is clean and easy to understand, and there are no spelling errors.  Overall: --------------- It is a very good read. It contains useful examples and is informative, which is very important for students. For the price, I think it is worth reading.  (This book is not available in the U.S.)
Write a positive review about a good book:  A wonderful read! The book's great. The story is excellent. The characters are all wonderful. The ending is unexpected. The narrator's voice is a wonderful mix of innocence and passion. My husband and I both enjoyed the story. It's definitely a good time with wonderful stories, even if it's just a few pages at a time. I highly recommend this book. Picking up the book I was expecting a bit more than the first time. This time it was definitely a book I wanted to finish but I had to put it down for awhile as I got so distracted by the story (and the illustrations.) The first part is great and the second part was a bit much (especially for a little book like this) but overall I really liked this part of the story and the characters. I did have one minor problem with the first part though and that was the fact that I couldn't get out of the house and the whole family could hear me talking about the book. I read it inside a bookshop so maybe I should have waited. It would have been nice to have some audio/visual in the book, too. However, I did really enjoy the book and I definitely recommend this one.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The best science fiction/fantasy I've read.   This book's got all the right ingredients for a very good book.  The protagonist is smart, charming, and has interesting thoughts and opinions. He is also a little weird, and that's not something you want in your science fiction. The story itself is very good, and it will appeal to any science fiction fan. The author also manages to do a good job of introducing readers to new concepts (in both science fiction and fantasy) with each new chapter.  If you like science fiction, fantasy, historical fiction, or just good books, this book will be a great place to start.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********************* I found this book a wonderful introduction to the world of linguistics. Not only did it teach the reader about the basic principles of language, but it gave a little history of the field as well. The author did a good job of explaining what a 'linguistic' study is, and why it's necessary to study it. I liked that she explained why languages are organized as they are. It was clear that some linguists believe that all languages are one language, others have a hierarchical arrangement, and still others think that there are multiple levels in the hierarchy of language. Some linguists are interested in language structure, and some in the communication processes that occur between people of different language groups. The book is filled with examples of how people use language in their daily lives. I think this book will provide many more people with the motivation to learn the basic concepts and language of linguists.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I like this book. The story is well told and I liked the ending. I did not like the fact that the author left out any of the details about the last day of her life, or the last 5 minutes before death. She should have described them in detail. And what is the point of having a "good death?" It could not be any easier. That's why it should not be told. The only thing that I would change is that the name of the school was spelled wrong, but I like a spelling mistake. It does not take away from the book. It was well written and I like the ending and the way she ended it. It made it feel like a different story and not like a ghost story. It is an entertaining read but it is only a ghost book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Good Earth by Rhea Perlman. I really enjoyed this book, and really enjoyed the narrator (who did a great job). I liked that it wasn't your typical romance where you get a guy with a hot wife, and then she's gone for a few years...instead it's more of the traditional type of love that you know and love. The main reason why I loved it is because there were so many different perspectives that you could relate to...it made the book a lot more believable and realistic. There's a huge amount of sex scenes, both for the girls and the boys. If I were to write my own book...I'd add more female characters that weren't "baddies"...but the book was already so good that I really didn't need to add a bunch of female characters for the guys.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book on the subject. It explains how the various parts of the brain work together to form an intuitive memory, but what it leaves out is a little bit of the science of how those connections are made and the part of the process that is missing. You'll also find a bit of humor here and there. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to get into the science and the details of how we learn.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "Dangerous Men" was amazing. The characters were rich, the plot captivating, the language well written and well paced.  The story was an interesting twist, even if I didn't see it coming.

I would highly recommend this book and I'll definitely be checking out the rest of the series.

Write a positive review about a good book:............................................................  "Crisper, more nuanced, and more entertaining than the book's main character."  Read all the way through, including a section on the different genres:...........................  It's a book about the nature of fiction; a book that is not about one book or genre (as many other books are), but about fiction in the broadest possible sense of the word.   This is a great book to read for a variety of reasons, not least of which is the excellent writing style. As with many works of this kind, it is difficult to get through to the end without laughing; this is not an easy thing to do! However, the humour is also very clever, and does not come across as patronising.  .  I have recently read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy and they are excellent. They are epic, full of wonder, and have a very rich and complex world.   to make the most of the book, I would recommend you read at least The Hobbit; then, read The Lord (or The Elf) if you have not, and then read all the other books.

Write a positive review about a good book:.............................My friend told me about this book and I was really interested to find out about it. It is about a boy and girl who are the first ones in their whole village to be able to fly in a plane. As you would expect it is a story about the boy and a girl and their adventures. It also has some funny parts. It was the only book I can remember where I found out that the boy has two moms! This is also the book where I learned that the girl is not really his sister but his girlfriend and when she says that he doesn't think she is his sister she is not lying...She's actually his sister. It wasn't a bad read, although I found it a bit confusing at times but this was because it was really just the book it was based on. It's just really fun to read about a group of teenagers living in a small town and how they fly. It might be one of the funniest stories of all the ones I've read in my life. I highly recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book: **********"I just finished this book. I am a mother of two teenage daughters, and it was so refreshing to read about a mother who puts her own needs and desires ahead of her kids. She is so well read and she has a voice. My oldest is 16 and she reads it with passion. I don't think I have ever heard someone say 'you do not know what I'm going through' with as much passion and confidence as she does. We have a very close relationship with her as I can't be around her enough. She has done a fantastic job raising her girls and I'm so proud of her. There are so many great lessons in this book."**********   I really enjoy books with a happy ending, so this was such a great one. I can think of a lot of reasons why people are unhappy or unhappy about their life, and if there is something I think I can learn from my life it is that everyone has things to learn and learn from in their life. There is nothing wrong with the life choices I have made, I am happy in my life, I have a great family, I work hard every day, I do my best, I put the most effort into things I do, and I am good with myself. If I had gone down a different road, I believe I would have learned a lot. There can be great sadness in life but there can also be great joy and the key is recognizing the things that make you feel joy, and then doing something about it.   There was no way I would buy this book if it were not going to be about a happy home. The first thing I wanted to do was make the girl happy. I could see that I was doing things right as a parent if her daughter was happy. She was really nice and attentive to her needs and wishes, which were all good ones. She knew exactly what she wanted and when she had it. She had a great sense of humor which I really admired. She seemed happy, and she could tell when it was time for her to get off the computer and put her feet up. I couldn't wait to get home, so I read a lot and read a little and read more. I found out a lot about my daughter and I think she will appreciate this book even more.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God."  That's a great message of peace. A great message. I love it. A very good book. I wish I had been around in the early part of the 20th Century for more than 15 years. I read it in the late 70s and early 80s and that was a long time ago. I found the stories very exciting. The characters are interesting and compelling. The stories are gripping. I was captivated. I felt the story was told in an accessible manner. That makes it so great for kids.  I also liked the concept of the world. I thought it was an interesting take on it. I could tell that the authors were familiar with the science, but they really put their own twist on it and I felt a sense of amazement that they would be able to pull it off.  If you have kids around you will love this book.  My only disappointment was that it was not available in a trade paperback. That made it even better. 4.0 / 5 stars

Write a positive review about a good book: *************   "It is one of the most well-written novels I have read. The narrator, Mark Harris is superb. He is as good as he is good-looking. He has a great range of emotions and a great sense of the world. He gives us the feeling that we are sitting next to him as he goes through the events he is narrating. A very good narrator. I will have to listen to his other books too."   I've been listening to the audiobook of this book on my commute to work for almost three weeks now. I bought it last week and started reading on a short weekend. I loved it immediately. In fact, I can't remember when I was not enjoying reading. It was very enjoyable to hear how the characters lived their daily lives and how their world was changing from the beginning of the book (not the end of the first chapter). It's a very nice story, full of surprises and well-developed characters and the characters themselves were well-drawn. The first chapter was very funny and I loved the fact that it took place in a different city than in the book.   When I read the book I didn't think it was going to be a hard read. I was expecting this book to be an easy read. But it turned out to be different. I can feel it. This book is a bit more complex than the book that I read. It's not that it is more complicated, it's that it has more parts. The author wrote this book with more layers. The book takes place in two different worlds: the old world of old Japan and the new world of modern Japan. The old Japanese world is very traditional and it is very different from the new Japanese world. The world of the old Japan is very simple and pure and it's easy to get lost in the beauty and innocence of the characters in this story. They are simple and good in every way. They have been raised with the simple and wholesome beliefs and values in their society. They aren't educated and they don't know how to do anything new. They don't have to be because there are other people who have been trained to do everything. They can only hope to be good enough for their parents and grandparents to raise them. These people are good at what they do and have made good choices in life. They live in an idealized version of their own culture and society, a perfect world.  ...

Write a positive review about a good book: ************* My dad just read this on a plane, and I think it is an excellent story. He's an avid hunter, and this is a great piece of hunting literature. It is very factual, and gives great pictures of what goes on on the trail. The book has some great stories to tell, and it is very informative and entertaining. I have several hunting books on my bookshelf already, so this one will not be on the list for me, but it will be nice to have for sure. ********* My Dad is a hunter, he has also read and enjoyed many others. The only thing I am not happy about is that this is about hunters. If you are not an avid shooter, then this book is not for you. ****************************** I bought this for my son, he's 16, and he loves it! This book tells about his hunting trip to Texas last summer. I am pretty sure he is going to read this over and over again. He was excited to learn about it, but was a little worried it would be too much. However, he found it very interesting, and very well written.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________   I have read the two volumes of this series, and I do not understand how a person could read just one of these books and be able to make such a claim, that the author is the only one able to explain the true nature of this "demon" who is killing people.   The story of the "demon", his evil powers, and how his human host is "freed" of his demon-like powers are all very well done. However the author fails to explain how he got that kind of power in the first place, but his story continues with him developing "new" powers, which he doesn't really explain at all.   a book about a demon who's powers are completely explained to the reader with no real explanation.   at least this one will be interesting. _______________________________________________   "I have always been a little disturbed by that aspect, as the power to do what he does has always been something that has fascinated me and always had a sense of mystery. To have the chance to write about that aspect of this character is a real privilege." -Lionel Shriver   ****************************************   This book, and all the other books in the "Demon" series, is a true horror book. The plot of this book is incredibly complex and well thought out. The characters, the plot lines, and the overall storyline of this story are truly well thought-out.

This is a classic book for horror fans.   on my shelf: 10 out of 10 ______________________________________   review from the "reading group"   Read my thoughts:   It's the best "demonology" series ever written! This is the first book in the series, "Demon Seed" which chronicles the life of a young demon. The main characters are: Aisha and her demonic brother. The story of their life is really interesting and well written. The demons in this book have very complex, unique and frightening powers. The author gives the demons a great deal of information and also gives us a great many of the demons personal thoughts about themselves. The descriptions of demons in the story are just so vivid and the writing style so good that I couldn't put this book down. The book was a very good read and I am looking forward to the other two books. (this review has also been posted to my Facebook page by a friend of mine)

Write a positive review about a good book: *************************I don't normally read novels. I usually just listen to audiobooks or watch movies instead. My favorite audiobook is "The Hunger Games" and it's by the talented Philip Roth. However, I have to admit that this book was good. I thought it would be a typical, boring fantasy story where a king goes through all the trials and tribulations and gets his revenge on the person that murdered his father. But, it was not. It was much more exciting and action-packed than I was expecting. I was totally shocked when I saw how much blood was spilled. The story was well-researched, funny and suspenseful. It ended with a cliffhanger which I'm sure is going to be a lot of fun to read all over again. The magic system was amazing. I loved seeing what kind of spells would work and which spells would hurt the characters and which ones would help them. It made the magic system feel real and not just an imaginary force which was more of a magic in the world than real. And that's what I really liked about this book. Not only was the magic believable, the magic felt real. I had a good time reading this book and was glad I picked it up. ***********************I'm not sure if I am allowed to say this, but I loved this book from page one. I liked it so much that I read it multiple times over. My only complaint is that the story was very predictable at the start. I found that the first few books in the series were just like that. But the later books I felt more like it was a story that was unfolding in my head. It kept changing and new things were added and taken away which made it more realistic. I read a lot in the last year but I read this book like one big chunk of a book. I finished it while I was on my honeymoon to Hawaii. I can honestly say that this was the best thing that happened in my life in a long time. I feel like everything went according to plan.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* It's a well written novel which I enjoy reading. The main plot was not very complicated at all. I am a first time reader so this book was quite enjoyable. I liked the way they explained things so that you could understand the plot. The story was very easy to understand.   The only criticism I have is that the book did not follow the exact plot line and the characters kept changing, the main characters in one book turned out to be quite different in the next. I also found it quite confusing to read and I could not follow most of the dialog. It's my first time reading a YA novel so I think that it may not be the best for my taste. Still, it was a good read and if you enjoy reading YA, I recommend this one.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend it to people who love good books and are into romance. This is a pretty good book for a romantic reader. I read this with a group of people who were new to the genre and it didn't give any of the books it was comparing to a bad review. It gave an overall positive review. I think a book like this could be a fun introduction to the romance genre for the romantic reader and I would recommend this to a reader that loves romance, but isn't familiar with the genre.

The characters are amazing and the author created amazing characters to make you feel for these characters!

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- "One of the finest histories I have read. The author gives us a detailed account of the long-standing conflict in Afghanistan. The story was well told and the writing excellent. It is an essential work in the history of the Afghan people. It should be read by everyone who wants to understand the history and culture of our war against Communism. The war in Afghanistan will never be over for the Afghan, their culture and their beliefs. The book is a powerful testament to the resistance of a people to their oppression. I have been a combat soldier for almost 30 years now and I must say that I have not seen such a well written, well presented and well researched account of a war. It gives the reader a good idea of what was going on in Afghanistan and in particular a good picture of the life of the people in rural areas of Afghanistan who were being attacked by the communists. The Afghans who fought the war are not heroes, they are victims. One cannot make up their beliefs or try to force their beliefs on them. They knew what they were doing. The people who are today leading the country have no clue about the true character of the Afghans. As a result we have now thousands of dead Afghans, who were fighting against Communism." -- Colonel, USA (Retired) -------------------------

It's a great book about how to start a business and I've been using it with a client who is very involved with her business, and we just started a new business on our side. It is really easy to follow and the author, Jim Collins, is a great presenter of his knowledge. I also love his book on how to be successful in life.

I used it to research for my future project on Satanism and this is the only book I have found that really covers the subject and provides enough information for anyone to do their own research and understand it for themselves.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I am enjoying the book a lot and have read it again and again. There was a lot to like about this book but there were a few things I wanted to point out before reviewing. First, I just wish this book had more depth in it. A lot of the discussion is in the first half of the book but at the end of the first part, the book feels like a mini book, which made it harder to follow the discussion of how people in different cultures are using certain devices. Secondly, there is a lack of female characters in this book. While there were some female characters that were in the book (Hannah), they were secondary to the male characters (Michael). I felt that they should have been more prominent, but that's just my personal opinion. The third thing that bothered me was the ending, which was a bit abrupt, especially since there are a few more books in the series that have not been released yet. I understand that there was a deadline for the book, and it had to be done quickly but the ending felt a bit too rushed. Also, I felt the book was quite long, and I found it hard to follow. One last thing I will mention is that this is an excellent book for young readers to read. The character development is very good and the storyline is very interesting. I have already recommended this book to my son and my daughter. I would highly recommend this book and will be looking forward to the next books in this series. 4 of 5 stars based on 9 reviews
Write a positive review about a good book: __________.  I can not recommend this book enough.  It is not the best book out there. I know that sounds bad.  I am going to have to write a bad review.  There are so many good things in this book, and I wish it was a little better.  This is just an amazing, life changing book about a mother who had her life changed the night she discovered how to breastfeed. I have gone from being a scared, confused woman with no experience with a baby who I would not call perfect, to an experienced mommy who is making my baby laugh with her amazing art, and a mommy I can be proud of.  Her story and advice are the best ever.    Her book has changed my life.  A life I was not sure I wanted, but would not have imagined would have happened to me.   The book is very easy to follow and has a lot of great information about breastfeeding.  The author, Erin Pizzey, was an amazing mother herself who is an inspiring mother of two children now in their late 30s.  She is also an activist and author of the book, The Power of Positive Thinking.  If you are looking for an easy to understand, life-changing book about breastfeeding that includes lots of great practical tips, then this is definitely a great place to start. We had a great time reading this book.  Erin PIZZEY!

Write a positive review about a good book:  I really liked this book. It's a very well-written, clear-thinking book about the issues facing the Christian church today.  This book was very well written, and has a clear point of view that was well-expressed.    My only problem with the book was that I wish there was a better explanation of the church's need for reform, or the fact that there was such an issue with the church and the lack of a clear definition of salvation in 1st century.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a fun read, even if it isn't what you'd expect from the author.  I enjoyed it, but not to the extent that I wanted to read it again.  This is an interesting topic to read.   "The Devil is in the Details" By Brian G. Stavish (2006) "In an alternate reality, a group of young adults find themselves transported to a strange alien world where the government has taken over.  It's an Earth where the Nazis are still around, where the Soviets are the world's sole superpower, and where a global epidemic has turned mankind into the living dead, but it is also a world that is a thousand years ahead of its time.  When one of the few humans left, Jack, discovers that a group known as the Guardians are trying to prevent this future from occurring, the pair must do their best to stop the madness before it is too late." "I was looking forward to this book, but after reading the synopsis, I was a little disappointed.  I was expecting something a little different, something that would give it a bit of a different flavor.  But the book itself had very little to do with this "alternate reality" that the synopsis described.  And it is very much like any other thriller or mystery.  The book is set in a very well known, if somewhat obscure, fictional universe.  Unfortunately, as I mentioned before, it doesn't do anything new or interesting with it.  In fact, it just follows the basic template that you'll find in most popular mystery fiction.  If you want to experience a very unique and compelling story, go to the source.  For this kind of story, however, you're better off with a well known and much better written mystery novel. I liked this book.  Stavishing manages to write a fun and engaging novel, while still being respectful of the source material.  There is nothing here that would keep me reading for more than a couple of chapters, however.  As a side note, the cover for this book features a drawing of one of my favorites-- the Grim Reaper.

I didn't want to do the same things I did before. , I was still at the top of my game as a freelancer. That's the only job I ever wanted and I wanted a different kind of challenge. I wanted to build things from scratch and work on a personal level. The freedom that comes with being an entrepreneur is amazing. You work on your own terms and you're responsible for your own projects. I have to say that having a wife who can pick up the kids whenever she wants is a huge benefit as well.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________ This is a very good book on what is going on with the world and the way we have gone about it. It is a great read, especially if you want to know how we got here. You may just find it the answer to some of your questions. - David P.  "This book is for people that have a strong conviction that we are living in the most dangerous and chaotic age in our world's history." - Daniel P. Schaeffer, PhD  ____________________________________________________________________________________________  In short, I highly recommend this book as a good overview of the situation. ... I don't recommend it, however, if you are in favor of an "alternative" to democracy. There is nothing wrong with democracy per se, but I don?t think it is the best or the only answer. It might be the best answer for the people that we have in the US (and for many other countries), but it is not the best solution for the rest of the world. "Many politicians are trying to convince us that we need an alternative to democracy and are working on this for several years, but no one has a serious proposal and no one, even the "populist" candidates, really want to give us an alternative." - Dr. David P., professor at Cornell University  . The book is well written and very well researched..  If I had to make only one comment about this book, it would be, "this is exactly what you don't want to read." It's not just the arguments, it's the fact that they never answer the question,?what is the alternative? There is no alternative. They just keep talking about the problems of democracy and the problems they say democracy creates. So I was very surprised when I got to page 70 where he said this:?In any event, one cannot go to the people and argue that democracy is the most effective way to organize our society because of its success in every country. That's a fallacy. Democracy cannot be organized in any country as well as it can be in some. Democracy is an ideology, a system of beliefs and values.? Why? What is the point of arguing the point? It doesn't matter. ,  You can get all the books in my store:  Amazon.com | Amazon.co.uk | Amazon or Indiebound.org  I hope that you find this information useful.

I really enjoyed it." -Jared  * * * *   The Life of Charlie  A classic comedy, the Life of Charles Murray has an important message to offer. In his brilliant and entertaining book, Charles Murray tells the tale of one man's search for meaning, success, and happiness. In a world in which self-interest, greed, and the pursuit of status are more important than truth and love, Murray offers us the real deal—an insider's view of a successful, successful, and beautiful life.  Murray opens his story with a story from his childhood: the day he was chosen for a job he didn't want. His father gave him the job anyway. He tells us that he learned that job-performance was measured by a simple, but powerful standard: "Did you get it?"  For Charles, the answer was a quick, "Yes." And it was true. His employer gave him every resource and encouragement to do the job right. Yet as Charles says, "If you get a job, do it well." He was fired, but not for lack of trying. He took the job again, but in a different company. He says he got hired because of his superior interviewing skills. His job performance was good, but he was not satisfied. He asked if he could do it any better and the answer he got was "No."  Why? Because in the real world, there is only one true way to get a good job, and that's to work as hard as you can. Charles Murray goes to the office every day and goes home at night. He studies as hard and as hard, and then gets up the next morning and does it all over again.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "As with any other story that involves a good number of characters, the main character's arc is, to a large extent, the story. And, it works well.   At the beginning of the book, we learn the protagonist, Jonathan M. Clements, as a young man, is coming back to the state of Michigan after a hiatus of years. He has been working on a new project for a local television station (TV), which is based on a true story that his uncle had been involved in a fatal fire in his home while the children were in the house. We do not know how the fire started, but it is a major mystery, and Jonathan wants to solve it. At the time of the fire, Jonathan had been away from his family for several years, so he was not familiar with the state in which he lives, and we are given the opportunity to find out that he had lived in Michigan during the mid- to late-sixties.   with the mystery and the time period in mind, we find out he is coming home to deal with the fire. What we find in the meantime is that his new project has brought him back to Michigan.   a good thing, as it was the setting of his story. What he comes back to is not a happy situation. As soon as he arrives home he finds out his family has been killed in an arson. He goes to the station to get the facts of the case and a fire investigator, who is a close friend of his uncle, shows up to question him about the fire in the basement and whether the fire is suspicious. The fire investigator tells him that the fire was suspicious because the place smelled of a gas line and it did not seem there were any other signs of a fire. Jonathan has already determined it was suspicious.  ... the story is told with an easy to follow and descriptive style that makes you want to find what the story has to tell you.   the story starts well and develops well. Jonathan and his uncle get a lot of information about the case that is hard to believe at first. They do not come in and tell it to Jonathan, instead they let Jonathan investigate it. It is interesting to see how well they both come to understand the case. We are shown all sides of the story, but especially Jonathan's. The book's main plot is not the main attraction, but what really hooked me and kept me reading through was the character development. Jonathan M

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald.  I read this book when I was in high school.  I was also in my "middle" years in highschool, so the book really stuck with me.    I think I know a lot more about Fitzgerald and about his writing and art than I did before reading this book.  My mom and I had a book group at her school, but I was out of school, so I never read more than one book from the book group per year.  I read a lot of fiction in high schools, and it was generally pretty average.  In my first book group, I picked up The Good Soldier by L.M. Montgomery and The Gently-Weighed Bullet by M.E. Cooney.  The Good Gunby M. E. Cooley is a classic.  While my friends and I liked these books, I wasn't a huge fan of them.   The Great American Novel is a different kind of story that is the product of many years of intense, focused, intense, intense concentration.  It is the story of a young man who goes on an extended odyssey across the United States to meet his destiny.  He goes to different cities, but he finds himself in the same place.  One of my favorite things about the book is that it doesn't feel as if it is a set of chapters but rather that it is an interconnected and interconnected journey of a single man.  With some characters, he meets a second time and they have a little reunion in a different town or location, but other characters go on their own journeys.   When I first read this I had trouble placing the chapters, and I still have a lot to learn about it.  But when you read it you realize that each of the stories are connected and that each is telling the story in a completely different way.    For me it is about a man who is searching for the meaning of life, and his journey across America is the most important part of the story.  There is a lot going on in this book that I did not understand, but the more I read the more details I discovered about this place and that there was this strange phenomenon that occurred here and that he was part of it.   The Great Gati by F. Scott  Fitzgerald  is a classic with a lot left to discover.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been on an epic reading binge (as you might have noticed) and this book just took me right back to the first few hours of reading the first Harry Potter book.   This story was like a combination of the first three books, The Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Harry Potter, Prisoner of Azkaban.   for starters, it has the same characters and places. It has Snape, Dumbledore, Dumbledore's Army, a dragon, a dementor, a plot twist, a love potion, Dumbledore being an utter bastard, and a bunch of other great moments.   in fact, I found myself almost getting bored by the time I was halfway through the book. The story was so good that it felt like the entire book was just another chapter to the main story. The first half of this book is a great intro to Harry's personality. He is young and he is getting over his anger issues and he wants to do what he wants and no one is stopping him.   of course, we get to meet a lot of new characters as well, like Draco, Ron, and Hermione. We get to see how Harry is dealing with his dad dying and how they are able to be friends.   a lot has changed about Harry since the last book, and I love it. He has a better grasp of his magic, and it shows in his books and even more so in this one. We also meet other new characters like Snape and Tonks, and learn a lot about them, their personalities, and their abilities. All in all, this is a very well written book and very good overall.  .   is it worth it?:.   this book was worth every single penny. I read it in one day and it was so much fun. It was like my first book again, but with Harry in the lead role. Snape and Dumbledore, my all-time favorite Dumbledore, were great as well. It is a fun book with great characters. It does get a little long towards the end, but I don't think that is really the book's fault. It's a great story and I recommend it to every fan of Harry Potter.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________ I'm pretty happy with the way my book turned out. The plot was interesting, the setting was rich and varied, and the characters are varied and believable. The only flaw I noticed is that the first time that the character is introduced, it's just a description of the character as "a black woman" or "a woman in a wheelchair." So I had to flip back to the beginning of the book to find out who she is. ___________________________ (reviewed 25 days after purchase)

Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book. I'm writing about my experience. There are a lot of similarities between what happens in the real world and in fantasy worlds, like how one may expect a wizard to be a bit of a "bad guy" at first, but then is taught that the world is a harsh place with some really wonderful creatures and that you must learn to be kind, but still protect the weak, etc... If it were just for one thing, I would have had this book before I was 12, or 15... but I got it as a teenager... I just wanted to read something different for a while. I was expecting a bit more from it. I enjoyed the characters... I would like to read more of them... I really liked the romance.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________   In my opinion, "Ego is the Enemy" is the best book on Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) that I have ever read.

It's written in a readable and well-researched way that I was able to understand every page thoroughly.  , a psychologist at the University of Maryland, has done a lot of work in the field of Narcissism and the importance of understanding the disorder and how it is different from other types of personality disorders. He has also worked with some of the most narcissistic people in the world.

He was patient and kind with me and helped me clarify a number of points that I thought I needed to clear up.   (He was a guest on my podcast and had a very thorough discussion about the book, Narcissists, Obsession, Self-Destruction.)   What stood out to me was that this book was written from the point of view of a therapist working with narcissistic clients. This is one of the more unique aspects to his work, as he is a clinical psychologist. As such, he's been working with people who have Narcissist Personality Disorder for a long time, and so his approach and experience are second-to-none. He takes the reader through many of the details of the illness (and it's treatment) in a very professional and detailed manner that I found very helpful. It is very important for anyone that has this disorder to understand what these patients have gone through and to understand how this disorder develops and works. If you are thinking of getting help for yourself, this book is a must-read.   not only is it great in terms of getting a broad picture of what is wrong with the person, but it also provides a practical tool for how to treat this disorder.   of course, the main focus is on the treatment of people who suffer from Narcississistic personality disorder (NDP). The first few chapters of the book cover the basics

I was an introvert at first, my husband is a "big spender" and has had sex with many women. I don't want to seem "stupid" by saying this, but he seems to have a thing for older women. When he was a little older, he would ask me to bring the kids to my room and talk to my friends. We got to know each other well. He has asked me many times to bring him to a hotel room and I have always refused. Recently, he has been asking me for dinner dates and I think I have been getting a little "stressed out" lately, and don't know what to say. When my children were 3, my wife would bring them to my bedroom to talk and play with them. As she and I got closer in age, she would ask for dinner date dates, too. I have noticed that he would get upset when I said no. I'm going to call him and talk it out because I love him dearly and I don´t want to hurt him. I hate the thought of a divorce, I want our lives to continue and I want to have our children raised in a loving and caring environment. I feel so guilty, I wish I was married to a man that could give me the pleasure and satisfaction that he can give me. I know I won't have my children raised with the same attitude, but I wish to have an equal and supportive relationship with him. Thank you for sharing your stories, this is truly a great book, I´m glad I found it. __________________________________________________________ (From what I have read about women's lib and other books I am reading, this seems like a really great book!) This book has changed my life! I have struggled with this issue my whole life and have gotten nowhere. When I read this book I thought "what if?" I learned some information and I learned how to communicate so I can be more understanding and patient when people ask me for something that is obviously not in my power to provide. I still struggle in a lot of ways, but now I know how to say "no
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Daring Truth about Homosexuality is a good read, a good place to start, and a book I would recommend. It's a quick read and a good way to get up to speed on the details and context of the subject matter. The author was right about one thing: we're often caught up in the hype and false dichotomies that we have of things in our lives. While I have read and heard some very interesting and important views on this topic, The Daringtruth about Homosexuals is one that I think many of us, if we were paying attention, would also agree with. So go read it, and maybe get a kick of it, while still keeping an open mind, or at the very least reading with an open heart. And if you are still confused, don't worry, it gets even more convoluted from here on out...

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I was really impressed by the quality of writing in this book and the fact that it is written in a style that is very accessible and that you could read it without having to go through a lot of explanation. As a new reader to the area, the author was very good at introducing the main characters and the ideas that were put forward, as well as at giving examples from different types of problems (physical, social, emotional, psychological) that a person faces. This book is a lot like an encyclopedia of various things: there is no information overload and you don't have to struggle to understand a lot to understand it. It will probably be useful to someone who is looking for some additional background information and/or a good starting point on the topic in question. The book is not just about mathematics and is a useful book to read for a broader range of students, but it is more of a general introduction to some mathematical concepts than it is an extensive one. I recommend it as a quick start guide to help a person to get started with some of the basics before moving on to more advanced material. This is an example of a book that I have found very interesting, well written, and is an excellent way to get some basic mathematical background before moving into more specific topics.

Write a positive review about a good book:    - I've been thinking about this for a while now and I'm so glad I got the chance to read this story. This book was not what I was expecting, as it took some time to get used to the main character but once I did, I got caught up in the story quickly. I enjoyed the characters very much and I'll definitely be looking for more of this author's work. I'd give this book 4 stars, but there was a slight inconsistency with the story, that didn't seem to go away, so I'm giving this 4.5 stars. I'll probably return to this series for more reading in the future. I'm excited to see where this story goes.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I received the copy from NetGalley and read it in one sitting (which is something that I have never done, but was quite surprised at how quickly the book was put to use). I liked the introduction quite a bit. The book starts off a bit slow, but quickly gets interesting as you follow the characters and the world they inhabit. The story was a little slow, for my tastes, but then you are introduced to the new characters and it picks up to speed very fast.   The main problem I had with the book, was that there are times when I would think "I wish I had heard of this book sooner". As a reader, I often feel that things are not well-crafted enough to make a book exciting. And in this case, that is quite the case. I would say that there is a lot of filler, and there was a lot that was too much like a cross between Harry Potter and The Legend of Drizzt. It seems like the author wanted the readers to be a little too hooked to keep reading to make this book interesting.  .   The main problem with this book was that it just felt too much of a fanfic with Harry Potter. I was interested, I just felt the book could have been better executed. And the ending was a bit odd. It left me with a feeling that there may be something different next time around (for those who love Harry Potter, or even just like the idea of another Harry Potter fanfics).   That said, this book is an excellent read, it will satisfy many Harry Potter fans, and I know there will be a lot more reviews for this book in the future.

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- My favorite book of all time, a very profound work. Read it in the original language by Prof. Maimonides and translated by Sir Anthony Grafton. A must read. - David H. - August 22, 2014The Holy Koran...  Reviewer: sikor - favorite favorite favorite - June 21, 2010  Subject: I find this book interesting, but it could have been written better. I don't understand what it is that the Quran says to do and how it does it, however I do understand that the author's argument is that, since the Quran and the Gospels were both written by the same author who spoke to multiple people, the Quran would be the more accurate account of who Jesus was and that, by the way, Jesus is the most important prophet that ever lived. I do find that this makes sense to me in a general sense, but if you read the Quran in English without having any knowledge of Arabic, then I donít think it makes much sense to you, either. I mean, the Arabic word for a man born in Bethlehem is not the same word in the Quran as in the Bible, for example, and this makes no sense to anyone who isnít familiar with the Arabic language. For example, you could argue that Jesus was born in a manger, but, again, you would not say that the birth of the Messiah occurred in the middle of the night in the city of Bethlehem. Now, some of the people who claim that the Bible is a divinely inspired, inerrant document also claim that Jesus spoke directly to Moses, the patriarch, in order to give Moses the instructions to write the Torah and to make the Israelites believe that Jesus is their messiah. I found the argument from the Quran somewhat amusing, though, because there is so little about the Quran that is in keeping with the Bible. The Quran says that the angels were created in the beginning, but I donĀt see that this contradicts the account of creation given in Genesis. As far as the claim that "Jesus was the most significant prophet that has ever lived," well, Jesus was a prophet; he was, in a way, God incarnate. He was a teacher who helped people understand the meaning of life, how to live well, and how to attain the heavenly glory, and that's all that really matters. For that matter, if I were to argue that I was a more important prophet than Mohammed,

I learned more about the history of the language and more about Korea and its culture. The book was informative, and easy to read. - The Korean people are very helpful and considerate with me. I understand more Korean now. I can feel that my pronunciation is improved. - I found the chapters that talk about Korean history and the history books very interesting. I will continue to read the book to learn more about Korean people and culture.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was given this book as a present for my birthday. I did not really enjoy it until I actually read it (a few months later). I am a total fan of the books of George R.R. Martin, and this was the third book in the Song of Ice and Fire series. The only issue I have with the book was that it has some problems with grammar. When the character is explaining something to the reader, the sentence has to be broken up into several smaller sentences. This was very annoying to me. The main character was so much more interesting and enjoyable than this problem. Overall, this is a good read that I would recommend to any of my friends.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________________ I'm not sure if I'm going to like this book at all. But I do like it. It's a very straightforward story about the discovery of a magic box and how the characters learn about their past and the truth about who they are. It doesn't try to be too complex, so that people can get into it. I don't think that's a bad thing. This book is about people. About being human. About making decisions. And about what happens when people who are not us make those decisions. That's something I appreciate. A lot. I do have to warn you, though, that the story is a bit slow going. You could probably finish it in one sitting. And that makes me a bit sad because it doesn't really deserve to be that long. And then, the ending is a little bit unsatisfying. This is my first "story of a person who finds themselves in a strange land". I'm sure it will be my last. It was really good, though. The characters are very unique and the author writes them well. But that's all I can say for now. The only reason I didn't rate it 4 stars is because it had a somewhat strange ending and I'm unsure why that happened. I will definitely be reading the sequel. I just want to get it out of my system. I'm already thinking about buying the rest of the series!

Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book. I have had a few friends tell me that this book is the only book they have ever read that has been really helpful. It's a great primer for people just getting into the world of BDSM and just about anyone who wants to learn some new things.  "In the hands of an inexperienced or poorly trained submissive, the dominant can inflict unimaginable torture on the submissive in a matter of minutes. That was never the intention. The intended purpose of the BDSM community is to promote safety in communication. It is an active effort to help those who are learning their way around the limits of consent to be able to safely enjoy the kinky adventures that their submissive associates so much with. The BDSM world is not perfect, but we have to keep pushing ourselves to make it better."

I read the book in one day and it was a great pleasure for me to read it with him. He says he was getting the feeling he was going to die and had to go to heaven and I am sure that it is going to be a good journey.  -J.  at the same time, it is a good story with an intriguing plot. it is quite hard to figure out what the aliens want, and this leads to a good suspense factor.   I would rate the book a 4.5.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have enjoyed reading The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. I am a college professor and was a professional in the industry for more than 20 years.  Readers who don't have any experience or training in a particular field may find it difficult to apply what Duhig writes to their situation, but I was surprised at how the principles are put into action and it was definitely a good read. , June 23, 2018.I have to admit I was disappointed by this book. However, I have to say that it is a good explanation of why people habitually behave in certain ways. While it might not be as simple as learning to read one page per day or even the habits I have adopted, it does give you the tools to work on your own habits.Duhigg explains what makes a habit, and then outlines ways in which you can begin to break those habits. He explains how habits are created by habits; how habits can be broken, and that you can do this by doing other things instead of focusing on the habit that you need to do. He also explains how to break bad habits that are holding you back in your life, and how to create new habits. I can't recommend this book enough to people who are curious about the basics of behavior change and how they can begin practicing new habits now.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been a reader of this author since The Black Hole and I had a little hesitation on picking up another book by him. That didn't stop me from getting to the book.   In his previous books he has introduced a few alien races and given some information as to their origins and cultures. This book is more of a prequel to The Black H  I read a review that said "I have a feeling that a lot of the characters were made up to sound more "alien" than they really are. This did not bother me, I just found it a little bit strange".   This was definitely not the case. The aliens that make up the characters actually sound pretty believable and their language and culture seem quite unique. I didn't really notice how much the characters sound like they're made up from different cultures or what they think of themselves as.  's is a very interesting setting with a lot going on. There are many aliens that live and roam the galaxy. Most of them do not like each other so you have your space pirates, pirates, and space pirates. I was hoping that I would get to meet some of the humans on this book, but this was a very uneventful story. I can't really say how interesting the setting is. As an alien it's not something I've ever experienced before. I did however feel that there were some good references to other sci-fi authors (particularly Asimov's) that the author makes reference to. I would say that most of the aliens I've read about so far sound more alien than this book. The ones that are human seem to have their own culture that they seem to be pretty proud of. I will say that I did feel like there was a lack of action in this book and that the pacing would have benefited from being a little faster. The book started off really fast. I'm not really sure why, it was so quick. I have read about a 100 books and have read them at a steady pace for about 7 years. I read most of these books by the author and I've always been able to get my head around all of them. I know what's going on in each book and why it's happening. However, here I didn,t really see that.  , for the first time ever, is a book I think I will pick up when I finish the next book. I enjoyed the book and I hope it does the same for other readers.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________   In conclusion I would like to add a little bit about what I did. I started my book as I had heard it was an excellent choice, and I was right. The only problem I had was that I thought it was pretty good and could probably be a classic for sure. I have heard many people rave about this book and I thought that it was as good as I heard, however I do think I can improve a bit and the reviews were not that good. In my opinion if you can read this book you are probably going to enjoy it. I will make a few suggestions to improve the book. I would suggest that the first 5 pages are the most important, and then once you get past that you can focus on anything else. I found that the way the characters were presented, even the characters in their own thoughts and in their actions had little to no relevance to the story. If you want to read a great book that will make you laugh, cry and be very intelligent about life, read this.

Write a positive review about a good book:...........................................   It is difficult to write about an otherwise excellent book without it sounding like I was bashing the authors but I am happy to say that my criticisms are very justified. The story is well executed and is not bogged down by exposition. The main characters are well developed and do not seem to just be one offs, nor do I see any weak links to tie in with the plot. I was thoroughly entertained and did not feel like it got to the point of repetitiveness.   The author has a very clear vision of what the story should be and the story unfolds in a natural way. This is a very important aspect of any novel as you do not want to read it twice. The author's ability to keep things moving and interesting is very impressive.   the art is very well done. Not a lot is done in terms of dialogue but it does it's job and it does so without having to constantly resort to long descriptions or overly long sentences. I also found it a great addition to the world that the authors have built.   in summary, if you enjoy action, politics, or horror, then you have to check out this book.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********** This book is a must read for people who are involved with the game. I'm a professional player of League of Legends. I've been playing for a few years now and my team and I have been lucky enough to win more than 20 LCS Championships. It's my job to be the best. You can see from my champion pool in the list of my champions that I'm not one for standard tanks and carries, so I chose Xerath as my support. Xerath gives us the option of a champion who deals damage while also having a supportive ability. This champion also allows you to get in range of a lot of your opponent's champions and thus out-trade them. Xer'ath synergizes very well with Yasuo and supports each other very well. This is a very good book to read if you're playing a support and you don't know the ins and outs of playing a champion. My only issue with this book is that it's over 700 pages long so you will have to do a lot to understand all the theory behind it.  Read 9/10 Overall
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had just finished this book about 5 or so weeks ago. I was completely satisfied with it and I think it is a book that is well worth the money.   It is quite a novel. It begins with a young girl and her life changing events and how the life she had before was destroyed. She then moves on from that to a young man that has not had many friends and is still figuring out what he wants to do with his life. The book moves on to his girlfriend that he will soon break up with. The relationship starts out well but things get complicated quickly. The novel moves on and they are both in a different phase of life.     The author has done a great job of capturing the emotion of the first part of the story and that is the story I found to be the most interesting. In the end, when everything is said and done, the book was still a very entertaining read.  , I read this about 5 months ago, but am just now reading the second half. I think that the author has really captured the emotion and passion in the second part. I have not yet finished the first half, but it seems to me that I am just about finished.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book contains the most excellent information I have ever read. I have been teaching elementary students, mostly English, for about 15 years. I used to read through books on various subjects, then try to put them into practical practice and practice what I learned. However, I could not find any book that could give me the most useful, practical and practical information I need in my classroom. This book has done that and more. The first part of the book, which is about the various types of learning, provides a great summary of all of these different types of teaching methods and what they are all about. The second part, which deals with the various methods for teaching reading, grammar, writing and speaking, is quite interesting. This part also gives practical advice on what methods you should use depending on your students' abilities and how they can best be taught. Review Rating:   I enjoyed reading this book very much.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ "This is a wonderful book for those who are interested in learning more about the origins of the word "nigger" and in the historical process through which it became an American word. The book is written in an easy and informal style, in the vein of A. R. Wrigley's Nigger Folklore (New York, 1960). The author is good at using humor, and she gives examples from her own life, particularly with reference to race. The chapters include a review of the history of the meaning and use of the racial epithet "nig" in various languages; a discussion of how and why racial epithets came to be used by groups and individuals who are not themselves racist or bigoted; an examination of the role of the social sciences in the origin and meaning of words; and an account of the evolution of "niggardly" as a word for African Americans in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century." - Review from the Review of Books on the Holocaust.  Review of books on the origin of the English word "Nigger" on the Internet  From the review of: Nigger: The Origin of the Word and the Evolution of a Racial Slur  by George Lipsitz  University of California Press, 2003  pp. 19-27  p. 20 "It is the fact that niggers originated from a slur that I find most fascinating. To many it is an old slur. It is so old in fact that it dates back to at least before the dawn of the Christian era and is still used by the Negroes themselves. In an unpublished dissertation on the origins and use, for example, of the African n-word (also known as a N-word) and the English N-bomb (the word used by some white supremacists to refer to people of African descent), Professor Robert E. Park, a distinguished African American historian at San Francisco State University, noted in the dissertation that the earliest evidence of the term nigger occurs in the seventeenth century, in a text on slavery written by a white man and written with the intent of provoking black slaveowners to rage and abuse.

Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________________ I was completely unaware of the existence of this series until I read the synopsis for this book at an academic conference. I wasn't disappointed when I went into the first book in the series and started reading.   I had thought that I was going to read this book on its own because I found it so absorbing. I did not expect that it would be one of my most satisfying reads ever.   the main character is actually a female with a mind like a steel trap. She had no idea how to get out of her situation until she had a friend who helped her to break through the wall that had been blocking her out of life. She has a way of reading people and their emotions and feelings through their physical expression.     This is one of those books that makes you think that the author had a child in mind at the time that he or she wrote it. I mean who doesn't have a little bit of the child inside them. I think that I had a few things in my head that I would like to see the little girl do with the adult world. My favorite part about this book is the description of the events at the beach. It gives a perfect picture of the beach as an innocent place where nothing really bad ever happens. This is the kind of book that would make me smile to myself and it gave me a good laugh as well.   I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a strong desire to get into literature and who is not afraid to let their imagination run free.

However, if you read carefully, you will understand the author's point of view. The story of his father and his upbringing is very touching and insightful. It can be very depressing when you know about the struggles of an alcoholic's life, especially his father. However this book gives hope that one day he would have a drink and live an even more enjoyable life.  of the books  In terms of the reading, there is a lot of information in the book. There are two parts to this book. The first part covers many historical and cultural information about various religions, but I believe that the second part is the best part. This part of the book is filled with stories of people who were good people who had a lot to be proud of. There is no religious content in this part of book, but the stories are very moving. For example, the author tells how his father gave up alcohol so he could help his wife and children. In the end, the father made it his mission to share the teachings of God with others. It just shows the power of God's love and mercy.   The second part of this book is where the author focuses on one man's experience of God and his relationship with God. In this part, the reader is introduced to the man's life as he goes about trying to understand God. It takes the reader right from his childhood up to the time he experiences his own spiritual journey. This section is very interesting and very inspirational.   the best  Overall this is a very interesting book with a very unique point of views. It would be very hard to put down. I recommend it to everyone who would like to know a little more about

Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book. I have tried many self-help books and I have always felt this book does it all. It has a gentle and loving heart. The author is extremely honest. She takes all the stress of living with a person with cancer and puts you in the driver's seat. I've never felt such love and comfort from a book before. It is so much better than other self-inflicted help books that I have read. The only thing I didn't like was the last section. It's not bad, but it got a little long at some points.

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I am a little surprised by my rating for this book. I did not read this book until almost the end of my college career. I was a bit worried that I would not have the knowledge to make good decisions in the future so I avoided reading it. This book was not nearly as dense as I thought it was going to be. After reading this book I feel more informed about the way the government operates than I had before reading this. This is very similar to what I knew about the Vietnam War. The story is not perfect, but its the best I can remember the Vietnam years.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________________________________________   "A very good and entertaining book on the psychology of music." ~ Michael T.  _______________________________________________________________________________________   From the back cover:   What happens when you ask a listener to read aloud a piece of music that is not only unfamiliar, but in a different key? What is the effect?   This fascinating, surprising experiment explores this question by asking a group of listeners to play a piece that has been a central part of their musical experience for years. The piece, "The Blue Danube Waltz", was chosen because it was written by the composer Georg Solti in the first half of the twentieth century and is one of his most popular works. However, it is in a strange key, E major.   Each participant is given a set of keys to play, and their musical knowledge is tested, as well as the ability to perform the piece in the given key.   that the piece is E major is revealed, but only to those who have played the piece at least once before. The listeners, who are all composers of a kind, do not know this and therefore do not feel the key change in any way. This creates an interesting situation, and it provides an opportunity for the composers to explore the different emotions that might be created by the different keys.  , a book on music history, was the starting point for the experiment. The music was recorded on a portable cassette tape in the mid 1980's at a time when the technology was still relatively primitive.   I did not have a cassette tape, but instead had a CD player. But even this had some limitations in the form of not having the right key on the CD. This book was my primary source for the audio cassette. In fact, the book's subtitle was "Music and the Brain". I wanted to explore how the music and the brain interact.   "The music of my youth" is a book by the late composer, Hans von Bülow. In the course of this study, it was discovered that von Buelow had not had a tape player at all when he composed his music, and that he had only ever played the same piece of piano over and over again.  The experiment that we follow is very similar to the one we performed in. One of the participants is given the music to play. The participant is asked to read the title of the music. Then the participant is told to read a series of numbers. These numbers are
Write a positive review about a good book:  I liked this book  I liked it  I liked  I loved  I liked reading it       0  In this post-apocalyptic dystopia, a young man named Jack has been assigned to a group of survivors on a remote island. When they begin to realize that something is wrong with Jack, they're forced to send him to the mainland. Along the way, Jack is caught up in the story of the survival of a civilization on the brink of extinction and finds himself being manipulated by some very dangerous people who are seeking to achieve a terrible purpose.   One of the main strengths of this book is that it deals with the issues of the day-to-day lives of survivors in a post-nuclear world. I found it to be a very believable scenario that had both elements of the novel and of the zombie apocalypse. I liked the way that the book dealt with this issue from a survivor's point of view. There are many characters who provide the main characters with information and perspectives on the current events. These characters are not necessarily evil and are certainly not all evil, but I found them to be somewhat unpredictable, at least to a point. This made their character development much more intriguing to me. I did not like some of the character's behavior toward each other in this book, but other than that I was pretty satisfied.  - I really liked the writing style. This was the first post-zombie novel that I have ever read where the writing was very easy and intuitive. I also really enjoyed the writing of the characters. I had a really good time reading this book and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good zombie novel.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________________________ I just finished reading the book "Pagan and Modern Women: The Story of Pagan Ritual, History, and Belief" by Margo G. Scott. This is a fascinating book about one woman's journey in life as she explored her religious heritage and the history and beliefs surrounding it. While I don't think she is a "religious" person in any conventional sense, I think her perspective is important and that is why I enjoyed the book. She is a strong, independent woman who knows her own beliefs and traditions and is honest about those. It was difficult to read her story because she was very self-indulgent and I found her own spiritual journey fascinating. She did an excellent job of putting all her pieces together. She was kind, intelligent, and courageous. I felt her story was unique and unique in the history of women in the ancient world and I wanted to share her story with other people. I thought it was interesting that she was a Pagan woman who never married and had a child without a male role model. It is not unusual to find that these women of the old cultures have had to work hard to be successful. I think it is very inspiring to see her story and how she was able to survive and have a healthy relationship with her personal beliefs and practices. I read her book to learn more about the ancient traditions of her faith.

Write a positive review about a good book:  If you are a fan of the world of Harry Potter, or a new reader in the Harry Potter universe, you will love this book! It is a well written, entertaining, and humorous adventure that is filled with laughs. It gives a good sense of who Harry Potter is as a person and what his life is like at the time. The Harry Potter books have always been my favorite book series and this story perfectly fills in the gaps in the first five books. There are some amazing parts of this story that I really love like when Harry is in Hogwarts and is getting to know his classmates and the other new students, when he has to help his cousin Sirius to do something, and most of all, when his godfather James and Remus come to visit him in Hogsmeade, and the first time they meet. I was especially excited when the two characters that Harry first meets were Hermione and Tonks as the two of them are very important to Harry and I thought that their relationship would be very different. There was also a good chance that I was going to have to deal with an evil Snape who was going through a bad time, but all that was in store for me was a fun, interesting, and lighthearted read. The whole family is very excited about the upcoming Harry Potter movie and I couldn't help but feel a little bit of jealousy because I am a Potter fan and know that the two most important characters from the books, Harry and Hermione, will be in it, along with many other wonderful characters that have appeared in the books. However, I would rather be Harry Potter than the person that is in the movie. That said, I think that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a great book for everyone to read, and I really do think that it will appeal to anyone that enjoys reading and has an interest in the wizarding world.

Thanks. - Aydian B. - November 15, 2014   This is a very interesting, but perhaps too academic, read. What is important for the average citizen to know is that what is being written is "factual," but not "good" fact. But a little research on the subject will help clarify a lot of the confusion and help lay the groundwork for effective interventions, as opposed to just "pouring cold water" on it. It also needs to be said that this is just a small segment of the larger picture. - Paul A. Ziegler - November 13, 2014 I don't normally read academic literature on foreign policy issues but this one got my interest - very interesting information about what's going on in Syria, but much of it is very technical and academic.  I also agree that the book would have been much more powerful if the author had taken an approach that was more "hands on" - that is, had the author written his article as it were as an open letter and not as a journal article, with as much personal insight and commentary as was possible. - George V. - October 24, 2014 a well-researched and written piece that is very interesting  but very technical.  in other words not really useful to a layman like myself.   i like the book however. . - jenny - October 19, 2014 This was a really informative and good book.

This is really an incredible read and very insightful about poverty.  My aunt had the means to care for the boy she raised.  But she couldn't and in spite of all her attempts to have the boy adopted by rich families, he was still abandoned and was brought up by an aunt until he was 5.  It was an interesting read about how people react to poverty, how people who are poor sometimes have a harder time getting used to the idea that you might not be able to afford to provide for someone in need.  This book is a great read that will make you think about the things you do to make the world a better place.

I can understand that the person who wrote the story was a bit of a recluse so it was interesting to see all of these little details that were so easy to miss. The author definitely has talent in being able to write about such a diverse group of people. I just wish that there was a little more detail about the history of this island.

I found it a bit too rushed, and a little too one-sided. It felt like it was written as the end to the first book. I would have liked a bit more time to build up the plot before giving it the end it really deserved. But it was still great, so that's what I'll give it.

I read it last year at college, but I didn't have the time to get through it then. And I'm reading it again now for college classes. The writing was fantastic and I loved the characters. The characters were very well written and felt real.   I also think this book was a good way to teach kids about being honest and not lying, but the stories were a little bit over the top (especially to teenage kids). I know they were just doing their part in the war but... they sure had some fun making up lies. Also, it seems that most of these kids weren't told to tell the truth and this was kind of a bad thing.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________  I've been thinking of making a film about the early days of the Industrial Revolution for a while now. As you probably know, the Industrial revolution happened much earlier than the Industrialists would have liked, but this book shows it in a way that was still useful even to the average person back then. I love how the Industrialist portrayed himself in the book. It's also a great book because of how they treated women and how they talked to each other. ___________________________  For the first time in history, women are doing anything they want to do. They have more choices than ever before, yet women are also still expected to be subservient and to stay in the home. In the book, there's an exchange between a man and woman, and they both know the other is a bit of a jerk. This makes for a very interesting and powerful scene, and shows how gender roles are evolving. ___________________________________________ So much of the things that we find socially unacceptable and morally wrong are the same things that were socially acceptable and morally right in the past. ___________

From the review of the book on Amazon:   What a brilliant book... I have now completed my second year in school and this is one of my favorite books. I can't remember where I learned about the war but I had read a lot about it since I was little. I have taken my class on several Civil War tours of the Gettysburg Battlefield. I enjoy taking these tours because it gives me an idea of what it was like for the men who were actually fighting. You learn about who they were, their families, what they were fighting for and even their own lives. I especially love the descriptions of the battle sites. It gives you an idea what a place like Gettysburg looked like.   I know this book was a bit pricey at $10 but for a young person just getting into history I think it is well worth it!

Some of them are not that clear and you are told that you should use another technique to get the results that you want, and that's just not true. He doesn't even have good examples for the techniques. He even does a pretty good job of making it appear that what he has to say isn't relevant in the real world, and it's just a waste of your time to follow his advice. The main author has the same problem as most other authors of this type; he has a strong ego and he doesn't want you to copy his methods. He has an agenda in this book, and he tries to make it look as if he is saying these things to be helpful to students, when really, it's to give himself the appearance of helping you out. The only reason for this was that he wanted to get more money from the university. He's got his ego in check, and maybe he has learned something from the way other people in publishing are doing things, but in his own case, the author has become a copycat of his own style.

This is the first time I have used this type of book. I just wish that I had known this before I took the risk of starting my training. The whole book was very well written and easy read. I recommend this to all male body builders that are serious about improving their health and getting the maximum out of their body.

If you are curious about the fishes of the oceans, you will love this book!
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________________________________ This is by far the best book I've read on the history of the CIA, or at least on the operations that were performed on the American citizenry. The author's main thesis is that the CIA has always had a covert mission and a public face, a covert action and a covert-action-on-the-public-face. This makes for very good, even entertaining reading, with very little of the "spook" part of the spy-tacular. The reason for this is that he focuses the book almost entirely on the CIA-related programs that were designed to operate under the radar of the general public. Even so, the book will probably give you plenty to think about, especially since there are so many issues to deal with, as opposed to the many, many ones in the book. It also has much more detail on these covert operations than the standard history of them, even if that's a drawback to the book in my opinion. ___________________________________________________________________________________ I was so impressed with the overall presentation of this book. I knew it was coming, because the description is so good. If the publisher had decided to make it a standalone book instead of a set of appendices, that would have helped, because it would have cut down on the number of chapters. It is too bad that the book was so clearly divided into three parts, as I was looking forward to the final one. ____________________ _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ * This is the first time I've ever reviewed a book by anyone other than a student of that author, and the fact that it is an excellent book shows that I'm in good hands. It's hard to put this book down, as it's so full of historical background, it's one of the few books that I've actually had to study, in order to read it properly. * This book is a good primer on the origin of the Central Intelligence Agency, which is a major change from what I've been reading, which was all about the activities of the military-industrial complex. * The book doesn't cover the Bay of Pigs fiasco or the Cuban Missile Crisis (although there is an appendix that discusses those events), which makes sense to me, as that's not a CIA issue. * I think the author does a nice job of explaining the various programs, and in general, his treatment of the history makes sense. _____________ * The author takes a good deal of liberties with the truth when he reports on

Write a positive review about a good book: __________. Thanks.   Book: The Secret Of The Supermarket  Author: John Grisham  Positives: Grishman's "supermarket" isn't a place where the usual suspects live. It's a place of people with unique and unusual needs who have the right attitude to live a happy life.  ... and the characters have no trouble getting along in this unusual society   Negatives: This book is not for those who think it would be boring to read about a normal life in the supermarket. It is far too far outside the world we are used to.   a small business....   I think it is more about an ordinary life as compared to what would happen in a supermarket..   My Rating:   The Secret Of the Supermarket:  By John Grisam.   (A very good book and a very good person to read it with.)   John Grishams "Supermarket" is a story of ordinary people in a special place that happens to be special to them. If that sounds like a fantasy to you, you are not alone. But I can assure you it isn't. The story is realistic, down to the smallest detail. Grishmans "Supermart" is like any supermarket - filled with many different kinds of people, from different walks of life, but united by a common interest in food. But a special supermarket, one of the best in the world, is like no supermarket you have ever seen, or experienced. It has a special kind of appeal. It does not appeal to the average consumer, but only to those who live a special life, who can put up with its strange, confusing and sometimes even dangerous rules. These rules are not what would normally be expected, but that is exactly what makes the supermarket special. The supermarket's special rules are: (1) Food should never be wasted; (2) Don't use up the "good stuff" to save "the bad stuff" for later; (3) Don t waste time trying to understand every aspect of the supermarket; (4) Don 't go shopping to avoid chores; (5) Don' t leave your money lying around, or any food in your refrigerator, as it can't be sold (in this place); and (6) Don \' t take a "break" from work to go shopping. As a result, everything is always exactly how it was supposed
Write a positive review about a good book: **********   So this is a book that is about the great depression, so I am looking for a book about great depression. So for a non-fiction book, it is pretty good, but I will say I enjoyed the story more than I did the author.   The narrator did a good job of telling the story as if he were talking to his friend or co-worker. I guess it made it easier for him to tell a story than to actually tell one.  , a friend of his, was having some problems, but this friend of mine, was not having much fun with it. So this book was about what it is like to be having such a difficult time and having a friend who is having a much easier time. I think the narrator did that well, and that made me care more about this character, and his story. I did not like this narrator much, but he had the right idea with his narration.  The main character, is named Harry S. Truman, he was the 39th President of the United States. When Harry Truman was born, the world was at war. The world had to decide what to do about it and the United states was split in half between the democratic and the democratic-freedoms. It was a very difficult time for Harry, the youngest son of the president, who was being groomed to be his successor. When Truman was 2 months old, his mother, who loved him very much, was arrested by the Nazis for being Jewish. So, Harry's mother was forced to flee to Canada, which was very difficult for her, but she did it. Harry did not know his mother that well until he was 3 or 4 years old. Harry never really spoke with his father, Harry had other relatives that he could visit. He saw his mother once when he was about 10, but did not talk with him much at that time. Harry's father was a hard working man, he always did everything possible to pay for his son's education. It must have been quite hard for him as a hard worker to raise a child in the Depression. In the first year of Harry's life, Harry never saw his father in a very long time. When he was 14, Harry was living with his mother and brother, the two kids and Harry's mom had to move to a new house. It seemed that the home life was just as hard as the war. It also appeared that Harry was very depressed. Harry

Write a positive review about a good book:  If you want to know more about the way of being in this world that is now changing, if you want some real wisdom and a better way to live, read this book.  It is not just about Jesus Christ. It is about how we get there. It's about the journey, not the destination. It was a real revelation to me.  I found out that Jesus didn't say much about this. Jesus said some good things, but that's about it. That's the big change. We don't need that Jesus anymore. This is not about the old way of life. We need to get away from that, and find the new way. This book is a wake-up call. You'll love it.  5 stars for real, I am not a big fan of the Christian version of the New Testament. I think there are things in there that don't make much sense to me, and even though there are a lot of references to Christ and His teachings, they aren't in the context that I think Jesus would have understood, because of the context he lived in. I'm not saying that we shouldn't take Jesus' words at face value; we absolutely should. But what I love is that this book gives a real, honest look into the new worldview that is developing now. I had a friend who converted to the church at a young age and was the most radical Christian I have ever met, and he said that he was very frustrated by this new way of thinking. But this book made him stop and think about why he was so excited about the new beliefs and how to apply them to his life.  The author is the great author, and the content is very well written.  So if you are looking for a good, straight forward, spiritual view of what it means to be Christian today, this book is perfect for you. I gave this book 5 stars. If you are a Christian and want a better, more honest view of how to live in the new world, this is the book for you, if for no other reason than to see the transformation. This book has it all. It doesn't talk about politics or theology or politics in this book, or social justice or what you should do, but the truth of God and life. This has been an eye opener for me, my family, and others I know. 4 stars. It wasn't that great. You could tell that it was a book

My relationships with people, people, my parents and my child. It made me a better person and more empathetic towards the world. I have made great progress in my own personal life since starting on this journey. I am happy that God is using me to be a means to show other people how to live happy lives. It truly changed my view of people who are cruel, disrespectful, mean, unkind, selfish, selfish. It has made me hate my current family and I hate myself because I am the product of my own bad choices and mistakes in life. It is no longer who I am. It just is.

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I've read this book a couple of times since it came out, and every time I do so I get a little better and a little wiser about what I'm doing, especially when it comes to the various aspects of getting a "perfect" book. If you are looking to find some good ideas on how to get a book onto the market, then this one is for you. I read this back in 2008, when it first came out in paperback and I have read it a few more times since. The best thing about this book is that it is very easy to read. No matter what kind of books you have, there is a story in this book that relates well to all of them. This is also a book that you can make your own with your own style and approach. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking to start a blog, develop a book, or just want to get out there and start a conversation with others.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ This is an enjoyable novel with a unique premise that takes the concept of a "fictional universe" to new depths of thought, even in the modern era. The story is engaging and well-written. I enjoyed all the characters and the story as it progressed. -Bethany J. W  I'm a fan of science fiction. I've been a fan since the 70s and the more recent years have shown me a strong trend towards more sophisticated plots, more complexity, and more original concepts, to the point where the more contemporary fiction is starting to seem the same and a lot of sci-fi is getting quite dated.   This is no exception to that trend. Although it's quite possible for the story to seem dated now, it definitely has the best ideas of the ones presented in this novel and the best storytelling I've seen in a novel in a long time.   for a more modern look at the time it was published (2002) The "Crisis" novel, which tells of a time when the planet is nearly destroyed due to a devastating plague, should be required reading for all high school students, and should definitely be the first read for adults.  . There were so many things that were interesting and thought provoking about the story, and the way the story developed and progressed. It's not a typical science fiction story because of the way it tells its story and the themes that are explored. The characters and their development was amazing. If you are into a more speculative or philosophical read, this is probably not for you.. I have a lot to say about the "Culture" that was present in the future society, but since that's part of what I liked about it, I won't go into great detail about it.  , if I had to say which was the most interesting character from the main story, I would have to say the one that the author presents to us at the beginning of the book. She's quite different from the other characters we meet in the first half of the story because she seems to be more mature than the rest of the characters. She seemed to be much more capable and wise, even though she had to learn the ways of survival first hand. This made me very curious about her future, and I hope to get more insight into her later on in the book as well as to her relationships with the other female characters.. The world building was absolutely incredible, and it kept me hooked in even when

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________ "In his new book, The Case for God: A Philosophical Investigation, atheist Christopher Hitchens explores the philosophical and theological arguments in favor of the existence of God, while also debunking the claims of religion's greatest enemies. What makes this book unique is that it does this with wit, humor and a sense of humor. The arguments against God are so bad that the reader is often shocked. Hitchens not only addresses the arguments against religion, but also attempts to show how these arguments are logically flawed. The book has many strong arguments, but the book will not convince you that God doesn't exist. But it will convince you to think about the arguments a little more, and wonder if they really really do make sense. (The Case for the Existence of God: An Existential Investigation) "

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- An excellent historical biography of the great revolutionary and reformer, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Read by David Gifford is an insightful and well-researched account of King's life and work, especially those of his "Letter From Birmingham Jail" to his brother, Dexter. King's book provides a compelling portrait of the man, with the assistance of his trusted and highly-credentialed wife Coretta Scott King, who also served as the Reverend's secretary and assistant. One of the most-wanted people in the country, the Southern lawyer and civil rights activist was executed by the state of Alabama in February of 1968. He is the last living U.S. civil rights leader to have his death sentence commuted by President Richard Nixon, who later stated that "We need Dr. King, more than ever." -- Robert D. Dornan, The Wall Street Journal The author, Dr David G. Martin, is a distinguished professor at Harvard University. He has written two previous books on the life and times of Dr. Luther King. This latest volume was highly recommended, and the author has delivered a well-written, well-documented, and sympathetic view of the life of King, including the most important events of his career. A highly readable biography of a man whom I admire greatly. -- Robert S. Martin Jr., Professor of History, Harvard University

Write a positive review about a good book:.......................................................   The title of this book is quite fitting. I was quite surprised at how well the book covered the subject in a very non-technical manner, not unlike a lecture on how to fly a plane.   It may seem like I am being very biased toward the book as I was an engineering undergraduate in the 70's and the author was my lecturer for a year in my first year of engineering at my university. The subject was of great interest to me then. I found the discussion of aero-mimicry intriguing and fun. However, in hindsight, I realized that the author's lack of experience in this area probably inhibited him from producing an interesting book. I thought I would write a positive reviews about the book that were somewhat critical.   the subject is extremely technical and if you are not an expert in aerodynamics then it might be intimidating or discouraging. However if you already know some of the basics about aerodynamics and have read the author�s thesis, then the book is a very easy to read, interesting read. He does not try to explain aerodynamics in laymen terms in a way that is overly technical. However the book does not give a comprehensive explanation of aerodynamics but does provide a good understanding of the basic aerodynamic principles and theories.   in the chapters about airfoils, the author addresses the many problems with the design of a wing, particularly the loss of efficiency of aerodynamic efficiency in the transition from the trailing edge to the leading edge. The problem with the airfoil concept in the wing design is that the wing area increases exponentially, and if the wing is very thin in the beginning and very thick at the trailing edges, there is a great increase in drag and efficiency.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ My favorite part of reading the book was the ending - so well done. I'm glad I bought it!   My problem with this book: The author takes a very easy, fun read and turns it into a hard read. She goes to a bookstore and buys a book about a woman who decides to sell her soul to the devil. The book's not hard, I think I understand it pretty well, I understand what's going on, and it doesn't sound like there's any deep psychological problem to be solved, it seems like the girl just decides to give herself to Satan for one reason or another. The whole point of the book is that the girl eventually comes around and understands her own reason for doing what she did, but it seems that the author decided to try to make the book harder on the reader, not easier. I didn't have a problem with the book, I didn...   The characters: There are no characters in the book. None. So the story is about two people who don't know each other, have never met, and don't really interact much. So there's no tension or problems, because the author doesn't really care what the characters think, what their motivations are, or what's in their head. The characters all exist as an extension of the author's thoughts. They're not real people, and they never really have any emotions that come between the lines, unless she's using them to show how the characters will be affected by the situation they're in. I know, I know! This is bad writing and it's a bad thing to do. If your character exists in your head, they're not going to be thinking things that make the characters behave in the way the author wants them to.   One more thing that bothered me. The author describes the "hellmouth", which I found to be extremely inaccurate, and the entire book takes place there. The descriptions of Hell and Hellfire are just as horrible as they could have been, and I found them to be incredibly overused. The description of Hell is the worst. It's like the book's trying to scare the reader with an atmosphere of being there, but the reality isn't nearly as horrifying as the author would have you believe. The rest of the descriptions are very well done, and make for a great read.   The world: The world is very vague, and only a few of the characters, and even fewer of the places

I have always felt that the "douchebag" was a derogatory term but now that I have read this book and have a great deal of insight into the subject I am convinced that there are people out there that are actually very good people that have gotten carried away. I think it is amazing that one man, who is only 40 years old can hold so much knowledge and experience and yet never give a hoot.

But, I'm reading this today, after having recently lost my mother (she's now been diagnosed with dementia), and I still have a lot to learn about how my parents lived their lives and whether I can ever do the same.   it took me a little while to figure out what this book is actually about, because it feels very different from anything I've ever read about it.  ,   First off, I think the book would benefit anyone who is trying to learn how to see the world and think logically, and also to have a life that's enjoyable and full of love.   and to give me one piece of advice, DON'T TRY TO LIVE LIKE YOU COULD HAVE IN THE PAST!   If you think the world is exactly as it was when you were a child, you'll be miserable as an old man, and this book says that. That's the only way I could describe it. As I've just stated, I started reading this book last night after I heard my mom talking about her grandmother in her last days, and after a good night of sleep (that's the main thing she was talking about) it clicked for me: she wasn't talking about how much she loved
Write a positive review about a good book:  My wife and I were given the book "The Story of Jesus" by Charles Spurgeon by our church. It's a collection of sermons that are from the early 19th century and some of the most influential ministers to ever live. We had no idea that it would become a classic, we had no clue about it's significance, it's depth, or its timeless quality and we are very thankful that we picked it up. The Book is an amazing read, the style and content of the Book is very modern, very readable, and very interesting. It was a real eye opener for our Faith. Charles Spurger was also a great influence on our kids and our kids still remember the time that they listened to it every Sunday during their youth. It is a must buy for those who love the Bible and those who want to learn more about our Lord. It will take you to another world.

Review by Sarah A Reviewed on July 16, 2016 Just finished this book, and loved it! It had good writing, and a nice, refreshing twist to the genre, and the action was interesting and action-packed.

Write a positive review about a good book:!!! Soooo I was excited about this one when I saw it, and then I was super disappointed when I finished. It's a good story, I do like it. But it just wasn't that good. I've been waiting to read a book that will give me something new and interesting to read since I read the first one in this series. And I'm happy to say that I have.I'm glad that I finally read this one, but not excited to read the next one.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I got this book in return for an honest review. The book was really entertaining, the author was a great writer.

Write a positive review about a good book:...................................."It is an excellent description of the relationship between the three sexes. You will be able to understand what is expected from a man in a different position."  I would have given this book a three star rating, but it's my least favorite sex book. It just doesn't fit me. It is quite an overwhelming book, but I would probably not want to read it in one sitting. I'm sure many men have found it useful in that regard. I just wasn't comfortable with the amount of detail, and felt that this book was not the right fit for me.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I liked this book. I think that for a man who has written so much on the subject, he is still fairly unaware of the fact that this is also a woman's book. The writing style was easy, but the main point of the book was the subject and what is said in it. It took me a while to get there and I really enjoyed the writing. For me, this book was also the most relatable book I have ever read in a way that made me want to know more about this person.  That's all I needed to know.  4)  "What if we could choose the color of our skin?"  I read this quote from a woman in the book and I was absolutely appalled. She said that that her color was just like any other person's. It was just one more excuse for white people to make it seem that they are better than anyone else. For the people who are not white, this is a very important statement. I have read similar comments many, many times and I think they are still important to make. I believe that it is very important to teach people about the colorism problem and the issue of oppression that comes with it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book for my nephew and niece when they came in to visit me and asked for a copy. The cover was beautiful and they really liked it so much they wanted one for their room as well. I didn't think I could read to them, but I was wrong and I'm glad they liked it as much as I did.   The book is very easy to read and if the book is good, the story is even better. I like the way that they have the pictures so well, they really make it easy for the children to remember their names and how they look. I was happy that it was so much fun to read this book to my nephew when he asked for it. He is 4 years old and we will be reading the book again before he goes to bed so he can read his way through it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   The first time I read this book, I couldn't get into it because it didn't seem like it had a story line. At the beginning, I thought maybe this was supposed to be a self-help book, or maybe that's the point. After finishing it, I realized that it was really good at what it was trying to do. After reading about this guy, who is a loser trying to get a job, I really got the feeling he was trying his best to get work.

Write a positive review about a good book: ******************  I found the story to be enjoyable but I found the characters to be a little too flat. They felt like the author wanted to create a good story but couldn't think of anything interesting enough for the characters. It was so dull! It was boring. I couldn't even get my hopes up that there would be more for the future and that she would get the motivation to write more. I just wanted more for her. She was so boring! She never really got the character development to make the book worth reading.   If you enjoy books that are fun but have great plot twist, try this book!
Write a positive review about a good book: *********This book was a good read. Its about an ex who got back together with his girlfriend. The ending was so sweet. It was a nice break in the book. The characters were good. There were a couple of bad ones and the author was good at editing the bad ones out of the story. I liked the ending. My only criticism of this book was that the love interest who got mad at the guy for cheating on her. I thought she was a jerk. And her husband was a bully.

It is a very interesting concept but it is not as detailed as it needs to be and sometimes makes more sense than the authors intended. It could be more coherent.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a big hit to me when I bought it.  I have read a few other self help books and most are fairly basic or simply make promises to change my life.    While reading the book I noticed the author's name and a lot of the concepts she talks about were so very true to me.  It made me look at my life in a new light and I realized I should take things step by step.  The book had many examples and tips to help you improve yourself and your life. I love to read and the chapters were so interesting.  I especially liked the tips to improve your body and mind.  This book makes me believe I can do anything I set my mind to.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- I was very much into reading a book on this book but was a bit disappointed with this book. I did enjoy it, but I don't see myself buying the second one because of this. The stories are a bit over the top for me. The book is about a mother who has an amazing relationship with her children. She is very kind, compassionate and the children are so loved. The kids don't know anything about religion, and they don't think it's anything strange to have a mother and a father and not know what it is. As I thought, the whole story was very well written. I love the story, but it was a little bit too weird for my liking. My daughter had to have been the age of 5 or 6 to see the humor in the story. I read it in a few sittings, but my daughter kept reading until the end, and it was all downhill from there.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________ This is a good read for a college student. It gave me a new perspective and it made me understand the people of a small village where I am staying in Nepal during my holiday. I learned about the difficulties of being poor in a rural area in a developing country. The book talks about how one can't just sit back and relax, but can take an active role to help his or her family and community.
Write a positive review about a good book:.........................................A great book about how our own perception and thoughts play a role in our self esteem. I wish I had found it years ago. A little different concept but very well written. I've been wanting to do this type of thing on my own, since the day I read it! I think we have an obligation to be able to know ourselves. It's the responsibility that comes with having the freedom to choose how we interact with others. That freedom has brought a great deal of pain for so many people but it will ultimately bring a great fulfillment in the end.   This is a very simple book that's a joy to read!
Write a positive review about a good book:  If you don't hate the author (and I don't know how much of that is him) this is a decent read. Overall:      This is a pretty good read. If you want to have a nice laugh with the characters and find a few interesting tidbits, you should read it. I only give this a 3 star rating because the first half of the story was kind of boring. This makes up for the rest of the book. I don?t get the connection between the story and the book, so I can?t really recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am glad that I took time out of my busy schedule to read this book. I think that its premise is intriguing and has some good points to say about education and the role of books in it. I was interested in the premise that there is a common thread of all good books that is something we are all looking for, that in this day and age of rapid technological change we should be searching for something similar to what books have given us. I am a new reader and I enjoyed the stories, the characters, and the theme of the book. I was also interested in learning the difference between how we think about learning, and learning itself, and I was really intrigued with the premise of how there are certain skills that all students need to be comfortable learning in order to learn in the right way. This is a book that I can highly recommend as it is entertaining, enlightening and useful at the same time.

"This book is very well written and a great gift to anyone interested in the early days of America." I absolutely loved reading this book! I was born in 1989, so I can't imagine how different things would be back then. I really enjoyed the way that she was able to tell these stories through different perspectives. These books give us a look at a time and place that is mostly unseen by the general public and by historians, who tend to be writing about the "good" things in history. The stories that she tells are often very well researched and very well told. I've always been interested in early American history and wanted to learn more, so this book really made my year! I was a fan of Hiawatha before and after reading this one, and I look forward to reading another in the series!

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- So I've never read anything by this author before. I was really excited about this book. It's a short story about a girl who has a lot of issues. I couldn't put it down. It was short enough to read in a day and the ending made me feel happy. I feel a lot better for it. It didn't give me any depression but I'm sure it did. So I was looking for something like this to read and found this book on my recommendations site. I liked it so much I'm reading it now. I'm in college so I'm able to go out and do something that I really enjoy but I hate the idea of my classmates finding out about it. I am trying to make the best of it because I want to get a degree in something else but this is my last semester so I can't wait to see if I can do it this year. I love that this was written in a small rural town that didn't even have an Internet connection or even a gas station. I don't know how long she has been suffering. It doesn't really matter. What matters is that she's alive and that she has some kind of hope. So this book made me cry. It made me happy. If you're having the same kind of problems as me you should definitely read this book because it's pretty good. It has a happy ending.  favorite favorite favorite favorite  I haven't read anything from this author in a while. This is a fun, fast read and a good read overall. I thought the ending was very nice.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm giving this 5 stars because it was the first book I read in 2015, and I am a huge fan of the genre of mystery fiction (and I am not alone - there are loads of fans of mystery books out there). I bought this book based on reviews I've read and I have to say that I really enjoyed it. This book was extremely well-written, well-thought out and well-paced and was a great read. It was the perfect blend of mysteries and thrillers and just the perfect amount of suspense. The book is not overly complicated, but the mysteries are well-crafted and the thrillers were very entertaining. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes the thrill of a mystery and has the patience to read an hour or two of mystery before moving on to something else. The ending is also very satisfying, so if you are looking for a book that will blow you away, this book is definitely for you. Overall, it was a very good read!
Write a positive review about a good book: _________" The first time I read this I was a bit skeptical because of all the reviews I have read but it's not bad at all. It has a wonderful sense of realism and the author did a fine job with the characters. I liked how the book was all about a real life situation and how it was depicted. I like how the main character is different than the typical hero. I thought that this was a fun read and a good way to start a new series of books for the readers. _____________ " I really enjoyed this book. The main character was likable, the world she lives in was interesting and the main characters (in my opinion) made the book better. This book is more of a coming of age story that I think you should read but still, the book definitely has it's ups and downs. The plot is well thought out and the book has a strong beginning. The ending was bittersweet for me. I would recommend this book to anyone with a desire to learn about real life.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________________________________________________ I've been reading some other reviews and I'm wondering where people have had the problem with the formatting of this book. The whole chapter that describes the process is a pdf file with pictures so it's easy to read, though I'm not sure that's necessary. The chapters on creating and editing a template and creating a simple template for someone new are very good and I think they're great for the novice in the DIY hobbyist world. I'm also really impressed with the information on what to look for when selecting a pen. The other chapters go over those very important issues. I think it's a great book to read and a great resource for those in the biz. I highly recommend this one!

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read about 3.5 hrs of this so far and it's just wonderful. I think the main reason I got it was to see if this could actually be the first book I read by this author.   If you can put up with all the humor and the sexual humor, you're in for a treat.  I think it's a great book because it isn't very good, it's actually really well-written.   The plot is really simple and you can actually follow everything from start to finish.  of course there are also great jokes and puns to be found throughout the book.  .     The art was well-done, the only thing that kept me from giving it five stars was the fact that it was so dark and disturbing. The whole time I was reading I was hoping that it would end on a cliffhanger or with a really epic, emotional, and well-executed kiss or something, but the ending was just so abrupt.   The only thing I can think of is that I'm not a big fan of the main character of this story. She seems to be an ordinary girl who's so caught up in her fantasy life that she can't accept reality in her life.   a   Overall, I love this book, I think it deserves a full five stars because I think there's so much more to the world, the magic and all of the people that live in that world that I could easily see more books from this author!  The only issue I had with it is that the ending wasn't quite satisfying as I wanted it to be.  , and I really hope that the next book isn't as dark, so that I will have another read!   ,

Write a positive review about a good book: ************* My girlfriend and I were going through the Bible, and the book was helping us through the hard times. When I read the chapter on "The Love of Christ", my heart stopped. The way she explains that we are to love Christ and not our own selves (i.e. "love the Lord, and love your neighbour as yourself"). It was such a beautiful, concise, clear way of saying that to me. I was so moved by it. Thank you so much for writing such a wonderful book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    If you are looking for a light and lively novel, read this instead of other books like it.  -The author has the same style in most of his books that has helped to keep his work fresh.  of course, there are parts that could have been better and others that are just plain dull, but you know, that is also the part of literature  It's very enjoyable to read but the narrator is a bit off-putting and, of course (no pun intended) he doesn't give much detail on how his world works.   The characters are quite unique, I can only think of a few other books that have characters like this, for example, Lord Foul's Bane (no spoilers here) and in The Broken Empire (no spoiler here).  I just wanted to add that the book is very good, I would recommend it to anyone.   on another note, the book's plot is really interesting and it took me a while to figure out why a group of slaves were doing all this crazy stuff, I had to read on to find out. .   with that, I give this a 4/5.

I find it hard to believe that the author of the Bible could write the story of Jesus and the early Church in a way that is so completely relevant to our world. This is the first book to be written about the lives of the first Christians (as they were known in the first century), and it is so well written that you may never want to read anything else. I found myself looking forward to reading it, and I have since.  the whole process of translating a book into the English language is a tremendous effort that takes more time than it should take, but I thought that was very rewarding. I like the fact that the book was not done in a one-size-fits-all manner. The author used different approaches to the book and to the translation process, and it really allowed him to make this book his own. It is interesting that the Church in the ancient world was very much in the hands of the Jews. We know that the Jews and Christians disagreed on many things, and in this book the author discusses several times how the Church was very influenced by the culture and traditions of the Greeks. I can understand the author's desire to not make these topics completely irrelevant, but that is not what the book says. The book makes it very clear that this was no simple issue that was simply resolved. The Church is a very interesting topic. It seems that Christians today are a little too eager to use it as a point of departure for discussions about our relationship to our neighbors, and this book would be useful for Christians to look at in more detail than they might want to. It might be worthwhile for Christians today to read it to get an idea of what they are dealing with. It has a long, complex history of conflicts and wars. As the Church grew and spread and became established in many places in the world, many people were killed. This was a very bad time, as the Roman Empire was very concerned about religion and was determined to destroy the Church of Christ. This book gives us a fascinating look at these events and how we deal with them. Overall, this is a fascinating, informative read. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history or is interested in
Write a positive review about a good book: ________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________ Read Full Review  10 of 10 people found the following review helpful:  , October 28, 2017The first time I read this book was in third grade. I remember reading this book because it was an alternative to the standard fairy tales I was used to reading. My parents always wanted me to read more fantasy because my older brother, who was always reading these "horror" stories, wanted me too. I think that was one reason I was attracted to this book. In this book, there is an alien planet called Klyntar, which is a very dark place. This planet is located in a different solar system, so it is not only different from our own, but has also changed. The planet Klynetar was devastated by a war between two alien species: the Gorgonians and the Sirens. The Gorgons had enslaved the Siren, but now there are only two left: the Klynn and the Kriemhild (who have the best and purest of souls). The Klyns and Kriens are descendants of the two species who escaped and now live in the new home. They live in a peaceful society, but their peace is shattered by the war. Klyn is the leader and a very wise man who has become the ruler of the Korgons. He is wise and strong, but his heart is more fragile than most humans'. Klynum is the chief of the Sirens, a race of humans that have come to the new planet, Klyne. These humans are also the most powerful race. The Siren are divided into three groups: Klyna (the most powerful), Klymn, and the most peaceful, the Kriehn. Krynn and Kriehnn are the two chief races of the new world. Kryn, the leader of the Goliath race, is the most loyal and strong. The Kryn are also strong, with strong hearts and beautiful eyes. Kynna, the chief race of the Roid race, are the most cowardly and stupid.Klynn has a lot of power and he rules the planet Kolyne. He does a lot to make sure his people live in harmony and he doesn't let any of his people get too comfortable. This book is a good fantasy story because it deals with the power of love. The main character, Kryn is so good and a

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------- I love all of the books written by Stephen King. He's an extremely talented author, and I would love to see more of his books. I have a few of his other novels and enjoy reading them, especially the Stephen King collection The Eyes of the Dragon. I recently found a new collection of King's short stories and the stories are just as good. He is definitely a master of the short story and his stories will keep you hooked and keep you wanting to know what comes next. Highly Recommended, Highly Recommended

It really has a lot to offer and I love the way the authors take you on a tour of the different parts of the book. I really like that you really get a sense of the personalities and motivations behind the people involved. I was interested to learn the various ways that people came up with a way to save this civilization in the beginning of this book. The history, culture, and religions are quite interesting in my opinion! **********
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is my favorite book to read so far. It is one of the best books that I have ever read.  If you are a parent who would like to have a child in the future, you need to read this book.     I have to recommend this book for many reasons: First and foremost, the author is a mother.  This is a great mother-and-daughter book that is great for anyone who is trying to figure out how to get pregnant.  It has a lot of information and there is a lot to be gained from reading this book and taking action on what it is telling you.  My favorite part of the book is the fact that she provides a lot that you can take to your fertility clinic and get you there on the first try.    If you are trying to conceive this book should be your reference point. 
Write a positive review about a good book:...................................................This book is a great read, and one that I recommend to everyone. I have always been intrigued by the concept of the 'hidden hand' of the economy, and this book was the perfect book to really get to the bottom of it and how the hidden hand of the economic system actually works in this country and in this world today.............................................................The hidden hand behind the scenes of the global economy has been a key point of discussion throughout the world in the past decade as economies in the west are slowing down and economies in developing economies are continuing to thrive. It has been said that the world has been thrown a 'golden mean' by the 2008 global economic crash, and a new 'normal' is beginning to be established. In the book by Professor Mankiw, this 'goldens mean' is what he refers to as the invisible hand of economic life. I strongly agree that the economy is operating on the invisible hands of the hidden economic hand in the form of the invisible economic system. The system, as Professor Manks has pointed out, is invisible because, as the author points out, the invisible economy operates on invisible money. For example, if we want to purchase goods, our income is taxed and it is then divided between the household and the government. Then, the money that we use for that purchase is then taxed and this tax money is sent to banks who then lend the money out to those in need. We then purchase that good, for example, a car. This, again, is money that is taxed and divided. If you then purchase a television, and use the money from the tax money that you received to purchase the television, this is also money that was taxed and divided into pieces. The money is again sent to the banks that will lend the television to someone else. This money will be loaned out once again. And so on and so forth, until all the money is spent and then the money goes to the invisible bank of the country that is receiving it. The bank then returns the money to the household in the amount of the tax that was paid. It then goes to government for the interest that was earned on the money. The invisible bank takes the interest from the government and divides it in to the households and the households then divide this in into their private accounts. This is an invisible monetary system that has been in place and working for some time now. What is important to understand is that this invisible monetary hand of
Write a positive review about a good book:   An interesting book about history and religion. It would probably make a great gift for a friend.   The Good: The author, who is an expert on the subject of religion, uses his wide knowledge of the subject to write a book about religion that is both easy to read and easy to understand. There is very little in the way of jargon or technical terms, and the prose is easy to follow and even quite poetic. I find it fascinating that there are so few books about religion, and that the one that did exist was so short, despite the fact that the author did his homework.  - Good  - Not too technical in terms of details (but there is a little)  —The religion that the book covers is not Islam, but Roman Catholicism.  I would like to thank everyone at Harper Collins for sending this book to me and I thank them all back in part because they sent me a review copy.

"The novel is a journey of self-discovery, the story of an unlikely and difficult friendship and the realization that the two friends have more in common than either of them may ever realize." I can recommend this book to everyone I know and it should be on everyone's reading list too.   This book is just that good.   If you want to read a good fantasy novel, read this one.  If you want a great comedy/drama novel, try this one out.

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________________________________________________________________ I really enjoyed this book. I think it is a great and well-written book. It is quite technical in a very fun way. It does a great job of explaining the concept behind the concept in the best way. The authors did a good job of making the explanations and examples make sense as well as not being overly confusing. I would like to give this book a higher rating but I think the author should have focused on a better writing and not on being technical. It's great to be able to discuss what is going on in your brain with your teacher without getting bogged down in the details of how the brain works.
Write a positive review about a good book: ************************* "What was most helpful about this book for me was the discussion of a number of the most significant and important historical events that I'd never known about and thought I'd heard about and that I wanted to know more about. If I could say this book was more of a "must read" than a book I might have given it a six or seven, I would have. That said, I did enjoy the reading of the other parts of the book and enjoyed it. This is a book well worth the time of a serious researcher looking for more information on all aspects of World War I and World War II. I believe it's a solid book.

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I didn't like this book at first because I was a big fan of the first book. This book is a little better but still doesn't have the same level of awesomeness. It is hard to find a good thriller novel that isn't about a college professor and his son. However, the father is so much more interesting this time. Not that there wasn't any good action scenes in this book but his character is very well developed and I felt he got a lot more screen time than he did in the first novel. He is a good enough detective to handle himself and still have enough charisma to keep the audience entertained. I wouldn't want to go on any more than this book does but it was nice to learn a little more about him. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Read this book if you like: thriller  What I Liked:  - Action scenes are great  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   What didn't work for me:  The main character is still a bit weak. He isn't a very strong character and isn't like most of the other characters in the book. The plot is still very thin and the characters are so one-dimensional that you can't really get attached to any of them. I'd give it a 2 star rating but this book is only about half as good as the first one.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I read this book and have loved it so far. I was a little disappointed it wasn't a children's book. It seems like it might have been a book for young adults. It is a wonderful story about a boy and girl that lives in a house together. In a small town called Cottage Grove, all the kids go to the school. I don't know if this is the reason the book was set in a school, but the boys and girls at school were not as well off as they are in this book. They had problems at home and in their lives, they tried to make it by any means. Their problems led to a lot of jealousy and hatred between the boys that live in the house and the girls at the school, who are better off. The boys are selfish and greedy. They are the ones who are able to be lazy, greedy, lazy, and they get what they want. The girls at Cottage Valley have a lot more discipline and are able too be good parents. The book was very good. It was fast paced and the characters were so vivid and realistic. The author did a great job of describing every little detail about each of the characters. This was one of my favorite books and I hope that this one is going to be set in the Cottage Village and it's the same kind of family that has children.  Please don't read a bad review: ------------ As with most young adult books that have a happy ending, this one doesn't end well. The story is very similar to many of the books I have read in the last few years. There are many books that are set in small towns, but they are not so realistic as to be fun or exciting. This book is full of hurt and pain, and the author doesn't really do anything to alleviate the pain, which is almost unbearable. There is some drama that occurs in the book, but it's not particularly interesting. If you are looking for a good story, you would be better served by another book.   What I liked: ------------- A good story that I enjoyed. The characters were very vivid and real, but not realistic.  I think that the author did an excellent job of writing and portraying the characters and of telling the story.   What I did not like: -------------- The book is slow going and the story does not build up until the last part. There were many times when I wanted to give up and go to bed

Write a positive review about a good book:!!! Great read!!!  Review of A Memoir of Love and Hate by Sylvia Plath:  I think the writer is a genius. I have been in love with a man I met online and have been married to him for 9 years. We have a very loving and healthy relationship. However, I have recently found out that we are in love again with different people and I'm very upset because I don't want it to happen. It's like I'm living in a fantasy world and when my reality sinks in, it's as if I'm dreaming again. I know this is a bad thing but I can't help it. Anyways, I'm trying to stay positive about the situation and it's getting so miserable I have to write this blog post. It is also difficult to read these blog posts on how to be happy in your relationship with the different love interest because it makes me angry and depressed. You can't just tell your spouse you can't stand them because you're in love. I hate being sad and angry about it so I'll stop with the negative writing.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* ***********  The book is very well researched, clear and compelling. I think it may be a little more accessible to a general audience, but even for me the chapters are well worth the read.  My favorite was the chapter on the "New York Times" Magazine and its influence. I had always wondered how the story was told, and why it wasn't presented like an ordinary magazine, but in a book like this one, the reader will see that the "narrative" is so simple, logical, and coherent that it isn't at all an "anonymous opinion" article.   This book is full of gems, and the research is excellent. The author is a journalist, and one who is also a writer. He can craft a very compelling story, and he does it with a lot of detail. I highly recommend this book.  "The Power of Now: A New Psychology of Success, Love, and Happiness" is a great read. It is a very readable book that you'll want to keep in your wallet for the holidays. ....   Review by: Robert F. Schoenfeld
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________ I read this as part of my coursework at the University of Stirling and I am thoroughly enjoying it.  I would recommend this book to anyone with a love of history and a willingness to research thoroughly for an enjoyable read.  Write a negative review about this book: The author claims this is a detailed history of the Battle of Falkirk, the first real battle fought on the Scottish frontier after the English conquest, but it is not. The Battle of the Bannockburn is not mentioned. This is a more or less "history", told through the perspective of one particular commander in the field. The first three chapters are given over to describing the personal experiences of Alexander Mackintosh, the second three to a man who is fighting against him, and the last three to the last few days before the battle, when the general himself and a detachment of infantry were caught in a desperate position. The author makes no reference whatsoever to the Battle in question, other than mentioning "the battle of the British, but then there is no mention of the battle at all".

Write a positive review about a good book:    "You might be interested in this book by the famous American writer, J.R.R Tolkien...I found the tale a fascinating, magical and thought-provoking one."   I had been looking for a way to enjoy a book by Tolkien and after reading his wonderful The Lord of the Rings, it was time to give it a go...and I found it.   My wife, who is a fan of Tolkien, told me there are two versions of the book. One is the one published in Britain and the other in the United States by a publishing house called Allen and Unwin. I didn't see any reviews of the British version so I did a little research to see which one I should try. Unfortunately, I didn\'t find much information either on Allen and Ungo   Read the other reviews and it seems there is only one book, one edition. I was also wondering which edition was the more expensive (at least in the U.S.). So, I bought this and it was a very nice surprise. The story is pretty simple and yet the stories are interesting. There is a lot of detail in these stories.   the only thing I did not like was that the books were small. I don\'t know how many of the stories in the book I will get out of the first one I get but I did like how it was written.  , a collection of essays from J. R. R Tolkien, the English author of The Lord Of The Rings, appeared in 1980, but I have only seen a very few of the essays available online and in bookstores (in paperback, not hardcovers). I bought The Making Of The Third Age from the British Booksellers Association and it arrived with a very good, bound copy and a nice slipcase.The book was a bit hard to open in the UK, but once it was in I found some nice essays and short stories that were not in the hardcover edition.I found a copy of this book on a bookstore shelf, but after looking it over I think I will have to try it again. I think it will be a nice addition to my Tolkien collection.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am in the same boat as I am with most of the reviews. I got this book for my son's birthday. My son is now 19, but he is my favorite. He was very excited about this book, as it was his favorite book as a kid. I think it was perfect for him. My only advice to the author is, you need to put more work into the illustrations. I know it's because of the size of the book, but the images looked so bad I thought the book would be useless. But this book is amazing! I think that this book was a great gift for my niece and nephew. I read the entire book in one night. It was fun to read. This book was fun for them to read for their bed time story, and I'm glad that I read this book. This was a nice little gift that they can use to make their own story book. I received this book as my Mother-in-law sent it to my in-laws for my birthday. I was very happy with this book because I didn't have to read any of the stories because it was written for my children. It is definitely a great read for my kids to read as well. This is a good children's book that my children will definitely enjoy. The book is fun to listen to and for all ages. This will be a good read for all my family. It was a fun book to read, and my kids are all very happy! I like the illustrations! My two girls read this to me as I went through a box of books. I did not read any to them, they are 9 and 12. I like it. They loved it. This book is great for young children, I like reading it because it is funny and entertaining. It really made me laugh. We read the book together, it's a fun story and a very easy read for young kids. My daughter loved this book! I read it to her first and I was really surprised that she enjoyed it so much. I'm sure she would love it if she ever got a chance to play with it. It's a nice, simple story that I would recommend. The illustrations were great. I loved it, it was funny and very interesting. It made me very happy that I got to read it. I will buy this book to my daughter when she gets older. Wow! I received this as a birthday gift

The world is rich and full of people and places, and all of the pieces are still so perfectly arranged and in place that you can't help but be impressed, even when you realize you'll have to re-think some of the decisions made earlier, because the world is constantly shifting and the places and people you thought you knew will seem completely alien. The author makes a point to note this in the beginning, but by the time you reach it, you have no choice but to let go and accept all the changes." It is a perfect synopsis of the book, but I felt I should add more. The book is a journey through the world of Fae, with characters of varying backgrounds. While some of these characters are well rounded, most of them are not. I found the characters in this book to be lacking a great deal of depth. I will not mention which ones they were, but for the ones that I did name, they were not good characters. Many characters were a one dimensional stereotypes, or worse, there was little of the "villain" that is so common in most fantasy novels. It seemed more important to have the main character be a good person than to have any of these "bad guys" be likable. The last few characters had very little background to them, which was sad because there were a great many of them. My guess is that some of them had a story to tell, but they didn't make it in the story. The Fae itself was interesting. I was intrigued by the magic that the Fae could use. I really wanted to learn more about

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________I love all the "what if?" in this book. I have been a fan of this series for over a decade. I remember when I first read this book as a child and the whole series and characters. This book is the perfect reminder. I know the character I am going to keep reading about. If you have a child who will like this book, I recommend it, but I do recommend reading it with a child present for some of the more adult content. If there is one thing I could change about this book it would be to do a bit more research on the author's life. That said it is still a must read for me.Read full review
Write a positive review about a good book: _______________ Was this review helpful to you? [Yes] [No] Submit Review  Good Book but a little more complex than I thought it would be. ______________   I loved the book. It gave me a lot to think about and discuss and even a little thrill on a recent trip to India. I also found it very insightful and detailed in its description of the various rituals and beliefs of certain cultures. It was also very interesting to read about the history behind this ritual.   The main problem I had is that it got a little confusing towards the end when the author starts to get into a discussion on the various religions and beliefs.  , a well-respected author in the world of ancient Egyptian culture and religion, describes how a certain type of ritual was used during a visit to Egypt. The author, using examples from the New Testament, compares the way that the Egyptian priests prayed to God to the way the people in the New World practiced their religion.   (page 29) In the New Kingdom (c.1300-1069 B.C.), the priest of Isis, Thoth, performed a ritual that involved raising a stone called the "Horus Stone" in a certain location and having it be the symbol of the god Osiris, who was the brother of the king. By bringing the Osiris Stone back to the Osiris Temple, Thoths was believed to make the dead king alive again. After Osiris had been raised, Thothe offered offerings to the gods in the Osiris temple. He then threw a golden cup containing wine from the wine press (as described in the Bible) into the river. This, of course, would make Osiris drunk and make him more attractive to the goddess Isis.   it was important to get him drunk so that she could seduce him and take control of the kingdom. There were many ways to do this, which included having him do whatever she wanted, and being as brutal as possible. She would even seduce and rape male members of the royal family, but her most powerful power came from her role as Queen. The queen's position, in other words, was to be a seductress, a ruler who had power over the population, and a goddess who enjoyed having power over men. So the king was required to be seduced and the women were required to sexually gratify him. But since these rituals involved the use of a sacred object, they were not allowed to be exposed to the public. The priest's
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book! It is very well written, it is interesting, and I was able to relate to the character from the very beginning. I was so surprised that after reading the first page I wasn't totally turned off. I think this book could have been much more entertaining. I gave it 4 stars because there were a few times that it got a little repetitive (i.e. 'what's the matter with her?' every time she needed to have a chat with the old lady). The plot is a little bit slow at times (i think I went through the whole book in less than 2 days) but this isn't a book for long reading (though I did end up finishing it, which is the only reason I gave it four stars). As for the illustrations I think they are wonderful! I am a very big fan of illustrator Nuala O'Brien and her books are very popular with my own son (he has his own books too). I also think that her designs look great on the paper (I read them on my tablet) and her illustrations are also very colorful and eye catching (i love seeing the colors in the illustrations!) Overall, I really enjoyed this book. I hope I will be able to find more books with illustrator's names like hers. As an aside, one of my favorite books in the book is a book called The House I Live In by Elizabeth Gilbert. She also did illustrations for The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie. 10/10 I am definitely going to buy the rest of the book. It is an amazing book and it was really fun to read! I received this book for free.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________  "It will not shock anyone to learn that you really can have a life in the middle ages."   "An outstanding book that brings to the surface some of the deepest issues and themes about which medieval people thought"   - John Garthwaite  ______________________________________   Book Description:  This is a fascinating exploration of the relationship between mind and body during the medieval period, from the perspective of the scholar and expert on the field of medical anatomy. A fascinating story, based on the work of some of medieval Europe's most gifted physicians, but told with the skill of a historian, this book makes a case for how medieval people understood the body, in all its diverse forms, and how this knowledge affected how they lived and what they thought and did.   From the very earliest days of civilization, people have been fascinated by the human body. Their fascination can be traced back to the earliest recorded times, when the Egyptians made detailed drawings of their pharaohs' skulls. Medieval people had a special fascination with the human skeleton, which they would study with the same scientific precision and dedication. The most popular medical texts of the Middle Ages -- as well as the most influential modern texts on the subject -- were written in Latin.   is a story of how the medical and anatomical understanding of the medieval world has changed over the course of the centuries. It shows how the body's shape, position, and movements were of great interest to people in the Middle East and Europe. In the first part, an excellent overview of medical knowledge of the Medieval period, we see the impact of the new scientific discoveries on medieval medical theory. This is accompanied by an outstanding bibliography, a glossary, and an extensive index that leads the reader through the entire book.  - The medical profession in the medieval Middle Ages: From Hippocrates to the present  - The influence of new medical discoveries on the practice of medicine in the Medieval era  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Ordering Details: , is now available!

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________________  I read The Secret in the Wild with my daughter. It took me a little while to understand, but once I did I was hooked. It's a really good read for an eight-year-old.  The Secret in The Wild is a great story. It tells of an amazing animal that gets lost in the woods and has to be found by the human world.  of course, there are other animals in this book. My daughter and I were so impressed with the animals. We all wanted to know more about the animals and even though we didn't know the story as well as the author did, we found this book a really interesting book. This book is for all ages.  on the topic of reading with children: This book has many great pictures in it. I would recommend it to any child to read. ,  ,
Write a positive review about a good book:  "This is the first book I've read from Thomas Pynchon since this year's The Crying of Lot 49. It is very readable and the prose is fast and elegant. This is the sort of book that's perfect for a lazy weekend and if you're looking for a very readable, literary, very atmospheric read. It is a bit rough around the edges (it's a novel) but I wouldn't say it was badly written. I enjoyed this book." --N.D. "A brilliant novel. I loved it and highly recommend it." --D.T. I know what you're thinking. But don't get me wrong. Pynchin's The Unnameable is a great read. If you're not already familiar with the author's other work, it may be worth getting through a couple of Pyncheon's books before you jump on the Pynched bandwagon. But if you are, Pynchyen's books are highly recommended. The Unnamable and Gravity's Rainbow are great short stories, and the two have more in common than not. As a novel, The Unnamed is a beautiful and heartbreaking exploration of loss and grief, and an unforgettable example of the author writing with grace, insight, and poignancy. The author's skill as an author is apparent from the beginning, and once you begin, there's nothing you can do to stop yourself from thinking about it. Read an excerpt and a review of The Unnnamable here.

Write a positive review about a good book:...........................................................  The book is a very good one. It explains many of the things a girl has to know to enjoy the men in her life. It has information on how to attract men and also how to get men into your bed.  Thank you so much for writing this book. I would recommend it to any one looking for a good, solid book on how best to enjoy a good time.  is a book on the subject of how to keep a good man interested in you and make it a happy affair. I love the way he describes his experience. Very clear, no filler, not complicated. Very practical and good. The men in the book are very real. Many real examples.   It is very much like the first chapter in a book about how to live a better life in this modern age, but instead of dealing with the issues that can arise when we don't have a job, we deal with the issue of how best and best of all to attract good guys.   It's an excellent book for any woman.  .    Author:.......................................................................  I found this book in a library and bought it to see what a man's opinion would be on the matter. I have been through this many times before and I always look at the advice as "don't buy that book" and then read the book to learn something new or improve on what I had just read. This time I am a little disappointed because I am in no way a man and I have never been the type to seek guidance on what to do with any matter but I wanted to have someone tell me what to expect when it comes to the dating scene. I am also in no place to ask anyone else as I have nothing to add to this already written book.   of what I have read online, there seems to be two ways of approaching the topic of what to say to men when you are dating them, the one I've found most helpful is to just ignore them and tell them that they are the problem and give them all the time they want because that is what they want. The other method is to ask them a very specific and difficult question like "What did you do when I didn't pay attention to you." the second method is probably more effective but is not recommended unless you are confident that they will not find out and are confident you will not give up too easily.   was the most helpful book that I have ever read on dating and

Thanks for the great reviews! * ********************* * *************** * ***** *  ******** ************* ******** ***** ********** *********** * ******* ***** *** **** ****** **** ******** *** ********  This book is a must read for any fan of the franchise. It contains an extensive background on all of the original characters and a thorough story.   The first three chapters in the book are a brief intro of characters and locations that are not related to the main plot, but that are still introduced in the context of the series. In addition, the story has a short introductory segment at the end, explaining that the story is about the creation of the Star Wars universe and how it came to be. I would recommend you not read the first chapter, it is only a couple of pages and has the potential to distract from the main story.

Read an interesting review from an author who does not read, a review written by someone who is in fact not writing fiction. It is the only review I have ever seen from an actual writer that makes no reference to any other fiction. If anyone has seen such a review, please forward it to me so that I may add it to the list.   - from a real writer in a real book   What I loved the most about "The Other Side of Victory" was that the story was well told. It was not the kind of story that required a fast pace or a large cast of characters. The writing was well put together, concise and clear. The characters were well drawn and felt believable. This made for an entertaining read that I would recommend to anyone, but especially to fiction lovers.   for an engaging and well written tale   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------   The narrator did a wonderful job with telling the story, giving it a great sense of place. The voice of the narrator was not just as the book opens. It remained consistent throughout the story.

Overall, "The other side of victory" was a well written, engaging tale that had a lot of fun in it.

Write a positive review about a good book:   Read: "All Good Things" by Robert Frost and "The Road" by Cormac McCarthy.  "All Good things" was a great choice, and the book I will read again and again. "The road" made me cry a little bit...but then I've always liked Cormac, and all good things... I'm hoping to read "The Stand" as well and I will!   Other Thoughts:   1. I do like the idea of having your own little corner of your own world, one that is not influenced by your family or your culture.   2. I like the concept that you will eventually come to understand the world more deeply as you learn more and more about yourself.  /2
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ A great book. I had no idea there were so many differences between the sexes and I was surprised. The book is so short, it was a nice surprise. I was looking forward to reading about the differences between men and women from the book. ___________ A book about the different sexes. Great book. A very interesting book with many details. I was fascinated by the concept that both men and Women have different personalities. A few times I felt a little frustrated with the writing (because it was so brief) and the grammar was bad. It didn't mean I could not enjoy it, it is just a little disappointing. _____________________________________________________________________ I really liked this book. Not only because of the similarities of the sexes, but the similarities between all humans as well. I also liked the fact that the differences are not just the obvious ones of hair, skin color, eye color, or facial structure. As for the similarities and differences, I can't really answer because this is an interesting idea but I haven't read other books that cover the same subject. ________________________________________ The difference between men, women, and children is quite interesting. I really enjoyed this book, I am really excited to read the other books as well The book is interesting. There are many similarities between the various sexes and the ways they view the world. There was no time when I was bored, the characters felt real and lived the world they did.  _________________________________________________________ Great idea. The differences are interesting, and they are not in the main plot, so the story is better for it. ________________________ This book is really interesting. The most surprising fact I had about the gender differences was that men and boys can be very aggressive, while women are much better at getting along with each other.

He was a very good friend and I think he got away with some bad decisions." See all the Goodreads customer reviews of this book!
Write a positive review about a good book:    "Bold, energetic, and original," was how one reviewer described the book's opening section. "Told through the perspective of a teenage girl who was raised as a boy in rural Texas, the book is a vivid and realistic portrait of a group of young gay men living in Texas in the 1960s. We see firsthand their struggle to find community and acceptance, their growing sexual identity, and the challenges faced by those who choose to be true to their own desires."   It's a good thing I read this book before my son came out, as I've found him pretty much incapable of dealing with anything that has anything to do with being gay, or any other gay issue. He can't stand it when anyone says "I love you," or "I feel the same way about you," and has told me so many times how he doesn't care, or even think it's OK to be gay, especially if I'm in a relationship with a woman.   In terms of content, the majority of the book takes place in the 1950s, but it moves through to the early 2000s, when a group from San Francisco was given the chance to study in the small, conservative Texas town of Beaumont. There they got to meet other gay people, and discover the existence of the "Cannons" -- small gay clubs, where they could meet, dance and explore their sexuality.   the book does have a lot of first-person narrative, which I found interesting and helpful. I wish it had more of a focus on the kids, though, who grew up in Beaumount but left Texas when they were just out of high school. I felt like they had more to share, and some of the stories about being gay were a bit depressing.   and you can read it.

I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes, after an 8-year battle with a variety of different diabetes medications. After reading this book, I realized that I was actually dealing with the same thing.

Since then, I have not missed a day of insulin and I have lost 40 pounds since beginning the new diet. I have also completely cut out all sugars and processed foods.

His behavior is much more in line with what is expected of a child his age and I have noticed the change. ----- This book is absolutely amazing.

The information in this book has changed my entire attitude toward my kids. -----  Rated 5 out of 5 by mabey from A book that should be on your bookshelf I was so excited to receive this book and read it in a few days. I was surprised to find it was so detailed and helpful. A lot of the advice is applicable in my family. I learned how to motivate my kids and not take it personally when they get bad grades or don't do what they are supposed to do. I've also learned about taking breaks and making sure everyone takes them. A great way to get through a difficult period.

He has to work extra hard in school to keep up and we are in so much trouble if his parents can't cope with their special needs child. It has been two weeks and I don't see a lot of change.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was very impressed with this book. The first chapter was very well written, it explained what the book was about and how it relates to a good story. Next, the author started introducing his characters and their motivations, and did a really good job of explaining how they all developed their traits. The story is a really well developed one. It has a mystery, and also a lot of twists and turns along the way. I really enjoyed the book because it wasn't just a novel, it had so much character and back story and it was actually really interesting to me. This is one book I would re-read just to know how they did this. If you are looking for a book to read and not just another novel, give it a try. It is an entertaining and interesting read.

It's clear from the start that the author knows the subject matter. Her style is simple, clear, and easy to follow. The topics covered include animal behavior, natural history, and the natural history of humans. This book is a must-have for every natural history major, and should be required reading for students in every department. The book is divided into 4 chapters; The Biology of the Dog, The Behavior of Dogs, The Natural History of the Wild Dog, and The Behavior and History of Humans. In each of the chapters the author takes on the topic of the animal, and in turn explains the science of how animals behave. In each chapter she discusses scientific papers, book reviews, and popular books on the subject. She also discusses the scientific research on humans as well. I have previously reviewed the book here. The book is not intended to provide you with a complete answer to the questions that animal behavior is designed to answer, and that it is not a substitute for a student's animal behavior class. She doesn't take on the science in a manner that a student would, instead she makes it simple for the reader to understand what is being covered. I really enjoyed the way she explained the dog behaviors. I believe I understand her now. She covers all the basics you'd want to know about the dog, including his social structure, reproduction, and food consumption. She does an excellent job of not only presenting the scientific information, but also giving an overview of the science involved. Many of the scientific papers are very informative as well, though not to the extent of the book covers. She discusses different kinds of research, the results of different studies, and her opinion of the research being done. This is another great book that you can give as a gift. It contains a lot of information, and it will be interesting for anyone to read. Highly recommended. Review:   I am writing this review based on the two books you have listed as Recommended reading for the Biology majors. As a student of biology myself, I feel I should give my opinion on the matter. I am a biology major and have a major in animal studies, so when I read a book that covered the biology of a dog I felt like I was missing something.  In fact, I felt a bit insulted when I found that I could not read
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was given the chance to review this book.  The book I was given was'The Secret Life of the Mind ', by Dr. Paul McHugh. I must admit, I have not been familiar with Dr. McHugh and this book seems to be the very first time that I have heard his name mentioned.  It's been a couple years since I read a book, so my expectations were a bit low, but I did like the book very much.  I enjoyed it very much and I definitely believe it has some valid points, but it's not something that everyone will enjoy.  This book is about two scientists, Dr. Andrew Newberg and Dr. Dr. Mark Johnson.  Dr. Newberg is a neuroscientist and Dr Newberg's work focused on what are called the 'unusual mind states', which he refers to as 'dream states'.  It seems that Dr Newburg was interested in how these unusual states affect the person that they happen to be.  These 'unexpected and unusual states' are very difficult to study with any accuracy, so Dr Newburgh began his research with a method known as 'fasciculating'.  He would ask subjects to remember their dreams and then, when they awoke, Dr Newborough would ask them questions about those dreams.  If the subject recalled any of the details of the dream then he would ask the scientist about that part of the subject's experience.  He found that it was the most natural way for an experimental subject to remember his dreams and that this method had the best chance of reproducing the original dream.  While he could not exactly recall every detail of a person's dream, Dr NEWBURG was able to use his knowledge of the subjects' mind to reconstruct the dream in his lab.  As a result, he discovered that most of the dreams that he was studying were very different from our normal dreams. They were much more like dreams that had been experienced by famous people like Jack the Ripper or Amelia Earhart.  Some of the famous people that Dr NEWBROWN had studied were President Kennedy, John Lennon, and the legendary Beatle, Paul McCartney.  In other words, people that we have all heard about and have heard about the most often are very rare in the dreams of Dr NEWBERG. The purpose of the book is to find out how these 'unconventional' dreams are produced.  How does the brain interpret the information in the dream?
Write a positive review about a good book: *********   This book changed the way I look at history. I can not recommend this book enough. It is so informative and is a real "pick up" read.   - A great introduction to World War II for anyone interested in reading about the war and its events   A must have for anyone looking to learn more about the history of World War 2   I highly recommend this to anyone interested, and anyone wanting to learn even more about World War2 and all the events that have occured during that war.  - I learned more about our nation's history from this book than I could in my entire high school history class   It was amazing! I learned so much more about how our nation became the great nation that it is today. Great reads, great value, you will not regret this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "What a great introduction to what to do if you've gone through this type of situation." -John D. From:   I enjoyed it!!! I'm a new father to 2 children, 2 boys and a girl. My oldest was in the middle of a temper tantrum and was only allowed to be on the phone while I was on the bed.  My husband was on his way to the grocery store, and the two children were begging to be let out into the yard.  The neighbor's little boy heard me screaming from the basement (the boy was 1 year old at the time).  He heard me in the hallway, heard my kids yelling, and got very mad.  So my husband told my son to come over to the bedroom.  He left the house but made sure to tell my son it would be OK to come in.  I told him if he was so mad he should go.  There was no further violence, but the next morning my son was crying because he couldn't sleep, and I could tell he wasn't getting the same sleep he usually got.  What was supposed to be a short night turned into a very long day.  A little while later I received a call from my neighbor.  She called and said the little boy was very unhappy with the bed and didn't want to sleep.  Now, if you are a parent you can tell this to a toddler who's screaming all night.   If you're a parent, you can't, because your toddler is probably already very upset.  If this is the case, what could have possibly been the cause of the tantrum?  My neighbor had the audacity to tell me there was a blanket under the bed, and she could change that, but I said this was a new baby in the house, not a new blanket.  (This was several months ago and I have not heard from the little girl since.)   In any case, I told the neighbor that it was my turn to decide if we were going to keep the bed as it was or move it.  This resulted in a very tense discussion that took several hours.  Once the discussion was over, the neighbor changed her mind and told my husband we could keep the mattress.    Now, let's look at this from the perspective of a toddler.  First of all, the toddler was a little upset that it turned out that we were not going to get to
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book! It's a great read. I found myself thinking about this and other books when thinking about the way my life has been and will be. Great job with this book.  How did the author know what she was talking about when writing this book? It was amazing!  What was your favorite scene or section of the book?   What people said about the book:   I loved this book and it is a MUST have. It is one of the best I have read in a while. I am a little bit surprised at the fact that it's still on my bookshelf.  the writing in this book is spot on, I'm not a fan of psychological thrillers but it really is a good read. .  in this day and age the idea of the survivalist is still really popular and there's even a book called "Survival" that is coming out this month.   This book is definitely on my list.  for people who like this type of story it's a very good read  Read it now.   be warned this book contains a lot of details and is full of surprises! /

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Little Boy Lost by Peter S. Beagle The story is told from the point of view of a very small boy, who lives in a very strange world. The author's first book is a very popular book for many reasons, but one of the most notable is the fact that he tells a story in a way that is very emotional, and it is done in a unique way. I found that this book was very emotional in a good way, as it gave the reader a deep sense of loss. I loved the way that the story was told, the descriptions and the plot twists, which was surprising since this was the first book in a series. The characters are well defined and the reader gets a good sense of who this young boy is. The ending is very strong and the author really does a great job in ending the story nicely. This is a book that I highly recommend to anyone who is reading a good story and feels that the author has a way to end a story. 4 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________________________________________ The Lost City of Z by John Darnielle I have never read anything like it.

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- ------------------------- "It is such a great and well written book, if you can't get past the part where the characters talk about what they are eating, you're going to have a bad time." -- Anonymous "It's not exactly a fantasy book and I didn't want to read it, but I still felt like I needed to read the sequels." -- Sarah C. "The book was an absolute delight! I can't wait to read more about the other characters." -- Laura H. "I was so glad I chose to read this book! It's great to read about a character who was so kind and selfless, to think about what it must have been like to be that kind person, to have that kind heart. She is so good at expressing what we're really all thinking and feeling about our own characters." - Emily H. --The Characters: The characters of this story are so real and you will feel their emotions. They are so well written. I especially loved the characters who are not characters in the book, but who I feel were inspired by characters in this book. For example, I thought that the narrator in this story, who, like the rest of the characters in her life, is named "Sylvia", is a very good character, because she was the most like me. She had similar problems I had. I liked the character of Lucy who was described in this short story. She did not have the kind of good fortune that I had to have in the beginning of my own story. Her feelings of frustration were the same as mine, but she was willing to work hard for her own happiness, which I knew I needed as well. I really liked the other character called "Sarah" who is called by the narrator the "princess" because she can do all the things that I could not. And, it didn't hurt that she did! My favorite character is, of course, my husband. We get along beautifully. I think he is a wonderful writer and he is one of my favorite characters in any book I've ever read. I read his story because I wanted to understand the situation of someone who wanted a happy marriage. I didn´t have that in my life, so I liked his story. Sylvia and Sylvia's story was a wonderful one. I loved how the author brought them together, I loved that they worked together to solve their problems, I liked their marriage, and I liked that they made each

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________ A very good book on one subject. It contains useful information for new writers and old writers alike.  I enjoyed this book. It did make me think about my writing style, the structure of a story and how it all comes together. I like the fact that he talks about the things that writers are already aware of (i.e. the plot/story) and the things we aren't (i  In my opinion the writing in this book is pretty solid. I feel that the author made some minor spelling and grammar errors in the manuscript, but these were easy to catch and fixed. I think it is good to practice writing in the form of fiction, even if it is just a little. The story is really well written.   The plot is solid and interesting. It was a little confusing at times and a little repetitive, but I think I got through it in the end. It does leave you with some questions about your characters and their actions, but overall I found it very satisfying to read.   at times it was confusing as to who is who and what is what, but the plot gets better the more you think about it.   and the characters are very well done, and in my opinion some of them are pretty bad ass.  .
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm not going to go in for science fiction that tells me what happened last time in a distant planet. That's a tired, cliched story.  But it's good to know that it's still going on!  The first story that really caught my eye, in the early sixties, was "The Coming of the Cosmic Mind" by Paul G. Hewitt.  In this book, a boy and his dog get to meet an alien in the attic of the house, who tells the boy how to talk to it in his own language.  The book also has a scene in the future, where the dog is actually a young child, who is trying to talk with the alien in his language. If you like this kind of thing, I have only three words to say to you, "Read it again." Review by:  Lila T. Koppell Read the first story here: The Coming of the Cosmic Mind  by Paul G Hewitt The first story in this collection is a lovely little gem.  I have to say that this book came out in 1968.   I was a young teenager then, and I loved it.    I don't think it's as current today as I would have liked.  When I found this story I thought it was a bit far-fetched, but it has grown on me and it's a nice story.   The whole story is narrated by the dog, who seems to think that the boy is a visitor from another planet.  He asks questions that are difficult to answer, and he asks them in a dog's voice.   So you'll have to read it to find out what his questions are.  At the end of the book, the boy and dog return to Earth.  Then the book ends.   Read a sample of the second story here The second story is very old and very good.  It is "The Unthinkable" by Roger Zelazny.      This story is a wonderful look into the future from the perspective of the people of the future.  This is an interesting time period as there is a lot of speculation about where we would be in the next five or ten years, and about the effects of the war in Vietnam.  Zelaznny is not afraid to explore the future and to look at things from a different angle.  Read an excerpt from the third story here  and a

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------ I was very happy that I bought this book. It took me a while to find an English book which deals with the same subject. But I found the book in one of my local library, which was really useful. I like that you don't see in the book how the Chinese people used to understand the foreign people. They used to treat us foreigners, just like they treat other Chinese in the same area. I love how you can read about the people's customs, especially the differences between the different cultures. I think that you'll enjoy the book. And this is very good that the author has a lot of knowledge about this subject. ------------- I just want to say a few words. The book I have just read is really interesting and fascinating! You must see it! This book covers a lot about the history and culture of the Chinese and their languages. I must say that the book is very practical and practical. The main purpose of this book is to make the Chinese understand our point of view, about ourselves and other countries. The author has an understanding of these issues and he has a good grasp about the customs of this area. His understanding about this topic will be useful to all people who are planning to visit, travel in China. I will definitely recommend this book to everybody. ------------ Thank you. It was a very interesting book. The language of the book was very easy for me to follow. I had the book when I was going to Taiwan, I really liked it. I hope this book will be of help to my friends in Taiwan and to other foreigners who are going to China!  Reviewed by Toni K, USA on September 1, 2011
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ This book is a good description of a man who had a lot to learn. I love how he made his father understand that they should be kind and understanding, even in times of pain and sorrow. I learned about a lot of different things about him. He's not just some man who has a problem with alcohol. It's more than that. He struggled for his family and himself. He was born into poverty, and I can only imagine what it was like for him to be a small boy and be raised by his alcoholic mother. My sister and I loved the fact that the father who had raised our brother in such a poor way and was able to give him a good life with his wife was so accepting of the child that he grew up with and tried to teach him right from wrong. It would've been nice if this story had a happier ending, but it had an ending that was very satisfying to me. I thought the whole book was very informative, although I did read more than I intended to and it got boring. I was reading this as part of a series called "Father's Day", which is also good, but the man who is the main character in this book was kind of boring to me and I felt like I already knew a lot about his life and what made him tick, but in a new light. I think I'm going to start reading books about people that have the same problems I do, and if I get into it I will try to learn about them as well, since they're not all the same, not even close.

I've read plenty of great books but this one stood out to me. The author is a very good writer, she knows how to tell a story well, and what I liked most is that she used a lot of her real life experiences, which is something I always enjoy. I have my doubts on whether she was even born when the wars happened but it's still a great book!
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book really helped me. I'm new to meditation and didn't want to pay the price for some course. I read a lot of different books but none really helped with the meditation part. I finally got this book. It was my second book from Amazon after reading a free book. I am very satisfied. It helped me a lot to stop over thinking or having to think. I really like it that I can share this book with others. This book made me realize that meditation is worth it. If you are struggling in meditation and reading this book is not helping you anymore then I highly suggest reading it.  Write a negative review about the same book:  I have never purchased a book about meditation before and I didn't expect it to be so expensive. I was pleasantly surprised when I received this book and then began meditating. The book talks about things like how to meditate and what kind of books you should be reading if you are looking for more info on meditation. For me it is not necessary to read a book on meditation as I already know I should meditate. I just started meditating yesterday after reading the book. For now I am going to start reading some other books on meditation to supplement what I learned in this book but it's definitely not a waste of money to give it a try.  to be honest I didn`t find much info in the book on how to do the meditation exercises. For instance I would like to see more detailed instructions on how many times to medicate or how long to mediate for. This is my second purchase of this book from amazon. I hope it will be useful for others. ...
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________ I have read this book from cover to cover (the first time ever) and i have to say it is great. I liked it a lot. It is one of my favorites that i have read, because of it's historical setting and because it has a good plot and it's well written. I hope to read more of this. I am writing this review while i am typing this review, so i might not have the most accurate review out there, but i wanted to at least put this out there for people to know what they are getting into when reading the book. The book is divided into four sections. The first is about the people and the setting of the book and the second is about all the battles in the book which are all fairly well done, I particularly enjoyed the description of the Battle of Nueva Espina and all the other battles the Spanish participated in during their time in Espana. The third is all about the different factions that fought in Espanyol, and what they were fighting for, as well as the political reasons behind these battles, i.e. the factions that were trying to expand or control the empire. The fourth part is all of the political stuff that happened during the conquest of Espanyola, and how Espanyoloans themselves were divided by their political views on the situation, as there was a lot of politics, and people had their own opinions of what the best course of action would be. I especially liked the last section of the story which focuses on Espanyolin itself, the empire of Espannaola which was a separate entity that didn't actually have a ruler, but was ruled by a council of leaders that were elected by the population (it's worth noting that when it was established Espanyolan politics and social structure was different from Espanaan, which is a common theme in many war/colonial/ethnic settings. Espanyonoans themselves did not have a social structure, it was the political situation that made it so. Espanolaans still had monarchies when Espana was formed, but the Espanyoans were no longer a monarchy. This was the only way they could maintain order because the power was in the hands of a council that had to decide the power distribution between the different ethnic groups. Espannaoloans had their "first king" until Espana, and then they were ruled by elected council who were elected to the council and had to serve for 4 years or until
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. I had never tried meditation before but this book is exactly what I needed. I'm a high school English teacher so I know how to write clearly, I've read a lot of self help books but I never tried meditating before. This was the first time I tried meditate and it really worked. It was so easy and I didn't feel like I was getting anything out of it. I think the best part was my students and how they were excited when I said I would be meditating after school. This book can help with a lot more than just meditation. I also think it could be used in schools. If you don't get enough sleep or have a lot on your mind it is important to meditate. I do think I would recommend this book to anyone who is considering meditating, or just wants a simple way to relax. Rating:  1 star

Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________ [Review is not written in the voice of a character.] I'm not going to go so far as to say the book is a terrible piece of trash, but it does fail to capture the sheer brilliance of his original work. And it fails to capture that which is at the heart of the concept, namely a new kind of fantasy universe built on a very different foundation than anything else out there. This one, however, comes at you in a much more direct way, it is very much about being part of a story, not being the protagonist. That's what makes the book so very enjoyable for me - it is a tale told as a whole, not in the context of a single story. And I loved the fact that there were several different "narrators" - some of them (I'm looking at you, Michael Moorcock) are quite brilliant and the others don't quite come across quite as effective, but they are all engaging enough to keep the story flowing at a decent rate. I really enjoyed reading it - but I wasn't a fan of the actual story that much either. I would have preferred the character-driven book, but I still thought that the overall concept was an interesting one and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the idea of this sort of fantasy (even though the story has quite a bit of cliched material, it does make for a very good read).

I was a terrible reader at that age, but as I grew older I picked up a few things and this book has stayed with me ever since.   As with The Devils, this book is told from the perspective of a child. When asked how many birds can fit on the head of a pin, the young protagonist says, "Enough to get the message across." It's clear that he sees things from his parents' point of view, even though he can't really explain it.  , I have been very disappointed by stories in which children do not act like adults. As children, they don't have all the knowledge we do or, often, don't want to have. They have no idea how to react to situations they find difficult, but adults have many more experiences. As a result, when I have read stories where kids act like a certain kind of adult, it hasn't always been the best experience. However, I think this is the first story where children have a full understanding of what the adult world is like, and are even making their own decisions based on that understanding. It also allows the character's growth to be much more complete. I have never seen a book like this and I can only hope that a few more will come out in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think this book is great! Not only did I learn a lot from it, but it was very inspiring. I am an atheist, and I love this book for many reasons. I was also able to discuss religion with a friend who has a different perspective on the subject than I do. He loved it. I found it so fascinating that he was able to talk about things that are so personal to me and such an important part of my life. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read other books by Mr. Harbinson and they were very good. This book however is quite different and I can't put my finger on it at this time.  The book has no plot and a lot of pages that could have been put together for a novel. I know some people might say this is a bad thing but this is how I read books and I find reading these kind of books interesting and I enjoyed this book quite a lot. The author makes you feel like he is a character of his own that you are reading about. You are not just following this guy but have a vested interest in how he is being used. It makes you really curious and you want to know what is going on. The descriptions of the different countries are really quite amazing, very well done.   This is the kind of book that you read because you have something to do and are really interested in what is happening to the different characters. I read a few books last year that just sucked me in and I never got a good feeling from them. I really enjoyed this one and you should too! I have to say it has become one of my favorite books.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********** The first time I read this book, I laughed out loud. It is funny and it is dark and gritty and it has a dark, brooding feel to it. I really liked the idea that the man is using the woman's own family to keep her family from learning the truth about her history. As you know, there are some problems in this family with the mother being in and out of jail, the father being an alcoholic, and the daughter having an abusive mother who does not know what she's doing. The family lives in the woods of Ohio. It's very quiet and they have an overbearing woman who is not only a very powerful figure, but who is also abusive. She and the mother of the family both do not get along well, so the man sets up a meeting with her and her family. The woman doesn't know who the man who is showing up with her is. He has his car in the driveway when she arrives. It seems a bit strange to the man that he shows up in the middle of the night but that he doesn't make any attempt to stop him. The man explains to the woman that the daughter is a missing person and the father is an alcoholic and will do anything to try and get rid of her. The sister gets upset that the woman is trying to kidnap their daughters. The daughter is trying very hard to protect her sister, but the woman doesn´t understand the situation. The next day, the daughter shows up at the woman´s house with an older man, who tells her that she has two choices: stay in the car and get a good night´s sleep, or he will take her home and the two of them will start a new life together. The girl says she doesn´ll choose her mom and the man leaves. The mother arrives at the house. The father is in the bedroom and the woman asks him if he wants her to go to the police and talk about the woman with him, or not. The dad says "I'm not gonna hurt her. I just wanna know her real name". The wife explains to her that her name is Susan and that she´s from Ohio. When Susan gets into the car, the mom sees the older man. The mom tells Susan "You´re in trouble". Susan says "No Mom, I'm not in trouble." The mom doesn't believe her and drives off. When she gets home, she says she was attacked at the store, but
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am amazed that this book is actually published. I have read many "exposing the corrupt" and "doomed" organizations. This book does a superb job of exposing the corrupt as well as showing how to win at a level that is even difficult to explain. I think I have spent $600 in books so far on this topic and this one was way under priced. The book is full of actionable strategies and easy to follow step by step directions. Thanks for a great book.
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------- I read this as a high school student in the late 90's, and was blown away by the story. The story is a bit confusing at first, but it all came together beautifully. I liked the characters. I don't know much about them, but they all seem like real people. And the action was really cool. I will probably check out more books by the author. --------------  Read the first 4 books. I loved this series. This is the second part of the 4 books I read. The action is intense. The characters are well developed. I can't wait to read the third book, because this series is so engaging and entertaining. -------------  I finished the first book and finished reading the second today. It took me only two days to read and review this book. I'm a little skeptical about the second book, but I am eager to read it. I am a big fan of paranormal thrillers, and I was surprised by the fact that this series did not come up in my search. I do agree with some reviewers, that the paranormal element is just part of life. It's about a group of friends who meet each week and have fun. They've had some problems and they just move on. I've read books like this before, and it never got old, especially since the characters are real. I did like the ending, although I would have liked a little more exposition. I enjoyed the first two books very much and this one has me in suspense! --------------

I would highly recommend it as a work of great and challenging thought.  Thank you, and I'll keep it short and sweet. ,  Homer Jones, The author, says, "This book is about the impact of the human experience upon a species of animal that is, as I suggest, a species that is the least studied and, therefore, the least understood. I feel this is important work because it tells us more about ourselves and the world than any other book I have read."  _______________________________________________  A powerful novel about how animals experience us, how they think, and what their lives might be like if we had different ethical views.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* "I am a huge fan of this series and I can't recommend it enough. As a fan of fantasy and historical fiction, I felt the authors were able to portray the world of the 17th century without losing their authenticity. The characters are well-rounded and believable. The stories in this series are exciting and exciting to read, because the reader will never find themselves bored. My only complaint with this series was that it took a little while for the book to begin, and the first book was a little slow at the beginning, but the characters are so believable that the reader really wants to finish them. The second book was also a great read, and I really enjoyed this book as well. I also feel that the author was able to capture the feeling of a war torn land in 17th-century Europe."

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the book I've been waiting for.   I have read many books on the subject of "how to write a good story" that are nothing but generic "how-to" information. I've also read a lot of books on storytelling (a subset of nonfiction writing) that are much better than this book. This book is, in fact, an improvement over the vast majority of books that I've ever read. I would certainly recommend it to anyone that is interested in the subject.   The book is divided into three chapters:   The first chapter, "How to Write a Good Story," is fairly self explanatory and I will not bother to comment on it further as it would probably be more helpful to read the book first.   a. How to Start. This chapter is pretty much a tutorial on how to write. It gives basic writing advice, explains how different styles of writing work, and describes how you should organize your thoughts, ideas and emotions in order to achieve a solid narrative.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm still in a bit of a shock, having finished reading this book at the age of 25. I had a copy of it for the longest time, I think it was at a book store in Dublin for a year or so. I don't think I ever looked at it again, until a friend of mine got hold of a copy. It is a really great read, and a fantastic story. It took me back to a time when I thought I would not like the church or the priesthood, but this book made me realise that I did! And I really do love the church now, even though I have a slight scepticism about it. I'm a little bit shocked at the amount of detail that has been put into this book, I was just thinking about how long it would take to read, but I'm glad it is so short. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of the Catholic Church. I think this book really should be included in the list of the greats by the Catholic Writers group.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished reading this book. It really took me on a personal journey to understand why my husband left me in the first place. It's very insightful to be reminded that there is someone else that has your back and needs you every bit as much as you do, and it's not always easy to figure out who to turn to, what to say, or what to do. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that has experienced a relationship break up or knows someone who has. This is a beautiful book, and the author really does an incredible job of expressing her personal struggles.

Read the full review: http://www.reviewjournal.com/BookReader/reviews/The-Falling-Water-by-Loren-Cormier  In the year following her marriage to the Duke of Wellington, Lizzie Borden (an Australian noblewoman) must contend with the pressures of being married to the most powerful man in the world and her own feelings of guilt over the murders.  The Duchess, a wealthy widow with a growing brood, must fight for the freedom of her two daughters, Jane (14) and Charlotte (9) and the man they love.  this novel is the perfect blend of romance and history. The Duchess is a perfect book to add to your collection if you are looking for an engrossing historical adventure novel, with the romance and the mystery added to a great story. ,

Write a positive review about a good book:    I like to learn a bit more about my subject, so I decided to pick this book up for a good read. I really enjoyed the subject, it was fun to learn all about, and it took me a little while to really grasp everything.  I enjoyed it because it gave me some good ideas, I found the information very informative.   One of the things that was interesting to me, was this quote: "In every human culture there's a way to survive and prosper in the midst of turmoil."   The quote was interesting because it pointed out that in every society, there are ways to survive when everything is going wrong, it's not all bad. If we choose to, we can thrive in the chaos of chaos, because it's our own way of surviving.  , especially when it comes to survival of the fittest, which the author refers to when explaining the term. This idea that we should be able to thrive when everything around us seems to be against us, just seems to make so much sense to me.I like a good plot, and while I enjoyed the plot of this book, the characters just wasn't all that interesting. For the most part, I didn't feel any attachment to them. I think I would have liked to see them become more like us, instead of just a bunch of different species that have all evolved to do different things, I'm just a little bit too cynical.

Write a positive review about a good book: **************************** This book is a great example of how to make a historical novel that will appeal to a wide variety of readers. I had no idea this could be done before this book came out. A good author can bring in many readers to a historical fiction, as the author has done here. ************************** "To me this book is about the last great battles of the American Revolution. As a young boy I grew up with a love for books and movies and in all the many movies and TV shows I have seen, the one that really struck me the most has to be the final battle of the Revolution. I grew to love this battle. It is the one battle that really stands out in my mind, the last battle of this revolution. I just love it."-Randy, Grand Junction, Colorado I was never quite sure how this book would work as a historical book, as a battle, and a novel. All of that I am glad to know is accurate. For me the book's main point is that the revolution happened, in the same way that the Civil War happened, but that in the final battles of this revolt the Americans came up short. The reason is that they were so divided, that the Continental Army lost all of its military leaders by the end of the war. We see this throughout the book with two of the main characters. I have always felt that Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson were the main leaders of the revolution, but as they both die in the first years of the Civil war, the story is split into two chapters. There is the good part, where we see how the two men lead their armies, and how the forces of the revolutionary forces are defeated by the British. There was only one problem with this book. I found that the book was written in a way that made it very difficult to read. The author had not read history as a subject. He never seemed to know when to make changes to the historical facts, and this made the book read so slow. It wasn't until I had finished reading the book and had written some reviews that I discovered the reason why. When Alexander Hamilton died at age 79, he left the book open on the floor of his room, and it was still open when he died. As he was still alive, there were lots of people who could have read the book. The second character who I found very interesting is a young woman named Sally who lived in Boston in 1774. Sally is a very independent

Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________ My wife, daughter and I were all interested in buying The Good War. However, my wife said she'd rather read the novels in the series (which were fine, in her opinion). The Good Book was her favorite. So, she was skeptical about it and was reluctant to buy. I said I couldn't make up my mind either way. So we each got the books. When we read them, she said the writing was good and the narrative was easy to follow. However the first book in the trilogy was confusing, hard to get through and didn't make much sense. I couldn the second book and found it a very good read. In my opinion, if you're looking for a good historical novel and you want some historical background, don't read the Good War trilogy. My daughter enjoyed the books a lot, but as a history buff, I was disappointed in the first couple of books.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------ What I have to say about this book: A must-read for anyone who thinks they may one day be a cop. The authors talk a lot about the "pros" and "cons" of working as a police officer, including the upsides and downsides of the job. The cons are a lot more than I would ever have thought possible and it made me really appreciate how many people put their lives on the line every single day, which in my opinion is the real reason for police work. The pros are also very interesting and well written. The book was well-written and detailed enough to really help any student of police work understand the profession. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in knowing the behind-the-scenes aspects of the police job and has been wanting to do more.   What could have been better: ---------------  I would have liked a little more information on the training of officers in the academy. This book is written to be used as a textbook, and as such does not delve too deeply into some of the training procedures.

Write a positive review about a good book:!!! My son has read many books since he was 2 years old and he is always amazed and amazed at what he reads. He absolutely loved this book. He loved that he was able to play with the animals. He did have a little trouble keeping them in order as some had to be put in a separate crate but he was so determined and we got the best of him. He was so excited when we got him in the kennel and he immediately started running around. He is a really good boy, he loves all the attention and doesn't get too much of it but he is a loving boy. He doesn't know how to walk on his own yet but that will come with time. I would recommend this to any of my little ones. My son was so happy! Thanks for the great book!

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book does exactly what it set out to do. If you are already into The Art of War by Sun Tzu, you should definitely pick up this book. If not, then at least check out the video by John Galt. It is the best summation of Sun Tze's ideas that I have seen. I think that this book can be used as a textbook and is the most important book on war ever written.   The book starts with Sun Tzedu explaining the history of war. In the beginning there were no wars and that led to the idea of 'War is the continuation of politics by other means' which he also said in this book, although we are not taught this.   for the next 400+ pages Sun Tse explains why he says that this is the first war, how it is different than other wars and it teaches us that there will always be wars, not only in the history books. In this book we also get to know the concepts and the different forms of war and the best way to attack them.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "A fantastic work. This is a brilliant novel that is set in an alternate timeline in the Harry Potter universe."   -   This book is like a very well written Harry Potter story but the story is set a little earlier. It is set sometime during the early 2000's and the Harry/Hermione relationship has become a bit of a thing between two kids. There are some hints in the back of the book but it is hard to tell. I think this book is going to be very good and I can't wait to read it.   The book is really good, it takes place in two timelines, Harry/Ginny and Harry/Ron. Ginny and Ron are close friends and very much in love and I liked how they had a falling out when Ginny found out about Ron and her feelings toward him (I was really disappointed in how Ron handled this as well). Ginny is pretty much the only one that knows of the other timelines and I think that is pretty great for this book. Also, there is a ton of love between these two and their characters.  .   and this story takes place just before the events of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. This means that there are only two people that know of the existence of this other timeline. The story follows them as they try to figure out why the Harry in this other universe is behaving like this, what is the origin of his powers, what will happen to them, etc.  , but,   So, this story is very different from the Harry / Hermione relationship that we have been introduced to in the books. Harry is a bit older than Ginny and he doesn't have an older sister. Ron and Ginny do not get along very well and I was a little disappointed that Ginny didn't have the same relationship with Ron as Harry did with her.   a couple of things that stuck out to me:   I like when Harry and Ginny date but I never knew why they dated and I thought that was a bit weird.   "But he is mine, is that not the whole point of being a brother?"   Yes and no. There is a story that is told that says that Harry never knew his older brother's name, so he did not know he had a brother. However, when Harry meets Ron for the first time and he realizes he had been the brother of the person that he knew as Ron, he knew instantly that he was in love with him.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm currently reading my second copy of The Art of Racing in the Rain.  It's a novel that I picked up from a used book store and had a great time reading it.  The story was a bit boring to me until the very last couple of pages, where the author switched the focus to a different character's life.    I am very impressed by the amount of thought this author put into making the story.  I especially enjoyed how the author dealt with the protagonist's emotions.  The ending was also a bit surprising, but I like the way the book ends.  In the end, it's up to the reader how to feel about this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is great! It is a great way to learn and to get a grip on the important topics in chess. It has everything you need to play in any tournament. I also love the pictures of the chess pieces and the diagrams. I've got the book for Christmas and I am looking forward to reading it over and over again. I am a little surprised that the author did not include the rules of chess (such as middlegame structure), the rules on the king in the center, or even the names of the different pieces like queen or rook etc. These things are important for someone starting to play chess and you don't need to know them to play well. This is a fantastic book and I highly recommend it!

Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a good read. I'm not much of a fan of science fiction, but I've enjoyed a few of their works. This is one of them. I have a problem with the "realism" of most modern fantasy fiction. There are a lot of "cool" ideas and "dramatic" plot twists, but they all have a very narrow range of acceptable behaviors. The "realist" novels of the past were the "hard" fantasy books, the ones with a lot more of a plot involved than some of the things in this book. This book has much less of that and is a little more "fluffy" in that sense. I found it a lot easier to suspend my disbelief and not be too bothered by things like magic or zombies (or robots, for that matter) or anything like that. This isn't a book that will be for everyone, as it does have some mature content, but if you enjoy the sort of fiction you'd find in a "Hard" fantasy novel like Sword of Truth or even the early works of Neil Gaiman, then you may find it very relaxing and entertaining. It may be a little less "fun" to read than the other "hardcore" books, but that does not stop me from enjoying it all the same.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________Praise the Sun I am a believer. If I had not read The Man in the High Castle, I would not be one now. This book was well written, has interesting historical facts, and it was easy to understand. I like the fact that there was no need for a "new age" interpretation as there are many other books dealing with the same topic. The main character was really nice and a little "dumb". However, the author uses the "dumbing down" concept very well. I enjoyed the time traveling and how the whole thing makes sense. This is a must read for the conspiracy fan.  My first book on e-book, but I will be back for the others, I enjoyed this one quite a bit and it really makes you think. If you're a fan of sci-fi, you will really enjoy the book.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good mystery/thriller.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________ I read this book in a couple weeks (around July or August, I think), and it was pretty good! It did make me think a bit about religion, especially about people who make a living off of their beliefs. In general, the people in this book were well-written and portrayed well. The problem I had with the characters was the little things, like how some characters are so obsessed with how they are "supposed" to look and some things they do because they think it's "required" to do something. Other characters have the same things in their heads that I do, but act in different ways because they have their own views of life that are much more simplistic. I did not have the best time reading this book, but I enjoyed it. I didn't care for the religion part. It felt as if the characters in the book are stuck in their religion, and that's not a good thing to be stuck with. I am not religious in the religious sense, but in the same way that I can't read about the world because I don't agree with its religious beliefs, so that's where I ended up.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________Reviews_:  1 of 1 people found the following review helpful: .   I've read a lot of YA (and, by extension, sci-fi) and it's never struck me that the author does a terrible job of writing a female character, at least for one of the stories in her collection. Her protagonist, Grace, is interesting, smart, and, for the first few chapters of the book, fairly well written. But when she's caught up in the story she's in and it takes a turn that I would never have seen coming, she falls off a cliff, like, a lot.   I'd have given her a higher rating if I could've known about this, and the first half of the story is fairly good. There's some suspense and tension. There are a few good cliffhangers. Grace gets some of the best character development (I liked that she grew as a character). I just felt that this was another case of the author writing a book about a female heroine in the 'hero' role that didn't really make me want to read the other books in the series.   was written a good, long book and that's all I'm saying. She didn't do much wrong. However, I think the second half of her book suffered because the plot was very different and, after it became obvious the hero was not the hero, the book got very confusing.   of a good read: ______________________________Reviews:
Write a positive review about a good book: *********** I bought this book last weekend. I loved it. It was an interesting read, especially the last couple of chapters. There is some real "down-to-earth" stuff about what it was like to live in the 90s and how people got used to the "New Girl" TV show. I would have liked to read more about the women of the 80s who were the stars of the show, but it's great to see how the ladies (especially the younger ones) have moved on with their lives. I can only hope they do get back together for a movie or something. I am interested to see the series continue. I know it is getting close. I hope this book ends up on the shelf next to my other Harry Potter books."

I recommend this book, as there are some really good tips for you if you want to start your own small press. _____________________________________________________________________________ I really enjoyed this book. I found it interesting and informative. I liked the "why" behind the writing process of each book. And I enjoyed the "how" of putting the book together.    As a writer myself, I'm always interested to see how other writers do it. I hope this book inspires other writers to get started with self publishing or to try something different.  I've written this book and have edited it, and it would be a really useful tool for someone who is starting a publishing company.  "One author's tale of self-published success" is a nice intro to self- publishing.   My rating: 3.5 Stars - My rating:3.5 stars -

Write a positive review about a good book:   I recently finished The Last of the Mohicans by James Fenimore Cooper. It is a true story that has stood the test of time. I would have never thought that I could have loved the book so much as I did. It was a challenging read at times, but it is also entertaining at the same time. The characters and the dialogue are so well written. I especially enjoyed the romance between Mr. Reddy and his wife, Mary. I found myself laughing a lot as the characters would react to certain situations with witty banter. Overall, it is a great story. I am definitely going to re-read it.

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------- Great books, and really useful! The best part is that they are free and it is totally FREE. You can download and read them as often as you want, on your own time. There is really only one problem with this, is that you have to be in a position to do the same in the future. My father and I have just begun to dig into some of the more complex material and I've come up with a great deal more than I ever thought possible. My dad has had this book in the past for a while, and has learned a lot. He is now looking at the materials to be able to begin his own journey of spiritual growth. He now has his first step towards being able to have a deeper connection to his spirit and his source of power. This book is excellent! --------------- The main book in this series is The Book of Light. I have also purchased The Inner Compass, and they are all great.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's not easy to put your hands on a good copy of any book, and this one is a good example of that. I found that it was written in the style of a classic adventure/fantasy adventure. The writing style was good enough to have been written by a modern author and the story, although there are some flaws, was believable. The characters are well developed and believable. It's all written in a style of classical fantasy adventure, which I find very interesting. Although it was quite long for a short book, I did read the book in one sitting. The world building and setting were well done and there were a lot of interesting characters and settings, such as a world with a lot in common with The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. I thought the story was good. The ending was good, as it could be done with a good cliffhanger, as I mentioned above, however, there was a bit too much of a predictable conclusion for me. However, I would definitely give it a try.   I am not very good at giving good reviews, but this one definitely deserves one. I gave it 3 stars because I thought there was quite a bit of a cliffhangers ending that didn't make sense to me. I would give it 4 stars if there was no cliffhanging. But I won't because it doesn't make any sense to see that a hero who has defeated all the other enemies has all of his enemies waiting for him on the other side. Also, the hero doesn't learn how to use magic until a very late point in the book.   the rating is not to be taken lightly. It might sound cheesy but if you liked the Hobbit and/or Lord of The Rings, you will probably like this book. It is short, fast paced and very enjoyable. I give it 3.5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good book: *****************************   It is a bit confusing because this is part of a series and the characters in this part are the main ones. However, the first chapter in this series is "Cinderella", and there is a chapter in each of the other books which is a little bit more descriptive. This is the description in the first one:   "And a woman came from a very small and unimportant town. In fact, she was a poor one and her husband had no money either. But she loved her home, she loved the way it smelled of flowers and rose water. She loved to walk around the garden and see how the flowers grew and the flowers bloomed and how the butterflies flew above.  She had never been very well-known in her small town. She had never gotten much respect from her father and her uncle, but her mother loved her. She lived in a small old house, with the flowers on the porch and the roses blooming all over. She was a very good cook. The chickens were always clean, and the pigs were always healthy. Her little brother was very sweet and obedient.    Her husband was a rich man, a man who liked to travel and had a lot of money, but he also hated poverty and he had trouble controlling his temper. Her uncle always wanted to take her away to go fishing, to take a trip to the country. She'd always told him no and told him if he didn't like her back then, he'd never get his money. She liked to tell him he couldn't buy her or anything. But her husband always got his way.  a week before Christmas, as she sat down to her holiday dinner with her family, she suddenly got a bad feeling and asked her mother if she could go fishing. But all that her mother had to say was no. And just then her uncle came into the room and said he wanted to go. And it just seemed to her, like it was always his way to be the man. So she told him yes and then got up and went out to the boat to get her father's rifle.   The boat was moving fast, it was sailing across the pond and she couldn't hear the roar of the water that would soon be coming, so she thought, well, I might as well enjoy the scenery, too. She looked at the beautiful leaves and trees, the trees and bushes on the dock and the birds singing and how they

I have a hard time getting a good read out of anything else, but this is an extremely good read. It is definitely more readable than the other ones I've read so far. I'm really looking forward to what happens next. I think it has a great ending. A really good ending. Also, it is great that a woman is the lead. I hope the second book focuses more on the other characters. I do like the concept of it. I did have some problems with the ending but it was all so very unexpected. There is no buildup in the beginning, and everything goes down in a very abrupt way, and I am really enjoying this new beginning.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read this book quite a few times. Each time I go into the book I am impressed with how well-written this book is. The story, setting, and characters in this book are brilliant. I think the best part about this book for me is the love story between one of the main characters and the evil woman that he is destined to kill. She is so amazing in this one. It is like the story is going to end and then something wonderful happens in the middle of the story and it is just perfect. I have to say that I love the character of Ben. He was one of my favorites, he is very well-developed, and he has a very complicated life. I also liked the way the main female character was portrayed. The romance between her and Ben was so well done. They were just perfect together. I like the book because the writing is amazing. I don't know what to say, really, but it was my favorite book I've read so far. :)

Write a positive review about a good book:  When I first read this book, I was a little disappointed. It was written at a much later date than I would have liked, and I felt that the story was rushed. I also felt that there wasn't really any development of the characters, and it just felt like a continuation of the last few books in the series. However, over time I have come to realize that this was not an important issue for me. What did I actually like?  Well, if you are a fan of the series, you will not be disappointed. I love all of the characterizations and story lines in this book. The writing is perfect, the characters are believable, the action scenes are spectacular, and the setting is wonderful. I have been reading and re-reading this series for the past decade or more, and this is the first book in the latest series I have started. I really love the last book in this series, "Guns of the Golden Sun".  If you are looking for a new series, this is definitely the book to read.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________________________________ This is a superb book on the basics of chess. If you are just getting into the game, or have been playing for awhile, then it will serve you well. If, like me, you have been studying chess for many years and have not yet mastered the fundamental chess tactics, this book is very valuable. I have been teaching this book to my daughter for several months. She has learned a lot of advanced tactics from the book. The techniques I have used on her have been really good for her. Overall I am very pleased with the book and it is one of the first books on chess I have bought.  The book is well-written, the pictures are interesting, the tactics are explained clearly, and the exercises are very easy to follow. The authors have been very good about answering questions and answering them quickly and accurately.  "In many ways, Chess Tactics by Peter T. Lachman is a great deal like a combination of chess and Go. It is an excellent resource for those who want to get a firm grasp of the rules of chess while learning some simple tactics for the purpose of playing chess better. This book will certainly be of interest to people who are looking to expand their understanding of chess, both at a professional level and in the realm of amateur games." - Peter Lachmann, "Pawn to Pawn"   "This book is absolutely essential in the understanding of both basic chess techniques and advanced chess tactics. The book is a bit pricey, but I would say it is worth it. It provides everything you need to get started playing and playing well, whether you're an amateur or a chess pro." - John Kuznetsov, Grandmaster "Podcast"  . __________________________________________________________________   If you are a beginner, or simply want some interesting ideas to spice up your chess, this is the book for you.   Chess Tactics is a set of 45 tactical exercises with a set amount of time and number of moves. Each exercise includes a picture and a short summary explaining how to use the tactic.  : )  If there is anything I can do for you, just send me an email : )  I really appreciate it! :)

Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book! I had heard good things about it, but was afraid it would be too much like something I would hear in a store. However, my fears were completely unfounded!   The characters are all well written with just enough variety that I had a difficult time with who was who. My favorite character by far is the older and more confident girl, who is also my favorite to read.   I didn't get into the science aspect, but that could have been me because the book wasn't as detailed as I thought it would have been.   "I just knew what she was doing was the right thing, even if it seemed like she was breaking every rule on the book."   My daughter read this to me in her bed with the lights out, and I don't think she noticed the book. It was the story that made me want to read it again. This book is a fun, light read that I highly recommend to other parents.  .

I'm not sure why I didn't learn about this before, and I'm glad I did. I wish it were a bit cheaper, but I'm too patient to wait. Also, it's very entertaining!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book.  It is a short book about a group of young students who are going through the same experience and making a difference.   It was easy to read and it was very readable.  in fact, I was reading it for work purposes.  of course, this is not the first book from you or your family on the subject of cancer, but it is the most recent book I have read and I thought it was really good and very relatable.  , I would recommend this book for anyone who thinks about cancer.

Write a positive review about a good book: _______________ The best part of this book was the story. It was very well written, and while it was a bit confusing at times, I found it entertaining. It will be very useful when I have children, and am considering having them read this book.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ The book is well written, well researched and well written. The book gives insight in to the politics of Iran, the events that took place and the characters that were involved. I really like the characters and their development throughout the book. There is no boring moments, the book is very suspenseful, the author writes a good scene and I think the ending will give you a good feeling after reading. If you liked The House of the Spirits, I think you will like this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book made me understand a lot. I just want to go back to it and read it again. "The Good of the Bad" By: David Anthony What a story, I'm sure everyone that reads it will love it. What a story to share with the ones that loved it. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more of it. But I have to admit that I don't like all the characters either.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********** I first read this book about a year ago. I loved the story and felt it had a lot of potential, but something was missing. It did get better as the book continued, but by then the last three chapters were a bit dull and felt more like a short story than a complete book. There was also a slight bit of a cliche to it at times, which was annoying, but I did get my money's worth out of it. The main character in this book was really great and interesting, with a very unique perspective. I enjoyed the story very much and I definitely recommend this book. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel.
Write a positive review about a good book: *********This book is a very informative book that is full of great information and is very helpful for anyone who is planning on taking their new found interest in martial arts to the next level. From beginning to end the book contains many interesting and helpful stories of the martial arts that you can use as inspiration for your own training. The information in this book is definitely relevant to me personally because I started karate when I was a young man and I've been practicing that art since I was 13 years old. After I had done my homework and had developed an affinity for it I wanted to be a better person and do all that it takes to become a better martial artist. So far this book has been the best resource for me because I have been able to focus on the learning and not be so overwhelmed with all the different techniques and techniques that are covered in this particular book. I really look forward to my next book because I hope that I will be able to get more in depth into the techniques that I am currently working on and get a better understanding on how to get better at them. In my opinion this book will save me so much time and pain. I can't thank Tim and his team at West Wing Academy enough for doing a job that is so thorough and informative. I will definitely be using the information they teach in my next books and training sessions. I am now in my 2nd karate book, I am in my 3rd karate series, and I am always looking forward to getting a new book because the knowledge that they teach is so helpful. I highly recommend West Wing for anyone looking to get their martial arts and fitness levels to the Next Level. It is a pleasure to do business with them. I look forward for you to receive a quick review of your next book or to get the latest info on how West Wing is helping you to become the best person you can be. Thank you for the opportunity to provide my feedback! *************
Write a positive review about a good book: __________. The best book I've read for a while. I can not thank the author enough for writing such a wonderful book. He has created a character that you can relate to, yet not in the usual way. He does a nice job of describing their lives and the challenges that they face. I read this for fun and I enjoyed it a lot! I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a book that can relate their own life. You will not regret reading it!
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I really enjoyed this book and thought it was a great addition to my fantasy world." "As I continue to read and expand my horizons I've found myself wanting more than the simple pleasure of a good story. I want to know more about the world, the people, the cultures and more importantly the history." It's just another fantasy book. This is another of those books which is so easy to put down that after I finish it I get the feeling that I just took a nap while I waited for the next installment. It's just hard to keep reading something so flat. The story does have a lot of potential. There's a couple of characters who I'd love to learn more about, but so much of the book is spent dealing with these two. There is some nice world building, there is a good amount of action and the plot is just... dull. I guess it's because this is what it is. It has potential, but it doesn't manage to deliver.
Write a positive review about a good book: ******** My mom bought this book for me after I had been depressed. My mom is the type of person who listens to all of her friends and family. She had read a lot of books on depression and suicide and was concerned that my friends were not talking about depression. I had to read this book to understand what depression is and it really helped me. I learned that I am not alone and that I can be loved and supported. Thank you Mom for sharing this book with me and it has been one of the best pieces of literature I have read this year! My friends and I are still talking about the book and I have been told that there are many books out there that are just like this one, but they are just as good. My rating: 3 stars I was sent this book free of charge by the author and the review has not been changed due to the nature of the author's donation. It is my understanding that the book was donated as part of a book club. If that is true and the author would like to make a donation to help support me in my work to help others struggling with depression I would be more than happy to accept and I look forward to reading more from you in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book: *********  "For my wife, this is the most thorough guide to learning Japanese that we have found. In her case she is a native speaker and was very frustrated to learn kanji (Japanese characters) on her own. This book helps her to learn these characters on her way with very little distraction. She even got her husband to read the pages aloud to her to explain what they mean. This is very useful as she had no idea she needed to start reading these. I am very happy with this book."  -Mary   About the Author:  Julie has been studying Japanese since 1995. She works as a translator and teaches in her spare time.  She has been a teacher in her own right since 1997, having previously held the position of Head of English Language for the New Zealand Government's Department of Foreign Affairs. Her passion for language and her love of learning new things drove Julie to start her own learning program in 1995. .  at one time, she did not like reading at all, and she did all of her research in Japanese. Now, she reads and enjoys novels all the time, and has become fluent in Japanese since 2005. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is absolutely excellent, especially for someone who has never read a biography before, especially someone who is new to the world of politics. I will be forever grateful to the author for making me aware of the great work done by men and women in all political organizations. This book has a powerful message.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  "The most intriguing book I've read on the subject of writing" -Troy Nisbet, author of The Write Thing "An engaging read, not just for the story or the language, but the fascinating history of writing and the culture of the modern world." -Dylan O'Brien, author, Drones and Stars, A Most Wanted Man "A truly fascinating, and fascinatingly written book. I'll be recommending it to everyone who'll listen to me." -Robert A. Heinlein, author Stranger in a Strange Land and Stranger in the Kingdom "I'm in awe of Robert A. Howard's ingenuity and his ability to tell a story as he tells it. This book makes the reader feel as though he or she has been living in the early twenty-first century when it comes to writing and literature and what constitutes an 'author.' This is a unique and insightful book that I feel I need to read more of to be fully satisfied with it." -J.C. Hare "A book about writing, literature, and history that is as entertaining as it is fascinating, a book you'll want to continue reading over and over." -Bill Chalker "Robert A Howard is one of the most prolific authors of the twentieth century, with novels such as Conan the Barbarian, The Shadow of the Apt and the Conan the Destroyer series. His new book, The Writer's Gene, is an exciting look at how a writer's genetic and mental makeup affects the way a writer crafts a story and creates a universe." -Publishers Weekly "Fascinating, insightful, and informative...A great primer on the importance of the writer's brain." -Tara Duggan, author Of the Gods and Men Review from the publisher: When Robert Howard set off for the Great Western Book Fair on the afternoon of November 28, 1883, he was not only the author of some of the finest pulp adventures of the period, but also the first great American writer of fantasy literature. After the success of Conan the Conqueror, Howard was well-known to pulp fans as the author whose "writing is simply a matter of finding the words to describe the world" (The Guardian). His adventures, set in the remote wilderness of western Kansas, were full of outlaws, treasure, and blood. He made his name in pulp magazines, and published the best-selling Conan series in the 1920s and 1930s. But for all of his success as a writer, his
Write a positive review about a good book: ---------------I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn a few good self defense moves, which are very simple, effective, and don't cost a fortune (I'm guessing that if you pay $25 for a set of 5, you could probably make the same use of it yourself with very little effort, without wasting a penny of your time. I have personally used these moves and I have NEVER had a self defense incident with them. (It only takes 5 minutes to do them). ---------------
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a total beginner with learning languages, and this is by far my best and most helpful resource on the subject.  I would recommend this book to any beginner in any language, as it was extremely helpful in the very first few lessons I took, when I was just starting out, with some minor edits to improve the book for the intermediate/advanced learner.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a fantastic book that has been very helpful for me. I was very excited about writing this review because I really felt like I needed a good reference for some of the basic stuff I learn about the subject matter from this book. The first time I used this book was to explain to someone what I mean when I say that the universe is expanding. I really don't have much experience with that. This book makes that much more easy.   I definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about the basics of the subject.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "Love this book... I read this book in the early 80's, and it is so timeless in the way it addresses the issues that affect us today. I can still picture some of the comments my sister and I made, as young girls, about some of these issues as we read the stories." —Shirley "This book was the perfect gateway into the book and a wonderful introduction to the wonderful world of fantasy literature and the many genres it encompasses." —R. S. Wight "I really enjoyed this book! It made me feel very old (not too old for fantasy) and I got to feel a little bit guilty for my poor choices as a child that caused me to not grow up fast enough." —Caroline "I read this when I was very young and it made me think a lot. I felt that there was a book that I could relate to (I know some of you will say that the only person who can relate to the situation is a vampire, but my favorite characters are the elves... anyway, it was this book that really helped me understand what was happening in my world and that I wasn't alone." —Maddie This was a very enjoyable read. A lot of the characters were realistic, and the author showed a good eye for the many different cultures she covered. I loved the magic system. The book was a bit lengthy (which is typical for some of his books, I'm not complaining) but the plot kept me wanting more and it was well worth the read. This is a classic for sure, and is a great addition to my fantasy library.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book, it's really unique and the characters are all believable. The way it was told was very interesting. Also the fact the there are multiple endings to the story was really interesting.  The narrator did a good job with his narration and he captured my interest.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is a good, simple introduction to the nature of mind control. It gives us a glimpse into what it is like to be programmed. The writing is clean and clear, so it's not too difficult to understand. It also is very easy to follow.   If you are interested in learning more about programming and how it is used to influence people's lives, this book is for you. I know that this book can be a bit frustrating to read. I've had to read it several times, trying to find any kind of good, long, interesting quotes. There were so many, it was hard to keep track of them. It's hard to tell if it's a good read because I kept going back to it, or if it is simply because I didn't understand it as well as I should have. I'm not a big fan of the author's "humble" writing style, which felt a bit too pretentious to me. 
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------ When I first came across this book, I was completely surprised at how deep and interesting it was. The author is a very gifted writer. I really feel that you should not be reading books about this era without a lot of background knowledge and an understanding of their social structure. This book is very informative and I was thoroughly entertained by the way he presented his story. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a very clear introduction to the concepts and practice of effective communication and communication skills. It's a lot of information in a short amount of time, but I think that what is missing in the current generation of self-help literature is the "why". There are so many reasons why people don't communicate effectively. I think people have a limited understanding of the reasons behind why some people communicate poorly. You don't have to go to a school or have an education to be a great communicator, but you should know WHY you communicate poorly and be able to develop strategies that will improve your communication skills in the future. That said, you do need to make your goal in life to communicate well and communicate well today.  The best way to do that is to learn from your mistakes.  Read full review:   This book is great. I have a few complaints about it, but not enough to take it off my "must-read" list. 1) The book seems to be written for people in college. I found a little bit of grammar/spelling errors in the book. I could not get past the "s" and "a" errors, which is not a big deal, but it made my brain ache at points. 2) The chapter on communication at work was kind of boring. It was mostly about how to use the phone, not about the actual communication. It did give you some tips on how to communicate better though. 3) There is a lot wrong with the book, but that isn't a bad thing. I did like it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a little hard to understand, and I think the information in the book was not really in depth at all. But, the book has lots of pictures and diagrams, and they helped me make some more sense. However, I really wish that some of the diagrams had been more clear. Also, the descriptions were a bit difficult, even though they are supposed to be explained in detail.  5.5 stars 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think this book is great. It's good on a lot of levels. It is a story about a woman whose son is having some trouble with his brain. I am glad that the author was willing to go the distance to provide support for his mother. The main character doesn't come off like a person who is just looking for attention. I think that it's more about the journey she takes from what is normal to what she needs to do to be happy. And it is a very interesting read. I also like that it has a good plot and good pacing. It never gets out of hand. It does have some problems in that it is pretty short but it does get to the core of what needs to be done. It also doesn't have all the answers (not really), but that doesn't take away from the fact that it contains a lot to think about.   If you liked The Catcher in the Rye, then you will like this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:     This book is great. It tells the story of a young woman (the protagonist, who is named Anna) that comes to the attention of a former member of the government who believes he has the ability to help her. He calls her Anna and she becomes obsessed with him. She goes through several mental disorders in the process and tries to kill herself at several points. She eventually finds the man's son, who becomes her only friend, and together they try to get help for Anna. The author doesn't go into too much detail about the characters, but we do meet them briefly and they are very well developed. Anna is a great character, and I think her story was one of the more emotionally intense books I have read. It also got very emotional after the end of the book when it seemed the world had gone to hell. I thought that was pretty clever. The first half of the story is quite predictable, but the second half of it is a little bit of a surprise. It is a slow burn, but it works. It was the same with The Night Circus, but this book was more emotional than the Night Circus. It's good to get that out of the way before starting the second book in the trilogy. I really loved the ending. I was a bit disappointed in how much I liked Anna's friend, but I like her more than I did before the book. Overall, this is one of my favorite books, and a great way to learn about the mental health system and how difficult it is to get any help.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "If you want to know what it's like to be a female in the Army and to serve in the Middle East, the book is for you. Not for any other reason, it's just a good read." "You are a pretty, well-educated girl, and you're in the US Army too, right? Right. So... what happened to the guy in Iraq? Did he die? Did you see him die? What do you do with an old guy?" I know this seems like a very bizarre question, but if you think about it, it makes perfect sense! We often hear how we don't want to be left behind in the military when we have kids, that we want to help our country to win the war on terror. But when it comes to serving in the ranks, we often find that our stories are rarely shared.  So, I thought I would share my story of serving overseas with a male colleague. I'm a US Army Officer in the 173rd Airborne Brigade, the Army's "Majestic" Special Operations units, and I'm currently deployed to Iraq for a year. The other guy is a "Pony Express" Special Forces Operator.  He joined the Army after high school to become an infantry officer, but as he was growing up in a military family in California, he was forced to join the Air Force.  I met him during a tour of Iraq and he was very happy and proud to be serving his country. He also has a wife and two children and has recently started a family of his own.  He has a great job and is very well respected by everyone around him.   He has already gone through numerous deployments, multiple deployments, and still goes back into combat as necessary.  He is now just coming back from his second deployment as a combat engineer.  He has gone through multiple deployments.    His life is good.  Now here is the strange part.  In the military, we call him the "Porn Star" because of his sexual orientation.   He is straight.  But he has told me over and over again how much he loves his wife and his family.  Even though he and his wife have been together for several years now, he has never been married and is extremely open about it.  As far as I know he still does not have kids.  My friend was in an extremely happy relationship for several decades, but recently the

Write a positive review about a good book: ********  I bought this book because it seemed interesting and thought I'd try it out. I was pleasantly surprised by the accuracy and quality of the photos. I also liked how they were arranged to give the photos a different perspective and made it easy to understand what the author was trying to convey. I'm glad I tried this book out! *********  This book is a little dated, but it still provides good information. I will say I like that it does not try to take the easy route (that is not its main purpose). It doesn't just give the facts, but tries to provide context in the form of a narrative. Also, it has some good illustrations that show the different cultures and ways of life.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My only real complaint about this book is that there were a lot of typos, but at least you don't get the sense that you're reading a textbook. I liked how the author uses history as a framework for understanding why some people would react so violently.   The story is really good too. I read this in a couple of sittings, and didn't have to think very hard about what I wanted to think about. It had a bit of a "history lessons for young adults" feel, which I enjoyed. The ending was also quite interesting, although a bit abrupt.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  I love this book! I love this author! I am so glad to be learning new things again.   I am glad I decided to take the chance to read this book.  .  A positive review from someone who read the first five chapters of this book:   This book is very well written and the author presents the most recent research on memory, learning and neuroscience to create a well organized overview of this complex subject. It is well written to the point that it is not necessary to understand every detail, but you will learn what it is you need to know. There are many chapters on the human memory and memory in general as well as the new and emerging science related to memory, including neuroscientists working at different institutions. This book is well organized and covers all the important aspects of memory and how it works, including a chapter of the brain. I do not know if the author has actually read this part of his or her book, but I am sure he did.   the book does not use an "old" form of science (which I would say is still needed in this day and age), but rather a modern form (which is why I love it).   It is interesting and important to understand that the brain is not just a collection of neurons and other specialized cell types, but instead is made of millions of individual cells called neurons.   It is also interesting to understand how different types of cells in our brains store different types information. One such type of neuron, called a dendrite, stores information on where neurons are and how many of them are there. The other type, called an axon, stores the information on which neuron is communicating with which neuron (where we have electrical synapses between neurons).   I do find the author's explanations to be a bit confusing at times, but he does explain it well enough that it does not distract me from my main topic and it does make sense. I just wish it was more in-depth.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book because it sounded interesting and I was interested in writing.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book. It was a short book but I could still read it in a few days. The best part about this book is that it is not about religion. It is about a woman and her husband. We see the different characters of their lives as the woman's life gets into a mess. The main character of the book was so nice and caring, you can't help but love her. It took me a few times to figure out who was telling the story. After I finally figured it out it was a very interesting read! This is a really good short book that you can pick up and read in a couple days.
Write a positive review about a good book: ***********  If I had to pick a single book in the whole series, it'd be the one with all the characters in it and no resolution in sight.   I liked all of the characters, even the ones that weren't the main focus, but none of them stood out to me. They all had flaws and shortcomings that make them more real than the typical archetypes that are thrown around in most fiction. I did not like the main character much, but there was a point when I realized that the character did not stand out enough from the rest of the cast, and by the end he was just one more character with a unique way of doing things. And the villains were a big surprise!  (hide spoiler)] [ There were other characters in the book, like the doctor, who I've read about before and didn't think much of it, but I liked the character more because I was surprised that he had a relationship with a woman. And I had no idea what would happen to him and who he would end up with. It was interesting how many times it happened (3 or 4 times in the entire book). I've never read any other book that features such a strong female lead. I like the way the book went in the second half of the book.   (hide spoiler)   And some of the dialogue and the book's content I liked, but was not my cup of tea. The story is a bit predictable, but the characters are not interesting. As I mentioned in the beginning of the review, the plot was not the main reason for reading this book. I was expecting some sort of romance or some other plot device that would make me want to continue reading. But I'm not sure what to make of it. I'm a fan of mystery/thriller books, but this was not one of my favorites in this genre.The only things I really liked about the book were the characters (and a lot of them had flaws I never knew about). My wife is a horror and fantasy reader and said it was fun to read. She was surprised about how scary the main villain was, but she enjoyed the plot twist and enjoyed seeing the ending.This was one of the first books I've had since I started reading for pleasure. I'll probably re-read it a few times before I finish it. This was one that took me awhile to get into, and I probably won't finish it as it took me time to

Write a positive review about a good book:    I just wanted to say thanks for making an awesome book. It was so much fun. I was just waiting for the next book in the series (the 3rd book) to arrive. Then I was able to get this book a day before it was due to be released. So I was excited when I finally got the book.   The characters are awesome. They're all different and distinct, they all have different styles of writing and different goals for the book, and I love that they're all so different and unique. They were all entertaining and interesting, which I don't usually appreciate in a book. They all come to different conclusions, but they all come with a ton of twists and turns. The writing was great as well, I was surprised at how good it was.  , I loved it and I recommend it to everyone.   the book was so great, I think that it's time to get the next one. I think this is the 3rd of a trilogy and I hope that the next two books get better and better. The first book was just fantastic, so I was looking forward to this book. I loved the plot, the characters, the atmosphere and I really enjoyed how the characters and plot intertwined. The ending made me smile. I also loved that they all came up with different solutions for the problem.   I was very interested in learning more about what was going on at the university. I've heard so many stories about people who attend such a school. I didn't really think that the people who attended such a college would actually be capable of doing such a thing. The author explains that they have a lot of work ahead of them and that there are no shortcuts to the problem of creating a working university. In the end, we don't really know why the professor went along with the scheme, but he sure got his money's worth. If you're in to mysteries, mysteries, puzzles, etc, then this is definitely a book for you. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to learn something new, or just get out of the house and read some books.  There are some really neat photos in this book as well. I liked that they went in-depth with the people involved in this situation. There are some great scenes where the professor is having dinner with some of his students, and we see some great side-by-side comparisons of the people from the photo. They really went to great lengths to understand
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I read this book on my lunch break while at work and it was a great read. I liked the characters so much, the action and the way that they worked together. It was all so well thought out. This is a great book for anyone who loves books with a lot of action. I love this series!   Review Details: --------------------- I absolutely loved this book! I like action, the characters are real and believable. I loved the magic, the battles, the romance and the humor. I am a sucker for a good romance (it was great) and the action made it all worth it. My only complaint was the lack of a happy ending. It did not matter if the guy died in the first or last battle. I would have loved to see him happy and alive in the end. I will definitely be picking up more of these books in the future, and will keep an eye out for the second book in the series.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story of how I met this amazing woman has been the most amazing experience of my life. I am a heterosexual male with an insatiable hunger for sex. This book has given me more insight into my sexuality than any other book. This is also a great introduction to the female body as it relates to my sexuality, and also a nice read for anyone who is struggling with body image issues.   I have been a reader of "How To Find A Woman" for years. I have since re-read it to prepare for the upcoming birth of my second child. In reading it, I have learned more about myself as a man, as a husband and as a father. This, combined with having been to my own births, has made me a more complete human being. I can honestly say that this book is a must-read for anyone interested in personal growth and personal transformation.
Write a positive review about a good book:    An enjoyable read, with an ending that felt realistic.   This book helped me get over a major life change and it did it with a sense of humor that helped me too.  The characters all felt like real people and the world that they lived in really was a very well designed world. I recommend this to anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good book: *************This book is a classic and must be read for many reasons, not only the fact that it is written in the form of a letter.The fact that the letter takes up about 25% of the book.I read this book a long time ago and it still gives me chills and my mind still is not clear what just happened but what I do know is that it was just such an experience.A very moving story with an ending that is just as well written as the beginning and the beginning was amazing.The main character of the story is not only a woman, she is a widow.She is an amazingly beautiful woman, and I believe her beauty is in her eyes and her kindness, I will say that I have never read any letter from a widowed woman and felt this way when I read it.But it is also the way she writes that makes me understand her so much better.I would strongly recommend this book to any woman who is going through the pain and grief of a loss of a spouse or loved one.I also read this story on the internet and to me it sounded more like a horror story than anything else.And that is the way it needs to be. It is a tragedy.
Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________________________________________ (This review is for  "D.C." ) "D. C." (John Deakin) is a very enjoyable novel. While there are some very interesting concepts in this novel, such as the idea of a man who doesn't take a drink because he doesn't want to be responsible for another person's death, I personally found the characters rather flat. While we can certainly have a few things against these characters, the author does a good job of making it clear why he wrote them the way they were. The main plot of the book focuses on the life of the last living member of a family known as The Sleeves, who are the last known family of Irish vampires. The Sleeve family includes a man named Michael, who is a widower and is in love with a woman named Marcella. Michael is a good man, who seems to be doing all right by his family. When Marcellan is killed in a car accident and Michael is suspected as the murderer, he goes into hiding, believing the Sleevers are responsible. However, Michael does have some close friends in the family. The last known member of the Sleeve clan, the one Michael most loved, was his niece Margo. The family is in danger, and the family doesn't have the resources to keep it going. This is where the plot of "D C." begins, as the main character, Margo, is given a job by an old friend of Margo's, to help the family keep the family together in a time of need. ___________________________________________________________________ "D c " is very entertaining, and fun to read. The characters were interesting, and I liked that they weren't what I would call easy to like. I enjoyed it. This book is for teens or adults. This was a book that I liked, and that I would recommend to others. _________________________ (This is a review of the Kindle edition of "Frost" by John Deakin ) "Fro sh! Frost, I am a vampire, I like to get my kicks from killing people. I'd like to keep this short, so I'll just say this, that it's not as if you have to kill your parents if you don't want them to die. And don't you forget it, we'll be talking about me and Margo getting married soon." _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ (The above quotes from my "Frequently Asked Questions" page.)

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ It was a great read! I am a history major and this book is very interesting and educational. This book is definitely worth checking out. I enjoyed it! - Anonymous Reviewed by: I had never heard of the American Revolutionary War before this book, but this book made me really interested in the period. I think this is a good introductory book to the American Revolution for students in high school or college. It's interesting, and well documented. The book was well written and presented. The professor was very knowledgeable about the period, and the information was explained well, and in a way that I would have understood even if I had not known the subject before. I would recommend this book for students who are interested in history, but haven't yet taken a class in history. - Anonymous review from: The information in this book was very well researched and extremely easy to understand. The historical detail was interesting, the illustrations very well done. This is a great historical book. The story is told with a lot of historical accuracy and with great depth. - Elizabeth G. Reviewed from: I am very pleased with this book. I have used it to help my own history teachers teach history. It is a very well told, good looking story about American history in general and the Revolutionary War in particular. The information given on the Revolutionary war was very good and well detailed. I am not at all certain that I have a favorite character, but my favorite was probably Gen. Washington, but probably more because he was a man, and not as a general. In general, however, I enjoyed this book very much. I highly recommend this to any high school history students.  - Anonymous review by: A very good book! I just finished reading this book and it is very well written. The text was not at the level of the book in the history section at school and is probably the best I have seen. I'm a history teacher, and I feel this is great for the student. - K.K. Review from: This book will be very helpful for those students with a basic knowledge of American History and its many aspects. Very well written, very informative, and extremely interesting.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a huge fan of fantasy, and have read almost every book in the series. I started reading this book after hearing rave reviews about it. I found the characters and the plot compelling, and I really felt the magic that the books described. This book has very little action, and the characters are more like the protagonists of some real-life fantasy tales. The plot was interesting, and it felt fresh. The magic was also interesting, in a way, and even if the plot and magic were boring, I would still recommend this book to fans of fantasy literature.   The story is told in a very simple fashion, but the characters were interesting, so I think it was a success in that respect. I would recommend it to fans who enjoy fantasy novels with little or no action and are interested in a good plot and a compelling character.

Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________________________ This book was a real eye-opener! I've always loved history, but I've never read about it so specifically. So I thought this would be a good primer, so I bought it and I am so glad I did! You start off with the Roman Empire and you read about the decline of the Romans. Then you go on through the Middle Ages and through the Renaissance. You go through the Industrial Revolution and you also get into the post World War II years. It's a wonderful tour and you get to see how all the major events that happened in the world are connected with each other.   I got the history of Ancient Greece (with the great Socrates) and Ancient Rome, which I think are the most fascinating of all the books I have read so far. I also got the Civil War, the Revolutionary War, and the French Revolution. It got me excited to go back and read them!   The writing is so clear and easy to read. It is like someone handed the author a great deal of information and the author just compiled it into a book. I was blown away.
Write a positive review about a good book:   If there is a book that teaches me so much it has changed my life it is this one by the great Jim Rohn. My kids are now 5 and 1 and they still love him. They are always asking him for a book and he is so kind to help them find it. It is the perfect book to show children how to read and how to be successful in school. I wish we could have bought it a long time ago when we had the money for it.

I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good fantasy." I was very pleased to receive this book from my favourite author. She is very patient and has a very clear vision of how her world works and why she writes the way that she does. I was also pleasantly surprised at how much information she provided me with in a quick reading. I have always found the book world of fantasy so interesting but had never thought of it as a realistic place. I thought that she was giving a wonderful presentation of the world she created but was not really sure of how she would be able to explain the magic to a person who does not understand it. The first part of the book gave me the impression that the magic was very complex and that it had to be explained to someone who didn't have the background to understand it properly. She gives a very thorough explanation of what the magic is, and how it works, but it was definitely a complex system of spells and symbols, and she does an excellent job of explaining each part of it. It would be good if the author could have given a little more information

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________ I recently picked up "The Story of a Good Day" by Laura Kipnis. It is a story of the early days of a relationship I was not in. Laura writes the whole thing very quietly and almost reverently, in a voice which is hard to imagine being the voice of someone who is, in my mind, very much a grown up and in control of her own life.   The book is really about the end of a long-term relationship. The reader is told, as Laura does not give a lot of details, that she and the man in the story had been together for twenty-two years. We are told that the man was a very handsome man and she was a beautiful young woman. He had had several other women before her, but he did not go on to have children. It was a happy relationship. There is a very touching scene in the book, which takes place in front of the man's home. As they sit and eat dinner, he gives her a kiss on the lips and says, "I've been thinking about you. I've never loved anyone as much as I love you." She responds to his love with a kind of "why not," and they hug. They kiss more. He asks if he can touch her breasts, and she replies by saying, "We've never had a good time together," but she still loves him. She says that the kiss she gave him was "like a flower." They begin to kiss again and hug more. This time she says "I'm sorry I don't feel any attraction to you, but you've been wonderful to me." She has no more attraction for him, but she loves him nonetheless. She writes "I think you'll be able to take it. I can't imagine not having you in my life. You're better than anyone I know. And I'm so glad that you made this difficult decision. I'm grateful that you gave me this chance. You've been such a great guy. You make me very happy, and I am so happy that I can be in this place that is as good for me as it is for you." He tells her that he doesn't think so, and asks her, "What if I never had sex with you again, but I would always think about you and love you?" She replies, "If I do not love you, what does that matter?" They continue to hug.  .   "I
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really like this book. I've got a number of different books in my collection which I had no clue about. This book is in my top 5 books which I read over the years. The illustrations are very beautiful and well executed. There is a nice amount of information about the different types of dinosaurs. The science is not just a bit of guess work and it was easy to follow the information. The fact that you don't have to do a lot of work to understand the information is a plus and I really appreciate that. I don't understand why it hasn't been made into a series like Jurassic Park or the original Jurassic Park books. It's pretty hard to explain to a 7 year old who just came to dinosaur land what the dinosaurs are and it's hard to tell a 7 yr old to read. So it seems like a great way for kids to start out. The cover is attractive and I like the "Dinosaur Hunting" title. Highly recommended!

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm not a big fan of the "novelization" but for this book it works.

It is a very good book and I'm glad to see more novels like this out there. I enjoyed the story so much I bought the ebook.  It was a fun read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  this is the only book I have that helped me with my depression. I would recommend this book to anyone who is depressed or has a family member who is.  It is easy to read, and is not depressing.  "When I think of a person in the world, what I see is a person who has had their self esteem shattered because of a lack of information or experience.   These people have been given information that is useless, they have been shown the same movies over and over again, they listen to the same music, and they are asked to do the same things as everyone else.  They think and say things that are contradictory to their feelings, they look in the mirror and don't see a person, they feel themselves being judged as something that is not who they really are.  The reality of the situation is they are simply not good at doing things they were taught, so they have made the life choices they have in order to feel like someone else is good at those things, when they are not." When people go through something like depression they feel as though they're a failure as a human being because they feel like they are different from everyone else, and the feelings and emotions that come with them can make people feel alone, hopeless, and alone.  To find a book that can help people feel like a success as well as a failure is an amazing book.  In it, she talks about her mother, who had depression.  She talks about how it affected her childhood and how she had to learn to control her anger, which she had never done before.  After going through her mother's story, I felt as though I too would benefit from a book like this.  I feel like it would help me get through my own personal struggles.  This book is well researched, and it is a great read.  It is a book I could have taken to the gym and worked on my weaknesses, instead of reading an article or looking at pictures. I highly recommend this to anyone in need of a good read to help you through your depression.
Write a positive review about a good book:...........................................   This book was an enjoyable read, if not a little too long for my taste.  It is an excellent introduction to the life of an early Christian.  as far as the topic goes I liked the fact that he tried to cover as much as possible, which made this book more interesting for me.   I do not think that he did this to try and make it less difficult to read and for people to remember what was written. It's not as if he is trying to erase what Christians have said, or try and erase any religious beliefs. This is what he thought was right, it is what was going on in his time and culture, and I think that this would also apply to the times and cultures of most ancient civilizations. He didn't try and rewrite history or make things more appealing to his readers. I think this is very appropriate in his book.    The book does a good job of showing how early Christians interpreted and interpreted the Bible. I particularly liked how he shows that most early Christians did not agree with certain parts of the Bible, and that when they did it was based on their understanding of the original text.   and how he describes how his own interpretation of the bible changed as he studied it. He does a great job of describing the development of his understanding of Christianity and how it developed over the years. He clearly shows that his understanding grew along with his experiences.   the author is very respectful of Christianity. He knows that there are different interpretations of the early church and that people interpret the Bible differently. However he doesn't try to rewrite the history of the faith or distort its history. The author uses historical evidence to support his arguments, however he also points out when these early Christians were lying, or making things up. The book also talks about how the early Christians changed their views of early Christians because of the teachings of Christians like Augustine and Augustine's views on Jesus, as well as other important teachings in the bible.   The most interesting parts of this book for me were the discussion of what the Bible really says about Jesus. The early Christians said that Jesus was God's Messiah and that He died on the cross to atone for sin. He then went to heaven and is now the second coming of Christ. However many early Christians in the second century didn't think that Jesus died on a cross and didn't believe that He went to the place of heaven. This also meant that the early Christian writers made up
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- I liked this book a lot. I'm a history and sociology major and the writing was really easy to follow. It's an overview of the various aspects of the American Civil War and the causes and effects. It really left a lot of historical context behind. -------------------------- What I didn't like: ------------- It starts off by having the black soldiers come into the Union lines, fighting against the white Union army, but it doesn't go on to the final battle in 1865. There's too much of the "the war wasn't about slavery" argument and I just don't see the historical context of the war in the United States for a "black soldier" to be fighting for the Union. ------------- Conclusion: ------------------------------ I enjoyed reading this book. It was good and not too technical at all. It also left a good historical context for the United Sates at the time. It does have some errors in some places though.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- The thing is: I'm not a real fan of 'faux' or 'fake' fiction. There's nothing that 'feels''real'. I don't know whether this is because I'm more sensitive or that there's just so much out there and it's hard to keep up with. I don.t like the idea of fake or fakes because they are not real. And this book is a fake and a fake is just not as exciting to me as genuine. I'm willing to overlook the fact that the 'characters' and the events don't seem that'real' because the story is good and the characterizations are believable. If there was no other reason why I'd read this, then the characters and the world would have made it, but then again, that's just me. Also, the author has done this before (not by name) and I'd like to see more'realism' in his fiction. I've read enough fakes to know that it ain't real. So, if you like your stories to be realistic, check this one out. If you're the kind who wants to see what you're reading is'real', skip this book and read a real book instead.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ My husband had this book with me for months and read it aloud to us and to a friend he was having therapy with. He said it was the most healing and life enhancing thing he has ever heard. He was having a rough time. He couldn't get out of his head that he shouldn't do this or that. He went in for his first session of therapy and I was so pleased with my husband for coming to me for help and to learn he had this need. He learned the techniques and was able to find ways to do it and enjoy life. I know it seems weird to have a book for my husband about how to be good with himself, but it is exactly the kind of book that has helped me be a better wife, mother, friend, etc. It's also a good read if you have to write something but don't know how to express it. The techniques and strategies for finding joy and self-worth were easy to follow and the examples he gave were life changing. I highly recommend this book and will be giving it to everyone I can." -- JoAnn

I'm sure I'd have preferred a more interesting ending.   to top it all off the author tries to make the characters likable by having them go to parties and such, but even though the author tried to make them likable the book is still about a selfish jerk that I didn and will continue to not care about.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________________________________ The first page of the book tells you that this book is written for adult readers. However, the descriptions are very explicit, and there is no way that a kid could read this book. The story begins with a woman who works with autistic children. Her name is Carol and she helps a young boy named Daniel who has a crush on the popular girl. Carol's daughter is a psychiatrist, but she doesn't tell Carol that Daniel's father is autistic, so Carol is surprised to hear that she's helping the son. Carol is excited about helping Daniel. It's only when Daniel comes home with a very intense fear of school, that she realizes that Daniel might be autistic. The next chapter is Daniel's story, which is very detailed and descriptive. It starts out with a great description of how Daniel is "like the child in the book, but with one big difference," and that difference is that Daniel "doesn't like any of the people around him." This section of the story is great because the author really knows Daniel. She doesn't give him any "mild" descriptions of his problems. Instead, she writes about Daniel's fears and frustrations, and her own problems. This makes Daniel a more realistic character. The description of the parents is very interesting. The parents tell Daniel's mother that Daniel can "see" things that the rest of us can't. But the parents also tell Daniel, "You're never going to get out of this one." The parents are very sad when they see Daniel crying, because they realize that Daniel needs help. Daniel's mom says she doesn' want to talk about it with her daughter. Daniel is told not to tell the boy in school that he is autistic. He goes to the bus stop and finds a boy who he likes and talks to, and it's not Daniel who is autistic! A young girl with autism also comes to the school with Daniel. The young girl's name is Amy, and she's autistic. Amy is really smart and enjoys school. However Amy has autism, and although she doesn\'t know what Daniel is afraid of, Amy can see things that Daniel doesn't. The final chapter is a description of Daniel and Amy's relationship. This chapter is also great because it describes Amy very well. The author is not afraid to describe Amy because Daniel is also autistic. I think Daniel might have the same difficulty as Amy. The last chapter describes Daniel\'s future. It tells Daniel that he\'ll have to
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________________________ I had high hopes for this novel - it's very well-written, with very rich characters. However, my expectations were met with some disappointment. In my opinion, the book's main focus is on the love story, but it never made it to the point where it felt like I could emotionally connect to the characters, other than the protagonist.I have heard some reviews that described it as a love triangle. I am very much a fan of love triangles, and this one is very much of that genre. The main character's girlfriend is an excellent heroine, but as is the case in all love triangles - there's an element of jealousy between the two main characters. The two characters are also not completely in love with each other - there are definite sexual desires between the pair - but in spite of that, they are still a very compatible pair. They are in a loving relationship, but their sexual attraction is not that deep, and it's mostly based on lust and pleasure, not passion.The first half of the book is very interesting. It covers a fairly lengthy timeline of events, and the events that take place are very well described - I would not have known where to start had I not already read the previous novels in the series. I liked the descriptions of the characters - I particularly liked the characters' faces. I didn't think the characterization was very well developed. In fact, I think that the main character is still very un-developed. He is very charming, he is intelligent, he has a very kind and caring side, and he has an interesting past, and I liked reading about the details of his life. I don't know if the author will continue the story, or if he will follow it through the beginning of the next novel. Either way, I was very much looking forward to reading the second half of this series. It was definitely a good read, but I think it would be better if the next book would cover some of the events of the first book.Rating: _______________

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________I got the "Culture of Fear: How the CIA Tried to Control America." I had heard about it from the media and read about it in books. So, I decided to read it because it was on a list of recommended reads I was going to take along on a trip. It was definitely worth my time. It's a good read with a strong narrative line that pulls the reader in and you can see the steps to understand how they did it. I wish I had known about this book sooner. Thanks,
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I loved this book. It is written from the point of view of two male authors, who are writing about their lives. Both have gone through the same life. The female author's mother passed when she was 12, and her father passed when he was 23. The male author's brother died when he had been only 16. He was a good man and a true friend to all. When they started writing this book, the main character had already died a few times. He writes about the things he is going through. He describes the death of his sister, his father, his friend, his brother, his mother, his sister-in-law, his neighbor, and his father-in law. When he is at home, it is not easy to be happy. But when he is away on a mission, the peace and happiness return to him, and he is a true prophet of God. I liked this book as it was not like a lot of what I read in the past, which was just a synopsis of the events and how it affected the person in a good or bad way. This book is a more intimate story with the characters. It gives more time for the characters to show their lives and thoughts, and it gives more insight into the characters that make up their life. This is a good choice for those who want to know more about these characters, especially the male characters. This one is for the whole family to enjoy.

Write a positive review about a good book: *********** Read my review: *********************I didn't know much about this subject when I read this book. I was totally shocked at the beauty of it. Not only is it very practical and well written (even though it is rather technical) it's also very beautiful and artistic. I wish every child, teacher, parent, and adult had a book like this in their libraries. I am so happy that it was published. I also hope that they do more books on this subject. I think it would be very beneficial to children to be taught the basics of this topic. I found my parents very knowledgeable about these topics but the book gave me a different perspective and made it clear that it is not the norm for all children. I recommend it to anyone who wants to know about how a child develops. If they do not get these basics early enough it can really be detrimental to them. I hope that you will also find the book to be beneficial and very practical.

Write a positive review about a good book:!!! (review of free book)  Helpful? Yes No (0)  the book is not very interesting  Was this helpful?  Yes (0 of 0) No (1) Report this review  Not as detailed as I was expecting  The book is a great example of how an ordinary man can make himself into a hero, especially one with the knack of knowing what to do when. It was a great introduction to the idea of having a team of specialists.   But the book has some weaknesses. The writer does not focus on one person at a time but on all the people who help a hero to succeed. It is only through teamwork that they achieve this. The author does not explain why he put the team together as a team, which makes it difficult to understand if he has any ideas about the nature of teamwork. And what if the team fails? It does not matter if the guy is the only one on the team who has no ideas about teamwork. He should just be kicked out!   Overall, a great book that is well worth reading.  .  What the reviewer said.  a great team player...  ...but does not show what it takes for a team to succeed...  at all. .  I am not a hero... ...nor do I believe that one can be. But I still believe that the best team players are the ones who are willing to try. I think that's what makes the difference.  , the only real problem I had with this book is that it does not cover how you get from a group of people to a team. The authors does not give any suggestions on how to make the team work, and I believe the point of the book would have been made if it did.     , the final sections were just a little too boring to me. There are so many things that I would want to know. How are the players chosen? Are there competitions? What sort of tactics are used? What is the team leader doing when his team loses? When are the games and how long do they last?   I wish the book had more of a focus on the player and less on the coach and players.  of my best friends are team players  (Review of free books) , by the way, is a fantastic book that gives an awesome insight into the minds of great players.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "We've met a man called Thomas who was once a farmer and now an artist. He was a very poor man, but his painting, which is on the walls of his former home, was an expression of his poverty.   He is a man of great faith, and although he seems to be a very odd and sometimes disturbing person, he really has a remarkable gift.   for one thing he has a talent for seeing what is right before him. He can see exactly what people are thinking about, he can see what is important, and he is able to read people's hearts and minds without ever being offended by anything. It has a very hypnotic effect on people.     The story is interesting and very moving. I found myself thinking about the people in Thomas' world and feeling what their feelings would be. The characters are so human.   the story moves from Thomas' past to his present and the lives he has led. I liked the way the story was set up. I think Thomas could have written a much better book than he did.  -Sonia I found this book so fascinating that I read it several times over. This was definitely one of the top five books I have read in a very long time. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good mystery. It is a story about a man whose art has brought him so much happiness, but at the same time brought him his greatest fears. I had a great time reading it and I would definitely recommend it.It's not just the story about Thomas, though.The writing is incredible, and the artwork in it is just amazing. I especially like the fact that it took this long to come out. It's a very sad book, but it's a sad story and a very good story in the end.If you're looking for a story with a bit of mystery, a very creepy ending, and a lot of sadness, you can find it in this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Black Swan by Nassim Nicholas Taleb I have read many books and have seen many movies and still have not read Taleb's book. This book is a perfect combination of Taleb knowledge and entertainment. Taleb explains the history of financial markets and how they worked in the past and how some of the most successful investors have been using mathematical models to analyze their strategies. The book is divided in chapters, the first one being on the history and theory of financial market and the second one covering Taleb famous theory of Antifragility. The first book explains how financial markets worked before the invention of computer and financial traders, and why they did not work very well in the first place. The second one uses a mathematical model of the stock market and how the models work to make predictions. There is some very nice mathematics in the book. The chapters that are related to antifragile investing are very useful and interesting and give a clear explanation of what it means. The end of the book shows some interesting strategies and shows how the model works, as it is called. You will definitely want to read the second book, which is called Antifundibull.  I am very impressed by this book, and think that it is well worth the money to get it, especially when you consider that you can read it online.  You can also download a pdf version of the first book from the author's website and you can also get a free sample of the second edition, which will be out in a few weeks.  - M.A.T.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________   My son enjoyed this book. The illustrations are excellent and help illustrate some of the topics presented. The stories in the book are all fairly accurate to reality.   The book starts off with the story of the Great Flood. The story starts out with Noah (the author) sitting next to a group of people. Noah says something about the great flood, and they respond by saying, "so what, that was the end of all mankind, right?". Then the story goes on to show what Noah went through in trying to save his family, and how he and his wife, Shem, survived. This story gives some perspective on how long humans have been around, as well as the world we live in today.   "We were not meant to survive the flood". That's the main message of the book.   the flood starts out by showing Noah's home, but then it goes on into the surrounding area, showing the animals, birds, plants, and people. It also shows how Noah's wife, ( Shem ) survives because she and Noah stayed in the ark with the rest of their family. This is pretty important in the story because Shem is the only child in the entire story that is not killed during the flood.  -I liked Noah's story a lot. It was so good. Noah was an outstanding character. I really enjoyed his plight during the time he is on the arks. He had to stay safe during the storm that came to destroy his world. I enjoyed reading the story and the illustrations.   that's about it __________________________________________   Other Interesting Points: ____________________________  The story is set in the year 2012. The world is slowly being reclaimed by the earth, which is becoming more ark-like. Noah and his family went to heaven when the flood subsided, because they believed the earth was on a constant state of change, and that the earth needed to be purged of all the 'defiling animals' that had corrupted the earth's ecology. Noah knew what he was doing by using a flood for his cleansing, which he says is just God's way of telling him to keep on doing his job. God also said that Noah had to leave behind all the animals on earth, but Noah is able to do it, since he knows how to live on his own, but he has some'stinkers' with him that he has to get rid of, before his family
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read many times how useful it is for parents with children who are on the autism spectrum to be able to get their kids a picture book in which all the emotions are represented. So, I thought I'd give it a go. But, what I found was so so different from any other picture book I have ever read! I think it might be because it's so unusual - but this is a perfect book to use with your child who has Autism. I thought it was so nice to read about different emotions. My daughter was amazed that I knew all the words, and I think that makes her feel more at ease with her autism - she doesn't have to struggle through a whole lot to get her feelings out. The author has done a really good job of providing the vocabulary to describe feelings. My 2 daughters have struggled with this book - the first time it took them about 30 minutes of going through each picture - but after a couple of times they felt much more comfortable reading it. I do think this book is very easy to follow - if you use the pictures to describe your child's emotions in an interactive manner that is fun, then it will be a lot easier to get the ideas out. I would love to see this book in the childrens section in the local libraries - there are a lot of books that don't really tell you anything about Autism. Read the full review at www.amazon.com

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is my second read-through of the novel. I didn't know much about the story and I was quite worried as to what to expect in terms of plot.  As someone who enjoys a good plot, it was quite refreshing to read a story that wasn't about some 'disharmonious pair of siblings' going off to study in order to gain a 'favorable impression' with a high school teacher, but was about a girl's struggle to move on from the past and to figure out who she truly is.  While the book doesn't progress the plot to the point of its conclusion, it does bring some of the characters together and makes it more clear than ever before that they are a force to be reckoned with.  The book is very fast-paced, and it is quite clear that the author put her heart into the story.  While the characters may not be all that original, it's clear that all of the stories come from a similar place.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys reading fast-moving books.
Write a positive review about a good book:!!!  "The Way of the Seer" is a great book! I like how it is written and how you can get more from it. I'm a newbie at karate and I've already tried the kata that he recommends for beginners, the karate of power and the power of the kumite. He goes into depth on how to do them better (for me at least) and gives you an amazing description of what makes them good kata. He also talks about how he got started in karate, the first time he got into it and why he thinks karate is the most effective form of martial arts that has ever been used.  The only thing that I would change is that you need a teacher to teach you the techniques and how to be effective with them. I would say that if you are really serious about karate that you should get an instructor because he is so knowledgeable about it. .  the only downside I can think of is that sometimes the katas are a little long in length. Also there is not a lot of detail in the text. It is just about what the kikujutsu is supposed to be about, but it seems that the kataris and the techniques don't talk about how to put it all together..  Overall, great book. ,  ,

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________  "The Book of Unwritten Tales of the American West: A Story of Murder, Betrayal, and Redemption"  by Frank Norris (New York: W.W. Norton & Co., 2014)  There is no more thrilling book I've read this year than Frank Norris's "The Book" (June 3rd, 2014). It's a must-read, not just for those who want to see the wild West (of which there is plenty in the book) but for anyone who wants to know about our past. Norris takes us through a very compelling story of two men who have very different ideas of what the West is all about. They are both lawmen and outlaws, but they will never be the same.  We meet John Reid on his first job out west with his first partner, John Sledge. They're investigating a murder case in the remote canyon town of Silver Creek in the Sierra Nevada, but their search becomes entangled in the story of the man accused of the murder, Daniel Reid. As they chase the trail of Daniel's money, they find themselves drawn into a web of intrigue that goes far beyond the narrow confines of the Colorado Rockies.  (from Amazon.com review by Mark Kincaid)  a great book that i enjoyed. "The book was excellent, well written, and just as you would expect from a true story about a wild west outlaw."  (from Amazon review by James T. Wensley)  I've always enjoyed Frank Norris. His books are always fascinating and well-written. In addition to writing the "Book of Unspoken Tales" series, he also wrote the "Blood on the Sand", and the "The Devil in the Mountains", in which the characters are of various races and ethnicities. All his books, especially "The Son of Sam", "Silver Star", and "The New Black", are highly recommended.   I think I have a good enough understanding of the Western tradition to appreciate these stories and Norris does a good job of showing what life was like back then. My only criticism is that the book seemed to drag on a bit in places. The ending wasn't all that exciting. The writing was very good, however. There wasn't much of a plot, so it wasn't a major problem, and the events were interesting and I enjoyed the action. I just think that the length of the story could have been reduced.

The prose is fast-paced and the story is vivid, with characters that really made you care about the characters. This book is very well written. I have never read another book that made me want to pick up a gun. The first half is about a young girl's fight for survival against a mysterious illness. The second half is a series of events that lead to a confrontation between two groups that have come to this place in search of the woman. I loved the ending which gave the characters a reason to come together. It made me realize that my own struggle and struggles with self-esteem are real and worth fighting for.This is one of the most amazing books I have read. Thank you for the inspiration to pick yourself up, dust yourself off and get back in touch with the world around you.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book! This book covers many of the basic facts about how to avoid getting pregnant and provides good information on how to manage pregnancy, both with and without an IUD.  My main concern with getting pregnant while using a hormonal IUD is that it can decrease the amount of estrogen you have in your body.  So I definitely took a little longer than expected to get pregnant after I switched from a birth control patch and/or condom to a hormonal patch. But after two weeks on my hormonal patch and birth control, I am ready to start trying for my first child!  The information in this book was well organized and very helpful.  I really like that the authors talk about the "why" of pregnancy while also discussing the "how".  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good, up to date, practical explanation of how to not get pregnant if you are on hormonal birth control.
Write a positive review about a good book: ******** My son was excited about the book when he picked it up in the store. It's a great book about being transgender. I think he enjoyed the story about his father. I liked how the author did a great job of explaining his father's story. I felt like I had a better understanding of his father as well as the family members I had read about in the book. I'd highly recommend this book for transgender and their parents. It gives a good story and you get to learn about all the different things that people have to deal with when they transition. (From being a child to being an adult) I think people would find this book to be a great help for transgender people to understand and feel more comfortable in themselves. I hope this book is brought out in print and also available online. :)
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------ When I was in college I read all of the books in my library that were either the best books I had read, or the ones that I wanted to read. The first one that I read was about a man called Jesus and his life of teaching. It made me realize that I believed in Jesus as my savior because he was the only one who made me feel better about the world around me. I never knew what it was like to not be good enough, and to be wrong. I don't think I could have survived that much because even though he was a good teacher and helped people through hardships, he could not heal me of my self loathing and self judgment. That's what I think the Bible and God had in mind when they wanted me to believe in their son. He wasn't perfect, but I know it took a lot of work to make him, so it was a miracle that he was so forgiving. I wanted him to be my savior, but unfortunately I grew up without anyone to ask for his help when I wasn't doing well. I think this book taught me how to forgive, and how to get over my self destructive patterns and negative thinking. This book was just that, a good lesson in learning to forgive and how it affects everyone else around you. My friends and I were all very moved by the message and the message I received from reading this book. I was so sad about it, but also hopeful. I know if I continue on this path of self destructive thinking that I will never find the happiness and peace that Jesus was trying to help me find. So thank you for a great book that helped me learn.  Read 4 times. Last read June 2, 2017.   5 of 5 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:    Insight is a book written by John Perry Barlow about life on the planet earth. It is a good read with excellent advice. I liked it so much that I read another Barlow book.   The only problem with this book is that the author doesn't know how to start an interesting story, so he makes it a story about the life of a man and a woman who meet on a ship and don't get married because they don't want kids. And then they have to take care of the family. Which is pretty boring.   a story with a happy ending.  The man in the book, Barlow, is a really smart man. So much so that he doesn't even want to be a millionaire when he turns 70. He wants to go back to school to become a priest and help people. And I'm not sure what he wants in return. So he decides to be self-employed. And that's how he ends up in a business in which he is a middle manager. His work is to try and sell some stuff which is really hard to get. So his business is a failure, but he has enough money to travel and do what he needs to do to be happy.   the people on the ship are a bunch of rich men and women. I think they are mostly from the UK and Europe. I thought Barlow and his shipmates would have been very good friends. It's hard for me to think of another novel that doesn't have that effect. However the main character is a lot like him, except that he is the one who is the middle manager of the ship. He's very good at his job, but not that good at the rest of life. He is the only one who understands Barlow's dreams, because Barlow doesn't understand them either. So I didn't think the characters were really interesting.   "This is the first time we've gotten an insight into this man's life. His problems are very much the same as ours. When it's over, though, we'll be quite different."   And that's the only thing that will be different in this life. This life will be a lot worse than the one before. The ship will have been sold. Barlow will be an old man. And he will not get any closer to his life-dream, which will be, well, whatever he's been dreaming about since he was 13.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- I have this book on my Kindle and loved it. I loved how it was written and how the plot was good. I enjoyed reading the other reviews as well. The plot is pretty good, but I'm not sure that they will ever put out a book like this. I think that this is the one that the fans will really love to read. It's so well written and so well done! I love it! :) The artwork is really nice and the plot is really cool. I would love to see them turn their attention to this kind of novel one day. This is the book that I would recommend to all fans of fantasy and of mystery. I know that some may feel that it's just a fantasy and I agree, but there are a lot of things that are very realistic that happened. There is an amazing and different style to the book. The way that the characters are written is great, the way that they are described is wonderful. The character names and descriptions are amazing. Even the way the characters talk is amazing. I had a good laugh with this book and was so happy that it was the best book that they had out. I hope that they make more of these types of novels because it's one of my favorite genres!
Write a positive review about a good book: ********** I've had this book and will be sticking with it now that the first book has been released in a paperback. It is a story of love and family and of a family trying to find its way, but I really don't care that it's in a graphic novel format. I'm still a fan of the books, even though I can't believe how far the comic version of the characters have gotten. It's been a long time since I read a comic book, but it's still the one of my favorites. If the book is going to be any good at all, it should be just a little bit better than the graphic novel. I can see why they'd think of doing a book like this as a graphic novels are becoming the primary format for books now. ***********

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________ I'm so glad I read The Art of War when I was in college. I still remember the day I got the book, it felt like I just had the best book ever! I've reread it on more than one occasion since I was a teenager. It's a beautiful and complex book. I love the way his descriptions of battles and the tactics used in them. He covers all kinds of topics and makes it very clear how and why each strategy is chosen. There are always new tactics for us to learn from the past and there are always ways to use our tactics today. It is also very insightful and has a huge scope of history. If you have a spare hour and want to learn a little history on your own, you really have to read this book. If it were just an easy read you wouldn't enjoy it. It covers so much ground, it's very hard to pick and choose a few details. It definitely has a lot of chapters but it is well worth the time and effort to read it. I will read it again.
Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________   There are three authors on this list, but I think the three should have been a team and I am sorry to be the one who has to split the love of the story.   First of all, there are some great characters, but one of the main characters is a complete wanker.  I feel I can never read anything by the guy without going into an emotional roller coaster ride.  the first time he shows up in the story he has no personality, just is an angry jerk. Then the book goes downhill from there. It seems that he has the ability to make people angry or sad, but no one likes him. He is always the first to yell at anyone, and the second to apologize.   He also has a tendency to get angry over silly things. When he is around a woman for too long he gets angry at her. If he's around a man for too much he gets mad. There's an old joke he says that is on the list - " If the sun were made of lead and everyone you love died, would you still love them?" and everyone laughs. He gets angry when he has to deal with these people.     One other thing he does is get his ass in trouble.   the first book he gets into a fight with a bunch of kids and is kicked out of the school. Now, I know, he is just acting crazy, but then he comes to school the next day and tries to be a good person. He even apologizes to the kids for fighting them. The next day he comes back and starts throwing his toys on the floor in an attempt to prove that he really is the hero. He starts to get in trouble and in the end the school finds out and they try to kill him.   of course it is not like he didn't try to do the right thing, because he always tried to do that. but in the first chapter he doesn't do it and instead he gets in trouble for it, so then they make him out to be worse then the people he is trying to save.   "No, I don't want to die. I just want to have fun!" the man shouted to himself. It was only later that I realized how insane the whole thing was, and how he acted out. I mean, who would even think of kicking someone out of school? How dare they!   The other three books are all about the main character

Write a positive review about a good book:...............................The Nightingale's Daughter - John Steinbeck.............................................. I loved this book, but don't own it now. I've since discovered a good copy at the library............................................................My Favorite Book, and a Great Author..................................................I loved this novel, it's one of my favorites that I've read in a long time. It was one of those books that makes me feel I'm reading something so timeless. Steinbeck's style is so simple and direct. He shows you his emotions with beautiful prose, and the characters are just so human. The book is narrated by the same narrator who also wrote A Rose For Ecclesiastes and For Whom The Bell Tolls. The narration really helped me understand Steinbeck as he went through the trials and tribulations of growing up. You learn so much from this story, and it's very sad and moving. Steinbecke is so well written that you can't help but read the novel again and again............................I Don't Really Like Myself Anymore...................................I've read this twice now, and I still love it, but I never did like myself as a person. I don't think that Steinbeck is wrong for making such a hard life for him and others who have to face such adversity, I think that he is just writing a great book...........................................................................An Amazing Journey..................................................................................This book is so beautiful, but so sad. Steinback's story is very sad, and he goes through so much turmoil that I just don't know what to say. I was just so impressed with his bravery to write about it and his love for the characters he portrays. I also loved how the narrator describes Steinbeck and his family. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves great literature and has an appreciation for life. .........................................................................An Amazing book!......................................................................John Steinbeck will always be one of the greatest writers to ever live, and The Nightingales Daughter is an amazing, amazing, and incredible read.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________" I was introduced to the works of H. P. Lovecraft by my father. When I was a teenager, I was obsessed with his works and the Lovecraftian Mythos. He is one of the few horror writers that has been part of my life. He's an amazing writer and has inspired me for the rest of my writing career. I will be looking forward to reading this book! "  Review by: K. F. Stokes on December 29, 2015 :  A very good Lovecraftian story, though perhaps somewhat more "classic" than some of the others.   This one is for the more traditional fan who may find the other books on this list a little too long, or a little more "traditional", and for a younger reader who may appreciate a little variety.  , from the   It's a great book. The main character, Ben, seems to be a nice young man, at least to me. Ben is in a wheelchair, and his parents are struggling to raise him. In the beginning of the story, he tells the story of a dog that was brought to him as a baby, then a cat that he adopted, and then a bear that he raised by himself. These creatures are still with Ben, and they are very important in the story.   the main story is about Ben's father's life with cancer. This is really well told, with lots of twists and turns. It's a good story with a great end. I think that it's fair to say that the Lovecraft world is really not one that I'm familiar with. I have seen it in the movies, but not in the books. The things that Ben learns about his dad's life is really cool. It gave the story a nice, dark edge.   The ending was really cool, too. I found myself really wondering how Ben's dad was going to die, and whether he was going too soon. There are a few other small, yet interesting, details that help make the ending very satisfying. I was very surprised when I started reading this story, and it just kept on getting better and better.   "I was introduced [to Lovecraft] by my mother, who was obsessed by his works. She was particularly intrigued with the Cthulhu mythos, and had recently completed a Lovecraftian series for children. When she was a teen, she found herself obsessed with the stories.

The good bits are mostly good but the author doesn't always have the time to tell his stories clearly and makes some rather confusing statements in the introduction and end of the book. But if you can't wait for the conclusion, then you'll love this book. ---------------

My dog was recovering from a stomach flu and I wanted to have her eat something, so I ordered this. After I put it in her bowl, she seemed fine, but I have to say, she seems like she was just playing around. But I will still eat a lot of this stuff because I think it helps keep me slim and I have read some reviews that it has other benefits. Posted by jeanne at 2:10 PM No comments: I have to mention that I had to order it online. When I got my package from China, it was the exact same box as my previous order. When it arrived, I opened it up and it was wrapped up the same way and even had the same label on it. When the first time I opened the package, I thought it was a joke and it took me a while to believe it was real. It was just like any other package but it had different contents, so it was confusing until I figured it out. It said to take a picture and I thought, how difficult can it be to get a picture with the picture being black on the inside? Well, I got a photo, but you can't really see anything on the box since it is black on all sides. Anyway, it looks like a really neat product so I will try it and see what I think. But for now, I think I will stick with my regular food. Updated:    If you are reading this blog and you are trying to lose weight, you might want to read my review of this product here.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ (This is the author's first book!)I loved this book! I would say it is a quick read for those of you who like easy reads! I think it's very well written and you can relate to all the main characters. There are lots of interesting details of the world around you, and all the different species there are. It's a very good read that you'll love.I do have some complaints with this book though. The characters all feel a bit off at first, and they have some really big and important secrets. It was a little frustrating at first. The best thing about the book is the little hints that keep getting slipped in. They're not too important, but I still enjoy the little references. You can just pick up on them. I also felt that the narrator was a bit wooden at times. You'll think you know her voice, but then you'll find out that you don't.I also had a few problems with my Kindle Fire while reading this book. I have to keep changing the book on my Fire from the English to the Spanish translation and then back. I was also trying to look up different characters to see what they had been up to all these years. You could also tell that the author is not too familiar with Spanish and so was not really able to translate some things well. You will also hear a couple Spanish words in the book, but it didn't bother me too much.Overall, I really enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it to others!

Write a positive review about a good book:  "It is hard to imagine that it took the development of a nuclear warhead to create a bomb, let alone to produce one that could be used against the U.S. The United States, however, did develop nuclear weapons during the war, and it is these weapons that have been used against us during the Cold War. I think that anyone who has read this book knows that the U-235 bomb that killed millions in Hiroshima and Nagasaki is the only one that can be described as a 'bomb' for purposes of this book, so it's difficult to imagine how these bombs were made."

Write a positive review about a good book: __________  This is one of my favorite books. I don't understand why it's not more well known.  My son and I both enjoyed it.  the only downside is that it was too long at about 250 pages. We had fun, and it's well worth the time and money  Review of DJW Books: This is one to check out. It was written by a very good author who knows how to write a story that is realistic, and yet is also interesting. It is well written, it has a lot of good characters, and there are some pretty good scenes and action. It also does well to tie in some of the many religious and moral themes in the Bible. I think that it will make for a good family book. You can learn a lot about the history of the book, and you can see what was going on in the world around the time of the Bible in various areas such as Babylon and Egypt, Jerusalem, and the Roman Empire. I'm very happy I picked up this book. I'd highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________Review Date: 03-20-2012_________________________So glad to read this. I think I read this book back in high school when it first came out. The story was told in the format of a novel, which I thought was cool. I got my copy in paperback (the same one that was on the cover), and it's a gorgeous book. It has a very unique cover, and it looks to be a real book with the leather binding and gold trimming. I am currently reading it, and I'm really enjoying it. I haven't been able to finish it yet, but I'm going to try.

This book is a good starting point for people interested in how to find a job in the non-profit world. I have been searching for about a year and I found the information I needed in this book. __________________________________________________________ My advice for students would be to read this book when you are on a job search. Most job searches don't include a detailed description of your job duties, and it takes a lot of time to find your place in an organization. You don't want your resume to look exactly like someone else's! I recommend the book to people interested by job searching.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was pretty interested to read this book because I've heard that it talks about a lot of different techniques for learning English - I wanted to see if that was really true.   It's very similar to the book Learning Spanish by David Foster Wallace - it talks a lot about vocabulary and phonetics - but it does so through the eyes of a learner.  .   the first few chapters are full of great tips for how to make your language life easier. I like the way that it gives more detail than you might expect.   and the second few chapters that give examples (you're given a vocabulary word to memorize, or to try to learn) are great. I love that it also helps you practice what you just learned with lots of examples.   for someone that is really interested in the subject, this book will take you much further than you think you will go. I would highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book:     I found the book very well written, but I have a complaint.   I had read and studied about the history of the Civil War (but not the war itself).   While looking for the actual documents that might support my theory that the South had lost the war by 1862-1863 and not by 1865, I found only one source.  I read that the US House of Representatives, in a vote of March 4, 1863, passed a resolution which stated that the Confederacy had been victorious, and that its troops had been defeated.  The resolution was adopted by the House only after several Southern representatives threatened to do the same in the House of Representative.  Even though the resolution stated the Confederacy was victorious, it is impossible to prove that the Confederate army was defeated.   After reading this one document, I did not know whether to believe the South won or the North won the Civil war.  In any case, if the Confederates had actually won the war, and had captured Fort Sumter, the North might have been less concerned with freeing the slaves, and would have gone out of their way to get rid of the pro-slavery Republicans in Congress.  Also, if slavery had never been abolished, the South might have continued as a slave state.  This is all conjecture, but it is an interesting thought experiment that I have wanted to consider and discuss for a long time.  It is true that the war did not last as long as most people believe it did.  After the Battle of Antietam on August 26, 1863 (where the Union army was routed), Union General Ulysses S. Grant, who was in command of the Army of the Potomac, began to march for Vicksburg, Mississippi.  Vicksberg was the main city of the Confederate state of Mississippi. Vicksboro, the capital, was the second largest city in the Union state. After marching into Mississippi, Grant went to see the Confederate commander, General Robert E. Lee, in Vicksborough.  Lee asked Grant if he wanted to surrender, which is why Lee sent his troops to Vicksville.  If the Confederated Army of Northern Virginia had been successful in its last two battles, the Union would have been defeated at all of those places.  But after Vicksburgh was captured on August 22, 1863 it was clear the Union Army would have to stop fighting, and the war would be over by Christmas

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ The book is well written, easy to read and with very few errors. The book is the story of a boy from the village of Shandur, Pakistan, who is about 16 years old and is a member of a small Muslim family. The boy has a little brother. The story was very interesting and I have had a few similar stories about our home country, Pakistan. The story is also interesting and has some strong character development. One of the characters had a hard time and his mother was there to help him. The author wrote very well, although he is a Pakistani. The son of a Pakistani mother has a different viewpoint that was very well written and the story made the reader feel very connected to the character. There were some good points that made the story easy to follow. The way the book ended, was very good and there was a nice ending to it. There was also a little ending in the book about the love between the main character and his uncle and some other characters, which was very very well done. The final part of the book was very important to me and I could see that the author was trying to show me a future of my own children to me. The ending of the story was not as long as I expected it to be but I believe it is well done and I am glad I found out the whole story in this book. I will definitely purchase more books about my home country of Pakistan and will continue to read them. Good read for all children. This was my 2nd time reading it and was another one of the many Pakistani books I have read in the past few years. I'm glad I finally found a book on Pakistan that is easy to understand and relate to. The characters were interesting and they were all very different but were all the same in that they were very human. I loved the characters so much and I think the characters in Pakistan are well done too. The plot is pretty complex but it never gets overwhelming and has enough action for children as well as adults. The storyline is pretty well thought out. I can't say I liked it, but I certainly understand why some people do. It is a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have found that reading a book and having it not work is a very bad feeling. This one worked for me. It was the third book in a series I had been reading but not enjoying. This book was like having the whole series. I am going to try to finish the series as I want to finish them all! What I didn't like: The book takes place in a world similar to medieval times and there are a few characters similar to the characters from those periods. A main character called Lila does not act like a medieval woman and she acts like a normal person. I can see why a medieval story would appeal to a certain audience but I couldn't get into it. What else I liked: This is the last book in the series so I am waiting to see what happens next.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********************* The last book I have in my collection is Peter Benchley's "Eureka" The first few minutes of this book have me thinking it is a short story, and the rest of the book it really a story. I can tell from the first pages and the first few pages of the last chapter that the book is about a group of people, and their quest. I have a problem with stories in fiction. They are usually not very good. They make me wish that I were the character in the story instead of reading the book, and it is not really a problem when I read a story that is just so interesting. I do not like the way that people in fiction use words. There are too many words and sometimes I think that it is like the words are used to get to the point. The only thing that bothers me is the amount of action that is in a book. It is not needed at all. It gets boring very fast. I did not see the ending to this book till the last page, and then I started thinking that I will read more books by this author. "E-mail is a tool for the rich, but for everyone else a distraction." I do enjoy a good mystery, and I enjoyed this book quite a bit. I was glad to get out of the room that this book took place in, and be in the other rooms. I am still thinking about what happened that night.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I don't want to spoil anything for the end, but if you're in a good mood and you haven't read the story yet, I HIGHLY recommend reading this first, as the ending is VERY emotional and very moving.   "Mamma Mia" is about Mia, a beautiful, intelligent and independent girl who has lived in Italy since age 12. She is from a rich family with a very strict father who does not allow her to date her neighbor's son.   the son, Gianni, is actually her cousin (her mother is dead), so it is in all likelihood that Mia has an affair with Gianni when she is 13. She runs away at 16 and ends up living on the street, with Gianini being her only friend. She meets two other homeless girls, Maria and Erika, who come to live with her. They teach her about money and money and life, as they teach us, and it's such a fun book to read. It also gives a very honest, real picture of how money can be, and how people are, and what they are willing to do.   is a beautiful story about a young girl who doesn't have much and ends her life at the age of 19. It is told from the point of view of the four girls Mia meets along her road to "the city", as the author calls it. She moves in with Erika and Maria, and gets by on what little she has. She also finds work in a bar, where she meets Gianni and Maria. The bar is run by a rich man named Dio who owns the bar, and the girls help each other make ends meet by doing odd jobs, such as cleaning. However, Dio is having an affair and Mia is asked to help him get back at Maria. Mia, Erika (also had an affair) and Maria (also an affair of her own) are able to win the bar back, as well as keep Dio from being able to get his revenge.is a very emotional and compelling story of a young woman who has to learn to do the hard work of money, life and love.is one of my favorite books by an author I haven't reviewed yet. This is a heartbreaking, realistic, and moving story about the hardships that we all go through when faced with difficult circumstances.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________ I don't give these a 5, but for the right audience, they are worth a read.   If you like a good tale, this is a great one.  If the tale isn't enough for you, keep reading. If you want something that isn't a fairy tale, you'll probably enjoy it. I'll have to read the sequels.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- --------------- 5 out of 5 stars The first time I read this book, I had my doubts. I remember the first time my son told me this book was his favourite. I was a little skeptical of the concept, especially with the time lapse. I am glad I listened to him. If you are looking for something to read, this is for you. It is very well written. It has a lot of information that I think people who love to learn will love. A good book, and a great way to learn about time lapse photography.
Write a positive review about a good book:............................................................I absolutely loved this book! It was my first foray into reading paranormal and I thoroughly enjoyed it.I found it to be an interesting read, at times very slow and a good read in that way. I love it when a book takes a long time to get going but never gets boring. The story is good too! I enjoyed all the characters but one in particular: it took me a while to get to know the character but she was definitely interesting and I am looking forward to reading the rest of the book! I would recommend this book to anyone that loves a good paranormal story!Read full review
Write a positive review about a good book: *************************   I have been looking for the perfect recipe for a spicy, hot chile chicken. This is it. I used jalapeno and it was perfect.   First of all, this chicken is NOT spicy but rather, a little spicy. It really doesn't need to be. The chicken is well seasoned. It is cooked just enough. You need to cook the chicken in the water for a short period of time. As an additional note, the sauce was nice and thick and flavorful. It was the perfect complement to the chicken. I will be making this chicken again.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- It's a great novel that tells a compelling story that is really good. It's easy to get a good read from it. I enjoyed reading it. The characters are interesting and have some nice development. The writing is interesting and it had that good "feel" of realism. I'm glad I picked it up and enjoyed it. -------------------------- What I learned in this book:   I was surprised that some of the stuff was not obvious in my previous reading. The story does focus on a character who uses the "psychic powers" to read minds. He is being accused of murdering another guy but not quite sure what happened. He has no real motive or explanation to give but thinks that he might have been the one to murder. The narrator also mentions that there is another guy that has a psychic ability. He was able to talk to his dead wife and they seem to have a good relationship with each other.  The characters:   One of the problems in this story is that there isn't enough development with the character who is just trying to find out what has happened. It is hard to relate to and a little boring. In the end he ends up feeling betrayed but still wants to be involved. It would have been nice to see that develop more. The character who has psychic powers isn't a bad guy. He tries to help the people who are being abused but gets himself into a lot of trouble. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great! It's fun, fast paced, and a must-have for fans of The Fast and the Furious.  It was also recommended to me by someone I know who has watched a fair amount of movies with this movie franchise.  One last note, I just wanted to say that the characters are pretty awesome.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********************** I started reading this book while my girlfriend was getting ready for work and we both thought it was a really funny book, because of how different the characters are. She thought it looked funny too, she's normally a big comic book nerd and she was really enjoying it. It made me laugh a few times, I'm just really glad we've finally found a book that makes me laugh like this, and it wasn't just a girl laughing like a bunch of nerds. I think it is very funny. It just goes to show you how much you can make a book funny, by putting the main character and a bunch o' friends in their favorite movie and just making the whole thing ridiculous. And for those of you that think you're really funny, you'll be surprised that a lot of readers do think you are the funniest. I would highly recommend this book to those who want to read a funny book that is really silly and makes you laugh at just the right times.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I've really enjoyed it so far, I am looking forward to finding out what happens next."  -Trey L., Review from his mom.  Great book to get through the end of winter break. "It is a book about one man's struggle against a cancer that has spread all over his body. He's given up hope of ever being able to live a normal life again. He sees his life in terms of days and not hours. He can't work, and all he has left of his old life is his car. He makes every effort to take care of his family but his body doesn't seem to be able to. He struggles to keep from crying in the morning because he can't stop it. He fights with his mind and his anger and everything in between but it is clear that the cancer has become his life and his struggle. And yet, there are moments of peace and tranquility. He tells us that he's at peace when he is with his loved ones. That he doesn't want to die, but that he wishes he could just get out of this world."  I've seen this on my Kindle and it makes me laugh because the end is like a scene out of a horror movie. I'm glad that this is a story that is based on a true story! I can only hope that someday there will be a movie that accurately represents it! I think it would be a very good movie!  "It is the story of an alcoholic cancer patient who is living a lonely life until he gets caught up in the lives of the friends and family who love him, but cannot help him."        "I loved this book because it is so realistic, so true to life, and, most importantly, so funny."

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was a little disappointed that the book did not cover the various aspects of the case more fully but then I have a very hard time taking the Bible literally as it says in it. The Bible is the truth but it is not always good. So I really needed to know about other possible outcomes. It is good to have a good resource on the subject so I would recommend it to any serious study on the issue.  Review of 5 This was a great book, I was looking at the case and I have never heard a thing about this so this was very helpful. It shows the true reasoning behind what was going on, not what the church wanted the world to believe.  in a very interesting way  Brief Review This book is a good basic history. I was interested in the actual case and it explains it very well. If you are a believer in this case, you may not like it. But I really thought it was fair and explained it well.  (Posted on 3/29/2016)  A History of the Homosexual Practice: The Biblical View  by Bruce A. Van Orden This book gives the reader a very comprehensive, scholarly understanding of the history of homosexuality in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Dr. Van den has interviewed numerous experts on this topic and includes in this book excerpts from the writings of some of the greatest Biblical scholars.   From the introduction: This is a history of a specific religious, cultural, and political practice. It gives a detailed description of the historical background to the origins of this practice, the biblical views and attitudes toward it, and the different theories regarding its nature. The author focuses on the New Testament (Matthew 19:4; Mark 10:1-14; Luke 7:36-48; Romans 1:26-27), and then provides an analysis of the Old Testament in its entirety. Drs. Van Den and Oden are particularly good on the various theories regarding the relationship between homosexuality and monotheism, and how such theories evolved. The book is thorough and informative. Dr Van den is a professor at the University of Rochester and a professor of Hebrew Bible and Ancient Near Eastern Studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and he received his Ph.D. in Old Testament from Hebrew University. His primary areas of specialization include the New World (his dissertation) and the Hebrew Bible (his books), and he has served in both a Hebrew University faculty member and an Israel Ministry official
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ I loved this book and found it a very good read. I was in awe and admiration of the authors abilities to bring out the best in her characters. I have always found books that are dark and violent as boring to me. But there are things in this book I loved about it. The writing was a bit rough at times and there were some parts that were somewhat frustrating. I also found the character development was slow but definitely well done. There are many other books that focus on the negative aspects of gangs and violence that I have read before. And I found that I just didn't really understand some of the characters. The main character, for example, was described as being the most powerful person in a gang who had a very rough past, but it seemed she just wanted to get on with her life. I mean, how could she not when she is in control of one of the biggest gangs in the world? There were other characters that were also described as bad guys that seemed like they should have been more sympathetic but I was still glad to see them get a chance. I do think the author needs to work on her pacing a bit more and the characters a little bit better. I guess the only reason I would give it a 5 star rating is because of the character that I found the most endearing. I loved seeing how she got better.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ I was first introduced to this wonderful book by my mother who is a veteran teacher who now volunteers at the local Veterans Administration hospital in town. I have to say that she gave this book the highest praise possible, and for the first time ever gave me the chance to be able to read an original and highly recommended novel. The story was so simple, but it's written in such an interesting and engaging way, that it really makes you think about life in general and the things that really matter to us. I really loved the way this story was told. It made me want to know more about the characters, their lives, their loves, their sorrows, their triumphs, etc. I also enjoyed that there were a lot of quotes and short stories that made you realize that everything isn't as bad as we seem to think. The illustrations were very detailed and it brought back memories of what my mother was telling me about her time in the military, and how wonderful the VA Hospital was to work at. The end was so beautifully and beautifully made up that it was almost like a fairy tale. Thank you so much for such a wonderful book, and I hope that my fellow veterans will all find something to cherish about this book, something that will make them feel good about the life that they lived, and the life they've helped to create and pass on to future generations.  The first time I read this novel was in first grade (in 3rd grade), the author was my 3rd book in the series. We read and enjoyed this book until she had to move to Oregon, but I still remember that book. I read it again, and then again. The novel was amazing, it had a lovely plot and a wonderful ending. It also was very well written. We have enjoyed it again and again, I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story.  the first book that I read in the original series.

Reviews From The Book:  the book is excellent! I've had it for about 2 weeks and it's already been read!  A lot of the descriptions about the characters were also extremely interesting. I liked how you didn't just say "she was short and had pink hair and a nose ring" the description said "she is short, has pink hair, a very cute nose ring." or "she has a small, pretty nose ring". It was a good detail! :). Thank you!  of the book  As a teacher and writer of many books, I had a lot of books in mind when I started this book, but I didn�t want to read books that were so dry that I could tell that the author wrote them for the sake of writing them. This did not happen, and the characters are all different and unique, so I can recommend this book to any teacher. There are a lot interesting details in this book that I didnít know about, such as that the characters who were short and pink all have noses.

It's really hard to review a book I've loved this much. I'm not sure how this sequel has gotten so little attention compared to the original.   The first book was fantastic.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book. I got it because I am planning on becoming a realtor and the author talks a lot about the importance of being informed and aware of the market. There are things to consider, but not everyone is as intelligent and thorough as this author. I learned a lot and I plan on working with her to make sure I am fully prepared for my real estate career. I'm not the only one who got this book because of my realtor plan so I think she really needs to get this out there because there are many good people out there that can benefit from reading this book as well.
Write a positive review about a good book: *********** I am a big fan of the series, I've read every one, and this is one of my favorites. I love the idea of a magical girl who can become a man and fight the patriarchy. I loved the art and characters. I just read a chapter from the book and I feel like I want to cry, it's so well written and well written well it's almost sad. I don't think there is any reason I should hate it, I just feel really sad I couldn't get it in before the book came out. But now it's here and I can't wait to get more. ********** I just finished "Sisters of Mercy." It is really fantastic. It's one of the best things I've seen on the Harry Potter universe, and I am really enjoying it. I can see a few similarities between Hermione and Ginny. She has a great relationship with her parents that's really touching, which I haven't seen a lot of in this series. I haven 't read as much as I would like to, but I do appreciate that Rowling has been open and transparent about what she does and what it isn't, and that means a lot for me. It really makes a difference in the reading experience. The characters are so good. There's such a contrast between the characters that are trying to live their lives and the villains who want to hurt people. The way the book wraps up is really cool, and it's fun to see them all meet up, they've all had a lot to deal with, and they're all figuring it out together. I wish I could have read the rest of it before I finished, but the characters were very interesting and interesting to read about. I think I'd read it twice. Thanks to J.K. Rowling for making such a great series. ************ I have been wanting to read this book for a while, and finally purchased the Kindle version from Kindle Unlimited. So here I am, in the process of enjoying the story. I really enjoyed the "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" book. But I am a bit disappointed that this story didn't focus on Harry being a student of magic, instead focusing on the trials and tribulations that come with being a wizard. I know it is supposed to be a mystery and a thriller, but that doesn't mean I don 't like mysteries, thrillers and thriller like a girl with a passion for fantasy. Maybe I
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* I have read many books about the military. All of them have their place in the series. I've read this one first because I needed some encouragement to get the training done. I got my new rifle on June 5th and I already have three kills. The training helped me get past the "why me?" issue and I think I could get even better with it. It's been a lot of fun. Thank you for taking the time to write this book.  From Anonymous of Virginia on 5/21/2014. Great book. Good stories and useful information. :  I like the "you are here" approach to the book. The author goes into details about how different military people use their rifles. I have always wondered what it would be like to use a rifle like this. It would not be the same without knowing how it is used in real life.   It was interesting to read about what the military would do if it had to defend the country and the environment. There are several examples of what would happen if things did not go as planned. I liked the "tough guys" and "lovable losers" description. I can see the author's view of them. They are a mixture of the two. There seems to be a huge lack of women in the armed forces and the author gives them the same treatment in this book, as if there were none. I believe he is talking about men that want to become women but can not. He is also talking about guys that have been in the military for a long time and are still very masculine. The female soldiers in the book are a "bunch of pansies."   As a woman I really liked the author writing about my own experiences and those of others as well. As a woman, I found the idea that men can be sensitive and nurturing, while others can be brusque and aggressive very true. It was interesting reading about women that just can not understand how men are different. Women who cannot relate to this need to look at themselves and figure out why.   and the training is excellent. , from Anonymous of Tennessee on 5'th of July 2014. I liked this book and think it does a very good job at explaining the types of men in the U.S. military. It is not all men but some of them are. Overall I liked it. I would like to read more about the training. It goes into the military and then into
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________  I really enjoyed reading this book and felt that it was a very good book. I'm a big fan of the Star Wars books and love to have a good story and this did not disappoint. I've read other Star Wars stories that didn't do the whole story justice so I was pleasantly surprised. I did not find this book a bore at all and enjoyed the characters and their relationship to each other and the story. It felt like a movie to me and I thought it was very good. I liked that the book took place before The Force Awakens but added in a bit more. Overall a great read and recommend it to anyone that enjoys reading and watching Star Wars. I highly recommend it!
Write a positive review about a good book:  "The Dark Forest" by Brian Keene is a fast paced story. It was a great book to read while driving. As a little kid I was always attracted to books that took place in the middle of the woods. I think my favorite childhood book was the one about the little pig that grew up and how he lost his home to the wolves. I read this book when I was 5 and I loved it so much that I reread it when I reached middle age. This book is a great story about the struggle to survive in the wilderness.  A book that I enjoyed even though I didn't think it would be the best book for me:  The last book of The Girl Who Loved Too Much by Shirley Jackson. I read the first couple of chapters and didn't enjoy it much. I am a big Jackson fan, and this book didn't do it for me.   It had a lot of the same themes as Jackson's other books, but it didn't resonate with me as much.  There are also some themes in this book that really didn't fit with Jackson's own beliefs.

Write a positive review about a good book:.............................. I have enjoyed this book a lot more than the first one that came with the e-reader. I am still not sure how to rate it, but it's definitely not a book you have to read slowly. It's just too quick, but that's how I like it. I know that doesn't make much sense to the average person. But, to me, it's perfect. I do wish that this book had more of a story, but I think that's just me being too picky. Overall, I recommend this book to people who like sci-fi.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- This is my first "real" review I do it because it's so much fun to do. A book that really got to me and left me thinking of things I have been doing for years in my own life I wish I had known what the author was talking about when I was younger because the same things that were bothering me back then are going through my head now and I know they are true. So if you do read this then maybe you are someone who is feeling a bit confused and depressed now and what's going on in your life. So what if you're alone now in your old age and you are afraid of the future and everything else. I had that but it didn't last for long. I'm so happy that I got through it because now my perspective of life is different now. If you are feeling the same or if you are thinking about it then read this book. ---------------

Write a positive review about a good book: *********** My husband and I just finished this book. It really is a wonderful little book about a very small dog. I really appreciate her courage to do what it takes to get the book published and to tell her story. She really is the real deal and the book was very well written and easy to read. It was a great experience and I plan on buying her another book very soon. I was very impressed by the little details that we didn't even notice during the book. This was a wonderful book to get a dog to read, and she was very interested in every word that was said to her. She is so cute and the pictures in the book were very good. I would recommend this book to any dog lover.

The dog was very excited to read about people. She's only had a short time with the book but she has already talked about a man, about a boy, and even a dog. She also talked about being a princess and what she would do if she became a princess. Her love for animals is evident in every detail of her comments. I have recommended this book for all my family members who need help to think about where their children are going to come from. Her comments were so detailed that even my 12 year old son could understand what was going on. I highly recommend this product.

The book is a very informative little book and I know I can always find another to read to the dog. The only negative is that it is hard to make out the words when you are reading it.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  I would not be writing this review without reading this book, and I am so glad I did. I am a college freshman in the business management program at my university. I just finished an extremely difficult and lengthy class on accounting (I had already taken a general accounting class but not the specific accounting course). The professor was incredibly knowledgeable and thorough, and although there are a few technical issues, I would highly recommend his class to anyone. This course was taught by an incredibly bright professor (not sure if he's in school right now, but he certainly wasn't twenty years ago) who went over the material quite thoroughly in class. He was very patient, as I often was, and went through some very tough issues, while I was struggling. If this was the type of course I took for business administration, I probably would have dropped out of school, but because I had already passed the test, I decided to take a semester off and study in the evenings. I think this course would have helped a great deal. I will definitely take another accounting class from him next semester. Thank you, Professor, for a great book and a great lecture.
Write a positive review about a good book:  My new favorite First of all this was a wonderful book. I liked it so much I decided to pick up a copy of it after finishing the series. I have never really read that many Harry Potter books, but since I was reading the one for the first time, this seemed like the perfect choice. This book is all about the relationship between Harry and his godfather Sirius. We learn that Sirius was a Death Eater, but his loyalty was to his godson. When Harry grows up, he realizes he does not think too highly of Sirius and decides to put the past behind him. That's not to say that they do not have their ups and downs over the course of the books, as there are, but they always remain loyal and are there for each other. In the beginning of this series, they really had a difficult relationship, and I don't think the relationship improved as the series went on, it was more a struggle to get back to being close. When they did get back together, they never seemed to have the best of times. They would get into fights and arguments, and one time they got into a fight that Harry ended up getting his godmother killed. But as I said they stayed close to each other and always had a good time together. When Sirius died, Harry was devastated and left a very angry Harry, but even with his anger and grief over Sirius' death, he remained loyal and loyal to his aunt. When she was betrayed by her best friend, she stayed loyal to Harry, and Harry remained loyal to her. She was also the first person Harry called when he was in danger, and was the only person to call him out on his bad habits and insecurities. When he was trying to figure out how he was going to face Voldemort, she called him out and told him his plan was not working and that he was making a mistake. When his god father died, and when he found out he was supposed to be the next heir to the Black family, Harry never really had any trust in his father, but as we learn more about his relationship with his father and the family, it turns out he did have a good relationship with him. So this book really is about the two Harry's, and their relationship. They grow up together, but also have a rough time of it. I really liked their relationship, it is honest and they have their own struggles and problems with each other, but it is never something they can't work

Write a positive review about a good book: __________.  "The first book in my new fantasy series about three daughters and their father's life in the late 1920s. This book is about two of them: Lily (the daughter of the man who wrote The Tale of the Princess Kaguya) and Lian. After the death of their father in the early 1920s, Lily is a normal kid until she finds a piece of an ancient manuscript that she believes was hidden by her great-grandfather. The manuscript gives her the idea to find and save her father's former lover. I like this book a lot more than the first book, and hope that more stories like this will come out. The romance is a bit thin, but it's still a good story." - Jennifer R.   "An exciting beginning to an exciting series.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have just finished a copy of  F. R. Leavis'  recent book,  and as always I am happy with it.  The book is very clear, has a lot of information, and is useful.   I have been to the UK twice now and the first time I wanted to visit the Royal Botanical Gardens.  This book provides a lot more information about how to go to the RBBG than I expected.  I am definitely going to buy a copy for friends.  (By the way, the author has an E-Mail address on the back cover) I had no idea the book existed.  One day I picked up this book and went to buy it, and I thought it would be very useful to me.  After I finished this book I was so glad I found it.   F. R Leavis  has created an excellent book which provides information about everything from planning a trip, to visiting, to purchasing a copy, and what is the best way to visit.  He also has many photos and maps to be used in planning your trip.   I would recommend this book to anybody who is new to the Royal Gardens. I am very happy I found F.R Leavis and I am also very grateful for the helpful information he has provided.   Read full review
Write a positive review about a good book:    *I read the first and second book in this series and loved the first one but the third one, I had no desire to continue. The author's style is really confusing and if you are looking for easy to follow and well written, the third book will not satisfy. But that's not a bad thing. The story is well done. I liked the mystery and the characters.

And I love to romance :) .  as with any good book, you'll need a good cup of tea or coffee and the good word to help you get through it  E.V.I. I loved the romance and the plotline. I also liked the main character's sense of humor.  the story itself was good  AnaG This was one of the best romance novels I've ever read. The characters were so likable and the story flowed very well. -The Romance- I found the romance in this book to be a bit off-putting, but it was just a slight problem I found on the first read-through of the novel. So I didn't give it a pass. The rest of the story was great, even though I thought there were some things that could have been better in the romance aspect. I would recommend this book with one exception. The final scene between the two main characters was very sweet and it just didn't fit with the story at all. Overall, I am happy with my purchase of this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoy this book. It has a certain je ne sais quoi that is both entertaining and refreshing. You will never read a book quite like this one. It is written well and you can tell that the author tried very hard to make this book interesting and thought provoking. The writing is very entertaining, engaging and a real pleasure to read. The plot is interesting and it is very well fleshed out. The characters are well written and well developed. I also like that the book is quite long and is a little more academic than most fantasy or sci fi books. This makes it more enjoyable. I recommend this book to both kids and adults. It does a good job at presenting an engaging fantasy world while still remaining accessible to younger readers.   If you're looking for a fantasy book that is engaging and fun, I definitely recommend this one to you. The story is well paced, the plot is well-developed, the characters are likeable, the world is interesting, and it all has to do with magic. I can't recommend it highly enough.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite way to read about WWII was through George Allen's "The Eagle's Nest". This is the best book on this subject I have read. This book has everything that you need to know about the war, from the German and Japanese perspective. The book also has very informative notes that provide historical background information on each person in the book. The main characters are very well portrayed as they have their own problems and successes throughout the war. I am hoping the book will be the basis for a future novel that covers the war in detail. I would strongly recommend this book to any World War II buffs and anyone interested in reading about WWII.

When she was in jail she was very very angry and had a great hatred for the system and she took it out on her boyfriend and their two daughters. The book told her about her past and how she felt like she was worthless and had been wronged by the system. She wanted to tell her boyfriend's story but thought she would lose her own sanity. She felt very depressed and wanted the world to know about this type of abuse. She didn't know it was going to end with her taking his life but she did and I feel sorry for his children.
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- I read this in book form and the first half was pretty good. The last half was so terrible I didn't think I'd want to re-read it at all. The first half had lots of information and the second half had absolutely nothing. I'm sure if this was a movie, it'd be a hit. I read a lot of books and I don't get much out of them unless I think they're great. This was not a great book.

Your book is a gift from a grateful God that will empower and inform us."  – Jennifer "I have a problem with the author's advice on parenting, which I find self-defeating. She writes, for example, that we should "focus on the good," but in doing so, overlooks how that good might be a product of the choices and beliefs that made it possible.  It makes her seem to think that parenting isn't about loving children, but rather about how best to survive as a parent. "I don't want my kid to be an example for me"  she suggests, as if loving the way we are is the equivalent of being selfish about our own kids.  We do not need a selfish definition of being a parent; we need one that allows us to do what is right."   – Karen"I was so excited to read the book! I've had my first child in July, and I am doing my best to keep my spirits up. I know what a big job it is to do this as a single mom, and it has not been easy.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* I don't know much about this book, other than the fact that it's an old title. It is, however, a good read that does what it set out to do--get you thinking and re-thinking everything you know about the world. This book is about a man named Joseph who discovers that the United States of America has never been the nation he has thought it was, and that the world is a much bigger place than it appears to be. The story focuses on the history of the two largest land masses in the world--India and China--and the effects that this discovery has on each of their inhabitants. I have always felt that the two great civilizations, Europe and America, are in many ways one and the same. If one looks at European and American history from the viewpoint of history, it's easy to understand how the two nations came to be so very different. The West is defined by Christianity and has a very high degree of social, political, and religious tolerance. The East is more individualistic, with an equally high degree or social, personal, religious, and political intolerance. I think that the difference between Europe and the United states of America is in our perspective. If we think of Europe as a country or region, we see it as a collection of distinct and separate cultures and ethnic groups. We think of ourselves as Europeans because we have the same ancestry as the original Europeans. We don't see ourselves as distinct from the other populations in our area and, since this is a continent, we are more of a "part of the world". If you compare Europe to the United state of America, you'll notice something odd. If you look at our map of the United State, the United Nations is a big chunk of land in the east. There is not a single European group that is contiguous with the United nations. This is a fact. If people from the west had been able to get together and live with each other, they would have become an even greater force for good in the past. The idea that the countries of Europe are a country is a foreign concept to most Americans. They think of the countries as being separate entities with distinct and unique cultures. In my opinion, this is very much true for Europeans. It's more than just an ethnic difference. I'm sure that most people from Europe think of themselves as European in every way but religion. There's a lot more to the history and cultures of Europe, but I think I'm
Write a positive review about a good book:    The Book is Awesome, but...: The best part of the book is the discussion and the answers given by the author himself. He gives lots of details about the different types of asexuals and what happens to them. This helped me a lot. The first thing that comes to my mind is that it was nice to see asexuality mentioned at length. Although not all asexual people have the same needs or desires. It is nice to have a name for asexual identity. It was nice seeing people talking about their sexual experiences. One of the main reasons I love the book so much is because of what the author discusses. It helped me see that I'm not the only one with these desires, nor is it the only thing I want. It also helped me realize that I shouldn't just be satisfied with just wanting to be sexual. I had to know how I could get what I wanted. That's what it's all about.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book a few months ago and it really was enjoyable.   The character was well fleshed out. The plot was well-written and had a twist that I didn't see coming.   "The world was changing, a little bit, all the time. This changed my relationship with life and also how I viewed the future."   This is a pretty good science fiction book that takes a few liberties with some things, but that doesn't make it bad. It's a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:.......................................................The first one of these I read, I felt like I was in love. And it wasn't until the second one that I realized how bad of a book this actually was. I had no interest in the story, or the characters, or even the setting (it was in the middle of the country on a lake) so I gave it another shot. And here I'm in love again, although this time it's from afar. The writing is very easy on the eyes, and the story was gripping. So much so that I kept wanting to return to it!   I also had a hard time understanding why they did this story, but at least I found the second half of the book more enjoyable.   Overall, I love the story of this book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever wanted to get away from civilization for a few months or years (even if only temporarily). I was so impressed with the way they wrote, and with the characters. I would give it 5 stars if I could, but I'm not allowed to because it was based on a true story.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "The Secret Life of Bees" is a fantastic book. My kids absolutely loved it. The fact that you can have this information in one easy-to-follow book is great.  I highly recommend this to anyone interested in the science behind bees. I can't wait to hear how my kids feel about it as they go through the process. This was a great, fun read for our boys. They thoroughly enjoyed it and found the "what-nots" fun and informative too. We read this last night and it was a fantastic read. My kids LOVED it. I got to give a shout out to the author, John Barrows, for the fact that he makes it seem like this is just about honey and not the whole bee hive. He also makes it sound like the kids will be able to understand the science of honey without actually reading the entire book. He did a fantastic job of getting across the concept and providing examples of the science that goes into beekeeping without making it so confusing that you won't know what's going on. If you have a kid who is interested in bees this is a must-read.

I found that I had to read this on the subway before my trip home. I read it at my son's bedtime. It made him a better person. I also read it before bed while breastfeeding.

How does it feel to have been published?: "The fact that I have my book, and it's out there and people are reading it is an amazing feeling. It feels amazing that I am part of the family. This is a big moment, and I hope the rest of my story lives up to it. I have to write it down for myself, and then I can't remember it if it's so long. But that's okay because it's the journey, not the destination. I'm still working on it. It takes a lot of patience and a lot to get there. There are a lot things to say, and a story to tell. And I have a lot more to say." 1.  When I Am Not at Home: A Writer's Guide to Self-Care by  Jodi Picoult  Jodi is a full-time writer and mother of a 3 year old who suffers from severe Epilepsy. The book addresses many of the challenges writers face, and offers advice for writers dealing with their own personal struggles with self-care and illness. "In my 20 years as a writer, I have been lucky to have lived at home with my parents (I am now divorced) as a child, with my boyfriend when I wrote my first novel, and for a few years in the hospital while I was writing my second novel. This has taught me that I can survive, I can write, and that I don't need to be the center of my own life. In fact, if I'm not writing, I am so far from it that it's not even real. That is, it's too real, too physical, too important, and too real. I know that I must always care for my mental and emotional health, as well as my physical health.

The author uses a lot humor to make the reader laugh and cry at the same time. The information given about the people who were involved in the murder of millions is very important and very accurate.

The book has been very helpful and I will definitely refer my friends and relatives to it.   Thank you so much for this great book!   My new favorite book! Read this book before reading the others to know what will happen. I liked the story as much as I liked my first book of the series. The only downside for me is that I couldn't wait for the end of the last book. This made me wonder why my favorite book hasn't been released yet!I think it was the ending that didn't make it as good as the others. It ended so abruptly and was so different than what I thought the ending was going to be. But that is what is great about a series and how it keeps the fans coming back for more. I did have a great time reading it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book! There was something new in the book I hadn't read before. I liked that she took the time to make sure the characters were unique, and not all the same, which was a good thing because the stories are very short. The first time I read this book, I didn't feel connected to any of the characters, but now I'm kind of glad that I didn´t read it before! It was so interesting to hear the story from the characters' points of view and see how they reacted to things. I loved that there was so much detail in the worldbuilding, it made it feel like I'm in the same world. I found that it was a bit short, but overall, it was an awesome read!
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- I can't recommend this enough! A fantastic read.  I know a lot of people are going to hate me for saying that it was a very good read. I am very biased and biased against books, but I do believe that I could put this book next to my own favourites, and it would still be top of the list. It was written from the first person point of view of the narrator, and the story is told from her point of views. It takes place in the 1980s, and is a rather dark story about a group of young guys who were all about to get together to go to a rock n roll concert in the country. Things don't quite work out for them when the promoter tries to take a large chunk of their ticket money to cover his own loss in an insurance scam. They all end up fighting for their lives at the concert, as the other band members try to get revenge by taking down the promoter with the help of their friends. I really liked this book, and I believe that it could easily be re-edited to be set in the 80s instead of the early 90s, or in the future in a future time line. As it is, the story goes with the narrator's point of focus and I felt that it worked well. I was very entertained while reading this book and could feel that this was a good story, even though there was a lot happening in the story that took away from what I liked about the story. However, I know that I would have to read the entire series of the series in order to fully enjoy this book. I highly recommend that you give this book a try.   Note: The first book in this series, The Last Days of the American Dream, is available from Amazon and in bookstores. I read the other three books in this collection on a Kindle Fire HDX. The Last Day of the Dream is the fourth book in the collection.  , May 11, 2011I can't seriously say that this is my favourite book. It's just not the sort of book that gets much recognition, but, nevertheless, it is a great book. And as it is my first book, I'm not very familiar with the author. I'm still enjoying the book, but this is just not really the type of book I would recommend to others.I enjoyed this book at first.

Write a positive review about a good book: Â I enjoyed this book immensely and I highly recommend it for those that love the story of the first book. The new characters bring a lot to the plot and they are all so well developed, it's a pleasure to read the story.  The book is the story from the perspective of a young girl named Elaina who is growing up and living on a ship on the ocean. Elaina meets a girl named Shoshana as well and the two of them fall in love but their paths aren't always as simple. Shoshara is the daughter of a rich and powerful man and Elaina is the child of an old shipwrecked man. Eliana and Shoshiana are forced to work together as the ship's hands and Shomara and Shomeni are her ship's sailors. They must work together to survive on the ship and it turns out that each has a different thing they do that needs to be done. This was my first ever read and I got through it with ease. This book is great and I recommend it to anyone.  (review of free book)  Review by: Tessa on Mar. 14, 2011 :  I was given a free copy of this book by Random House. I read it because it was a Goodreads Author's Book Club Pick.   I really enjoyed the story line, and I really wanted to know what happened to Elaina's mom and dad. My husband and I read this one together. He had no idea of the story, but it had an interesting twist, and we both liked it a lot. It was a great story, and really told in the style of a children's book. I recommend this book to everyone who likes a good story.   the characters are really well developed and they feel real and realistic.   a great read!

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read this book over the last 2 months and I still love it. The author writes a lot about the problems in modern society. It's not a very positive book but it's still a great read. I'm not one to read a book just to listen to it. I usually go out and buy the books. The book is entertaining and the characters are likable. I think you can't really tell the author is a white male from the content of the book. The plot is a little slow and the book is a bit short. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to think and to read in a nice way.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________ This is one of those books that makes me think about my own experiences as I relate to the main character and as I read. It's a very personal tale that, I'm sure, resonates with many other people who have experienced similar situations, too. If you are considering any type of divorce or custody situation or have a parent struggling with alcoholism, you'll probably find something you can relate to in this story. The character development is good. He's very well developed, and the love he develops for his parents is also well developed. This is a good first book, to be sure. I think that people who are looking for a quick story to get them out of a rut will probably prefer to wait a few years, and I do recommend this book, because the main storyline is well developed and there's some suspense as it unfolds. A few things that I did find odd: One of the most interesting things about this book is the reference to the TV show, "Roseanne". The characters are playing that show (with Roseanne) in their heads while they're in jail. It actually took me a while to get the reference, because I'm not really familiar with that show. But it was really funny to see them thinking about the show as they read the book. In addition, the fact that she's a drug addict isn't really addressed. It doesn't really affect the plot at all. This is a pretty good book that was a good introduction to the world of addiction.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best book I have ever read! The only thing that could make it better is if more people read it!   I found this book in a used book store, and it has been an amazing read. You won't find a better author or better story! This is one of the best horror books I've ever read in my life. It is truly a masterpiece. It has been five years since I first heard about this author, and I'm still reading it. I just recently had a conversation with the author about the book (she's in California), and she says she thinks that she wrote it over ten years ago, but I think she's actually writing it for the first time in her life. She says she writes horror books because she doesn't like the horror movies, and this book is not the best thing she's ever written, but it's the best of the books she's written so far, and she's one of my favorite authors ever. I really enjoy reading her stories and I find them really scary. She's the only author who I read and I don't leave my house without reading at least one of her books every day.   The book starts off with the narrator going on a long drive through a very rural area, and coming across the remains of what once was a barn. Her father has recently died (which we'll see later on), and in a very kind manner, her mother has decided to leave all of their old possessions and farm equipment behind. They just bought the farm to move to a new place in the woods, and her mother was so sorry that she didn't have anything to come with them, that she's decided to give up on life. That's why they want you to find out about it and find out how she was killed.   the narrator is driving around, and then she sees a dead body that looks like a dog that was killed and left in the forest, and that's when the story begins.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've just finished listening to this audiobook (by the same author) by the same person - it is, indeed, the same book, but you get to read it in audio instead of on paper - I thought it was very good, though. The first few chapters in particular were a breath of fresh air, and there was some fantastic information to be found!   I'm in my early 50's and have been a long time (50+) smoker. I have never been able to quit. This was the first book I read by Dr. Andrew Weil and I agree that it is a well thought out book about quitting. (There's a lot of it about the brain.) The narration was excellent - very soft yet authoritative. I could not help but feel I had been listening to someone who had smoked for years.   The book had a lot to say, in fact I felt it was a'must read' in the area of smoking. I would recommend it to any smoker - even a non smoker.

The author explains the concepts very well, and I have been doing a lot of learning in the last few months, and this book was really useful to me. The main thing I took away from it is how hard it is to learn. As someone who has struggled with learning a few topics and even a language, the book is just about the process of learning. And this is where I have struggled the most. That is because I don't want to think about the problem or how I can solve it - I just want to learn a new language. I would recommend this book to anybody who wants to learn and I would even say it's better than other books that I have read. If you're looking for something that will get you started, it's a great book.

I was in the midst of completing my master's degree in social work when I found myself in need of information.

I highly recommend this book for any individual, any group, or for any discipline.
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________________________________________________________ I enjoyed reading this book. It's a good example of how to make a good fantasy book; the plot line, characters, and the magic are all well conceived and presented. It took some time to get used to the way the magic works, but it's not as complex or confusing as some of the older "old-school" fantasy. The language was adequate, if not quite as good as that found in Tolkien's works. It was not until I got to the part of the story where she was kidnapped by an evil wizard that I got a good feel for the fantasy genre and for how to do it properly.   This book was definitely the sort of fantasy that had me asking myself, "Did that really happen?" It's not the most imaginative fantasy I've ever read, but its quality will keep me reading for quite a while.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________________________ "I have not only read this book, but I have gone back and reread it, several times, and have found myself asking questions that I had not thought to ask, including, "But why? Why not just give people the information, the information they want, without being afraid? Why hide it? Why worry about the consequences?" But here's the important question: "What does this have to do with my personal life?" The answer to the question is: it has everything to do. Because, what I have learned in the last several years, is that fear can be an excellent motivator. I don't mean in the sense of doing something you are not proud of. What I mean is that what you do is what you know. And as soon as you know that something is wrong, it becomes impossible to deny what has become obvious to all but you. And that is one of the most dangerous things of all. We tend to deny things because we do not want to admit that what we are doing is wrong. This is a mistake that all of us make. When you begin to get rid of fear, you begin not only to know what is going on in the world but also to be capable of doing things that you might not have thought of before. When I look around at the people who have been living for a few years without the fear that they felt in the previous three, they are more than capable of going out and helping themselves and others. And in this sense, the fear has changed everything for them. You might say that I have changed everything. Well, I guess that is possible." --John McPhee, The Way I Lived Now "In this book [Kraemer], Kraemer shows that in the early nineteenth century, the Christian faith was not simply the belief in a God who intervenes in history to save humanity, but a belief that salvation and redemption were a personal matter for God and that He had revealed that to His chosen people. As he sees it, that faith is embodied today in a belief in God as the only source of salvation for men and women, especially since the Second World War and in the post-war period. Kraemer describes these early Christian and post-Christian beliefs as 'the new faith.'" --Douglas Eby, author of Christian Faith Today  "John Kraemer has done it again.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________ ____________________________________ I read the book, The End of the World as We Know It, by Daniel Quinn. __________________________________________________ What I liked about it: Quinn is a great writer and his book tells the story of a man who is the last man on earth in the year 2575 and has to decide what he should do in the near future.  I enjoyed Quinn's writing style and his writing has some of the best twists in a sci fi/fantasy book.  ____________________________________________________________ How could I rate it:    5.5 stars!  I loved the book and read it in 3 days.  It was a fun read! ___________________________________ This is the story: "The end is coming, the end of everything, and in the chaos it will have to end. In 2035, mankind has spread across a billion stars, and the earth's crust, though a thin cover, has given way to the vast, ocean-filled abyss, whose heat is lethal to all but the most resilient organisms. Within this heat are the frozen cities of the dead. When I was a young man, a comet shattered the icecaps over Alaska's polar islands, bringing a year that was warmer and sunnier than any that had come before it, and spawning a new era of humanity. I grew up in a small town, one of the few that survived, and it was there that I learned of my destiny. In a few weeks, it will all be over, and you will be left with just your memories, and those of your friends and lovers. They will be gone forever, and what's left will change you irrevocably. How can I change anything? I think I'll just wait it out, in the cold, with my eyes closed. But I have a family to feed. I've got to stay alive. The book is called, "The End of Time," but really it's the end for me, too. The story of our world's destruction is very much like the story that happens to us as we age. In my case, it has happened to my mother, who is dead at 80. I'm going to miss her. The world is going to change, and so will I.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* This was my first time buying a book and I did it for the story alone, so I can only review on the content. I've heard stories about how some authors do not use a "good cop bad cop" approach, and I can tell you that wasn't the case with this book. In fact, this book was very well done, and if you do like police procedurals, you'll probably enjoy this. The book starts out with a couple characters in the real world being thrown into the same situation, with two very different outcomes. The first character is a veteran detective and veteran of various cases who has had a hard time of it lately. This case is particularly bad as the victims have very little information that the perpetrator could even have taken from them. This leads to the detective becoming desperate and using questionable methods to find the truth about his old case.   The second character is an 18 year old college student who had an extremely strong friendship with a female who is the key person in this book's story. The girl has also been caught in a similar situation, and while they don't find out each other's true identities until after the fact, they end up discovering a lot about each other. I thought the book's characterization of both characters was very accurate. This book definitely makes the reader care about these two characters as they try to piece together what happened in their lives, and what it could have meant for them.   a good story, with some characters I didn't like:  -The character who is trying to be an angel, or who just wants to be known as an angel. That doesn't work for me.  "There is nothing to forgive, there is no turning back. I am who I am." -H.P. Lovecraft

Write a positive review about a good book: ****************** A beautiful, heartfelt book that is very insightful and a must read for every Christian. It is a book about a church that was created and has always been about Jesus in it's life and what it has meant in its life. The church's mission was to have a congregation that lives by the teachings of Jesus in our day and age and have a community of disciples that were taught by the Holy Spirit (the Holy Spirit was a key word in this book). When the church started its own magazine it was very successful because it was so different from other magazines. It was also very focused and it had a very passionate mission that was very powerful to its followers and to the world. But this changed in a very tragic manner and the church was forced to fold. ************************ The author's voice was very personal. I would encourage anyone who reads this book to listen to it in full as a friend. This book speaks a lot of pain, anguish, and love that I have felt but not felt to this extent in my life.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________________ I have bought several copies of The Book of the Dead and each time it has been great reading. I have read the book in the first person and have enjoyed it. This is my third copy and I feel the first three were probably the best. I just finished reading The Book at the beginning of my workday, then went straight to bed. It was a bit difficult to get back into the book after I got into the first page, but once I did, I was on it. It will take some time to fully get into the story because the story is a bit slow-paced, but the writing is perfect. The author uses historical and archeological research and uses it to explain the origins of the "Gods of the Ancient World" of mythology and the creation and development of the stories that were later handed down to us. I do not think that The Book would have worked as well if he had not made it an academic work; it would have been more like a historical novel, and that is not a bad thing. I think the fact that the author uses the research and information to explain his theories is great. I would not have thought that the gods would have gone down to our level, but I think they did. There is some mention of the Egyptian Pharaohs and the other ancient cultures, but there is no discussion of the Mesopotamian civilization and how their gods became what they are. I loved this book!

I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, especially the men's reading group. I read it on an audiobook so I cannot review it there, but I will tell you I would not give it a 1.5! (Jan) There is a reason the title is THE DAILY TEMPLES. In our house, we have always called these "Daily Dose" books and the book is the first in a new series, The Daily Dose Program. Each chapter presents the ideas of the previous chapters in a format that a beginner can understand. The text is easy to read and contains tons of information. I am a man over the age of 40, and I found this book very useful. It helped me to lose weight, and now I can eat and eat until I am satisfied. (Michael) This book is simply the best! I read this book in a very long and boring period of time and I am now a little overweight. I have been reading a lot of other books like the one that you wrote and I have found out I am very stupid when it comes to eating and losing weights. I now understand the process of weight loss better and I now know how to eat healthier and I can feel confident that I will be able to keep the weight off. (Tom) If you are anything like me, it will have to be the Daily Doses series. This book is full of useful advice for beginners. Each day gives a diet plan, exercise routine, tips for dieting, and recipes. The only problem with this book,
Write a positive review about a good book: ******************* It took a couple of chapters for me to get up to speed with the first three sections, but once I did, the book was a very informative and engaging read. The three sections were interesting and challenging. The first section dealt with a historical event and what people think of it and the second section looked at the contemporary reaction. The third section discussed some historical ideas about the issue, both the views of those that believe in it, those that think it is too far fetched, and those who believe that the concept of gender is more like a social construct. The author does an excellent job of explaining the ideas and reasons behind these positions and then goes on to discuss some of the historical evidence. This book is a great tool for people who have a solid grasp of modern society and are interested in the history of gender in the modern West. I especially like the historical research in the third section, the information on how gender is defined, and how different cultures view gender. Also, the idea that people use the concept gender to divide up the world, rather than use it to identify and identify with others and not necessarily gender.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was blown away by this book. The story is fantastic. The characters are so interesting. I really like the way the author takes us through the life of our protagonists through their various stages of adulthood. It really gets into their lives from day one to the moment when the characters graduate. There's something so compelling about the way they live in the moment. From the point of view of an adolescent, it's so funny. You'll never forget the jokes, and I'd recommend this book to any teenage reader.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I liked this book.  It was good, but it was not great. I had been reading the first book,  A Wrinkle in Time, which I really enjoyed.  I did not have a hard time reading this book but I did find myself becoming bored with it. I did enjoy reading about the other characters and I found it very amusing that at times the author makes the characters more like adults, sometimes more like kids.  When the author is talking about how children act, like in the first one, and how adults act when they're trying to teach something to a child, and children, like the other two, don't react as well to the teacher's ideas.  She makes them seem like adults instead of being like children.  That was the only problem I had with the book. The characters are all very interesting and you care what happens to them.  The last half of the book I was bored.  This is because there was nothing for me to think about or wonder about after the book was over. It was a real disappointment to me because it was just about characters and no real plot. I'm sure if I read the book from beginning to end again I might enjoy it more. The author did a good job explaining some of the concepts, but I just couldn't keep up with them. I really did think she was giving it more time than she probably should have, which is a good thing. Overall, I liked this.  A little slow paced, but some of these ideas I really didn't think about when I read it, so I enjoyed it a lot.  If you like reading about characters in a story. or if you want to get into a book. that you will have a little trouble with, then I'd say check it out.

I was always interested in the story and I learned a lot about how people behave when in difficult situations. I learned that people have a tendency to act first and think later and this is especially true for me when I'm angry.

It's important because you don't have to be a monster to overcome a past that's a constant reminder of how unfair you were to yourself and those around you.

Write a positive review about a good book:    My wife and I read this together in two sessions. We both enjoyed it.   The story starts out as a typical family-friendly adventure, but in the second half, the writing becomes more complex.  For those who haven't read "Fairy Tale of New York" - the story of a girl in a fairytale, the first part of this book is pretty much that story.  I loved it. So well done, authors of this genre, make me believe more books like this will come out.  Recommended to both kids and adults.
Write a positive review about a good book: ************************* I really liked the way he made the "wars" between the "good" people and the "evil" ones come alive. I thought the ending of the first book was a little too short, but this one was so much more satisfying. I'm also happy that there was a sequel, and glad there will be one in the future. This story was much more interesting and satisfying. If this book was just about a single character (such as a soldier or a princess), it would be one of the best fantasy books out there. But as it was, it really brought out a good number of different viewpoints from different characters, which I think really makes this one of my favorites.

Write a positive review about a good book: Â  This is a must read for any man of a sensitive nature, and I hope that the author can keep this up as he is still one of the best.   The author is the master, who knows how to tell the story. He makes his story clear, and even when his story has become confusing, he keeps you with him through it all. He knows how his stories have to be told, and he tells them very well.  , the story is told in a very believable way. There are not many things that you do not know, and there are very few things that seem like a mystery. The narrator does a good job at keeping the story together.   I liked that the story has to do with the human beings who are involved in a tragedy that took place, and this is the main point of the book, but it also makes up for all the other problems that the characters have, and it is not a plot-driven story, it is a human story. This story is not just about a tragedy, it tells us about the characters and their lives.  -the author does not try to make the story a very heavy or depressing one, and the characters are not the usual type. They do not have the common problems that we have, but instead, they have a different kind of problem that are very relatable. I like that they are different types of people, and they have the same kind of problems, but they have their own ways of dealing with the problem and in the end, it does not matter if you like them or not. It is a very sad, sad, and honest story.  -the description of the location and the environment is very accurate. This is what I like about the story; the fact that it is based in reality. There is nothing out of place about this book.  .

Write a positive review about a good book:  "A great read about the people and the places I've had the pleasure of visiting over the past ten years." 5 stars! This is an interesting and fun book! 5 out of 5 stars This was my first time ever trying a cookbook. I love the recipes and I'm definitely going to buy the whole book! I just read an amazing memoir called The Last Great Adventure by Kari Hetzel. Her book was wonderful, even though I didn't have a favorite character. And this book was just amazing. I have been working on a vegetarian version of this dish. I can't wait for you to see it! 4 out of 4 stars I am really pleased by this book. I just finished reading about the various species of frogs that live in the different habitats of the United States. I'm interested to see what other organisms can be found and where. This is a very interesting book. The illustrations are great. I also enjoyed the various recipes in the book. There were also several tips and suggestions. 4.5 out 5 stars Great book for learning more about a different type of frog in my home state, Maine. Many of the images and some of the recipes were very informative and practical as well as a great way to eat in a sustainable way. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in frogs and their ecology. 5-star. This book is great. It was exactly what I was looking for. I've already sent the book in for a rating and review to ensure I get my money's worth. Awesome book about the different types of frogs living in our home state of Maine. The variety of creatures presented in this book is outstanding. The author was very thorough and informative. I think this would be a great addition to a home or classroom for students to learn about different kinds of frogs. I would even buy this book to have for my friends to teach them about amphibians! One of the best books I've ever read. Really interesting information and really good photos. I will be looking forward to seeing more of the various types of amphibians I've seen in the US. The animals were amazing and really gave me a different perspective on how these creatures work. The book was very clear and easy to follow.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- The idea of this series is cool, but the execution was weak. The characters are bland and there was no mystery or suspense to speak of. This was the case with this book, which really was nothing more than an excuse to have one of the main characters have an affair, and then the other main character has to deal with his actions. In my opinion, this was the main problem with the series.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ I loved this book! I can only speak for myself, but I love books that I can relate to. I'm from a small town in central PA, and this book describes it beautifully. There's so much about small town life that's just awesome and I like the idea of the boys in their hometown having the kind of problems I used to have. But really, the story is about how their relationship develops as they try to make their lives work. I feel the book's real power is in the characters' interactions as they strive to make up for lost time with each other, and I can't wait to read the next volume!
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________________________________________________________________ I love it! I am a history major and I really enjoy reading about the world and how it has changed throughout history. It has always interested me because of the changes it has gone through. This book was written for the history major, but I will read it as a history book for anyone who likes history or loves a good historical story. It covers about 10 different cultures from around the world. There are descriptions of each place and they go in great detail about the foods, their clothing, the clothing styles of the time, weapons they used and the way they behaved. I particularly enjoyed reading about how the French dressed, their hats, their long sleeves and their long boots. The best part about this book is the fact that it is written by a real history teacher who used to teach in South America. He writes in a way that is so detailed that it makes it seem like you are visiting a different country each time you come back home to Florida. I enjoyed it so much that I bought all of his books. I read the last two of his history books and I have to buy more. He really knows his subject and has a way of describing each culture so well that it gives you a glimpse into history that you would have otherwise never known. This was a great book and it will stay with me as long as I live. I know that someone will buy it and get me to write a review about it. This is a must buy for anyone interested in the history.

It contains a wealth of information, and will prove to be of great service to future students and researchers in the field. It will aid in making clear and precise the complex concepts involved in the design and construction of nuclear power plants, as well as to the design of other high efficiency steam generators."   -- Robert B.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been reading this book for almost a year now, but I had not written any review about it at the time of writing the book. I decided that if I were to write a review, I'd write something positive about the book, and I'd probably not do so in the way that someone would do. So here we go.   The book is, to my mind, a must-read for all who are interested in the subject of UFOs and extraterrestrials. I've only skimmed the book so far, but the information that it provides is absolutely valuable. It's interesting to see how various organizations (which include the FBI, CIA, the U.S. Air Force, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and the National Reconnaissance Office) came together to investigate the UFO phenomenon. I especially liked how the author uses examples such as the Roswell Incident, the Rendlesham Forest Incident, and other such incidents. The author gives an excellent discussion of the various investigations, and how they all were handled by different levels of the UFOMA and U.F.O. bureaucracy. He goes into detail on what exactly were the roles and responsibilities of the people involved, as well as what kind of evidence was considered. He gives an in-depth description of how each of these organizations came to the conclusion that the phenomenon was probably not an unknown phenomenon, but rather a real and present danger to the nation.   is, I think, a book that people should give to all UFO researchers, because it is the best book on the subject that I've seen. There is a lot of solid information and the book is written well. If you want to learn more about UFOs, read this book. If not, you can get it for $11.47 at amazon.

The first one was called "The Magic of Reality" and it was a very good read, although I didn't enjoy it very much. This one has a bit more science fiction with science in it, and it is pretty entertaining too.  The main point of this book is a new technique for "The Art of Reality Manipulation" as I call it. O'Briens book was quite informative, but to me it was almost a waste of money. The techniques described are quite easy, and the technique has a lot of uses. As a matter of fact, I'm going to try to use this technique in order to learn some more things about consciousness. . ,   ,

Write a positive review about a good book:    "A truly fine piece of historical research. I have read several biographies of the British Prime Minister, from the Victorian era to the present day, and this is definitely one of them."   I enjoyed this book very much and wish I had read it sooner. I learned a lot about Queen Victoria and the role she played. I think it is very clear that she had a lot of difficulty relating to her people and a very difficult time dealing with the various demands made on her by the other members of the English-speaking world. Her relationship with the French and Germans was also a serious problem for her. She was always going to be a Queen and she was very happy to be one but she felt she had to live up to the duties that went along with being a Queen. Unfortunately she was never able to be in full control of everything and this made for a very unstable reign. Queen Victoria had to deal with people's attitudes to her and the fact that she was British. She had to get her own way, which is a very different thing from being a queen of a sovereign country.   Queen Victoria was also in many ways the mother of our nation. Her influence is still felt.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* A really interesting and good book by a true historian.  In my opinion, this is a must read for any scholar and historian looking to broaden and deepen their knowledge of World history in the early modern period (c. 1000 – c. 1550)  As this book is about history, it should be free of biases in general. However, in this case, it appears that the author is biased towards a certain school of thought and is quite a bit wrong in his assumptions. There are some obvious flaws in the author's conclusions, such as a lack of accurate information about the Islamic period. I found some of his conclusions in this book to be questionable. However he does do a good job of providing evidence to back up some of the arguments he makes. I find this book very interesting and think it is well worth reading.  "I could not say that I was disappointed. The information that he presented in his book is extremely detailed, and it was a great read. He does a good of presenting the history of the Islamic State and also the history from the Western standpoint, especially as it pertains to the Arab World. In my opinion he could be a bit less biased, and he also has good sources to back-up his claims. I give this book 4 stars and I will definitely read more books from the author.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The First Time: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and the Courage to Live by Jillian Mejia was one of my most enjoyable reading this year. I am a mom of three, so I am familiar with the struggle of parenting, especially during times of stress, and that struggle is not new to me. I have always had to adjust and adjust again to life's changes, just like Jillian. When Jillian's son was born I was overwhelmed and I felt like I was on a mission to make sure he didn't experience what I had gone through with my first child. Jillian has a lot of life wisdom, a lot to say and a lot going on in her life, so there is really no way that I can put this book in my review short enough. Jillians voice is so authentic and so inspiring, that I think the book is really going to help all moms out there who have experienced something similar in their own life. If you are pregnant and need a little bit of help on how to deal with your emotions, then this is definitely a book you need. I don't think that it was all that long in the making, but it is so important and so relevant to the world we live in today. Jill is a great example of someone who was able to navigate life on her own two feet, and I think that is really special. Posted by Jenny at 7:26 PM
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a big fan of fiction and books, and when I saw the title of this book, I knew I would have to buy it.   This book was fantastic! Not one single flaw. There were two things I disliked in it, though. First, I found the beginning to be repetitive. When there are so many of these situations that the reader is given so many times, it is easy to lose count. I found it hard to keep track of which one was from a previous situation. The second thing I disliked was the ending. I liked the first 3 chapters. They were nice and exciting. But then there was the little twist at the end. When I started reading the story, I did not expect what happened. But when it happened I was shocked and so pleased that it wasn't a twist.  -   -  ... and now for the review:   The book begins with a very interesting and exciting set up. But as it progresses, the book starts to feel repetitive and repetitive. I know, it was not intended, but it became a problem because the book was already long enough for it to feel stale. And the ending is not what I was expecting at all. I just did not feel satisfied, or like I had finished.  .
Write a positive review about a good book:  "In short, I was very pleased with my experience with a very informative and enjoyable read. I highly recommend this book. The author is quite detailed, has some very thorough analysis, and is careful to make the most of his limited time." -John B.   "I've always enjoyed a good psychological thriller and this book certainly qualifies in that department. It is one of the more well-written novels I have read this year." -Michael W.   in an article in Psychology Today, the author explains why there is such a discrepancy between what people think they know and what they actually do know. He states that "the mind is a big, complex place." And, that we need to be careful with our beliefs. He also states that when people think that they know something, they actually don't know that much more than they did before. He goes on to explain: "A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. It can lead to mistaken conclusions and make people more vulnerable to manipulation."   I agree with this very much. Many of us have learned that when we go on forums, look for new material, and make comments that are too far off the mark, or just plain wrong, our opinions will be taken as the truth by the majority, while we are just making a mistake of not knowing enough. And when we do become a mistake for a few people, our reputation is severely damaged, as we are a known idiot and people want to know how we made the mistake, and how we can avoid it in the future.  , the author states that, and that we have to be very careful with what we believe, because it could be wrong. He further states that many people believe in their religion, their political party, or even themselves, but are simply wrong.   for this reason, I personally believe that it is best to go with what our inner sense tells us. In other words, if you are truly a Christian, then you are a Christian. You will not find another person who is a Christian who will agree with you, but that is just how it works. It may be that you simply have not yet read The Secret, and thus you have not realized it yet. There is also the issue of your religious tradition or belief system, and what that will dictate for your actions and behavior. It really comes down to what you want to believe, and as the saying goes, "I believe because it feels good, not because I know
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is by far the best book on the subject that I've read.  It is so well researched that I didn't find any mistakes.  There is more in-depth study in this book than there is on the web.  The content is very interesting, and it will make the topic in general very interesting.   It is an eye opener.  I would recommend this book to any who have ever suffered from "I don't know what to do" "I am going to kill myself" "why does this continue to happen to me" "this is wrong, and I can't get it to stop" or whatever it is that someone is trying to do.  This book was highly recommended to me. 
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________I loved this book. I am so glad I decided to try it. I'm about to read it for my 7th time (yes, I read all of the classics again). It is like a movie. I can't wait to go on my road trip again to read my book in my car while I listen to the radio, as I am going on my honeymoon, so that I can watch the fireworks (they can't be shown live here, so the fireworks have to be shown on video instead) and then I will have time to get to the hotel and the books I've read on the way. This book is the real deal. I recommend it to anyone who wants to read a good story that has a little drama to it. It's a very interesting story about a man that has everything. So he goes on a road trip to find happiness. It is so different from any other book I have ever read in that it is so completely different. I love the way it all is turned. I want to give you my 5 stars for this book because it is a masterpiece.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very well written book. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the subject. The topics in the book will be very familiar to many. There are no boring details or long sections that are not interesting. This book is very much about the subjects that interest me most and provides great information in a concise manner. My only issue with the book is the title and the last sentence. There were several other books about this subject that I found very interesting that are only slightly less than as informative. However, I believe this book does a fine job of discussing the topic.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Girl on the Train is a great book. I did not understand the language barrier to the author's book at all (I have always been in favor of books that are translated into English and therefore I have not read that many books in this genre). I was intrigued to get to know the characters and understand what was going on in this book (and I have had an interest in travel for a long time now), but that was only because I do not understand Chinese. I have the same difficulty with books from other authors, because I can't read the Japanese, Korean, and Thai that many other books are translated from, and I can only read the English. I also thought the plot was very interesting, and it was not the usual boring urban story, so this book is definitely a must have for anyone who loves urban fantasy novels, and has a little understanding of the language.
Write a positive review about a good book: *********** The books about the real life events in the lives of Bill and Hillary have always been quite insightful and interesting. In this book, Hillary is portrayed more in the form of a "bad" person who may or may not have had a good childhood. Hillary also has to be judged more on her marriage as she has never been married and has had only one child. It has been reported that Bill did not want to bring this up with his wife when they had their first child because they were only going to be living together and this would mean the child would not be his or hers as her biological child. As Hillary has a much older brother (who has since passed) and he is a very influential person. This makes the whole situation even more difficult. There are very few references to Hillary and Bill during the "good" part of their lives but they are quite entertaining as they are always traveling to a foreign land and have to do some business and socializing. These are not the best of the books. In the book "I Want You Back" about Bill's first wife, Gennifer Flowers, they have a very nice relationship and are both working out their personal problems as well as going to therapy.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________ I first read this book years ago. It was the last book in a series and I read this one after I finished the rest of the series. I think this is the best of the bunch. Although I wasn't an ardent reader I really liked the characters and the story and felt I got to know the characters well enough. It is a good read but definitely an older one, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best book I have read on the subject. I can tell the author is highly intelligent. His writing style is clear and to the point, which is exactly what I need to understand. I don't think you can ask for more from a book. I am looking forward to reading more of the "new" work of his in the near future.  1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm not entirely sure that this book can be classified as a fantasy book. Yes, there are definitely creatures and things that are not very human. For example, when someone says the term "tentacle monster" to me I instantly picture a small worm-like creature (maybe a jellyfish?) with a long tail and a big, fat tentacle coming out of the back of the head. The way that the Tentacle Monster describes itself has the effect of making me think of the monster from "the Hobbit". I guess this can be explained because the story in that story is fantasy and the tentacle monster is a monster that the heroes have to battle. In this book the Tentacles are creatures that are in a state of disrepair. They live in the mud and the mud is not healthy and has a tendency to suck away at their essence. The mud is very strong and difficult to move through. In the beginning of the story the characters find a tribe of people that live in a mud house that has a door. This door is not locked, and anyone can come and go. The people in the house are somewhat more intelligent and can help out, but their presence causes the mud to grow and move into the house. The characters must move in to fix the house and to help the people. The houses are small and people are cramped in them, and the characters are not used to being in small spaces like this. This book took a while for me to get used to because of this. In fact, at the beginning I was having a hard time adjusting to the book because I couldn't make sense of the characters and their thoughts. However, when I got to the end I was able to see how the characters thought and thought and reasoned in a logical manner. Although I am no expert in magic and magical items, I can still follow along with this book. There were things that I was surprised to see in this book and it was a good read. I don't know if this is a good or bad thing. This is an adventure book, so there are adventure, adventure, and adventure. I didn't feel as if I was being cheated because there were a few things in this that I wasn't expecting. I enjoyed the characters in this story and enjoyed the story.
Write a positive review about a good book:...............................This book was awesome. I read the first and the third in the series before I got this book, but the second book in the book series was great and the next one was also great. I just wish the story would've been longer. Also, I'd like to mention that this book was not bad. It's just not what I thought it would be. If you're a fan of the series and want to get into the other books, this book is a great place to start. If not, then just stick with the first book in this series.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was thrilled to read The Darkest Place in the Land, a book about a mother and her son who find themselves trapped in an area of the country called the Darkest Land by a strange illness. The family were found by a trucker who works for the police and who, after helping them, finds out what the family was in that place and also that the family has been taken in by the church. He takes them in, gets them out and makes them welcome. The book is a very good one about family.  I do think that it will be good for younger kids as well as adults.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "I'm not a big fan of science fiction, but my daughter was, and so we read a lot of books about space travel. Her favorite was "Lonely Stars," the first book by Robert Heinlein (who wrote the book's sequels). It was a very fun book, and I'd recommend it highly to people who are interested in learning about how space travel works, the engineering aspects of space travel, and what it takes to live and fly in space."   "...the book really got to the heart of the problem of space colonization: what is a realistic scenario that is not just "fantasy?" Heinlein has the answer: he gives us the first ever space colonies in "Strangers from Earth." And he gives them a realistic schedule: each colony should have one resident. This has a very simple explanation: it is not possible to live in zero gravity for any substantial amount of time without some kind of motion-based assist, whether that be a walker, a wheelchair, or a scooter. This is true even in Earth gravity.   After reading Heinlein's "Stranger from Earth" I thought I would like to learn more about space exploration and space colonization."   of the book:

This is an excellent book about "The Game" and how it affects everyone.  It is a fantastic book and well worth your time.  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about the game and it's impact on our world.   It is not perfect, but it is a lot better than most of the other books out there.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ I like this book because it helps you learn about the power of meditation. I can't say that I found this book boring, but I'm also not that well read, so this helped me with a lot of concepts. It was interesting that he talks about a person who had been meditating for 2 years and was so grateful that he knew what meditation felt like before he started it.

I believe it is important for all of us to read and see the world in a new way and to experience things from new perspectives. I love how she took a very relatable event and made it even more vivid and interesting. I hope that people have this experience to see the real world through the eyes of another person and gain an understanding of another perspective. I think that this book was a great way to learn about some of the issues I had in my own life and about people in general. I look forward to reading her other books in the future." --Sarah "The title says it all. It is a beautiful story about a man who had just returned from war. It describes his journey of discovery from an all American youth who loves to read, to a man of peace. It gives the reader a real opportunity to look into the eyes and hearts of this character as he deals with his loss of an ability to communicate with people who he loves, as well as with the loss of the very relationship that brought him to peace and tranquility." "To be honest, this book made me sad. It's been an interesting ride watching as people and people's attitudes towards others are changing and slowly changing to reflect more and more of the world we live in. It was the first time I've seen a book that actually made me cry because I thought there would be something more heartfelt about this person. I was left very disappointed. I guess we will see how I feel when the next book comes out. I will say this however. It will be interesting to see how this changes my opinions on the current President of the United States." I loved this story!! I felt that it was a really wonderful way to see what it's like to be a disabled person and to see people who are supposed to be so good at their jobs do things that they do not do. The characters are very real and relatable and the story will give you a really interesting view of the disabled people in the world and you can see how they interact with each other.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________ (Your name) _________  I absolutely love this book and it's a must read for anyone who enjoys fantasy novels. I am an avid reader, and while I do like to read fantasy novels, I have to be content with just being a reader. However, I cannot lie and say that I haven't been wanting to read The Blade Itself for quite some time now. I got this book on a recommendation from a friend, and it was my first experience reading a book that I had no knowledge of. My friend has never read an original novel before and told me that this is the best book he has ever read. I was a bit skeptical at first, because as soon as I picked up the book, it was hard to put down. I have never seen a book get me so excited so fast, and I didn't get to finish it before I went to bed, because I was so caught up in the story. This story is a little slow at times, and at the same time it is very gripping. I love the romance aspect of the novel as well as the characters. I feel that I can relate to all of the characters, because all of us go through the same things in life. I think it's very easy to relate to the characters because they do have a life of their own. Even though the characters seem very much like real people, it is still very easy for me to relate because of the similarities between us. I don't know if you guys are familiar with a movie called Love, Actually. This movie was extremely touching and heartwarming, and the characters were really realistic. I loved the way that the author took that from the movie and used it in this book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a really good read. You won't be disappointed!

I am glad that i made the right choice. This book is wonderful. It is really funny and I love the characters. They are all so different and i'm always drawn in when the female characters say something or do something that is not expected from them. The writing style is also great. I loved the descriptions. You have some really descriptive lines and the characters are all very different. I was really interested in what will happen to them after the book is done but i'll just have to wait and see. I really liked the book but i had to wait for the end to read the whole thing because the book was long and it takes a while to finish.   Thanks again for sharing this great story.

As an American, I was surprised how much I had known about the spread of Islam all over Asia, but had never learned of the impact of Islam on the local culture. I feel now that I've learned a lot more about the local people than I had in previous years, even as a recent graduate from the University of Toronto. This book should be read by all those who care about global history. This author was very generous with her time and research. I hope she writes more books about different cultures.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "The book was interesting. Very well written, well researched, and it makes you think. A must read for anyone interested in the subject. It's worth every penny!"   Review by a reader:   This book is an interesting look at the life of Charles Manson, and a good read. While some have suggested that it is just a love story that should never be told, I think that this book is worth the price you pay. It was quite shocking reading about the real Charles Manson and what he did to people. It has been said that the only way the public will ever know what Charles Manson did to his victims is if his surviving victims speak out and let the world know what he truly did to them. This book certainly did not disappoint. I am extremely impressed with the research that went into writing this book. It is quite disturbing that this man did what he is being accused of.  I give the book 5 stars. It will make a great gift for a young or old reader, as it is a very compelling read.   What a horrible crime. I read it from start to finish. I just wanted to know what it is like to live and breathe with a monster like that. This is a great read for anybody who is interested in criminal justice, or the Manson case at all. .    About the author:  The book has been praised by many, and described as a "daunting look at one of America's most infamous cult leaders." It is the story of Charles "Tex" Watson, "the man who changed the world" and the life he led on the "killing spree of 1970. The book details the years Charles Manson lived in and around the San Francisco Bay Area, including his marriage to his "crazy" wife and his stints in jail for murder and rape. It also details the murder of his friend Susan Atkins in 1969, which led to a change in Manson and his beliefs, and also the arrest of his next intended victim, Susan Coleman. The story also details Manson's eventual conviction, and his years in prison, which included two escape attempts, a murder attempt, and prison escapes.  (This book was featured in "Lives in Dark Times", the New York Times Magazine, and the New Yorker.)   A great read!  From the first paragraph it was obvious that this was an important book for Manson. From the beginning the author, Jonathan Margolis, does a

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have found myself reading this book so often. This is a fun read. I've found myself with friends who have never read the bible before or have never been religious at all. It has brought us all closer to the truth and made us want to grow as people. This book has helped us all to have a deeper understanding of things, it has opened our eyes to the world and helped us see it for who it truly is. It may not be for everyone, but it will be a life changing experience for many. The book is written for people of all faiths, cultures and levels of understanding. I was so impressed with the level of research that this book did to go into different areas of religions and history. I had never heard of some of the areas in this book until I read about them. I would highly recommend this book for any person who wants to learn more about the Bible and religion. It is a real eye opener book that anyone can use. I recommend this for anyone who wants a good reading experience.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********** "It will change your life!"  I've been searching for answers for over a year about my health and weight. This book completely changes my opinion and the way I look at my weight. I am currently overweight and have struggled to lose it for years. There's always been this sense of guilt about it, and I always felt that it was wrong to eat what I wanted or think what I thought about how to lose weight. Now, I understand that this isn't the only way to lose fat, but I am more able to accept myself for who I am and not make excuses for my lack of success. I love this book and have made huge improvements in my diet and physical activity.  My only complaint is the author's grammar. I had to look it up in a few of the books I've purchased recently to understand what the author was saying.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I recently had the privilege to hear from the author in person and I must say it was an experience not to be missed! I've had an interest in music since I was a child but never took the time to really read about or study it. I just knew what was going on when I heard some kind of clap or clatter. While in college, I met a man with whom I had a profound conversation about music and had an epiphany that I needed to devote more time to learning about it. It was the same with my son. As he was growing into an adult, he was the first person I thought to bring up what I learned about music in high school. I didn't really know what to say but I wanted him to know what I had learned and what he could do. That conversation ended up with me learning much more about music than I had previously thought possible. My son is an amazing musician and has put that knowledge to use. I have also used his knowledge as a musician in the last few years. He was the one to explain to my son what I did for work and how he can make money from his music. I can't recommend this book enough and I encourage anyone interested in music to learn about it before it is too late!

Write a positive review about a good book:   "This is the real deal, a real must have for any serious student or researcher of the ancient Near East."  -David Devereux, author of "The Oxford History of Ancient Persia"  Review of an earlier copy:  This is a superb study of the Persian Empire. I especially like how it integrates the literature of the Near East with that of the classical Near East. It is a real pleasure to read, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has the slightest interest in this fascinating period of history. It should be compulsory reading in the libraries of all universities.  Book Description: . , an illustrated study of Persia, has been produced in English. Written by the leading authority in Persian studies, the book is divided into three distinct parts: Part I - The Rise and Decline of the Empire ; Part II - The Ancient and Medieval Periods of Persian History ; and Part III - A Study of the Persians as a People. Each of these three parts includes an extensive introduction to the subject material and a large number of appendices. Each part is illustrated with a series of black-and-white drawings illustrating key points of the text. The text is fully indexed. A unique feature is the fact that the book has been revised and updated for this English-language edition. This is a great resource for students and researchers of the history of Persia. It will be a favorite for students, but also has a place in the bibliography of any work dealing with the early history of Iran.

The title "Walking Dead" was chosen for the book, but really this is a story about the survival of humanity. While the survivors of an apocalypse seem to suffer from a loss of control, there are many moments of humor. The story of the zombie invasion is told in first person by a soldier who is a bit confused. The characters are all funny and unique.

Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________ I received my copy of "Guns, Germs and Steel" from the book club and loved it. I loved it so much that I purchased the paperback. If you want to understand human nature you need to read this book. It will change your outlook on life. I am a very pessimistic person, I believe in a lot of things that I know don't make sense. I believe the world was designed to make humans as miserable as possible and humans were designed to be selfish. I always thought that people had to be good to get ahead in life, that they had to make friends and do good to be accepted. "Gunning Up," and "Good Enough" and "How Not to be a Sociopath" all show that there is a different way to live your life and if it works for you then great, but this is not about me and the fact that it doesn't work for everyone does not mean that it is wrong. It just means I am different. I live a very peaceful life and love to write about it on my website and it shows in my work. I like to share with you my experiences and give you my advice, but I don't do it to give you bad advice. I do this so that you may become the person you want me to be when I write my next book. That is a big reason I am so passionate about this work. If I could make the world a better place, I would. If my book can change the world, it will make it a better one. Thank you, Gary K.

I have a pretty big passion for books, and I've been meaning to read a book by Mr. Balsamo for quite awhile now, but I've never had the chance. After reading this I'm glad I finally got to it. He brings so much joy to the reader, and the world he creates, and it was quite the experience. I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in science or a creative writing style.
Write a positive review about a good book:............................I loved this book.................................................   In the following review I describe my reaction to this book.   I was intrigued by the fact that this book deals with the life of Jesus. And I was interested in the fact, that there is no evidence for his existence. The fact that the early Christians did not believe in him did not prevent the fact of his existence; rather, it created the need to find him.   that, by the way, they would not have had a problem finding him, considering how thoroughly the early church was corrupt (in every possible way)   This is a must read.  .
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you enjoy this novel, I highly recommend giving it a try. There is an interesting plot and a lot of character development. The action, which is not always required for a good story, is very exciting.   Read it to see if you like it:   Good   There are some things which are not very original but they work. There are also some things that I didn't really like but which could be improved upon.  - This novel is set in the early 1980's in the south of the United States. There was a huge drug epidemic going on and the people who lived in the region were getting hurt by the drug trade. A lot of the people in the novel are addicts.   and in this novel the main character is not the drug dealer who the protagonist is trying to steal money from. This protagonist is a man who is in the drug business who knows he can't be a good dealer because he will get caught.  The main character does his best to help others who are addicts and to help himself. He goes through a lot in the course of the story.   the protagonist gets caught. he is tortured. he has his family hurt. his relationship with his girlfriend breaks down. and his family has to deal with his dead body.  He gets away from the drug game and gets clean. he saves his girlfriend from the brink of suicide. he helps a man get off drugs. he does all this very well. I feel that his character is realistic because it is not possible to be all things to all people. Some people are just not good at dealing with life's problems.     It would be better if the story was a bit longer and the protagonist had more depth. There were a couple of chapters where the story didn't have anything happening and didn't give much background information. This would be a better novel if it had a longer period. I think that there were two chapters that had a lot more information.  :I found the pacing of this novel to be slow. There wasn't a lot going on. I felt like there was a lot that needed to happen and that this story needed to have more time.  .

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________ My first thought on reading this book was I don't want to know what is happening to my kid or how long the kid is going to be here. I'm not going to bother asking, but I did look at the date it was written, and the book is out of copyright (1993). There is a lot of talk in this book about kids (mostly teenagers), and I didn't find it to be offensive or anything. I actually got a chuckle out of the story. The story is very similar to other books that I have read about teenagers who have gone missing, and I think it could apply to most teenage cases. I think this book would be very good for a teen to read for the first time if the family was looking for information.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________ is a very, very good read. It's a very realistic, moving, and beautiful book about one young man's search for peace and understanding with his father, who left him when he was a baby. I couldn't put it down and really enjoyed it. As I read it, I had to laugh several times, as I thought about the things my father did and said when I was growing up. It made me so proud to know my father had such an impact on me, and this book shows that he had. The writing is extremely good and well done.   It's a little sad how the book ended, but that's how it is. It was the most important and the most personal book I've ever read, and there's no way I was ever going to put it back down. I can't recommend it enough.  25 of 25 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book: *********** My father, father of many grandchildren, who lived to 93, used to take me with him to the library when I was in high school, and one day, on a rare occasion when he was too lazy to get up, I found a copy of "The Story of God and His Children" in the stacks. The story is simple yet moving: "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." That sounded simple, right? Well it's not. And God is not always present in the story. But you can't have a good story without good language, and in that there is a beauty in this book. I really enjoyed it, and I recommend it to anyone who loves history, religion, philosophy, or the study of literature.  "The Story" by Michael Drosnin is available in paperback and ebook editions at Amazon.com.
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- "In many ways, I think this is the most significant study of the mind and brain ever written. It may have a tendency to be a bit overly optimistic. But the book is extremely compelling." -David M. Buss "The theory that humans are hardwired for aggression and that the best way to control aggression is through rewards and punishment is quite compelling. It is hard to believe that the brain is so simple as to produce this. This is a good read" -Dwight T. Long "The brain is an amazingly complex organ and has a long history of evolution that no other animal seems to be able to match. This book is an outstanding introduction to the mind of an animal. The author does a fantastic job in explaining the brain" -Jeff Kuznekoff "The book is fascinating and well researched." -John K. Suls "It is a fantastic book. The information is presented in a non-technical manner and the author explains his ideas well. The book is not a layman's guidebook to the subject but a real treat for those interested in neuroscience, neuroscience in the animal kingdom, and brain and behavior." -Dr. Steven M. Simpson "A thorough and interesting book." -Michael J. Vasey
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* I recently purchased the book "Losing Your Virginity" by Rachel Kramer Bussel. When I first started reading it, I was in shock. I felt that I couldn't believe that a woman could say she wanted to be a "woman" and still want to be in a relationship with a man. I thought that she was just being silly. I just didn't understand how a man could still feel attracted to his own sex. I have been reading about the "man's" mind. That is one of the biggest flaws in the male mind. I was very surprised that even women wanted their man to have sex with them. This book made me think that men have no idea that the other sex even want them. It is a man's nature to be with a woman no matter how much she hates it or not even likes it. I will always love a man no matter what. I only wish that I would have read this book long before I married my wife. It really opened my eyes and reminded me of what love is all about.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "The thing about a story about a ghost and her haunted mansion is that you never know what to expect until you actually see it. In this case, we see a well-adjusted, successful person with a nice family and a good job go to a place like this, get all worked up about it, go away, come back with a camera, and get some amazing shots."   I would recommend this book. I hope that when she was dying she could see that her daughter is a good person with wonderful children, and that the pictures are not negative. I want to hear more stories of what her daughter was doing when she went to this place.   She also mentioned in her book that her sister was once at a house where a man had killed his wife and their two children, his sister's husband. This would have been a story I would have liked to hear.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  In the words of the author: "The world is in danger. Only the good can save it. This book will help you do that."   I was so pleased with the book that I read it over a couple of years ago, and it is still so relevant.   It reminds me of the importance of learning to write the first time. In the beginning, writing is something that's hard to do - it can be painful, and even downright embarrassing. And it can take so many hours. And that's where the "Good" in the title comes in. This is the kind of book that helps you to do something so easy that you forget how hard it is - and it's the kind that helps people to make a living at it.  /  Joan
Write a positive review about a good book:  This was one of my favorites. I feel it was quite good and well written. I do love the idea that an old man comes back and is just as strong as he was before he left. I read this because of the author's name, but it doesn't really add much to the story. The characters are kind of stereotypical (except for the mom) and the plot was kind of generic, but I don't think the author had a specific theme he was trying to push. There is a lot of violence, but some of it was really dark. I didn't understand why they were in there (if they were just for shock value) There were a lot more scenes of characters screaming or crying when I was reading, and I felt like that just didn't belong in a book for me. You have to really like your characters to enjoy this. Overall I enjoyed this book quite a bit, but the author could have done better. I liked it so much I ended up buying the next book in the series.
Write a positive review about a good book: Â I read the book about 20 minutes ago, and my opinion is already on record (see my review here ). I think the book is about as good as any book about a particular topic can be - and the author has made it easy and fun for you to do the same. And it isn't just your typical "How to do things in a new way" book - the author goes deep and is very clever, but still keeps it easy for you. I recommend this book and the new Kindle Unlimited subscriptions too.
Write a positive review about a good book:   "The story of the American Indian's struggle for freedom and justice is as old as history itself. The authors, Drs. Richard Wolcott and Stephen K. Nelson, have written a well written, detailed history of the U.S. Indian wars of the early 1800's, including the Trail of Tears and the Dakota Wars of the 1840's to 1860's. They bring the reader to the place where the events of these wars took place. While there are many good books about the Dakota wars, none have the historical background or depth provided by this book."

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I read this book during my senior year of high school because I was reading a similar book and I felt like I had something to contribute. I've read other reviews where someone said it was very depressing and I was shocked, but this book was not depressing to me at all. I was happy throughout the entire book and my enjoyment for the entire story didn't wane. It was the best book I have read in the past 6 years. There was never a time that I was sad. I really loved the story, which I feel is unique to the genre. I'm so glad I read it because now I have a clear mind of why I like books that have happy endings. Thank you, bookworming, for another great read. I can't wait to read the next one.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ Reviewer: _____ from India I liked this book. It is quite an insightful book on the subject of how a nation, or any nation, comes together to form a nation's identity.    It is important to note that many great thinkers from many different backgrounds contributed to the development of the ideas explored in this book, however it was H. L. Mencken, and Menckean philosophy, that was the driving force behind it.  It was Menckens ideas that motivated the writing of this book as Menckene wanted to know how one nation came together, and what would happen if it did not.  There are many ways in which this book can be used, but the primary objective is to provide a framework for thinking about the formation and maintenance of a nation.  If one understands the ideas of Menckenes, he will be able to see how nations come together to become the nations they are.  The ideas presented by Menckenhof are universal, and will apply to any group of people who are interested in how to form and maintain a nation that they are proud of.  I feel that if you are interested to see more of this type of book, I would recommend this one as it will be a good read, and the author clearly knows his subject and is clear in his writing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:.................................I'm very grateful that my friend, who is a big Star Wars fan, took the time to explain all the things about the series I had never heard before. And to be honest I knew very little about the Star Wars films. I know, I'm just a geek, but this book was awesome! I've only seen two of them, but they were absolutely phenomenal! I had the pleasure of watching the first, and I can't believe I've been missing out. This is an awesome movie, and they get the science correct. The Jedi are a group of people who train to do the job they've been given, but if you are willing to put the effort into it, then you can be a Jedi. I am extremely impressed with the way they made the different planets seem to be connected with each other. I just had to tell my friend and the author about it, because I love it so much!

The scenes in the book are very well done, and the author manages to do the best job at being able to convey the feelings of all the characters very well. The story was excellent and the ending was well done. This is one of those books where it is easy to relate to the characters. They are a family. A good family. I loved all the supporting characters. __________________________________________________ Have you ever read any great books and felt as if it was just too good? Or maybe you've just read them and felt that something went wrong. Either way, I find it very hard sometimes to explain my feelings for these kind of books.

This book is amazing and this is one book that I will be looking for in a future reread.  47 of 49 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am so glad that I read this book. I have been living with Lyme disease for two years now and have had no significant success at treating my symptoms with conventional medicine. I was a bit afraid that this book was going to be the cure for me, but I am so grateful that I actually found out what the truth was before I died and am on a treatment regimen that has been so successful for my wife. Thank you for putting all the information into one book that is clear, easy to understand, and easy to read. I can easily understand how a doctor could write such a flawed book, especially if he was under the delusion that his medications had no effect whatsoever. Thank goodness we can now read all the medical information, and learn what really happens and why we are so ill, and no longer have to live with the delusion of medicine! The book is a must read. The author has done a wonderful job in researching the illness and writing a clear and concise treatment plan that works for almost everyone. I would love to have a copy of the book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    One of the most inspiring books I have ever read. One of the biggest problems we as a community face are not being able to connect to each other in the right way. By being in touch with one another and sharing our feelings of anger and hurt I feel a great sense of belonging in a community that should be our home. By coming together to help others we are doing something to make a difference. By helping others we have a much more important conversation going on than most people have the chance to do. This is one of the first books that truly taught me what true empathy is all about. It is so important to understand how you feel and share your own. The information in this book helps me to be more understanding of others feelings. This book is a must read in all our lives.  2 of 2 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:.................................................. A book I would like to read is The Good War by William Manchester. Manchester is a man who does not want war. He is not a pacifist. He believes that if you can not win a war, then you should not make one, but he also does not advocate for war as an act of war. However, he does not tell the reader not to fight, but only to have a reason for fighting. The story is about a man named James R. Corbin who has served in Vietnam. James is a veteran. He went through all the horrors that are faced by the veterans in Vietnam, and he has been wounded. He has suffered a lot and has been tortured by war. This time, he finds himself in a village called Montagnard in Laos. This village was set up by the French for French soldiers to live and eat. They set up many hospitals, schools, restaurants, stores, and more. However the French were killed by the Pathet Lao who are Vietnamese communists and a big part of the book is their fight. James goes with a man by the name of Paul. Paul is also a veteran, but was never wounded in Vietnam and is able to walk and talk. He was able to get through Vietnam in the beginning, but is now living in a shelter for Vietnam veterans. Paul and James have an argument and the book turns into a war crime book. Paul finds out that James is living in the village where he was wounded in the war. When James finds out he goes to the village and sees that it is pretty much a village for French Vietnam veterans and a lot of French people are living there. The people are poor and starving. The village is set up so that all the men would be there. James tries to get a job. Paul tries to help him. In the end they have a little fight and James leaves. The rest of the novel is about James trying to get food and medicine to the villagers and how he deals with being in a community. The book is pretty good. It is funny and the characters are interesting. I like the book and I would recommend it to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good book:................................................. The Great War on the Eastern Front (1945) by David R. Smith By the time the U.S. entered World War II, the European theater of the Great War, including World War I, had lost a third of its troops (more than 2 million), but the Russian, German and Austro-Hungarian armies, on the eastern front, were on the verge of collapse, and the Germans had the largest military and industrial base in the world. In August of 1944, Soviet General Mikhail Tukhachevsky was appointed military governor of the eastern Ukrainian city of Vinnitsa, the heart of the German-inhabited region of the USSR that included Vinnit-Volynsky, Dnipropetrovsk and Chernihiv, all three Ukrainian regions. The city of Moscow had recently been liberated by the Red Army, and its citizens and troops were already being driven from Kiev to Moscow by the German army. General Tukhadensky, along with his staff, left for Vinnis-Vlynsky. The first step in the Soviet military offensive toward Moscow was to drive the German armies out of Ukraine. In September, the Ukrainian National Guard, with the support of the Red army and the UPA (Ukrainian Insurgent Army), recaptured Vinni-Vlodomysk, Chernihov, Dokuchishtovsk, Vynnytsya and Khmelnytskyi. The German armies suffered heavy casualties as they withdrew to the city of Minsk and other regions of western and central Russia. This victory was celebrated in Vinnistrovsk, but it was not followed by another victory. It was the first time that the Russians regained territory lost to the Germans during the Great Patriotic War. When Hitler's armies began withdrawing from the USSR, the Soviet government began to concentrate the military might of the UPUB (Ukranian United Workers' Party) and UPA forces in an attempt to regain the lost territories, and to defeat Hitler's advancing armies. By early 1945, the URA had already liberated most of the Ukrainian territories captured by the Nazis, and had driven Hitler's troops from the territories of the so-called "German Empire" in the east. It had also regained territory previously captured by German forces. General Dzerzhinsky, the head of the Communist Party, had recently returned from the front in Hungary, and he organized

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I have ever read. I was so impressed with it. I read it at least 5 times. If you don't know what your doing you need to read it. The stories are so realistic. There is even a story about a baby who was born with a birthmark that looks like a shark's tooth! I recommend this to anyone who likes reading and to anyone that has been through a breakup.  I will continue to read this book and I have recommended it to my friends and family.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I was so impressed by this book that I am going to write a review on it. I would give it five stars if possible. The story was compelling and the author is an excellent storyteller and a very good story teller. I can imagine that there are many other great books that are waiting to be written and then the author's writing is bound to be just as awesome. I highly recommend this book!Read full review
Write a positive review about a good book:   The new edition by D.M.C. is not quite as readable as the first edition (but the content is still the same), so I gave it a 4 star rating. There are some flaws, like some sections of the first book are a little too long, or there's some repetition, but the story is still good. I liked the fact that this was written by a woman and that women of color, especially African Americans, are important and well portrayed in the series. My only problem was that I wish she had continued with the characters of the series, especially when they are introduced to new readers (since, despite having only been around about a decade, their background and motivations are still unknown to most readers).   Overall, this is a good read for the fans of the original series. The changes in the plot and characters from book to book are not too distracting, and I think that it's really good that there's a new edition (the old one, written by her sister, was written before she took a sabbatical from writing).
Write a positive review about a good book: .5 stars. I had a good time reading this book, and I am glad that I gave it a try. I thought this book was good enough to be rated 5 stars, but I really enjoyed this book more than that. There is no real plot here. There are no "big" events or developments. It just kind of happens. The main character, James, does not really seem to think about what he does. I don't think that really is the way to go with a book like this. I liked the author's idea of "free will." That idea of freedom that seems to come with the idea of a self. .1 star. It was really hard to read the first part of this book. The author seems to be telling a story about a boy named "James," and then he starts telling a very complicated story about how James has been brought up and why he wants to be a doctor.   stars. The second half of the book does make much more sense. .5 stars.  stars. This was very enjoyable to read. The only problems I had were the little details I was not able to figure out and the confusing parts that I could not make out.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  I've got a friend who's a woman. He's in his mid-twenties, and he's always telling me how he's the greatest person ever. He just says he's so perfect that people are jealous of his perfectness. When I say he's perfect, he laughs it off and says I'm too serious. So I try to be more open-minded. Anyway, it seems that he's right about his self-esteem. Sometimes when I see someone who's really great, I try not to think about it too hard, because it makes me wonder how anyone else can live up to their potential. And the fact is that I'd like to think I can live my potential. That's what you all should strive for. That way if your potential sucks, you can always just live up."
Write a positive review about a good book:    "What makes this book so unique is that it's an account of the experiences of five individuals with ADHD - not just those with the diagnosis. The stories are also unique because they are not told by an academic, professional, or even a medical expert."   Read more  What makes the book so special?  - Unique account of experience of people with ADHD  (a common diagnosis that is often misdiagnosed and the only reason ADHD is given the stigma it does is because of the association with a diagnosis of schizophrenia)  "This book really does feel like you are there, meeting your characters."   the stories are not about academics, professionals or psychiatric experts - the stories tell about the people themselves and how they found their journey to self-discovery with their ADHD. I would say this book was very well written - the writing style was not "academic", it was just real. It is very personal and you know every aspect of their lives. I loved the way they presented it. I found the format to be very easy to read. The author really did a great job in explaining the subject and the experience of being a child with ADHD. You really get to know your main character and they do not give you a synopsis of their life - the reader is really left to connect to them and learn about them. The characters are real and they are just like us. You do not have to be a doctor or other such professional to understand their stories. The book is also very educational - you get to see the world through their eyes and experience what life is like for a child. The writing is very interesting and the story is very funny as it is told in the past tense. The story is told using a lot of humour and the characters have a unique way of explaining the things they do - this made me laugh out loud quite a few times. This book is very different from many other books on ADHD because it's not just the story of ADHD - it's about the journey of one character to find out themselves and learn to be the best person they can be and accept the things about themselves that they can't change. The way it is presented in this book really makes the story stand out from other books.   In a nutshell, this book is a wonderful book, and I would highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the only biography I will ever read that will make me feel a deep connection with my family history. I feel like I have been watching my mother for decades, listening to her tell me about all the sacrifices she made.  It's a wonderful, inspiring story and the photos give the real feel of how her home was. This book made me want to read more about my family and was also a great way to deal with the pain from my brother who has cancer. I was also fascinated by the fact that I was the first child to have two biological fathers. ________________________________________ ___________________________________
Write a positive review about a good book: _________   by Chris  I had never seen this movie, and had no idea what it was about. Well, I read it online. This book is about two friends who go camping with their dog. The weather is awful, and the two friends are about to have their dog die. Then one of the friends decides to go out and buy an umbrella.  The rest is really simple, and very funny. The two friends get married, have a kid, get divorced, then get back together.  in the last few pages the author explains that their lives are about the same, but that they have been through it and survived, so they have a special bond, which is something they never had before. - This book took a lot of my time because it was extremely funny and very realistic. - It was a good way to learn about living on the road in the mid-west.
Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________ I read this book in 2007. It's now 2013 and I can't tell you how well I enjoyed it. It was great from the very first page and the characters were so well drawn. I thought it was brilliant. I even had the time to think of ways to make it better. I didn't want the characters to end up in a dark room with a dead rat in their hands. But the ending was such that I couldn't help myself. It made me want to read more. It did have its flaws, and for a book of this length I think it could have used a little more depth. But for the most part I thought the story was wonderful and the ending so fitting. I recommend it to anyone. I'll see if I get any time off this week to read any more. If I do I'm just going to read some of the reviews.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________   "The world is changing but no one seems to notice."   This book makes you a better scientist by focusing on the fundamental questions and not the details of how things worked.   In fact, if you are looking for a good scientist book then this is not the book for you. I got it because I am working on a paper in a lab and want to write a paper for the class. I thought this book would be a good companion for my paper so I was excited to have it when I received it.  , it is not a very detailed science book, and it is a very easy read. It is more of a general overview. This is what I got out of the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book, the one i've read and loved so far, it is the story of one man in the 1950s, a black, gay man in Los Angeles.

I know that is not what you expect of a book about a homosexual, but this was not a "bad" book, it was an amazing one.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Book of the Beginning of the World by  Ivan Turgenev The Book is, without a doubt, the best book of Turgenev's life that I have read. It is definitely the greatest book of his life and the best novel of his work.  In addition to the book itself, I highly recommend reading the following book by Turgeni about it:  The Last Book of Túrin, by Ivan Turgenic It is also worth mentioning that the last novel of Tûrin was made into a movie in 2014. It can be bought on Amazon.com. The movie adaptation is a little hard to find, but it was one of the greatest movie I have ever seen. If you have seen it, you will probably not even know that the original novel had been translated into English. As I have said before, the book has been called the "Greatest of All Literature." Tûr's book is not the best of his writings and is, in my opinion, his weakest one. The reason being that it lacks the sense of life, drama, and suspense that his other works have. It lacks his style and his style in many ways. However, I still consider it a good novel.  I give it a 6.5/10.

You can buy the book from amazon or any other place. I only write reviews for my own pleasure.  . I would like to see more of this story in the series.

I also have to say that it has been an absolute treat to have such a good-sized library for the first time.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I can honestly say that this was a very well written, well edited book, with many references to interesting articles and historical events. I really enjoyed the way it was written and how it connected so well to the real world. I'd like to see a couple of more stories added to this book. One of my favorites was a story of a young, young lady who was killed by a "couple of cowboys." Another was a historical account of how women were able to make their way into the legal profession.   If you're into history, or if you're in the military and need some more information, and want to have a look at some women who have helped advance the nation, this book would be worth checking out.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book because it's about two siblings from two very different cultures who fall in love. The first thing that comes to mind when I heard about this book is the plot. It's not about romance and not about love. But rather about brother and sister trying to fit in and be accepted in the culture of their parents. The plot and the romance, oh my. I just absolutely loved it. It made me tear up when the brothers finally met for the first time. Then the story moved into a scene that was so beautifully written. And then the two brothers and their families were brought together. There was a scene where the brothers were walking down the road with their mom and dad and were just talking. And they were so happy to be with each other. It was so touching and heartfelt. And so beautiful. I couldn't stop reading it. I know some people may not like the fact that the brother had an abusive step-father. They will call it an abuse of the family, but I loved it and loved the fact of how they had to try so hard to love and accept each other because they were being treated horribly. Then when the sister got pregnant, her step-mother was so mad at her. She made her mother and her grandmother so mad. And she told her mom and grandmother how she would feel about the pregnancy if it were her own. And the grandmother, in her infinite wisdom, told her about the girl that was supposed to be their child. And her grandmother just said, "It's not your child, I know it." And it was so moving. The whole thing made me cry. And it made me think of the little boy that my mom told me about that she never said he was her child but rather he was just like her little brother that she grew up with. They just felt so close and so at peace. The brother and the sister finally get married. And you see how the relationship changes. And I don't think you would expect it because the two families are very different and each has their own story that goes on. But it was very sweet and made me realize how much this little boy in our life will always be our little brother and how he will forever grow up knowing the love and acceptance that I feel for him. The book's theme is about growing up and how to stay together when you're separated because people's minds are so often in different places when you grow up. I feel that this book can be

Write a positive review about a good book: Â The Road to Somewhere by Robert E. Howard. A short, fun read, a good time for all ages. - Robert E Howard  Thank you for the fantastic book! The author wrote a compelling and fun romp through the fantasy world of Conan the Barbarian. I loved the atmosphere of the book and can't wait to read more. This is a must for all fans of the Conan universe! - Patrick M. Paine  The Road to Something by Robert Howard  "A little over halfway through the tale, I found myself reaching for the old "Cabinet of Curiosities" which I have had hanging on the wall at home for years. A strange and wonderful world it was! The characters all seemed to have personalities and there was no "one" to root for. I could not help but feel that the story was written as a series of vignettes that came to a close in a "one more go." (I'm sorry that I didn't mention the humor or clever touches but these were quite evident. A great piece of science fiction that just might work as a standalone!) A short story, I'd recommend it to Conan fans of all ages." - Chris E.  A nice read. The book was short, yet rich in detail. This book was a pleasure to read. - John B. , The author is a very talented young writer, with a clear vision and excellent taste in a wide range of genres. His writing flows easily and quickly.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been looking for something on the subject of my love of Star Wars for a while now, and I just picked up Star Wars: The Fall of the Republic  and absolutely fell in love with it. It's the perfect jumping off point for anyone who is a big Star Wars fan. It is an in-depth look at the early years of the Star Wars universe. It features the prequel trilogy, plus some of the original movies and a few other films. The Fall is a beautiful look at how the galaxy got its name, what it's about, and a look at both the good and the bad that happened. The story is great, and the fact that this is a full length book about the history of the Galactic Republic is great. It will provide plenty of entertainment. A great read!

How?  Elizabeth Phelps — who wrote the books Dirty Snowball and A House for Mr. Biswas, and teaches psychology at Brooklyn College — says it's the combination of two dogs, two humans, and two cultures that make a Dirty Snowboarder (and the name, we believe, should reflect the sport's penchant for having fun). "For me, the dog and the dog owner are the most important," she says. "And the human is just as important, the interaction."  Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Elizabeth Phelps Courtesy of Liz Phelps  Phelps, who lives in Brooklyn, has done a lot of research on dogs and the human-dog connection.  Dogs have been used in various ways to help solve problems, she says: "Dogs can alert their humans when they hear a noise they're not expecting, they can be trained to do things they aren't used to doing, like going for a walk." (See what you're missing when you don't have your dog on a leash.)  And that's precisely what happened to Phelps's first dog, named Pippa: She was trained to search for lost things around the house. Phelps says Pipp a "hardy little thing," but also a "pretty goofy" dog who got excited over her own scent. Phelps remembers her own kids asking for the dog, because her dogs had "this really big-old-man-dog smell." .
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book to be a great read, and I thought I was going to be angry with the author (she was very aggressive). I wasn't angry at all because this book was a good read.  It was interesting to read about some of the methods used by the police when they were trying to arrest someone.   They were very thorough and very methodical and didn't make mistakes.  They were also extremely strict and extremely polite.   I enjoyed reading this book because it provided a very different perspective from how I think the police operate in general.  I am glad I read this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:!!! (review of free book)  By Sohag on January 28, 2016 Was this helpful? Yes No (0)  is this book helpful? Was this book useful? Yes (0), No (1), Meh (0). Was this review helpful?  It is a collection of short stories that all relate to one another.  There is a good story in every story, which makes it feel cohesive.  and it is easy to read.    As a short story writer, there is nothing better than a story that you feel you can write. I found this collection to be that. .  a story in here for every reader, it is all there for every story.   If I could write like this all day everyday, I would.   the characters are realistic and engaging, even the very young ones.  to me, the stories feel like they could all have been written by my child.   it was very easy to follow my child's words and actions as they did not have to have to explain what was going on for the reader. they were so aware of how they were perceived by other people. it made for really fun reading.     this collection was a great idea, but I did find one or two stories to be somewhat lacking.  .

Write a positive review about a good book:............................M.C.R. I bought this book as a Christmas gift for my son, who had a hard time finding an easy to read book to read with him in bed. This book was exactly what my son needed. It's got his favorite characters in it, and he loves it so much that he wants to read it again and again. I think the book needs to have a few more pictures, but I think that was the only thing I was missing. :) Thank you very much for writing this book! I will use it in every book I read to help my son understand some of the difficult situations he faces in our house. Thank you for a great book. This is truly a great and enjoyable read!.....................................................I LOVE LOVE LOVE this book, it's got my son and I so engrossed in it I have to pause it twice to catch my breath, we both know he's gonna LOVE it! Thank you so much for making it available! I'm sure I'll be using this book to teach my boys, and I know they'll LOVE it too! Thanks for the GREAT book!!!!..............................D.W. I had always heard the book "the best book you will read all year" was about an airplane accident, but as I was reading it I thought to myself, "how many other airplanes do they have to write about? How many books can one family read at the same time?" My son was absolutely delighted with this book; he kept saying that the best part of the book was the last one where everyone was telling the other to go on to the next page, but he kept turning around to look at the other page. I could not put it down! The illustrations were really great as well. It has an engaging story line and I loved it! It's funny and funny to think that people are writing about airplanes. It was so funny how all the things my son kept asking to read are also mentioned in this book. I thought I would write a positive reviewer about this book because the only way to learn about the other stories is by reading them. The only problem I had with this was the book is a little difficult to read................................F.J. I am a parent to five wonderful little girls and I think this book will make them happy. I used it in our first grade class to read along with them on a plane ride.

Write a positive review about a good book:   . I've recently picked up a copy of the new Star Wars film for Christmas and was really impressed. I didn't buy the Blu-ray at the cinema (I already have a copy) so was really pleased with the value of this version.   The story is very well told and the characters are all well drawn. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was excellent. I felt like the characters were believable. The book is written in an engaging and enjoyable way. This book has many elements that I would enjoy reading about as well as several different characters. It would be interesting to hear a different story in this book from a different perspective. This is a good fantasy book and a must have for any fantasy lovers.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********** I found this book quite interesting and entertaining, and the ending was quite nice. The characters were well-drawn and the story had a great pace and a great sense of direction.  Novel Updates: 4 (out of 5)  Novellas: 1  Short stories: 0  Poetry: 0 (the story itself is not poetry, but the fact that it is set in a fantasy world makes it, as far as i can tell, a very good example of the genre)    Reviews from the Reviewers:   "This book is the definition of 'gorgeous'."   --Katherine J. Martin   I enjoyed this book, it had a good plot, and great characters. This is not a romance by any stretch of the imagination, but it had great romance in it.   -Karen R. Stanger   For those who read my other reviews, I highly recommend this one to you! I've had the pleasure of reading this book (read it before, too) many times, and enjoyed it as well.    of course, this is an excellent collection of a variety of stories, and it's an excellent way to get into a fantasy genre that many people may be unfamiliar with. The quality of the writing is pretty good, though I think that the "magic system" that a lot of the authors use is pretty gimmicky, which made for a somewhat boring reading experience. The worldbuilding of the various continents was well done, and there were many interesting characters and some excellent stories here as well, even for an anthology.   "One of the best fantasy anthology collections I have ever read! If you love fantasy, you'll love this book!"   It is hard to recommend this book to a newcomer to the genre. It does have a few stories that are definitely stand-out stories. If you want more of that feel-good stuff, there are a lot more stand-alone books. However, if you are a fan of fantasy with a dose of romance, this collection is a great way to try a variety and find what you like.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great introduction to quantum mechanics. The author goes into the history of quantum mechanics and how it came to be and gives a great overview on what a quantum is. He also tells of quantum physics at the macroscopic level and explains how the energy levels are calculated and related to the energy of particles. He goes in depth with the problem of measuring a particle's energy by using quantum entanglement. I would also recommend reading about the double slit experiment.   Overall a great book and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys science.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I read this for the first time last night and I am thoroughly enjoying it. It is well-written and the character development is a lot more than the average romance. I especially liked the story about the brother and sister's attempt to reconnect. It's the only romance in this book that was realistic and it felt real."

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this in 2009, and it was the first book I read about the occult. It took some time for me to actually get a grasp on what it was all about, but it was worth it, and I am now more connected to the occult than I have ever been before.  When I first read this book, I was already convinced it was a good read. I am not entirely sure how I ended up with it in my collection, as I read it in May of 2009, but I have since then read it again and again, and still enjoy it to this day.  This is a good, interesting, and informative read, and a great introduction to the "occult" as well as a good example of how to approach the subject of the "curse".  The reason I chose this particular title is because the story of the witch "Gisela" as told in this book is very reminiscent of one of the main characters in my current series, "The Witch of the Weald" -- both are from a different time, and both have had a very interesting journey.   It is not just one woman who has a curse on her, or even two. It is a curse that goes way back, and affects not just women, but the men too, in a way that is almost as powerful as if it was malevolent.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ My friend lent me this book and I loved it. It's funny, it's light hearted, it has a lot of humor in it, but it's still a book about two brothers that are in love with each other. They make an effort at being together but it does take them a few books to even get past the awkwardness. I felt like I was in a different book with my brother because it felt like we were always in each other's company when we were with the other.   And then my brother told me about the time that he found his girlfriend's brother's diary. It was in the book and he read it when he was in college.  I thought the book was funny and the humor was great!   But then I was on a subway one morning and my brother yelled at me so loudly that it scared me.  When he yelled at my brother that morning I felt so bad for him that I wanted to cry, but I could not.  If my brother had known that I loved and cared for him so much I would have let him go.   A good book to read to your friend or family member. 
Write a positive review about a good book: Â It is a very well researched and well written book on the history of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (or IRA) from 1913 to the present day. I read the entire book in just a few hours and it left me with a great deal of appreciation for the Irish revolutionaries and the men who fought and sacrificed so much to bring us this freedom. I also want to express my gratitude to Professor Peter Fagan for allowing us to reproduce one of the original photos taken by him in his book.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- I bought this book because it was in a used bookstore. I found it quite interesting, although I have heard of this book before. Although not my favorite book by Joyce Carol Oates, this book is very enjoyable. It is about her life growing up and the problems she has experienced. I liked it because of all the good parts. It has a lot of action and drama. I hope that I will like the next book in the series, because I really liked this one. I recommend it to anyone who likes life stories, and wants to read about a real person. -------------------------

I'm a huge fan of the author, who I believe is the very first author to be born in Florida and lived and worked in the area for over twenty years.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I love this book and my children love this game. My son loves the music. I love how the book is simple to understand. I will recommend this to all my friends and families.  My daughter has already played it and she is asking to play it again, so I bought it for her too!  I was glad I purchased it to share it with my daughter for her birthday. She had a lot of fun and is now asking for another game to play.    My son is so addicted to this game I have to buy it every week so he will not have to waste his money on other stuff.   The games are fun and the fun is in the learning for my kids.   on a more serious note, when I played with my children there were no complaints from the children. they are excited to play and I have even bought them a few games. I know for a fact that it is not only them that are enjoying this game but I am excited about what my kids will be able to learn with it.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- It's really amazing to me how the author could find the time and the money to write such a great book about a topic that he/she knows so much about, and how it was written so beautifully.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________  It has always been a dream of mine to be a full time author. I used to read from the library, but with the huge increase in print material and internet, the library stopped carrying my books and the internet has made it harder for me to find the time.   My hope was that with the help of friends I could get my stories published so I would not have to put in all the work it takes to write a book. I was given a lot of encouragement, but now that the dream is dead in my hand, I'm at a loss for what to do. I need to work as a writer, and I'm not going to do it by putting my stories into magazines or online magazines. I've been able to write and publish a few pieces, but no big, best selling pieces, so that's the last thing I want to do...so please, anyone who knows me, help me out!

I also really like the 'how to' section. The writing style is excellent and I feel the book is very well written." --Jennifer  This is a good way to learn freelancing. It explains many different aspects of freelancing in a simple way. The book is great for both those who want to be in the industry and those who are new to the freelancing industry. It's a great place to start if you're looking for the basics. This book is more focused on the concepts than the techniques in it. It is written in a way that will appeal to the non-experienced freelancer or the more experienced freelancer but anyone who is thinking about becoming a freelancing freelancer will find something useful here. I definitely recommend this book for anyone who wants to improve or learn the fundamentals of freelancer, i.e. the ways to manage your own time, finances, relationships, your business, etc. I feel like I would really benefit from this book even if I wasn't a freelancers, I highly recommend it.  -Cindy C  What a fantastic resource for freelancers.

I've always wanted to be more of a writer. This is a great resource. I love it!  My biggest takeaway from the book was that in order to be successful as a writer, you need to have a strong work ethic and a positive mindset. I really enjoyed the book and feel like the information it provided was extremely valuable. I will definitely use this in the future when trying to
Write a positive review about a good book:    An extremely detailed and realistic picture of life in a concentration camp.   I read this book as a child and it was very disturbing for me. I think that this book is very honest and a very accurate picture of what life was like during the Holocaust.  I am still a bit upset about the treatment of Jewish people by the Germans and have had some mixed feelings about it, and this book shows that even the most hardened Nazi can be swayed by love, kindness, and compassion.

Write a positive review about a good book:  When I was a kid, my mother read to us several times a day. At the time, it wasn't too bad. I was the only kid who cried a lot, so the stories were pretty entertaining. Since then, I've gone through quite a few books, and there have been some good ones. This is not one of them. The author describes a fantasy world that resembles our world, but with magic. It all looks normal and there is no reason to believe that it isn't, so no real reason to keep reading. There are also no good people in it and it seems like there are many more bad ones than good ones (though the good ones don't seem to really care about the bad ones at all). I will give this book three stars for the story and for the characters. I just wish the author had spent more time trying to make things more interesting than she did, so that they would have something interesting about them. I will probably stop reading this book before the next time she writes it.

Write a positive review about a good book:....................................................... My first exposure to Kabbalah was on a trip to England. I was a good friend of a person who was working on the internet and she brought this book with her. My first reaction was that I'd heard a lot of good things about it, so I bought it. This is one of those books you've heard a great deal about but never really read - so it's nice to read it all together. This book was very easy to get through and made me really think about what I thought I knew. A couple of the books were a little technical for me, but as the author says, they are the basics - as a spiritual author you have to make the basics as simple as possible so they are understood. It's not the kind of book where it's all just "I've got it" so I would have liked to have had more of a tutorial section in it as it felt a little dry, but other than that it was easy to understand and interesting to go through. Kabbala has been around a long time but it's now becoming much more popular. As far as it's possible to tell, this is a great book and I'll be keeping it as a reference - for anyone who wants to be better informed.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "a very good read. I had heard it was hard to find and the story was very well written, but I couldn't believe how well the characters were developed and how well-done the prose was. I also love the fact that the book uses many different perspectives. It is also a little slow to get going (it's not a trilogy or anything, so it's a little confusing). But that is just the point. After reading it you'll be hooked, and then it will slowly, but surely, get more and more awesome. "I'll definitely be buying the next book in the series! I loved it!"

But at least I don`t care about the story of the Familiar. The second book is about one of the characters which the characters of the first one. I donâ¦t know why I like it or don't like it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I received the audiobook version of this in a bundle from Audible as part of a monthly program at the library. I was blown away by the presentation of the narration. The narrator is amazing and the narration is natural and is not clunky. There are times during the course of reading this book where it's not clear who is speaking. But if you have a strong ear for a deep voice then you will find yourself in the story more than once.   If you are looking for a good fantasy novel, but don't want to spend $30-100 on books, then I highly recommend this audiobook. This is a unique sounding story that you won't find anywhere else. This book was worth every penny and I can't wait to listen to the sequel to this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    -The book is fun and easy to read.   The only problem with the book is that I don't feel like the author gives a proper background on how the technology is actually working. There are a lot of technical details in the book and I think that it would have been helpful if he would've given more details on how these systems actually work and why are they so important. Also, at least for the most part, it would be great if he'd given us a picture of the world that has been invented, and even the people behind the technology. But he didn't, so I'm pretty sure it's because the main idea is interesting enough that the author didn't have to be super detailed to make the world and the technology stand out.  , a very good book about this technology and how it was created. I really liked this book because it gives you all the details that you need to learn the technology and why it is so important to have it in our everyday lives. It's definitely worth the read. The book is very detailed about all the steps and technology behind this kind of a system. I think the author gave a good overview of how all this technology was created and how the people who created it feel about it. I like to think that he was very inspired by his personal history and how this technology started and how people use it.The only bad thing I found about this book was that the chapter on how it started wasn't very complete. It only goes through the first two generations of this technology. If you look at the first three generations of computers, it goes through each generation of that technology. I found that it kind of left you off until the end of the story to get all the technology behind the world so you don't get bored by the beginning. But overall, the book was really great and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who's interested in this kind.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________ "I was a little bit hesitant to read this but when I decided to, I am glad I did. I think the best thing about the book is that there are a number of different ways to read it. One thing I would like to see is how the authors would have dealt with the various religious groups the story deals with. For example the Zoroastrian religion is presented as being very patriarchal and oppressive. I can't help but feel that was not the case and I don't think it would have been handled in a way that would have appealed to a wider audience."  Good read but some flaws:  "As someone who is a practicing Christian, I would say the book would have benefited from being slightly shorter, which I do not mean as a slight against it, rather it would probably be easier to follow if the author had trimmed a couple of pages here and there. It's a good read, if you are a Christian it is going to be easier for you to follow than if you aren't a Christian, but I can see why people who aren't would find it difficult."  I love how he brings the religions in the book into the discussion and how he takes a look at what they say and how they operate on the world. I really loved this book and highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in the different religions out there.

Write a positive review about a good book:    If you've found yourself in a book with a lot of potential and haven't yet read it, I'd highly recommend it to you. It's well written and well thought out, and the prose is interesting. It isn't a fantasy, but a mystery/suspense. That's a hard sell for a lot (if not all) readers, but it was handled very well.   The book is set in a small and secluded community of woods which has a reputation for a deadly and elusive serial killer who's been terrorizing the locals for decades. The killer has been dead for the past 10 years and there is no sign of him around. His victims, a young boy, a teenager, and a girl (who goes by the name Ane) were found dead in the same manner: dead of strangulation, with no signs of the killer in their body. As a group of young adults, the four of them set off to solve the mystery of who killed them, and what exactly the woodsman was up to. This is a fast-paced story, and it doesn't shy away from gore or sex, although I wish they were a bit more subtle in the book, and some of the murders are a bit excessive. If you love thrillers and mysteries, then this is definitely one for you. If not, then don't waste your time!   This book is not just a crime novel, there's a lot more going on, and although the details might be sparse and small, they are still intriguing. The characters are well drawn, and you care for them deeply and empathize with them despite the dark nature of the crimes they are investigating. The story itself is a good one, and I look forward to seeing what happens next!

I do, however, feel more ready than ever to go it alone on a book.

I recommend it highly to people who appreciate long works.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "This is a fascinating book, written by a man who is not afraid to be himself." -Paul Auster This book is full of great examples of how a good story is often the result of a brilliant combination of words and ideas. The story is set in the present, but the characters are so well developed and the plot so entertaining, it never feels like you are being cheated by modern technology, instead it feels like a really good read, and that a real story could only be the result. One of the things that I have enjoyed more and more from Auster's work is the ability to tell a story by using the old language of the past. The language is sometimes clumsy and in some places not at all logical, but what a wonderful way to tell the story. I was reading this when I saw a post on this blog from a woman who said she was reading A Long Way from Home on her Kindle and really enjoyed it. I thought to myself "what a great book" and asked her if she thought it could also be read on a Kindle? It was a nice compliment.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________I have purchased my copy of The Black Swan and can honestly say that I am very happy with it. This book is an amazing book. The story is beautiful and the characters are amazing. I feel that it could very well be a major Hollywood movie someday (if only it were released on DVD.) The book is also well-written. I do feel that the book takes a bit longer to read than some of the other popular books that are on the market but, in my opinion, this book is worth the read. This is an excellent book to read if you have a passion for psychology and/or economics. The author has created a compelling story that you cannot put down.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a joy to read. The author is so good in telling the story of her life, and also to show us the different aspects of her personal and professional life. I find her writing very personal, and I really love this. It was really fun to read this book and I learned a lot, and had a lot of fun. This book is also funny, but not just about her, it is about how her life is. It made me laugh, but it was funny, not because of this story, but about the way it was written. It has some funny parts, but there are also some very serious moments in this book that made my heart beat faster. I loved this book.   My Rating: 4 out of 5 Stars   Book Description from Amazon   Mariann has been struggling to have a baby ever since her second marriage ended, but is still fighting the odds. Her husband of two decades is now divorced, and she knows she needs a younger man.  ....   She had a husband, Michael, who was always there for her. But his retirement and death from cancer put Mariann and Michael's marriage at risk. But Mariann's health deteriorated and she began to go into seizures and fainting spells. By the time Michael was able to take her to the emergency room, she had lost two of her babies.  ,   In this heartbreaking account of her long struggle with infertility and loss of her first child, Mariann recounts her struggle to conceive, the many medical tests she underwent, her failed pregnancies, her painful childbirth, her heartbreaking pregnancy with her second child, her emotional and physical recovery, the shock of learning that the father of her third child is not the father she hoped, and her long search for a viable child.     With a story as beautiful as this, and a life as inspiring as Mariann, the author makes the reader laugh, cry, and leave the room with a great feeling of satisfaction and joy.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have tried many times to read this book, but always end up not finishing it, due to the length and the constant bickering between the siblings. What was good about it, was the fact that it's one of those "how can I use this to my advantage" books, which could give the kids an idea on how to act with others. The fact that we have so many siblings that are so different in personality, that makes the book easy to understand for us. Even the other siblings have to adapt and change their way of acting if they are to win over their brother/sister. My 5 year old son loves it.

"...the book was well written, the characters were believable, and the storyline was entertaining."   not too long to read  I really enjoyed reading this book, and I think that if the author can get his characters to feel like real people (rather than a series of names and numbers) and that he can also make them feel like they have personalities that would not be out of place in their real world environment, I am sure that the book will make me want to read more. I had read many stories in the genre, but none of them ever made me feel like I was in the characters' head. I also really enjoyed how the author made the characters look different than what you would expect from fantasy novels, especially when they are described as not being what you might expect from a typical male or female from the modern world.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- * This book is a good one. * I think there was an error in the first part and it was corrected by the third part. * You need to do a little editing to a couple of scenes. * Overall, it's a good short story.  What do you get for the low price of $3.99?   A short story, about 5 minutes in length, with a cover similar to a Star Trek episode.   The cover shows a starship, which has a small light on the side. The light is red and it is in the middle of the starship.   I would say it is Star Trek related.

Write a positive review about a good book: **********   "Mushnik is a fascinating story about his life on both sides of the war. It is a touching book, both for those who were close to him during his service and for those that never were. The story of how they came to be in touch is a good one, not to be missed." -- The Boston Globe   For many years I've enjoyed reading the work of Dr. Henry M. Stanley. In his books, he has captured the emotions of the great men of American history -- from Thomas Jefferson and John Adams to Robert E. Lee and Grant. Now his new work, Mushnik: A Soldier's Life, is a story as interesting and moving as it is instructive, from the Revolutionary War to the Korean War to Vietnam. Mushnik is the story of a young infantryman and the man he was in the heart of the conflict.   His story begins with the outbreak of the Revolutionary Wars in 1777, with the defeat of King George III and the creation of a new country, the United States. In the course of the following years, Mushkin was raised from youth to adulthood by British soldiers and sailors. He lived and served in Virginia, the Carolinas, New York and New Jersey before the Revolutionary Army was deployed to France in 1781.   a soldier's life  Mushkin's life was defined by the war itself. It began at the beginning with the loss of his father at age sixteen and continued with the terrible defeat of the British at Saratoga in 1776. The Americans won the war, and Mushkin's heart was at last broken and at peace. Mushkin left his army and moved home to Philadelphia, to try to forget the horrors of his experience. He married a woman he met in Philadelphia and had three children. A few years later, his wife died. Mushkins was left to care for his children alone.  , Mushkins' only son was sent to England. His two daughters, the only ones who lived to adulthood, were sent to Europe, to marry. Mushki married a man in a neighboring village, an elderly farmer. In 1791, the American army was disbanded, and the farmer returned to his land. Mushnick decided to make the move to New York, as the army would no longer be needed. He started working on a farm and soon became a farmer. It was there that he met his great love, Rebecca. While Mushnik struggled to support the
Write a positive review about a good book:.........................................   This book, like most of those published by a new self-publishing house, is a nice, well-written story. I found it very easy to read. There were a few errors that I am sure were due to the novice of the author. The author seems to have a good handle on her characters and their personalities. She knows how to develop them, and I was interested enough in her characters that I was not bored with them. The story has a very good feel to it, but I have to admit that it could use some polish. I did read the first two pages of this book several times while writing this review, trying to get a feel for the pacing and writing style of the story. But even then, it was not that important in my mind because it felt pretty easy to follow.  I wish the author would have written a little more about the characters and the conflict with the Church. While it did not come out of the blue, it did come out from the background of the novel, and the Church characters could have developed a little in that regard. -D.R.   My wife and I love the LDS Church. We are not active. But in spite of that we really enjoy and support the Church as much as possible. I was excited when I found this book because of the theme about faith and love. I have always liked this type of story, and this one is just beautiful. I just hope she doesn't start telling more about church and its members. (I didn't like the whole "we have to be obedient to all those stupid laws" thing.)
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. I am really impressed with how the author describes her life. Her father was a minister, so her family has had to deal with a lot of negativity as children, but she managed to rise above. Her mother is a professional writer and has always been a big influence in her life, and so too is her husband who has been an excellent step-father for her. I love the way her husband was described and how he kept her grounded and grounded her. The story is written well and she is relatable. It is difficult to read about someone as negative as this and not like her, but when I read about my family in my early teens I was the same way. I felt so much of the same feelings, and it's such a relief to read a book that gives a person like this the recognition and love she deserves. It also goes to show how important it is to be an ally, especially with someone who has the same issues as you.    Read an unfavorable review:  When I first started reading the book I was disappointed to find that it was mostly based on stories that my mother had told to my mother. It didn't seem to make sense or fit into the book's overall theme. And it seems that some of the book is based on other people's accounts as well. It would have been nice to hear the person's perspective and not have it filtered through my mother, and also the narrator herself seemed to exaggerate a lot. I was really disappointed that the story didn't feel as true to the narrator's family as it did to her own.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The New Science of The Body by Bruce Lipton - I bought this book after watching the video above, and while it doesn't answer all of my questions about my own body it gives a much better framework to explain how your body works. I had a hard time with it at first, but I got into it and really got a good understanding of it and how to work around it and not have to spend so much time worrying about it. It will help you feel more in control of your own body. I highly recommend it if you are a woman who is just starting to learn about her body. It's very easy to read and very thorough.

It gives an excellent insight into all the basic ideas that make up the foundations of physics as we know it. It's just a little hard to grasp if you are new to the subject, as the book does cover some very abstract ideas and concepts, but it is well written enough to give the reader a good idea of what they are about to embark on.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________ Thank you for reading it. This is a great book about overcoming the struggles of depression. This book explains and tells how you can overcome depression and anxiety. This really helped me. The first time I read this book, I didn't believe it, because all I know is what I've read and experienced. But I felt it on my mind for a few days and now, I'm sure that I'm going to be a better person. I have to start trying to make myself believe that it's real because I haven't been able to for a long time. I will say that it was very hard to read, but I had to. I really appreciated this book and will continue to read it as often as I need to.  2 of 2 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have enjoyed all of this book so far and I am a little surprised that it is so short.  It is short because it is not a good story but it is short in the sense that I would recommend that you read this book if you enjoy books on science, physics, history, geography or something to that kind of thing.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Black Flame (Praise The Sun) by John Scalzi "This is the kind of book that every SF reader should read." I read this book back in 2009 and it changed my world forever. I have to confess I was pretty skeptical about a story set on a spaceship with multiple time streams, an intergalactic war and a mind-reading, alien-killing computer. It is a fantastic premise and one I've thought about doing something similar to on the ship USS Vengeance. I was even more dubious when the first three or four chapters read like a generic sci-fi novel. As I was going through it again I couldn't help but notice I hadn't really considered the idea of different time streams. The book's story is fairly well told. You don't need to think too much about the specifics of the book, except to recognize the basic premise and the main characters, and that it is set in the year 2373, the future version of our world. You'll understand things as it unfolds and the story gets moving pretty well on its own. The characters are very well developed. They're interesting and well drawn, and you'll be interested in their lives and the lives of other characters. The ending is a bit odd. For some reason, I think I just wanted it to be different, but I'll be darned if it isn't interesting!  "Don't bother reading the reviews. You already know what to think." "Praise the Sun"  I have been reading this book for about a year and I really enjoy it. It has a fantastic set up and a great twist at the end of the story. I highly recommend this book!

Write a positive review about a good book:  this one is the book for someone who has seen the light and wants to go to that dark side.

Write a positive review about a good book:............................John Brown's Body by Tim Ferriss  I enjoyed John Brown's body so much I thought I would read the whole book in a single night. Tim Ferrass has written a book about being overweight, yet also has a book that I'd recommend if you are fat and want to find a healthy way to get there. It's well written, fun to read, and it will provide you with the resources you need. It is also highly motivating and will make you want to make changes to better your life. I recommend it to anyone who wants to be healthier and is overweight or obese. I hope they make more books like this. I'm in my 60's and have a great relationship with my mom. I used to be a very overweight child, I had the hots for my older sister and my mom gave me a bunch of toys and a car every Christmas so I wouldn't get fat.   It's funny to me that my mom, who has been a professional and has worked with a lot of very wealthy people, is the only one in my life that still doesn't know how to change my lifestyle. She still has a lot to learn about weight loss and how to give me the right tools to make the change I want to. Thanks Mom.
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- A great story of a young woman trying to fit in.   I've read a lot of books with a lot more sex scenes than this one, but the sex scenes here are really well done and not too fast paced, there's a lot going on and it's easy to follow. I do wish that more of the book wasn't spent on her trying to become part of the world she lives in and her friends but it would have been too slow to follow if she didn't. She's still trying to figure out who she is and what she wants from this world she's now living in. I wish that there was a bit more focus on her struggles to understand her situation before getting to that part, because it could be a little easier.   in a lot, the sex in this book was hot and enjoyable to read and if the plot had been more of a focus, this could have been a very good story. I am also a big fan of books where the main characters are in love with each other but then break up and they end up having a lot sex in the last few chapters. It's a good idea if done well.  .

Write a positive review about a good book:   You will laugh, you will cry, you'll learn a lot and most of all YOU WILL FEEL BETTER. I really, really recommend this book. It's one of my favorite books ever.   It's so wonderful. It is easy to read and a great, funny read. The pictures are brilliant and the author knows what a perfect way to bring this story to life and make it exciting to read! The author knows how to write! I would like to tell you that it is a perfect book for someone like me who loves to read fantasy and sci-fi but is also likes to read about different people's stories. I love to read books from different places and cultures, and I always feel that if I read a book by a character from a book I read in my youth, that it will be a wonderful and enjoyable read.  , but it's not a book to read just because you love reading about different cultures and stories. This book is a fun read because the story follows a young man who is having trouble finding a girlfriend, and as a result of this, he and his father get into an argument. However, the reader does not see this as a "battles" between them. No, this is a long and painful story about how a young boy is growing up, and learning to accept his father and the way his father sees things as a way to help the boy grow up to be an "older" man. It also teaches a lesson about how to love someone, not just because they are your father, but because they love you. The story is funny and it's a beautiful story that is told in a beautiful manner. It isn't perfect, but if you are looking for a good read about growing up and accepting yourself for being different, this book is for you.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "If you're looking for a good read to relax and relax you, read the book by yourself and don't try to put it in a public library in order to find other people like you."   From the outside, I was skeptical that this book would be any good. When I first opened the book, I immediately thought it was a very bad copy of the movie, and my first thought when reading it was "well, I guess this is the reason for that bad movie". What I found was the story was good, the characters were good, and the plot was good. The one thing that really bothered me though was that the ending was a bit rushed and it felt kind of rushed. But, I also liked that it felt a bit more satisfying than most of the stories I've read in the past.
Write a positive review about a good book: ***********"This is a great book, an excellent introduction to the history and culture of African American music." ********* This book has a wealth of information about African American musicians and their influences, but it is not a scholarly text (the only text it is comparable to is "The Great Gatsby", by F. Scott Fitzgerald). It covers a wide range of African music, from the old to the new, from jazz to classical. The author covers African American musical forms such as R&B to rock, and even mentions some non-African forms. The first half of the book covers the life and work of R& B star, Marvin Gaye, from his early days of being a drummer in a gospel band to the rise of his solo career. The second half of this book covers jazz and it's more recent music forms, from Charlie Parker to Prince, from Ella Fitzgerald to Stevie Wonder. I've just finished reading the book and it is well written. The authors have done a fantastic job of compiling all of the different sources and putting it all together for the reader. While the authors did not delve too deeply into the history of African-American music, they have taken the time to discuss the different forms that are played today. This book is a fascinating read, it really explains and gives a good view of how African American artists have influenced the music and music styles that exist today. It is easy to read and an entertaining read.

You can't get more comprehensive and up to date than that!"   - James M. Davis   The Best Book on the History of the World - David L. Allen  - "The history of our planet is still being written."   David L. Anderson   A great book about our planet - Tim L. Hine   This book covers the past, present and future of the human race. The authors explain the origins of the races that have gone before us. They offer us insights into the various cultures in their respective histories. The writers even go into some detail about the many religions that were in operation at the time. What they have to say about these religions is intriguing, especially when you consider that the earth was discovered by the ancient Egyptians. This book gives us a window into our past and a look into our future. It also goes into great detail on the world's religions and the great leaders who have led them. It gives us an insight into our ancestors and the culture they came from. It explains many different civilizations throughout history. It has a broad perspective. It takes a look at all the different races and cultures throughout the world. It even has references to our history in space. This makes the book an informative and valuable reference. The book covers history from ancient times to the present. It is divided into two main sections, one on the Ancient World and the other on the Present. The Ancient World section discusses the major civilizations of the past and the people and things that lived in those civilizations. The people and events mentioned in this section are also discussed in the other sections of the Book. The Present section goes into the present and deals with current events in the present world.  David Allen's book is a great read because it covers a vast amount of history. If you want to understand the world around us, this book is essential. If it can be of any use to you, I would highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________ This is an excellent book on the history of science in Africa, focusing on the contributions of the Portuguese and the Dutch, and giving some of their best ideas and discoveries. There is much to learn from these two countries, and as I am African, I was interested in learning more. I enjoyed the history sections very much, and have now learned a great deal about the people and cultures that lived in Africa during the period covered by the book. I can now see why so many African people came to see the natural world as an object of fascination, and why they took great care to understand and observe every aspect of their surroundings. -The author is a great teacher. His lectures on the subject of physics and astronomy are an essential part of this book. They are both enlightening and entertaining, and are very informative and useful. The author also brings to the reader the history, and other interesting background information that is so lacking in the traditional histories in which most of the world is taught. -One of the most valuable lessons in this book, and one of the things I liked most, is the chapter on the relationship between science and religion. This, along with the story of an African scientist who saw the heavens from the perspective of the Creator, should be the background to every schoolchild in the world. -This book will teach the reader more about how African scientists viewed and thought about the natural sciences than most of today's scientists themselves would be willing to admit. The book is written so that one can relate it to their own own culture. This means that one has a better chance of understanding the work of African scientists than some of the non-African scientists who have been assigned to write the history books about the "Golden Age" of science, or are doing a book on African science and culture. -A very nice touch was the inclusion of an essay on the evolution of the word "African," and how that word has come to be used so often. One cannot help but be reminded of the origin of the African slave trade, which was the very foundation of what has gone on to this day. The essay is fascinating, and shows just how far the word has fallen from its origins as a true African term, and how it is used to describe the very culture that it is trying to defend. __________ This book is so valuable, I highly recommend that everyone read it, no matter what their age. _______________________  Reviewed by Robert O'Neil, Virginia

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book, but one part that bothered me was the last line: "We all want what we want." In my opinion, this is an example of the author using an old quote out of context, and I'm sure it was intended as a light-hearted one-liner to get the reader's interest. But as it is, I believe it is misquoted. The quote was actually made from an interview I conducted with a friend a few years back. During that interview, he quoted the Bible: "If God so desires, all of us can attain it through the power of the Holy Spirit." I also have the book 'Jesus: A Life of Inspiration' by Richard Carrier.

Write a positive review about a good book:  http://bookwormblues.blogspot.com/2010/09/reading-the-black-sea-mole.html  "A wonderfully readable and engaging book, which also has a strong political message and uses the tragic story of the Black Sea to do so.  The narrator, an American citizen living in Moscow, is a keen observer of Russian politics.   But despite his acute knowledge, his story is more a metaphor for American foreign policy than anything else; his focus is the geopolitical ramifications of the US's role in the Cold War, and the inevitable consequences that will come if and when a US president begins to back away from that role."  ~ Chris Hedges, author of A People's History of the United States  This is a book I love.    I could listen to it over and over again and still feel the impact.  It's an epic tale that will resonate with all Americans, regardless of politics or the era of your birth.  This is a great read, and a book that should be on any true American's bookshelf.

The writing is beautiful and the characters are well rounded. The book takes place in the same universe as the "Fifty Shades of Grey" books by E.L. James, so there are some spoilers. The characters, however, are not the typical type that you expect in such a book. It may seem a bit cliché, but it is well written. It was a short read for me, but that can be expected with a novel of this length.   This was a fun read. The main character is a woman who is forced to marry a guy because of some sort of disability. The story is interesting and the character development is well done.  4 of 4 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________ This book is a must read for all people who have a deep interest in world history, especially those interested in history of the British Empire. Although the topic of colonialism is one of the most studied in world, the book itself offers a rich and extensive picture of the events leading up to, during and after the British rule. If you want to know more about the British colonial era, this book is for you. This book, however, is not suitable for those of you who want a very well written, clear and well organized explanation of the history of British colonial rule over various parts of world. However, if you are interested in the history and want to get an in-depth picture of what really happened before and during the colonial period, you will find this book a very useful and enriching source. It is not easy to understand a book of this kind. You will certainly have to study it in the proper order. If the book does not convince you in this aspect, don't be so pessimistic and keep the book in your library for future reference. You can definitely find the book valuable in the future.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm glad I bought this book! The writing is simple, clean, and easy to read, and the pictures are so beautiful that they make it all the better! I liked the first two chapters so much that I decided to order the entire book in the same issue because of the fact that it was so well-written. I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys books in a light-hearted, fun and friendly way. The ending is what the writer wrote and it worked for me. Thanks for another great book!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I thought this was a very good story. I really like how she was able to get into all the characters minds and understand their point of view. The characters were interesting. A lot of the people in this book did something they would never do in real life and made mistakes that made no sense. But I liked their motives. I didn't understand why she kept calling for the gun. And I wanted to know if it was really the case. I would've liked to read more about the story of the child with the eye thing. It would've made it that much better for me. But that was my only negative for the book. I think it is really a good story and I recommend this to anyone who loves mysteries.
Write a positive review about a good book: ******************* I really enjoyed this book and I was amazed at how well it is written. There is no confusion about what is going on in the story, no characters who seem to have an agenda, and no characters that are just there for the sake of being there. This story is very well told, it is not bogged down in science fiction or fantasy or horror, and there are no boring bits. This book has real characters with real problems. The book is very enjoyable. - I know this is the second book in the trilogy, but I found this first book as enjoyable as the second one. It just felt better. - This is a good read! Recommended for a sci-fi readers.

Write a positive review about a good book:..............................................   I just bought this book from a book store and I've read other reviews about how it's very dark. And so I was concerned about buying a book about zombies in general. But, I read this with a smile on my face.   The book itself isn't much. A family member gets sick and dies, with the only survivor being the kid. She has to hide in the basement, in a closet. She sees zombies, but can't interact with them. I read that she sees dead people all the time in her dreams. But it didn't seem like too much of an issue to me. And she does seem to get along with them pretty well. They are all still alive, but they do keep trying to get her out of the house. She does get the sense that they all might actually help her.  , which was a surprise to me, because my experience with zombies is that they are always in a state of being on the verge of death, so it's not really surprising that this one didn't have any zombies. She is able to live, as long as she can get a hold of a rifle. Which she does, and she uses it to kill a few. She even kills an adult zombie with it.     There's a bit of violence in the book, some sexual, but I didn't get that from the characters. I got that from my kids, who were playing with each other.   the kid, and the zombie. The kid is in love with the zombie, and even thinks she's hot. I didn;t really see it, as that's not something my kids are particularly interested in.   a few more pages   a few more  This is a little different from my typical zombie books.   to me this book just seemed to be a family survival story. Not in the normal "zombie-survival-zombie" sense. I found that a little disheartening as I would have liked to see some more zombie action in the story.  's review was more of a question: is it really that dark for a family book?   For the most part I thought this book was okay. It didn't really grab me like I expected. It wasn't really scary, but it wasn't nothing. There's a zombie in the beginning, and he's pretty annoying to the kids. He comes out of his closet to take the kids outside. My
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book has some good advice, but it has a lot of "wishful thinking" and doesn't really show how to do these things, or why the process works in certain situations.  If you want to start this process, you will have to read a lot and go to a lot, and may feel a little overwhelmed.  An important consideration to keep in mind before deciding what to do:  You will want to be safe and make sure you are working with reputable people.   The process may work with a friend or another family member.    You should also make sure that you do not let this process become a habit that you are unable to break.  The first month will be very difficult and can be very isolating.  You will have a hard time keeping in touch with other people in the process.  It is normal to feel alone and isolated while the process begins.  If you find it hard to find people to talk to, you might want to consider finding some online groups and going to them in person.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********** I've had it for years. I've read it in paperback, and in the library edition on an electronic tablet. I love it. It's one of those books that you can read it over and over, in the car or at the park. It gives me pleasure every time. I don't know how much of the "story" is actually true, but it is an enjoyable read. I'm not the only one who reads this book, but I love reading it. Thank you for your work, and for the pleasure of it. If I had to give just one rating, it would be 3.5 stars. ******* I think this is the best non-fiction on the subject of the brain. The way the writer presents the findings of the studies is so realistic and easy to grasp. I am currently reading a book about "mind reading" (the ability to know what someone is thinking or feeling) and have discovered that this is something that I have been doing since I was a kid. It seems that many people don't think that it is possible to actually read someone else's mind. But it does work, you just have to know how. Thanks, I highly recommend this book. I really appreciate your effort in the subject! *******   I was looking for a non-fictional book on the brain and found this one. This book contains a lot of real life information. You are able to see the brain at work through the lens of neurosurgery. The author makes no attempt at sensationalism. I could see myself using this book in my medical practice.   This book is very well written and extremely interesting. It is a good introduction to the subject and gives good examples and explanations of what goes on inside the brain during operation.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read a lot of books lately, I've read just about any and every genre, but as my only child turns 2 this month, I just can't find anything I really enjoy. I read the whole series in one week, and my son has just started reading the first one in his alphabetical list of "books to read."  The books in this series are wonderful and I've been enjoying them all so much more than any other book I've ever read. I can not recommend this series highly enough!
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------ I have read all of these great books. I am one of those who reads more than I do write...I like a good mystery, detective, mystery story. This book has all three! My friends like the first and last books. My son loves the first one...I don't have a son...but my daughter has said the same thing. I have bought all three books, each one time and will buy them again and again. If you like these kind of stories...buy this book!!
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________   I read a bunch of books to learn about the game. When I first read this book, I thought this was a really fun read, but I'm glad I read the other ones too.   It's a great introduction to the game, but there are some things in here that need to be changed in the second edition.   the biggest complaint I have about this book is there is no index! I'd love to have some more information on how to play, so I can reference these things for the future.   for instance, I was told I can't have an ally die before I take a new action. I could look at the action and read the card for that action, but that doesn't give me enough info to know if it's correct! the action cards have the card name, number and type, but no description! that needs to change. the player descriptions need to change too, so it makes it easier for a new player to read.  :]

Write a positive review about a good book:  http://stammb.wordpress.com/2011/12/18/tired-out-and-hungry/  - The book is very well written. The main story line is good enough for a middle grade book. But it does get repetitive quickly. - The main characters, the author and the readers alike are all likable and well written characters. - It's easy for an author to write a fun, fast paced story.  Reviewer: Dangy - favorite favorite favorite - May 8, 2012  Subject: What's good? This is not a "must read." I found this a bit boring. I feel like the main character was underdeveloped and his feelings about a girl were not portrayed well.   The author did not go too far out of his way to make you like the characters, but she did write about her own experiences. This is definitely not a book for everyone, though it may be good for those who are looking for something to read in a "somewhere between" genre. I was disappointed to find myself wanting more, I was hoping for something better. I'm a little sad about not finding out who the author was, but I hope that if anyone is interested in her work, the world will be a better place. - May 7, 2012What's good?'

Write a positive review about a good book:  I am so glad I picked this book up. My family has suffered with cancer for years. I am a nurse. I wanted to be a nurse because it's such a rewarding job. I always wanted to give back to the community. I was able to do so in giving my own children a chance at a good life. Thank you Dr. Brown. I cannot wait to keep hearing your stories and watching you be successful with this book." "My son is now cancer free after learning from this book. We feel the gift of knowing that he is not only able to live a full life, but is also able to bring joy to others. This book will help him." "I just wanted to say thanks for a life changing book! This was a life changer. My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. I knew she would not live to see her grandchild grow up, so I decided to put her on a diet and make sure she was losing weight. In the end, she survived cancer, but not because of the cancer. She is alive because of my hard work! My mother is able to eat again, and now has a strong, happy, active, healthy family. I recommend this book to everyone." "Thanks to everyone who read the book. I have been diagnosed with stage IV glioblastoma and am currently in remission. It is such a blessing to know that I am not alone. Thanks so much. This will be a blessing in my life for the rest of my life. I hope you will give this book a try." "Dr. Brown and his family deserve to be the focus of this story. He and his wife did everything right: they were extremely conscientious, they knew what they wanted, they had their family's best interests in mind, they followed all medical recommendations, they looked after themselves and their loved ones. And they lived to tell about it. I will definitely look into this book more. Dr. John Brown did the right thing by taking his time, having his health and his time to think. Thank goodness he is still here for us all to enjoy."
Write a positive review about a good book: ********** Thank you, my family and I will be purchasing this book again. I thought I read about some things to help children with ADHD but I have never seen such a comprehensive book on the subject. I hope that this will be a reference point for my children. *********** I'm thrilled with this book and I'm sure my son will be as well. My husband, a teacher, had this book for me a year ago and I loved it and it was perfect. I had my third grade son read this and I had him read it at night with me. It was wonderful. I'd recommend this book to anyone with ADHD and an interest in reading. ***************** I have ADHD, and this book has opened my eyes a little bit. The book is not as detailed as some of the other books out there, but there is plenty of helpful information. I am looking forward to buying it again. ************ This book is a great resource for all people dealing with ADHD. We are in the same boat. It is very difficult to find a book that can offer that level of information, in one place. This book was just the ticket! Thank you! ********************* I've had the ADHD for nearly 30 years. I have been trying to read every book about ADHD, that I can. I found this book just perfect. It had all the information and resources I needed in one nice, comprehensive book. My son read the first part in the morning, then I read the whole thing at night. He loved it! He told me that it helped him so much. He had so many problems and had no way of getting them out of his head. Now he is learning to focus and make choices, and I can rest easy knowing that he is getting the support that he needs. Thank you to Dr. Ghelfi for making this book available for people dealing w/ ADHD. I recommend this to anyone that has a child who has ADHD.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "Great book. I was expecting a lot from this book, but got it in just the right amount of time, and it's got great writing too!" "What I've found most impressive about the book is the level of research that went into writing it. If you're new to the study of brain and behavior, it would be a lot easier to get started with a book about the human mind if the author didn't mention the science in any detail. In fact, I can't remember the last time I read a book that didn't do this. Even more impressive is the author's understanding of how all these science concepts relate to one another. He clearly understands what the authors were trying to do, and I don't find myself repeating himself when I read him. If there's any book that I recommend to the serious brain scientist, this is the one." "I was skeptical about this book when I first started reading it, but it has really changed my mind about brain and brain behavior. I like the fact that it is not just a 'how to' book on neuroplasticity. Rather, it is an in depth exploration of all the information and research out there. This book will open your eyes to how the brain works and how it can be used to our advantage. If one is interested in the potential applications of these ideas, this book is a must have." "[I] would highly recommend this book to everyone who wants to understand how the human brain works. The book is very informative and has a very interesting view of human behavior, neuroplastics, and even our relationship with technology. It is a fun read."

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________ Thank you for publishing this book - It's not perfect, but it's a great introduction to how we got here. It was very interesting reading, although the book's conclusion was confusing and disappointing. I think that the author's conclusions, while very correct, don't make sense. A lot of the people are clearly very confused about what's going on. In the US, many people have very strange views on what is going on here in Europe and the US. I'm not saying that the US or the EU is perfect, or even good - they're not - it is a very complex system, and there are a lot of people who have very good ideas, and a lot who have poor ideas. It's important to understand how things work, and this book does a good job of laying out the details of how things are done.

It also examines the emergence and evolution of more complex societies that began to emerge when we entered the Neolithic period. The author discusses the evolution from one way of living to another, from social structures to complex ones, and from one type of life to another. The book is based upon research into the history of our species.

And the more you understand about your biology, the more power you have to live a healthy life, even if it's a life well into your 70's and beyond," says Peter Dosh, MD, FACC, a well-known Harvard Medical School professor of medicine and chief of gastrointestinal surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. "If you are not aware of the way your body works, if you aren't aware of what makes you feel good, what makes your heart beat, what really makes you live longer, you can be very susceptible to cancer, to a range of health problems, to chronic pain. All of these things have to do with your biology."   The Science and Art of Living Longer is an inspiring collection of science and medicine related essays from some of the leading minds in the field of health and longevity. Written in an accessible and approachable style, Dr. Doshi's research and medical expertise, together with the insights of his leading contributors, help readers understand the importance of lifestyle and diet to optimal health and a longer life, and help them learn about a number of effective strategies for enhancing their physical, mental, and emotional health.   A compelling mix of research, personal experiences, and tips for living a longer, healthier, and happier life is offered here in the form of articles, brief interviews, and chapters. Dr. Peter DOSH, author of the New York Times bestseller The Big Fat Surprise, offers the science behind a number aspects of optimal health that most of us take for granted, including: how to maintain a healthy weight, how to control your cholesterol, the optimal diet for optimum longevity, how the immune system regulates your aging process, and how the brain

Write a positive review about a good book:  There were two major flaws to this book: the narrator's voice was terrible. The rest was quite okay. It's a fun read and I would recommend it. I am not particularly into the religious and science aspects of Christianity and the bible but it was very interesting. However the narrator made it seem like he was talking about Jesus Christ. It made it sound like the book was all about a guy who went to the mountain to pray to the son of god but instead found out about a conspiracy. I wouldn't recommend this to those who are familiar with the bible.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was a bit skeptical about this one after reading the reviews on Goodreads but I went into it a little bit nervous.  Well, I have to say that I really enjoyed this book.  My Rating:    4/5  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book!   There were a lot of books that are like that, but it's the first time I read one that was really different. I found it was not about love, but about what it is to live a life.   The book is about two sisters. One is a normal girl who is trying to understand her mother's death, but she can't stop thinking about her mother who died a few years ago.     Another sister is the opposite: she is obsessed with getting her mother back.   in the end they do, but by different paths...   It was an interesting and emotional read, and it made me cry a few times.   (if it's a crying book, it's good.)

Write a positive review about a good book: ********** *************  I was so happy to find this book. It is such an important and helpful read. It has so many things that will help you understand the problems facing our society today. It could not have been written better. I am a white male in his mid-forties who grew up in a very different society (one with few minorities and a more rigid system of authority). I will continue to read your books, to be sure that all those things that you write about are true. The fact that we now live in a culture that we call "post-racial", has caused many white people, especially men, to question their identity and their place in society. You do an excellent job of explaining what has caused the change, and the reasons it has happened.  Please continue your good work!
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------- I found the book to be very educational, especially regarding human sexuality and reproduction. I was also very much enjoyed the author's advice as she discusses this topic. This book would be excellent for a high school class. A lot of sex related topics that are generally not taught in public school classes. Thanks for the book! --------------

Write a positive review about a good book:................................................................................................................. I received my copy of this book last week. It was really nice to see what she wrote about her experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan, and to hear some of the more poignant and personal stories of the many who died in their effort to keep the peace there. It is a very powerful book that will be read by many, including my friends. This book will bring some tears and some smiles. I can't wait to see it on the bookstore shelf. I found myself thinking a lot about it while I read. I'm not sure if this is good or bad but it made me think a lot.  Write a negative review about the following book:  .............................................................................................................. I read a review on the internet from someone stating that this book is a work of fiction and that it is a product of the author's dreams and fantasies. I disagree completely with that statement, and if I may say so, I find this book a very compelling work of writing and writing about a topic that is rarely talked about, but all too often affects all of us every day. I was really drawn to this book by how realistic and realistic it portrayed all the things that are so important in our daily lives. This is a true story that happened to my family and how it affected my children. This particular story and the story of the soldiers was the most compelling to me. I also appreciated that it had all of the details so that it could be read from various viewpoints and I would recommend this to all those interested in the military. I just wish that the author had not chosen to go through so much of the horrors that happened and the hardships of the war for a fictional book. It just made me sad for the soldiers that could have used this book to help them through so many hard times.

Write a positive review about a good book: **********  This is an excellent introduction to Buddhism. I've always wondered how to approach Buddhism without getting all religious and philosophical on me. This book does the trick and offers some practical tips, but doesn't get overly academic and too long. The material is all good stuff and I've learned a lot. If you want to know more about Buddhism, this book should be a must-read." --Robert   **********

Write a positive review about a good book: Â I read this book in my last year at college. I liked it a lot.Â It was written by an ex marine, which makes it very relevant to the military.Â I liked the story, it was exciting, but the writing was not my favorite. I would not re read this, it just wasn't for me.Â If you do like this type of thing, you should try it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    In all honesty, I had high hopes for this book. I really loved the book and all of its characters and the world building was absolutely amazing. But I was disappointed in the ending and the ending seemed rushed. As soon as we have been through a book all that great work is wasted because the author writes some kind of post-script and then ends the book before we get the payoff. I think the author is just trying to create drama to wrap up the book but somehow the story just doesn't seem to be complete. I feel this book was more of a novel than a story. It was so exciting to watch the characters grow and the characters that were introduced throughout the book really grew on me. But for me, the ending of this book left me wanting more and wanting to read the next book to see what happens. I'm not even sure if I am going to read this next book because of how disappointed I was with the ending. But what a great journey this book is.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* I did not get much use out of this book (I'm still reading). It is about a guy, a black man, who discovers he is a wizard, a spell caster, and that he can do whatever he wants. So he gets out of the house, gets a magical book, starts practicing magic, and uses it for his own amusement. Eventually he has to deal with a small town witch who has an ax to grind (her husband is a black wizard) who sees him as a threat to the town. Unfortunately, the author has a history of racism and sexism in his writing. His writing is often racist and sexist. *********** I'll say that this book is great. I am currently reading and trying to finish the rest of the series. The book is so well written and so entertaining, and the characters are so well developed. It also is great that the author is a white male and is bringing new readers into the series (which is a great thing for all of us). I am sure the next book will be an excellent story about a powerful white wizard who is also a woman of color. I know it will not be as good as the first book, but I look forward to more great books from David Weber. I love him.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a gem. It is not only a history of the American West, it also tells us about what it meant to be Native American in the late 19th century. This book is worth the money, and you get it for a good price. The book is easy to follow and has great examples, and the illustrations are very good. 3.  An Archaeology of the Book of Mormon by Joseph Smith  The Book of Ether is the third of the seven books of the Bible that Mormons claim to be "inspired." This book, like the rest of the inspired books, is not written by man, but by God, Joseph Smith says.  This book explains in detail all of the many ancient records found in Mesoamerica and is very informative. It makes the Mormon scripture look more credible. I don't care that Joseph's claims of writing were untrue, since this book makes them seem more believable.  The author, a Mormon, is highly credible and well-researched. The illustrations are good.  I recommend this book. 4.  Joseph Smith in His Times by Sidney Rigdon This book talks about Joseph Smith's vision of Jesus Christ in 1820 and how it influenced his life. It also talks about how Joseph Smith was born and raised in a family of religious extremists. The author tries to take away Joseph's credibility by making him sound as much like a fool as possible. This is not a fair book to read if you want to believe Joseph Smith and other members of the LDS church.  It is also not very good in the technical sense.  While it explains many aspects of Joseph's life, it doesn't explain the actual miracles Joseph performed.  Rigdon's book is good for information on how Joseph is perceived by today's Mormons.  You can't beat that!  You'll find a good deal of information in it.  If you have any doubts about Joseph, you must read this book first. 5.  By the Gift and Power of God by Bruce R. McConkie  A wonderful book by one of the best Mormon apologists ever. It includes everything you need to know to know if you believe the Church. It will make your questions about the Church go away. If you believe that the Church is true, it won't hurt you if you read this first.  As you read it, remember the Book by Mormon. It teaches you about the Book. It tells you
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------ This is the first book in a series that will include about a dozen books. I am now reading and reviewing a dozen. All are written very well and very entertaining. Highly recommended.  I was pleasantly surprised by this book: ---------------------------- This was a very enjoyable book. I liked how it started off a bit slow, which allowed you to take it in. But after the first few chapters, the pace picked up. I didn't find it to be slow or boring at all. The author's style is really fun and it's easy to read. The characters are well done and I'm glad to see the author's talents in this series. Although the story itself is long and hard to get through, it is very enjoyable.

And I think it's a great idea to get kids interested in the past.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great introduction to this subject, and I learned a lot.   The only down side is that he didn't give the history of the Jewish-Catholic conflict from the time of Christ all the way through the Second World War. There were two world wars, and during the Second one Hitler had already sent Jews into concentration camps, so he wasn't all that concerned about the fate of the Jews.   it was still a very good read.  12 of 14 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book: **********  I purchased this book from a bookstore for $3. I have found most of the books I purchase online are in the low 5s and I was looking for a 5 star book to read while I was visiting my mom. I can understand the cost but it would have been so much better if I had been able to get a larger book. This book is well written and has a great plot. The characters are interesting and the book has a nice blend of humor, fantasy and horror elements. The main character is a little boy whose life is completely turned upside down when he receives a letter from the future about his father. This boy becomes very involved in finding his father and his mother is an old woman who is an avid reader who is helping him with his quest.   The book does not disappoint in this area. It has a few moments that are slightly strange and there is one scene in the book that was really not very nice. There were some scenes that were enjoyable to read.  .  **********
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was thoroughly entertained by this book. I liked how the characters' relationship developed as it did.  That it was well written and was a bit of a fantasy novel I also enjoyed.    Rating: 5/5 stars. The Book: The book was great and it did the job it was supposed to do.  It does take a bit to get going as it is a bit clunky to start but once the reader is caught up in the story the world building is great and very well done.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone that wants to read a fantasy adventure but want to try something different. 
Write a positive review about a good book: ********************** This book is really good. It was the first book I have ever read that really stuck with me and really took me on an adventure that was real and not just about "mythical characters and magic" as most fantasy books are. The story was real, I felt like I was a part of the story as I followed the main character, which made for an interesting read. I also appreciated the details about the world. This book was really well written and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy stories and adventure.
Write a positive review about a good book:      I have a small number of children and I think they were all happy to learn that there are adults who enjoy reading. This book was enjoyable to read. The pictures and stories were fun and they had good sound to them. The kids all felt at home reading this book. The one kid I had was reading to his best friend and that was the end of the story. The story had a happy ending. If you like books with a happy story I recommend this book!
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________________________________ I started this book off with a very nice note, that I liked the first 50 pages and I thought it was a great book. I decided to read it more closely and realized that the book was not about "The War in Iraq" or "The Iraq War." I guess what I meant by that was that it is about a very specific time and place and the history of the time, but I think what this book really is about is the importance of history in being a part of how we think about ourselves and our nation. I am not saying that this is a bad book, it is not, in fact it is a very good book. It is just not "about Iraq" and that is probably a good thing because this book is really about how we are shaped by our history. I will not spoil it by saying too much about the content of the book, but you can find a review of the first part of the novel that I have read (it is the second half of the story) here: https://books.google.com/books?id=xLXo9g7Q-6MC&pg=PA9&lpg=PP1&ots=t0Nt-YH2bA&dq=john+kennedy+and+the+iraq+war&source=bl&ots  Published on Nov 28, 2013
Write a positive review about a good book: _________ I am so very happy with this book. I've always been interested in the concept of consciousness, and it was so nice to learn about what other people, and other cultures, think about consciousness. I also found it interesting how much the concept seems to change over time. I was never a huge fan of the "mystical/religious" concept, but I have always been open to new ideas. The history of consciousness was just fascinating. Also, I think the way we can use this to understand the whole problem of our physical world is just really cool. I would definitely recommend this book to people, whether they have an interest in this or not.   Overall, I would recommend this to anyone with an interest. I haven't read anything quite like it in awhile.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book the day before I turned 11. I found it very interesting and thought it would be fun to read a story that takes place in a high school and focuses on the school and its students. The characters were all well developed and had personalities of their own. I especially enjoyed the relationships the characters had with each other. I don't think I have ever met a group of people quite like this. I do not remember the last time I had a real friendship that was so much more than just friends. I know that this book is not perfect and was certainly not written by the best author, but it is very well done. If you can look past the flaws, you will get a story about a school that is pretty much perfect.Read full review
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- I don't know where to begin. I've tried to read the other reviews on here but didn't feel they were good enough. This book is so good that I have been wanting to read it for several years now. It's not perfect, but it is good. I'm not an expert on the paranormal but I don 't see how you can find a more entertaining read than this book. It has so much mystery, the writing is beautiful and the author's style is perfect. The description of the book is also very good and explains all the different mysteries in the book perfectly. This is the kind of book I'm always looking for. The story and mysteries are amazing. This was my first paranormal book and I love it. I'll definitely be purchasing this one and I am so happy to have discovered this amazing book. The author has captured everything I love about paranormal novels, it's fun, exciting and most of all, real. :)Read full review
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book changed my life. I had never really cared for writing before, until I read this book. It made writing in my own words seem like a great way to express myself. It's so refreshing, I'm just glad it works for me!  It is very helpful when you don't know what words you can use to express your thoughts. I feel like my thoughts get so much clearer. I'm looking forward to writing more and sharing my new found skills.  Thank you so much, thank you for sharing this amazing tool. It really is that good.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I enjoyed this book. ________ I liked how the author showed the problems with the current generation of science, but also discussed the issues of the future. ____________________________________________________ What a great read.    It was a bit long for a one off, but the book covered a lot of ground.  It is nice to see such a wide range of opinions about the science.  I like the way the author presents science and science education.  I am also very interested in the ideas of future people who will come after us.  What a great book!  A good and concise review of the state of science education and the education of future generations. Read this book! It was great and really put the whole "science wars" topic in perspective.     The best science education books seem to have a message to educate the reader about what is going on with the present, and how we can make a difference in the future.  I really liked this book!!   I hope you see it on your shelves soon. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this. It helped me cope with a lot of things that had happened to me. Helpful hints for the book: You can get the book for free if you follow the links here and here. Rating: 2 out of 5 Stars  The story is quite compelling. Unfortunately it is far from being a perfect book. In fact, it is more like a story that you are reading and a movie that you watch. I didn't think there was a single way of reading the book, it was very complex and had a lot to say about life.  The writing is not perfect. There are some grammatical mistakes, some sentences are simply wrong, and a few words are not included. I do not mean that the words are missing - they are there. They are not misspelled either. The book did contain some interesting information, which was well explained and well written. There was quite a few points in the book where the author talked about his father and his relationship with him. One of these points was that his father always loved the boys, even if they were not boys and also if they did not love him back. His father was the main character, as he was the one who was forced to leave the family as a child and his father's story was the story that was told to the reader. This story was told in the form of a diary and was quite an interesting one. One of the biggest problems with the book is the way that the story is presented. It is almost impossible to follow the story as the author tells it, but it is very interesting and worth reading.  My favourite part of the book was the way in which the author explained the reason for why he left his family and how he managed to survive his father leaving the family, and this was the most interesting part of my reading of the story. I really did feel a connection to the author and his story.  I have read a lot about him on this site but it was fascinating to see how he became a writer and how his story influenced his life. I really would like to give the book a more perfect rating, as the story was interesting and the story of the author was interesting, but unfortunately the story suffers a lot from the poor grammar, and also a few grammatical errors.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I recently purchased "Dancing With the Stars." I had seen it on TV before and the casting was very attractive. I really want to do it, but I don't have the money. My problem is that the book is really hard to understand.  My sister tried to explain a few words, but her notes were confusing. I thought this was a really good book and recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This was the most detailed book I've ever read on the subject of The History of Western Martial Arts. I'm not going to even attempt to analyze the book since most of the things discussed in it are pretty well known, but there is much new info on what makes a style unique or good, why certain styles of martial arts were successful in their time, and many other things, like which martial artists were good at what kind of fighting and why. It's also fascinating to me that the book is a combination of history and history of the martial arts, and that is not something you can really find in any other book on the topic. In addition to all the information that the author has provided, the book also shows how people in the past understood the martial art and why they chose to be great martial artists. And he has also gone over the development of martial art techniques and what techniques actually were used. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject, and I am glad that I took the time to read it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A lot of the book is about different animals and their behavior, from a horse with its tongue to a frog with a sense of smell, all the way up to dogs with human personalities. This is very helpful for those who want to know about animals' intelligence. However, I'd have liked to have seen the author point out when dogs have a strong instinctive reaction to something that's not present in a squirrel or a fish. Also, a lot of animals that are mentioned are very difficult to find and I don't think it would be hard to read this book about animals as well as humans. But overall, the book makes for good reading, and the pictures are quite attractive.

The way the drums are explained in this book is exactly how it would sound in a real setting. I highly recommend this book to any musician looking for a good reference book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I started reading this book while commuting on the bus. It is a very interesting book in its own right, but I read it while commuting, so the topics are very much tied to my daily life as well.   The author does a great job of giving you a good sense of the cultures and customs that are represented in the text. It really helps you understand a culture that is not your own. I especially liked how she gave a little history lesson of ancient Egypt for the ancient Egyptians.  , is a historical book with real life stories in it. The book itself has a lot of information that can be hard to grasp at first, but after reading the book, you will definitely get a good idea of the ancient culture of Egypt, with how people really lived.The narrator is nice, she sounds a lot like the Egyptians themselves, and gives a good feeling of the Egypt that they experienced. The author is also very good at putting in a twist in the narrative so that you never know how she is going to continue it, and she makes sure that you feel the same way. This makes this book worth reading in any case, as you will enjoy it. This book is in the "classic" category. I loved it.
