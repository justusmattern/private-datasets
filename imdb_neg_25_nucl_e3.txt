Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________   The worst movie I've seen in a long time.   I am not going to give too much away. The movie is about a family of 5 that moves into a new house, and the father has just got married. The wife, who is a very beautiful woman, is having an affair with a very attractive guy, and one day the guy comes to the house to see her. After having sex with her, he leaves, and he goes to the other side of the country to be with his new wife. When he comes back to the country he decides to meet the girl, and they get married. However, the father doesn't like this, because he doesn't want the daughter to see the guy that she has been seeing, and so he gets a gun and kills the man that the daughter had been seeing. The girl then runs away and goes to a place where she can get her freedom.  : ( The worst movie that I have seen in quite a while. The story is about two young girls that move in together. The mother and the daughter are both very pretty, and there are lots of funny scenes throughout the movie. The father is also very nice, and is a kind man. The daughter starts to get a taste for things that are wrong with this world. She gets into drugs, and goes crazy, and she is in a very bad state. The young girl has become very promiscuous, and has started to sleep with lots of guys. The younger girl also has a bad habit of doing drugs. One day, the young girl comes home from school and finds her father in bed with another girl. She runs to her father and tells him about it. Her father tells her that she can go to her room and he will deal with the problem. The next day, when she is at school, she finds out that her father is going out with a young girl who works in the school. She tells her friends about it, and then she tells her father about it as well. Her dad tells her to forget about it and that she should forget about the school, but she tells him that she doesn't. She doesn't have any friends at school at all, and her father thinks that she is too much of a slut to be a good student, and tells her not to go. However she tells the girl that she isn't going to school anymore. When the girl comes back home from work, she tells everyone about her
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ If you like this movie, please tell a friend about it, because it is good. I am not going to comment on the acting, because everyone is doing good. If you do not like the movie, tell a person who will like it. You can like it or not like it, that is your choice. If this movie was good, why is it rated as a 7? I am just guessing here, but I think it is because of the violence. The violence is there, but is never really over the top. The people that are killed are not people you would expect to be killed. I did not find the people in the movie to be very likable, but then again, this movie is a horror movie. If it was not for the violence, this would be a 6 or a 7. I give it a 7, because the movie does have some good things about it. If your looking for a good, scary movie, you will not find it here. This is a great movie to see for the first time, if you are looking for something that will scare you. If its your first time seeing a horror, you may like it because it has some great action. It was nice to see a movie that was a remake of a popular horror movie, and it was done well.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ I watched this movie as an open-mike night with my friends at a movie theater. It was good but I'm a little sad that it ended so soon. It's a really good movie but it's got the same problems as the last two movies. The same thing as The Big Lebowski. The characters all talk about how they're going to win the lottery. Well, the lottery is not going to pay for a new house for the actors and the actors are all getting a big raise. I know that a lot of people will tell me that I'm being stupid for saying this, but the movies that I liked in the 90's are The Big Bang Theory, Friends, Seinfeld, etc. and I've never heard of a movie that was that bad that was a hit with the 90s. The other movie that I thought was bad was The Princess Bride. It did not have a lot to do with what was going on in the movie. Also, The Princess was a remake of a cartoon. And then I've seen this movie and I was just like wow, what is going on? I've heard of the characters being from a different movie before but I don't know where they are from. I also don't remember what the plot was. The movie was not that funny either. The last 10 minutes of the movie was kind of cool. There was one little thing that I really didn't like about this movie. I was going to write about this but the other day I was watching a movie and there was a woman in the audience that was looking at her phone and she kept looking at the phone and then she looked at me and then I looked at her and she was like "I just looked at your phone." I didn't want to mention this, because it was a really random thing to me, but it really bothered me because it reminded me of how I felt when I saw the movie with the woman in my class that was going through the breakup with her boyfriend. So, I really think this movie was a bad idea. And if I had my way, I wouldn't be seeing it again. I would never watch it again and I would make sure that this movie never gets a new audience.

The director, who has a reputation for producing poorly-made horror films, decided to make a movie that was so offensive, it is nearly unreadable. I have seen this film in many theaters in many countries, and I never understood why anyone would want to watch this film. It is a sad, pathetic, disgusting, and hateful film. The characters are almost all bad, the acting is terrible, and the film makes no sense. This is a film that has no value whatsoever. - November 22, 2015Unforgivably offensive  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from This movie is just as bad as it sounds! I'm not usually a horror fan, but this one was so over the top, I almost passed out. The movie starts out with an evil-looking clown who is very evil. When he gets the attention of the kids he gets his revenge on them. When a child goes missing the kids search for him and find his body and the clown is there. This clown has no problem murdering a little girl in the middle of the night, and then eating her. He also kills a few other kids. Then he turns on the other clowns, and they try to kill him. But they're not that strong, and his clown friends don't have the same strength as him. So the clowns don't stand a chance. But the clown does have a little friend who has the power to fight the clown, and he has a little sister. So when the clown gets back at the clown's family by killing his little sister, the clown tries to kill her, too. Then, the next morning the little girl wakes up and she has a weird smell. She's wearing a clown's mask and she's alive and well. Then she has another weird smell, and she doesn't seem to have a face, so she has to have the clown eat her to get rid of the stink. So that's what happens. But her dad has a big mouth, so he takes her to the hospital. But when he goes in, the doctors can't find any

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ This is a film I have seen many times, but never understood the plot. It is a movie about a girl who has to marry a man that she hates and only wants to be with her brother. She knows that he has a very serious illness, and he has to be given a great deal of medical care, and so she decides to stay at his bedside and make the most of it. It turns out that this man is dying. I don't think the script writers got that right, because what we see of his illness is so horrible. I could have made a very short movie about this, but the actors do a wonderful job with this role. There is also some nudity in this film, and some violence, but that's it. This is the only film I can think of that has nudity in it and violence in it.

It's not very good, and there's no point in me telling you why. The acting is pretty poor. The story doesn't even make sense. It doesn't help that it's a remake of a movie that was bad. The movie stars Michael Jai White, and I don't know what he's going to do with his life. The original movie was bad, and the remake was worse. You're supposed to be thinking that this remake is supposed to make up for the original movie, but that's not the case. The only reason to watch this is to see what a great actor Michael J. White is. I mean he did do some good stuff in The Avengers, but he can't even act in this movie. He's in it just to act, and he sucks. He doesn't seem to have a clue about what he wants to say. He just says stuff like "Oh, yeah, I was a little kid, I can't believe this!" and "I don't want to go on camera, I don' t want to do this." And that's just the beginning. The last 5 minutes of the movie are completely wasted, and it's all a waste of time. The ending of the film is even worse. The guy is supposed be the good guy and he goes out of his way to destroy the bad guy. The bad guy gets what he deserves, and all the hero does is go off into a corner and weep. The hero isn't the good guys anymore, but the bad guys are, and you can't tell the difference. The end credits are pretty terrible, and if you're going to re-edit a movie like this, you better make it look pretty.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. _________. __________________________________________ The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen. Why should you watch this movie? Well, the movie starts off with a beautiful scene. A girl gets in a car with a guy, and the guy goes on a date. Then, out of nowhere, she leaves the car and she goes on her own date. Well, it's a date, but it doesn't go as well as she had planned. The guy she left with never came back. I mean, he was supposed to, but he never did. The girl was so sad and she kept saying she would be in touch. I'm sorry, but what the hell kind of man leaves a woman for a week and then never contacts her after that? I thought the guy was a good guy, but then again, I've never been in love, so I have no idea. And after this date, she ends up breaking up with the guy she just met. She never told him about the guy. This is such a shitty movie. The only good thing about it is that it's on VHS. I can't believe that they made this movie. It's a piece of shit. The movie is a piece...of...shit. I was so angry that I couldn't even finish watching it. I tried to, so much, but I just couldn't do it. The whole movie was so...wasted. It felt like I was watching a TV movie. I couldn aint say it was bad, but this movie sucked so bad, that I just can't say anything nice about it. You really think this movie is worth watching? Go watch something else, or you'll regret it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________ ___________  The Worst Movie I've Seen in a While  Posted by: John M. on October 2, 2004 | 5:29 AM I am so embarrassed for this movie. I was so in love with this movie and I have a feeling that I am going to regret my purchase. The main problem was the acting, which wasn't very good. I guess I was too young and thought that it would be a good movie to watch with my friends. Instead it turned into a bad joke. The story and plot were good, and I think it was one of the first movies to show how horrible war is. I really didn't care about the characters or the actors in this movie at all. I just wanted to get away from the movie. It wasn't too long but the ending was disappointing. _________ ______________ _____________ _______________  It Was All a Dream  By: Mike G. on September 21, 2004, 5:12 PM I was in college in the early 70's, and there was a film that I remember quite well. It was called "The Big Lebowski" and it was about a man named "The Dude" and his trip through the city of "Bohemia", where a small town called "Bozkis" is located. The whole town was on fire, and he was on the run. The only thing that I recall from this movie is that it was the first time I saw the movie and it made me realize that a guy who was a complete bum and did nothing but hang around the bar could be the main character in a movie. That is why I love this movie so much. _________________________ __________________________ ______________________________ ________________  Great Movie...but not for me  by: Mark H. on June 27, 2004 / 5:00 PM I love it. It's great and fun. The plot is interesting, and the acting is great. I do not understand why people who say it is not good or that it is terrible are wrong. It is one of those movies that is good because of it's acting, and not the plot. I would say it's worth watching. It does have some plot holes, but it's a fun movie and people like it. _____________________________________________  Best movie ever?  I thought so!  Loved it! :D

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ How could this movie be bad? I mean, I liked the premise. But this movie is terrible. The movie is basically about a group of young people who go out to a party. Then they get lost. They are on a train. There is a girl who looks like one of the girls from "Dancing with the Stars". She is a good looking girl. They go into a dark alley. She looks at her phone. They don't have cell phones in the 70s. There are no cell phones. Then she runs out and she sees a guy who is in a car and she gets in the car and then the guy gets in a cab. Then this guy drives her around. Then he goes to a house and she runs to the door of the house. There was a bunch of other people there. She goes into the house and then she sees her friend. Then her friend goes in to talk to the guy. And then she is attacked. She runs outside. There's a dog that is running around. It is a pit bull. The dog bites her. Then the guy comes out and he gets his money back. Then his money comes back. The guy goes back in. He goes into another room. And he gets a bunch more money. Then a bunch came in. This guy takes out a gun. Then another guy comes in. And they all start shooting at them. They all die. The girls are all dead. The guys get out of the cab and they run. The girl is on the ground. And the guys are all on the streets. They run through the streets shooting at each other. And a few of the guys get shot and die. Then one of them is taken out of this cab and he is shot and killed by another guy. They get in a bus and go to the police station. They tell the police that there were three men and two women and they are all in the same place. Then there is a phone call from one of their friends. He says, "The girl is dead, and her friend is in trouble." So he tells them what happened. The police go there and they find the girls. The friend of the girl is not there. So they take the friend of one of these girls to the hospital. The other girl is there and she says she is okay. So the police go to her house and they ask her why she is at the hospital and she said that her friend was shot
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________"  What was the purpose of the film? Was it supposed to be funny? Was the point to be provocative? It wasn't funny. It was just one of those "filler" films that Hollywood was producing to keep us entertained and to keep the money rolling in. It is not a bad film, it just was never meant to be. The script was terrible, the acting was terrible and the directing was terrible. The acting was really bad. One of the actors was a comedian, he was supposed to get an award for it, but he got the wrong actor and was given the award. The movie was not supposed to take off at all. I was so upset that the movie was a total flop, it was such a waste of money.  The only redeeming quality was that the producers, director and studio all made a lot of money for the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. ____________. ____.  I think that's a great question. So here's the answer: ________________________________________. I think the movie was written by the best of the best, and was actually based on a book by the great Richard Matheson. The book was a collection of short stories that Mathesons had written in the late 50's. This movie, though, was made by Steven Spielberg. It was actually the first movie Steven Spielberg had directed since Jaws, but it was still good. Spielberg was always the director who was able to make a movie look and sound like it was made in the early 50's, even though it was in a time before cameras were really that advanced. Spielberg and Mathesohn's work together is a great example of the sort of thing you can see in this movie. Spielberg had an uncanny ability to get the right balance between realism and fantasy. He had a good eye for making things look real, yet feel like they were filmed in a dream. For example, the ship crash scene was done with real cameras, but with the actors being told they were being filmed by actors on a stage. It's a technique Spielberg also used in E.T. __________________________________________________________. This is a really hard question. I'm glad you asked. This is the answer I've always given to people who have asked me this: _______________________________________________________________________. It is a very good question. My answer is this: It is the most important movie of all time, and that's not hyperbole. It is a masterpiece of storytelling, and one of the greatest films ever made. It also has the biggest budget of any film ever made, which is really, really cool. It took over a year to complete, and it took $4.5 million to make. It won a lot of awards, and most of them were actually from the American Film Institute. It got a lot more praise and awards for being the director's directorial debut than it got for being a good movie. That's a pretty impressive accomplishment for a film that was only made in about two and a half months. ______________________________________________________________________. I am not sure how to answer this one. I have seen the film twice now, and have always found the ending to be disappointing. I was really hoping for something more. It would be great to know if there was some sort of alternate ending that wasn't used. ____________________________.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ Review and rating: 3.5/5 I think this movie is bad. The story is not great and the acting is not that great either. It has a lot of bad acting. There's no dialogue that is good, except for the first 10 minutes when he's doing a press conference about his father's death. I guess that was good. The acting is the worst I have ever seen in a movie. The worst. The bad acting is that they didn't even try. It's just bad. I would not recommend this movie. ______________________________________________ Reviewed by: James E. Atherton

It's a comedy and some of the scenes are pretty funny. The movie itself is not bad and it's actually a good movie to watch. It has some pretty interesting characters that you really care about. The characters are so good. I really loved how much they grew throughout the movie. They had their ups and downs. I think this movie would be great if the actors actually had an acting style. It was hard for me to understand what the characters were saying because they were just doing their thing. The film didn't make me laugh all that much. I don't think I laughed once. I also didn't really care that much for the characters. I just really thought that this movie was just a fun way to watch some people getting into trouble. Overall, I thought this movie is a pretty good way to see what life is like in a bad comedy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only reason I watched this movie. The rest of the movie was so bad. I had to look up "wet blanket" because I couldn't believe how horrible it was. The plot was completely ridiculous. They were going to capture the aliens that came to earth in their ship. They thought the ship was going to be full of humans that they could eat. The alien they captured was about 3 feet tall and covered in scales and scales and it just was disgusting. I found out that the ship they were on was a spaceship that landed on earth and the aliens were the ones that lived there and they were like in the way they lived. They ate each other and they had a child and they got in trouble with the authorities. They wanted to take the child back to their planet but they weren't allowed to. So they decided to build a spaceship. They took the baby and they threw him out of the ship. It was raining and they couldn't fly so they just landed on a farm. The farmer and his son came to the farm and they found the alien and the baby. They found out it was a baby and it was covered in hair and it smelled horrible. So the alien was in their arms and the farmer's son was in the alien's mouth. So now the farmer wanted to get his son out of there but he couldn't because he couldn. So he tied the alien up and threw him in the water. Then he went to get the farmer and threw the alien in the river. It floated out into the water and when he went back to get him he realized the baby was gone and he never found it. So then he started drinking and he got sick and died. The story wasn't even close to the actual thing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.  You're not going to win a gold star for that, I can tell you that. That's what the film industry does when it doesn't know how to make a good movie. This movie is not a good film. It's a piece of crap. It doesn't even have the heart of a great movie. The movie is a piece with a huge plot hole and all that. It has a lot of characters, some good and some bad. But, what makes this movie so bad is the acting, the story and the writing. The director and his wife wrote the script with no script writer. They hired an actor and an actress, both of them, that do not even know how acting works. And, they both did a terrible job. They both have the same bad acting. It is all so amateurish. This is so bad that they had to use a "cinematographer" and a "sound director". These are just a bunch of actors that know how actors work. They do not know how movies work. So, they made this movie with a bunch actors that do nothing. It's like the worst version of the 80s movie "The French Connection". This movie has almost no plot. It does not have any action. It just does what every movie should do: it shows how a "bad guy" could be bad for a good story. It shows how the good guy could be a bad guy. But it does not show how the bad guy can be bad too. It tells you how it is and then you just think that's it. That was the only way it could be done. And this movie did that. We see how a good guy can kill a bad guys. We see how the evil guy could kill a good guys. But we don't see how it could happen that way. This movie is so poor. I think it was written with a bad script, because I can't remember a thing that I learned about writing and acting in this movie. It makes no sense, it is just so amateur. When I heard about this movie, I thought, this movie is going to be like "The Matrix". But it is not. This isn't a movie about "The Machines". This is a movie of a guy and a girl. It made no sense. It was amateurish and amateurish at the same time. This was just a mess of bad acting and a bunch people
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ Do you like horror movies? If so, you will probably enjoy this one. It is basically a movie where people with mental disorders and mental illnesses get to kill off one another. If you are in the right mindset, you can appreciate it. If not, you might not like it. It has some good moments, but there is no plot and the action is not really interesting. I think it was filmed in the '90s so it is hard to get the most out of it. However, if you have a good sense of humor, you could probably enjoy it. Just beware of spoilers.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________  "I can't stop thinking about that terrible scene with that poor woman in that one room. The fact that she's crying. That her life is over. I was in a theater, I remember it, I can't forget it. And I remember that woman. I remember how she looked. I can still see her face. And it's a part of my life that I never want to relive. That was not an innocent girl." ______________________________________________________  If you are not into sex, you are going to hate this movie. It is so vulgar, graphic, and graphic. I think they are trying to make money. But that is not their aim. They don't want people to enjoy the movie. They just want people who are not interested in sex to go in and see it and they will get their money back. They should have said before the movie that this movie was not for you. It's for people who don't like sex. I'm a sex person. I want to see sex. This movie isn't for me. It isn't even for people that are in the wrong sex.  -Bridget  ____________________________________________________  The film is about a group of women in a sex shop and the men who visit them. The women are all in relationships with their lovers and they are all interested in one another but their husbands don't appreciate this and keep them apart. The sex shop is a place where these women can try their new "bunny toys" and try to find someone that will appreciate them. And they do. .  the women were very entertaining, and you should have seen them all. I loved all of them. I never wanted to leave the theater! -Gwen  ____________________________________________________________________________    "This film has all the wrong things. I've seen it twice and the first time I was so bored I was embarrassed to watch it. The film is so bad, I wanted to throw it out the window. The acting is awful, and the story is so stupid. But at least the sex is great!" _______________________________________  From: T.E. "It was a bit of a shocker at first. I found it difficult to relate to most of the women. But after a while I got used to them and enjoyed them. They were quite alluring and attractive, and I thought that I would enjoy a night out with them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  [-] TheFuriousFangirl [-] TheMadPipeline [-] the_wandering_santa_  My review is not going to be as thorough as my friend's review. She does a great job, but I think the movie would have been better if it had been edited into a single film. I don't think there's enough time to give the plot a thorough go. I did not understand why people were so angry at him for getting his sister killed. It was obvious to me that she was his first love. It is pretty clear that the guy was not in love with his sister. She was not his first. And he was certainly not going into it expecting to get her. So why do we have such a strong reaction against him? I'm guessing we're still angry about his death. The guy was a great character and I thought he was well written. He's just a bit of a weirdo. It would have made the movie much better if he was in it.  "I never said it wasn't worth it"   I liked this movie. It had great acting, great music and it had a good story. I like the fact that it's not as long as some of the others on this list. The movie had great performances. I liked the chemistry between the three lead actors. The story was good. I would have liked to see more time spent on it and maybe it could have been longer. But it was a decent movie and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves a good romantic comedy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________ _______________________________________ A movie is a movie, but the people in it are not. The characters have no depth. They are like cardboard cutouts that were carved out of cardboard, then stuffed into a cardboard box, and then made into a movie. I don't think I could even tell you who the leads are or what they do. It's all generic. The movie's plot is so bad, that it actually has a good message: to never trust anyone. I think that it's a movie that you should avoid watching.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ ______________ (The Worst) _________ _____________  "I can't get this movie out of my head, and I can't take my mind off of it," wrote one critic. "The film is a terrible joke on all the people who don't take life seriously, and the people that do, and are constantly talking about it, and trying to make it better for everyone else. It's a sad, sad movie, and there are too many laughs to make this a real good movie."  The movie, which is based on a book by Michael Bamberger, features a variety of characters, including a small town mayor who gets caught in a web of lies and deceit. The film was directed by John Waters, and stars Dennis Hopper, Paul Sorvino, Jane Fonda, and Sharon Stone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________  "You know how to write a great review: 'The plot is lame, the acting is terrible, the plot is contrived, the characters are shallow and unlikable, the music is awful and there are a bunch of ridiculous plot devices, the action is predictable and stupid, and there's nothing to look forward to in the film'..."   I was a little disappointed in this movie. I mean, it is a little long. It has a couple of scenes that were really funny. But most of it is about a guy who's on the run from his ex-wife and her new boyfriend. He meets up with some local gang members, and he's able to get away from them. But there's no love interest in the movie, so this guy is stuck on the road with this bunch of idiots.   And then the cops show up and get involved. There's a bit of a plot hole in there. Why doesn't the gangsters just take off when the cops arrive? They're the ones who have been following the car, and they're the only ones with guns. Why didn't they just leave?   But all in all, it's a pretty cool film. I was looking forward to seeing it.   the trailer is a pretty good way to get a feel for the film. The actors are really good. The music is kind of lame. And the special effects are a little bit bad. I think the special effect for the gun shots is pretty funny, though.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.   5 out of 5 stars Great Movie! This was a great movie! It was a movie that I will watch again and again. I think that the movie is perfect for the age of today and I really enjoyed it. This is a great story, well told. This movie will make you think and will make a great day with a movie night. The ending of the movie made me cry like a baby. I would recommend this movie to any one that enjoys a good movie. I have been a fan of the tv show "24" ever since I was a kid and now I'm in my 40's and I still like it. The only thing that I don't like is the action scene in the end of the film but I guess that's the movie's job.   a great family film for the whole family.  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   How many times have you been in a movie and thought, "this was just a terrible idea"? The worst movies are often the most memorable because they are so awful that you can't help but think, "I would rather just do this thing that I would never do in real life than be a part of this." The fact that The Room is so awful doesn't mean that it's a good movie, it's just that the movie is so bad that you could never really think about the movie the way you would about a real-life experience. 

The movie was very good and I still watch it every time I think about it.   The story is about a guy named Lester Nygaard (Michael Stuhlbarg).  He's the guy who's trying to get a job at a hotel and get the money to pay off the debt he owes his father (Timothy Olyphant). Lester is an ex-convict and an alcoholic.  He meets his wife, Marge (Emily Rios) on the job.   She's the one who finds the job in the first place, and Lester makes a deal to give her a little bit of money.  She helps him get a place to stay, and they live happily ever after.    However, all of a sudden Marge starts seeing a man, "John."   This is not good news for Lester, because his father doesn't want to pay back his debts to him.  Lester's a bit of a prick and he doesn't like John, and the two have a huge fight.  John is a big jerk, but he has a thing for Lester's wife, and he makes a great deal with Lester.  It turns out that Lester is cheating on Marge, and John has a way of finding out about it, and then he tells Marge that Lester's cheating on her, and that Lester was going to leave Marge for her.  Marge is upset about this and she goes after Lester, but Lester is able to get away.  Unfortunately, Margo has been left heartbroken.  So what happens to Marge?   Lester does some terrible things to Margo, but Marge's the only one who
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________.  I've never been a big fan of "torture porn," and I never really had a preference for the genre. I think it's a little juvenile and silly, but it's always a good time. I've always been a bit of a "troubled teen" myself, and the "tearjerker" genre is pretty close to what I've seen of the genre before. ...and now, a very sad tale of how not to get your period.  of the week: the story of a little boy who is abandoned by his parents and who tries to be a hero.   .  and that's the end of the show for today. I'm off to go get something to eat. I'll be back tomorrow for the end. If you have any questions for me, or want me to do a video interview, just leave a comment or shoot me a message on the web. The first time I was ever a fan of a movie was The Room. I'd seen it many times before, but never in a theater. It was a very weird movie. I didn't know much about the people who made it, but I'd heard they were all very smart people and very talented. The only thing I knew about the movie was that it was a film that could only have been made by a small film crew. It's very strange, I know, but a few years later, I saw The Room in a huge, beautiful theater in New York, and I had to leave immediately because I was too embarrassed to be in the room with that many people. I couldn't even look at them. I was so embarrassed that I didn the same thing again. So I'm sure a lot of people in this room are like me. And if that's not the case, maybe it is. And maybe you're like me too. Maybe we just like weird things. Maybe that's why we like movies. Or maybe it's because we're all lonely and scared and sad and afraid, and that might be why we love movies. But there's no way of knowing for sure. And I really wish I knew. But for the time being, I'm going to watch a couple of movies, and then I'll come back here.

I have yet to see it in a theater, but every time I'm watching it I can't stop. The movie is a very well done drama and is full of great performances and some great scenes. It's also a movie where the film is almost a documentary on the making of the movie and the cast. Tom Cruise is a great actor, Densel Washington is a fine actor and MillaJovovich is one of the most beautiful actresses I have ever seen. Tom SIZEMORE plays a good cop who is trying to bring down a gang that has a bad reputation and who are also committing crimes. I love Denzel. He's very good in this movie and makes the role his own. Robert DeNiro is also a fine and important character. I think the main character, Tom Cruise has a nice voice and the movie is worth watching over and again. The cast does an amazing job with this movie.

You can't even enjoy it and be entertained. It is the worst movie of all time. The only reason it gets a 9 is because of the terrible actors.   The story is as follows: An alien space ship crashes in the middle of the desert. It contains several people who were on the ship at the time of crash. One of the passengers is named _________. This alien is a psychopath. He was so dangerous that he killed his own mother and took all the credit. He killed a few people but this didn't bother him. He is so psychotic that he kills people who had no reason to fight back. He also has a horrible temper and kills anyone who gets in his way. He kills many people and destroys the desert with his laser beams.   and the rest is just a bunch of violence. It was very poorly written. The acting was terrible. There is no emotion. They just screamed and moaned. The scenes that you see were all so badly written that I didn't even care about them. I wanted to look away from them. It made the movie even worse. I found the story to be ridiculous.  , the director, said the movie was made for adults and I thought he was full of it. This movie is just terrible. If you can even call it a horror movie. The people that are on this ship are just so stupid. The plot is stupid and the acting is stupid. It should have never been made. I can't believe that this movie was allowed to go through.   of course the bad reviews were there. I guess the reviewers didn't like the movie because they never liked ___________.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  If a movie has a lot of problems, I usually can get over them. The problem is when you see a movie with too many problems. The more problems in a movie, the less it holds my interest. That's what I was looking for in the first place. The other problem with this movie was the acting. I'm going to be honest. I don't know if it's just me, but there was way too much acting in this movie. I really liked the actors in the movie, but they didn't do much. They all acted like they had a scene and they were off and on for like 15 minutes. It was way overdone. The music was good. I'll give it a 7/10 for what it is.  Helpful but not for me. I wouldn't recommend this movie for someone who loves a good story. This movie was a train wreck. The story wasn't that interesting, and the acting was terrible. I would not recommend this to anyone. I gave it a 2 because the first half was entertaining. The rest of the movie was pretty terrible. The ending sucked, and I couldn't really look forward to the next movie. .
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________________________________________________________ The movie begins with a scene where a girl (who I will call "Sasha") gets in a car with a man, who she had seen on a TV show that had been on in the morning. They are driving, and she is talking about a movie she has seen, "My Father's House." Sasha has been waiting for this man for a long time. She is talking to him, as she is getting in the car, and the man asks her if she is going to see the movie, and if she wants to come to his house and get some more coffee. Sasha is looking forward to the movie and is ready to go. The man says he is going back to his own house, but he will give Sasha a ride home. When they are in his driveway, he gives her a hug, and he asks Sasha if she would like to go back to the house, and they go in the house. As they are inside, Sasha asks the man if he had anything for her, and that he had the money. She asks him what he is wearing, and then she says he doesn't look like a rich man, so she wants a picture of him. He is in a long coat, with a hat, and is also wearing a scarf. She tells him she wants it, but she doesn't want to see his face. He says she can see him if she puts her mind to it. Sasha looks around, and sees a large painting of a house. The painting has a man standing in front of it, and behind him is a small garden. She thinks that it looks like the man in the TV show she saw. The woman who was giving Sasha the coffee tells her that she is a real person. She says that she was a little girl and that her father died, and her mother was very ill. She never got over that, and it had made her very unhappy. The picture is a picture that her mother painted of the house she lived in. She wanted to live there one day, but her mother wouldn't let her, so Sasha took up painting, and wanted to get some money to get a job. The lady says that Sasha is a good artist, and says that if she keeps working hard, she will get rich. Sasha says she is not rich, and wants to get her picture taken, so that she can go home and tell her mother what the painting looks like. Sasha wants to go home, and tell

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ I've heard that the sequel is the same as the first. I have to admit that it's not. I would never recommend this movie to a child or a teenager, and the plot and the acting are horrible. If you are an adult who wants to see something different, you will not like this. If I can give it an 8, it's because of the actors. I had no idea they were such horrible actors. It was like watching them trying to act in a movie. I'm sure it wasn't that hard, since they were acting, but they really should have known better. My biggest disappointment is the fact that it took them this long to make the sequel. I just hope they didn't have to go through all this trouble. It is a real shame.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________. This movie is a mess. It's a boring mess, with some great actors doing the same old same old thing. The story is pretty much what you would expect from a movie like this: a scientist (the lead) has discovered a way to reverse aging, and is going to use the cure on his grandson (the only one of the five main characters who is not a scientist). Unfortunately, the grandson dies before he can use the method, and the scientist, who was supposed to be on his way to a cure for his grandson, is stranded on a desert island with the other five main character. The only problem with this movie is that it tries to make you care about all the main characters. The lead is portrayed as being pretty boring. He gets his face ripped off a couple of times, but we don't care. The scientist, on the other hand, is portrayed by a great actor. The chemistry between the lead and the lead's grandson was pretty good. There were a few times when they would say something like "This man can heal anyone. If you can't find him, try searching for someone else." That was pretty cool. But the problem is that the rest of the main character's characters are also pretty bland. The doctor, who is the leader of the group, is pretty bland and boring. The scientists are bland and forgettable. And the leader is the least interesting person in the entire movie. It should be noted that the movie does have some very good special effects. There are a few very cool effects in this movie. One time, the scientist gets hit by a car and goes flying into the sky, which is pretty cool to watch. There is also a scene where a bunch of people get blown up by a nuclear bomb. It was pretty neat to see those explosions. But then, you would think that they would have done better to have a movie about a nuclear war. There was also a lot of time spent in talking about nuclear weapons and how they are used, but that was about all. I could have done without all the talking about how great the scientists are. I really don't understand how the scientists would use the scientists to solve the problem. They are pretty much useless, even if the leader can do some amazing things. The movie also has a lot more "sci-fi" and "futuristic" sci-fi than the other two movies. There's a lot about how people can use genetic engineering to

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Close  Jul 27, 2017 1:16:43 PM by Anonymous Person   The movie has its moments, including the wonderful (and very funny) scene where the three young children sit on a table eating ice cream. But that's about it.  "The Secret Life of Pets" is about a guy who is stuck with a pet, a chihuahua. He takes him everywhere, including to the zoo, where he encounters a baby crocodile, and a man in a gorilla suit. The movie's theme is that a pet has more rights than people, and you can't let your pet run free. , but that's not what I liked about this movie. The idea that pets are supposed to be loved is a great one, but in "The Secret life of Pets," it comes off as preachy. The dog and cat characters seem like they should be adorable, but they're portrayed as the worst of the worst. .

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________ The film has a great start. There are some interesting characters to see as they try to make a living as bounty hunters. The story is interesting, with some twists and turns. It also has a good script that was easy to follow. It starts out slow, but it picks up. The script is interesting as you learn more about each character. You learn that some of them have issues, but they try not to let that get them down. The acting is good as it tries to portray the characters in a realistic way. The film was fun, and I didn't find it to be boring at all. The cast is good, and all of them are likable. This film was a bit different, but I liked it. I recommend this film to anyone who likes action movies, and for those who want to see a good story told in a good way. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** This movie is an absolute waste of time. There are so many stupid things in this movie that I have to say that it's a terrible idea to take a film that's supposed to be a sci-fi action film and turn it into a story about a bunch of aliens that live in the ocean and try to kill the people of Earth. It's just too stupid. And, by the way, why does this movie need to have aliens living in the water? They could just be any other animal and that wouldn't be a problem, but they are aliens. Why would they need to be fish? Why would a fish have the intelligence to be able to get out of the water and come to the surface to find their human masters? Why do they have to be so stupid? This movie should have been called "An Alien Attack". It's stupid, and the actors are awful. The only good thing about this movie is that it ends on a cliffhanger. If this was a TV movie, I'd have to wait another five months for a new movie.  The only good part of this movie: The last 20 minutes where they show the last two survivors of the planet. This is a good way to end a movie. I don't know why they didn't just make a sequel to this movie. They should have just done a remake of it with different actors and put it on Netflix. This movie has nothing to do with the other films, except that it shows what happens to the Earth when aliens invade it. The worst part of the movie: I didn't care for this movie at all. It was very bad and very uninteresting. It has nothing good about it. I can't think of anything positive to say about this film. It would be much better to just make another Alien movie with new actors and a new story.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  (For the rest of this review, we'll say nothing about the film itself. Just a little bit about the author.)  I read this book in the first edition. I've been rereading it for a few years now and I find myself enjoying it again. The characters are interesting and they're all a lot of fun to read about. I think I'd love to read the rest and see how it goes. I don't remember any of the names of the characters in this book. The main character seems to be the leader of the group, but there is a lot going on in between the scenes. There are also several interesting characters in the book.  If I could give this book a negative, I would. The author has some problems with his characters. I remember reading a review where the author said he wrote the book because he couldn't get over the loss of his son and was trying to capture the sadness in his writing. I found it to be true. His characters seemed a bit too close to him and I couldn't understand their emotions. He is a very talented writer and I can't wait to see what he does next.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. I don't even know how to start. I was totally expecting a great movie and all I got was a bad story and a poorly acted. The actors did not seem to enjoy their role in the movie and they did not even try. It was a really bad movie. I could have done without the whole "we are on a mission from God" thing. It got old after a while. The music was lame as well. The story about this poor girl in her life who was so poor and has been looking for God all her life and now she finds him and she thinks it is a mistake but it turns out it is not. This girl has a heart of gold and it was very hard to see how she could have gone so wrong. This movie is just not worth your time. I think the only way to watch this movie is to be very old, very sick, and very sick at heart. You will not be able to take it.

The film also has a few plot holes that could be solved with a little research.  Overall, this is a pretty mediocre movie that had a lot to offer. The Rating: 10/10

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   ______________________________________________________________  Here is a quick rundown of the main themes, which I will also cover in detail later. The movie centers on the struggle of two young people, Michael and Lisa, as they try to figure out their relationship. Lisa is a high school girl, who struggles to find herself after a rough childhood. Michael is a college freshman, who is a bit naive, but has great potential. Michael struggles with his desire to fit in, and his desire for a real girlfriend. He also has an extremely hard time making a girl believe that he is a good guy. At first, I thought that Lisa and Michael would have a happy ending, but then I realized that Michael was actually the one who was in the wrong. Lisa eventually gets over Michael, and I think that she should be happy for him. However, the movie tries to paint a picture of a happy relationship, which is not true. The love story is a lot more complicated than it seems.  The movie's main conflict revolves around the idea of what it means to be a good person, and how to truly be a "good person". The movie's central theme is that of the importance of choice. If one makes a choice, they are in control of their life. But if one makes the wrong choice, one can easily find themselves in a bad situation. The main theme of the movie is that you must make a choice to be good. If you don't make the right choice, it will lead you to an unhappy ending. In this movie, the main character is Michael, who was raised by a single mother, who left him to live with his grandmother when he was ten. He was forced to deal with a very difficult childhood, which eventually led him to take his own life when he entered high school. This is a great example of a movie dealing with the importance that we have to make a decision to be better. It is important to note that Michael and his grandmother have no problems. Michael even calls his grandmother on the phone. Michael also makes the choice to go to college, despite the fact that he may have to leave his grandmother behind. Michael goes to college and becomes a great student, and becomes very popular in his small town. However Michael's life is not completely normal, because he has to constantly keep an eye on his grandmother. Michael's grandmother becomes very distant to him, and he is very sad. But Michael is determined to make

I don't know if it was just a bad script, a bad director, or just bad editing that made this movie so bad, but this movie did not live up to its potential. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ If you don't like the movie, just leave a bad review. That's the worst you can do. It will only make them hate you even more. Don't even think about it, don't give them a reason to write a bad one. It doesn't matter how great your movie is, they will say it's bad. So just don't bother. If they don't make a sequel to it, or they do, just move on to something else. There's nothing more to be said.  Helpful If you've got a bunch of people watching the movie and they are all in one place, it's really hard to have the movie be exciting and interesting. But with a good audience, that's not the case. And I thought that it was really great that the story was told in flashbacks. It's a good way to keep it exciting and keep the audience engaged. The movie's good, I don't know if it's up to my standards, but I thought it was a really good movie. I loved it. I just wish it had been a little more entertaining. I was so disappointed that this movie wasn't better. The acting was good, but not great. I thought the story and the characters were interesting, but that the ending was kind of dumb. I'm not sure what the point was of the movie. It had a good idea, and it was executed pretty well. The only thing that I found was kinda disappointing was the ending. I wish they would have ended the movie with the credits rolling. It was just a bit disappointing. I don' t know if I'm over analyzing it too much, but the ending really didn't do it for me. I guess it's my fault for not really watching the whole movie. But I really liked it, and I liked the ending that they used. It made sense, and made the ending more satisfying. I didn't really think it was very exciting, but it was interesting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________  I am glad I read this book because I wanted to like this movie. I have not seen it so I cannot comment on it but I was not a fan. I was just expecting it to be some boring action movie about a group of cops. I could have been wrong. It was not that. It had a great plot and some good action scenes. It wasn't a very good movie, but I guess that is what it is about. I just wish that the plot wasn't such a crap, stupid story. I thought it was about a guy that goes to a cop show and then goes to this place where the cops do drugs and have sex with women. The cops were not the bad guys in this story. The plot was really boring and the only thing I liked was the sex scenes. The sex was okay. The only other thing I thought was pretty cool was the cop that was going to be in a gang called the Red Dragons. The other gangs are a lot of hoes. This guy is a nice guy. I think I liked him better than the other cop. It is hard to believe that this movie made it out of the same studio that made "Police Academy" which I did not enjoy. It does not look like a good movie to me. I guess I am just going to wait and see the next one.  Rating: 5 out of 5

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ Write a positive review about the good movie:  How do I make a movie with a female lead and a strong female character? It's very hard to make a film that is strong.  I have seen a few films in which a strong woman was a central character, but they all failed to reach a high standard. In my opinion, a female character needs to be able to withstand all sorts of situations. This is what I believe is the biggest challenge. It's not just the physical strength, it's the psychological strength as well.  the film starts with a girl who is a good girl and a good student. However, this girl falls for a bad boy, a delinquent. But this delinquent is really a very weak character. The girl must go through so much hardship, and this character is very weak. This girl has to deal with all sorts situations, including the loss of a friend. This leads to some pretty difficult scenes. The film is about a girl, but the main character is not a girl. She is a man. This film has a great ending. However it does not have a very good beginning. This film is worth watching if you are interested in seeing a good film. It has some good action scenes. There is a very strong male lead in this film. I think he is one of the strongest female characters in a film in a long time. This movie is worth seeing. The movie is rated PG.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. I mean, it's a bad film, but there are so many things wrong with it. The acting is so bad, I didn't even enjoy it. I mean that's why it's rated PG-13. The special effects were pretty lame. I'm sorry to say it, but I was laughing the whole time. This film is a total waste of time and money. It's an average film that was made for $10,000 to be shown at a movie theater, and that's exactly what it was. I can't think of anything better to waste time on, except maybe a video game or something. The only thing I liked about it was when they say that the alien is a very, very old alien, and I thought that was cool. I don't even know what to say about this film. If you want to see something else, I suggest you see a good movie, and then see this film at home. I would recommend this film to no one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________ This movie sucks. Not only is it boring and not very interesting, it is a bad film. The actors who play the roles of two women are all good looking. I have no idea why they did this movie. It was awful. I really wanted to like it but I hated it. There is a part where the guy is doing drugs and they have to get him to stop. I hate drugs and I never do drugs. He gets arrested and then he gets a call and it turns out he is being charged with drug possession and is in jail. I would have had no problem with this but there is no point in him being there. I don't understand why the girls don't fight him off or something. He is very small so they have no way to hurt him. The movie is not even funny. I didn't laugh once. I'm not saying it was a good movie but it sucked. It had no story, no acting, nothing. I think this movie was made to be made into a sequel and I don;t know if that ever happened. I guess it is because it was so bad that it became a parody.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You don't know a damn thing about the movie. You might as well go watch the show, because you're not going to enjoy it, and you don't have any idea of what you're talking about.  - George Miller, director of "Mad Max: Fury Road"  The movie industry is a business, and they all make movies. That's what it is. We can't change it. There is no one who can make a movie better than we can.  and it's about people and what happens to them. So it has to be a movie, a story about people. And that's why they call it a novel. Because you have to have a story. If it's not a story, it's nothing. And I believe that's what the movie was, and it was an epic story about humanity.

The cast is just awful, and the acting is so bad, that I can't even call this a movie. If you want to watch a bad horror movie, this is probably the best choice.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________  I like this movie but there were too many clichés: _______________________________________________  It was too much: ______________________________ ... __________  "Cinema is all about how things look, and in this case, it was a lot of bad acting and a lot going on with too many characters, and a bunch of confusing scenes."  .  _____________________________________________  You're in for a surprise. The plot isn't about an alien abduction, it's about a child that's trying to cope with a mother's death. This movie is just like a good horror movie but the actors are so bad it's funny. You'll probably think of the alien as the real monster.   "They've made a great movie about a movie, but I'm sorry, it doesn't have anything to do with the movie."  the movie is very boring. It's a good movie but a terrible movie. It doesn't even tell a good story. It has a plot that isn't very original. It is just the story of the mother and her son. The boy gets possessed by a ghost. The mother doesn't get possessed by the ghost, but the ghost just keeps trying to get in her house and when the mother gets sick she kills her daughter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If it were to be made today it would be called "The Last of the Summer Wine." It's a good movie, and it does what it sets out to do. It's not the greatest movie, but it's not a bad one. The story is simple: The main character has a terrible time with a group of friends who have come to visit his sister. They have a great time, and they make out all night. The main problem is that the main character doesn't like them. He tries to sleep with them and they don't like him. When he finally gets tired of being with them he goes back home. He is alone and realizes that he is falling in love with his sister and he will never be able to tell her because he is going to die in a few days. He tells his parents and they are okay with it. After a while he is able to sleep again and they go back to the party. They try to seduce the main male character. He can't get an erection and tries to seduct the female. They fail. So they go to a restaurant where they go up to the table and the female is there and starts sucking his cock. He has to get up and leave because his parents are waiting for him. He goes back to his room and lays on his bed and thinks about his future. In the end he realizes he has to tell his parents that he doesn't want to be with his sisters anymore. He does it by making a video where he tells his sister that he has a huge crush on her. After that, the girl leaves and he is happy. He gets up the next day, makes a video and shows it to his parents. They accept his decision and he gets back on the party bus. They tell him he has ruined their night. They are all pissed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ I had high hopes for this movie because it was a "star" production. The lead actors were talented and the story was promising. It was the first movie I saw with an Asian lead, and I was impressed. It starts out with a strong opening and a lot of action, but that was all it had going for it. This movie was so slow that the first 30 minutes just dragged on. The movie would have been better if it had been shorter. The action scenes were also rather boring. The acting was okay, but not good enough to be believable. The plot was not interesting and I had a hard time caring about it. I have not seen any other Asian movies, so I can't comment on the story in the other movies. I think that the only reason I liked this movie is because of the lead actress. If I had to choose between her and another actress I would choose her.  ...
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________. ______________________________. _________________.  "My son has a severe case of autism and he has a very limited vocabulary. This is his only way of communicating. The only way I've been able to communicate with him is by reading aloud and he does a great job. It's sad that we had to go through all this. My husband was the only one who could relate to him and I was just trying to keep a lid on the situation."   This is a horrible movie. I think that the movie makers wanted to show the effects of autism. They made a movie about a young boy who suffers from autism. This boy can't speak but he makes great sounds by playing with his fingers. This sounds are called "Soundscapes" and you can hear them when they are played by the boy in the movie.   The movie starts with a soundscape of a boy and a toy truck driving along a dirt road. It looks like the truck is moving but the boy's voice is playing in the background making it look like the camera is moving the truck. I'm not sure what the truck looks like but it doesn't look like a truck. The soundscape has a similar sound to the movie "Fletch" which is a comedy that features a little girl with autism. The movie makers thought this was a great way to make a movie with autism in it.   the movie starts out with the kid playing with a toy toy truck. Then the truck turns into a car. The guy drives the truck and talks to the kid.   is it supposed to show how hard it is for a person with autism to talk?   As the movie continues it looks like he is talking to the little girl and it doesn´t seem like he was talking to her. When he goes into a store it doesn`t look like he knows the people in the store and he doesn´ts understand what they are saying. The other characters seem like they have no idea what he is saying. They just act like he didn´t know anything. When the little boy starts to play with the girl, the guys in the car seem like nothing is happening. Then he starts to talk to her, but when the girl starts to cry the guy in the truck says something to the girl and the truck just drives off. The truck just leaves the scene. This movie does nothing but make a mockery of autism, the movie maker should have known that he was

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "My boyfriend is the worst! He never listens to me when I say something that might annoy him. I know this is a good movie, but he just doesn't like it. So I gave this one a shot, and he couldn't even see the movie through my eyes. He was like, "this is so stupid" and left to watch something else." The movie itself is an interesting watch as well. You know that moment in a movie where it's a classic, but you're too lazy to sit through it to find out why it's such a classic? That's what this movie is to me. The music is great, the acting is good and the plot is interesting. However, I have to give the ending credit as well, it was really cool! I loved it when I was watching it, and was wondering what would happen after the movie ended. The ending was very touching, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it as well!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ __________  "The worst movie I've seen in years." - Jeff D.  (This review is for the first 4 minutes)   The movie opens with a voiceover by a narrator explaining the premise of the film: The "Greatest Movie Ever Made", "The Greatest Movie Ever Written" and "The Most Beautiful Movie Ever Produced", all are about an all-powerful, all-knowing, all powerful, all knowing, all seeing God, all power, all goodness, all being, all good, all love, all truth, all perfect, all creation, all life, all the way down to the atomic level, all beauty, all peace and love and justice for all. : The narrator, or God, or whatever the hell this is, has decided to create an all powerful being (it's not explained) so that we can watch movies and listen to music and all that. So, it's up to the human race to figure out who this god is and to take control of the planet.    Now, the movie is a classic horror movie in the sense that it does all the usual things that horror movies do. The plot, the monsters, the special effects, the acting, the music, and the special people in the film. The problem with this movie is that there is no logic in the plot. There's no reason for anything. It's just mindless violence, murder, and destruction. It really just tries to be the biggest, stupidest movie it can possibly be. This movie is like a nightmare that you can't wake up from. It is so insane that it's kind of funny. And I don't mean to pick on the movie, I'm just giving my honest opinion of the movie.   It's so stupid that it really makes me sick. There is no reasoning or logic behind any of it. The movie is just a huge mess of chaos and stupidity. It makes me wonder if it was made by an 8 year old.  , the only thing I have to say about this movie are these two quotes. I think the movie's creator, director, and co-writer was trying to get the point across in this movie: "We are the most beautiful creation ever created. Our beauty makes you uncomfortable."   This movie is so stupid, so pointless, and so ridiculous, that it makes me wish that this movie never existed. It would be one of the

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  There's a lot of bad movies in the world, so it's very easy to be angry and upset about them. If you are not, though, you'll learn something from them. This article is about a good movie that made me angry, and you'll probably learn a lot about yourself and your relationship to the world around you. You may even find that your own feelings about bad movies change, which is awesome.  The movie was written by a guy who wrote all the dialogue in the movie. If it wasn't, there wouldn't be a lot to complain about. The movie is called 'The Human Centipede', and it's a remake of a movie called 'Centipede 2', which was released in 1993. . 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________________________________________________________ This was my first ever time to a film festival and I wasn't too sure what to expect, but the day was amazing. I came here to watch the "Dark Knight" on the big screen, but I wasn the only one there. I love the fact that I got to see it on the huge screen. It is definitely not for the faint of heart, but it's great to see how different and dark Batman can be. The movie starts off slow, but once Bruce Wayne has a vision of his father being killed by a gang, he is on a mission to find and destroy the gangs. Bruce Wayne is the perfect guy to be the Batman, he's intelligent, brave, and a little bit crazy. The thing that really made me enjoy the movie was the acting, it's pretty good. You see how each actor is acting, which is something I don't think most people are capable of doing. The script is pretty good as well. It's really a great read, the movie has a nice action scene and I really liked the way they put in some humor in there. It was a great start to a new trilogy for Christopher Nolan. __________________________________________________________________  The only bad thing about this movie is the soundtrack is awful. The music is terrible. I hate this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________________  It is a great experience, but the plot and acting is just so bad, that it just made me so upset. It is like the movie was made for a small group of people and was just a piece of crap to try and entertain them. I am a real fan of the movies that I have seen, but this is just a huge disappointment, and I wish they would make a new movie! ______________________________________________________________________________  Wow this movie is pretty terrible, I was really hoping that this would be a good movie, but instead it just felt like a shitty sequel. The actors did a terrible job, but you could tell that the director didn't really give a shit about it, because it is just bad acting and a terrible plot. The ending is terrible, and the movie just feels really fake and like it's just made to try to make some money. It does feel like a sequel, and that's really sad. I'm not sure if the director was trying to be funny or just trying to make the movie more realistic and made the ending a little better. I can see why it was made as a sequel though, because the movie is actually pretty good, so it just makes me wonder why they made this instead of a better movie. _____________________________________________________________________  I really liked the first movie, so when I saw the sequel I was disappointed, it was a really poor idea to make a sequel to a good original, and if you're going to make it a sequel that's even worse. The acting was atrocious, and even though the story was good, it just didn't hold up. The movie was also really bad in it's music, I could never get into it. I've never seen a bad sequel, but I would never recommend this movie, it's terrible and not worth watching. ______________________________________  of 5 stars for entertainment only.  ______________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* If you like bad movies, this is a good one to start with. It's a little slow, but it gets more intense towards the end.  "In the Name of the Father" is the latest feature film from the Italian director Federico Fellini, a master of the genre. The story revolves around a mother (Bianca Jagger) and her child (Clement Abrantes) as they are forced to leave their home town in Sicily for a new life in France. The film begins with the arrival of the child, who has a severe case of gastroenteritis, and quickly moves to the mother's attempts to conceal the illness. It is a dark and gritty film, but the story is ultimately uplifting. "I've always wanted to make a film about a child being sick. That was the main reason why I took on the film. I knew that the film could be a beautiful work of art. The movie tells the story of the life of an ordinary man. He does nothing special, and yet he has an extraordinary destiny."  This is a film that I can't say that I have seen before. The storyline is interesting and the director seems to have a lot of talent. .

I never understood how they could turn it into a terrible movie. They did it to themselves. There was nothing left in the tank and the acting was horrible. I had no idea they had any other ideas. I felt like the whole movie was just them running out of ideas. This is the worst Star Trek film in my opinion. I can't believe that this movie was made and made by people who really believed in what they were doing.

Sylvester Stallone   Syrvester's "The Expendables" is the worst movie of the year so far. The plot has nothing going for it. It's a story about a group of guys going to the Himalayan Mountains in order to hunt down and kill a guy who has killed a few people. When they get there, he's already killed the people who were there before and has a bunch of women as his wife and kids.   There are no stakes, no stakes at all. It just goes on and on, with no real reason for why these guys have to go through with the mission. They get a bunch more people and kill some more people, but there is no sense of urgency or sense of danger or sense that they're in danger of losing their lives. The guy has no reason to want them to come back for him. There is no reason why the guy has to die, because he killed the guy before they even got there. There's no reason for him to go back and do anything about it, because there was no reason he had to go there.  . ,,,,,,, (and I know I've said this a million times but it's worth saying again),,, ________. _______________________________.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "My friends and I loved the movie, but the acting was atrocious."  Well, if that's not a bad film, I don't know what is.  I can't say that I would have liked to have seen more of that one, but I will say that the acting is a huge problem for this film.      "This is a film that will make you cry"  No, I'm not crying.  1.   Passion  - It is an action movie, and I know I'm supposed to say something about it being a good one.  But in the case of this film, there is nothing good about it.  It is not a good action movie because it is not well-acted.  The acting in this film is just terrible.  And the reason that this film gets one star is that the film doesn't do anything special.  In fact, the film has very little to do.  When it comes to the action, it is very well done.  However, this is the only reason that the movie gets a one star.  You know why?   Because it doesn't tell a good story.    This is the best way that a film can die.  One word:   2.  Fanny  (1978)  The best way to say that this is a bad and pointless movie is that I just don't even know where to begin.  As soon as I saw this film I was like, "What the heck is going on in this movie?"   The movie starts off in the middle of a desert.  There is a lot of sand and a lot more desert than you usually see in a movie.  This film starts out with a man who is trying to find a woman.  He decides to take a road trip with his dog to find her.  Eventually, he and his dog find a girl, but he doesn't want to get in the car and drive to her house.  So, he decides to walk there.  Then, he finds a house and his mother is there.   And what is the first thing that I noticed about the mother in this flick?  Her head.  She has this crazy, crazy, giant, round head.   Now, I know that the mother has an insane personality, but that doesn't stop her from being a huge head. It's

As if this review was not enough to convince you, here is another: I do not have much to say about this movie. It is a complete and utter failure. It has no redeeming quality and is only there because of the ridiculous amount of hype that surrounds it. I saw this movie when it was first released and I remember thinking it looked pretty cool. Then I saw it again a few years later and thought it was a good idea for a film. However, I was completely wrong. I will now proceed to discuss the film's story and why I think it was made the way it was.The story starts off with Neo and Morpheus, two humans living on a train who are on their way to the "City of Light" where Neo has been sent. Morpheus has had enough of his life as a slave to a woman named Trinity, who is in love with him. He wants to leave her and she does not want him to leave. Trinity is a rich and powerful woman who was once the most powerful being on the planet, but now is a slave for Morpheus. She even gives Morpheus a ring as a token of her love. Now, Neo is a computer program who has been imprisoned by Trinity for a reason that we do not know. However when they arrive in the City of Light, Morpheus decides that he wants Neo to come with him to the surface to save his own life. However this would mean that Morpheus would lose his life, which is why he decides to let Neo stay with him as a virtual prisoner. However Neo decides that his life will not be the same without Morpheus and so he leaves to the City.The movie follows the story of Neo, Mor pheus, and Trinity, as they go through the City and learn of its strange inhabitants and what is happening. The main plot line is that Neo has to learn to accept his reality and to not feel the need to be anything but what he is. He eventually learns to accept the fact that he is a human and can love people and even have sex with them. Mor phus is the first one to learn this lesson as he realizes that he needs Neo. But he also realizes that the only way to save Neo from his own reality is to kill him. This is done by Trinity who uses her powers of manipulation and

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________   (Note: I only watched this movie in its original 35mm version. The only reason I am posting about it is because this is one of the rare times I saw a film that really took me out of the movie. It is an amazing story and an awesome movie. I am very proud of this review and my rating of this movie. However, it does have some flaws and it is very hard to see at times. The picture quality is pretty good and the sound is fine. It will definitely make you feel like you are on a journey. The story is amazing and the music is also great. However this movie is not for everyone. It does take you away from the movie for a while, and sometimes I felt that it was a bit too long. But this is a great movie and if you love adventure movies, then you will love this movie.)   This is a very dark and serious film. There are many times in this movie where it is hard to watch. I have to admit that this movie makes me feel very sad. The character of Will (played by Tom Cruise) is so very serious and sad. He is not a hero, but he is a good man. He has done some bad things, but has done them out of necessity and has learned from it. However it is a bit hard to relate to Will in this film. He makes a lot of mistakes, but you never see him do anything wrong. He just makes mistakes. I think he makes the biggest mistake in the movie when he decides to go into the ocean with a bunch of people who are not all right. It doesn't make sense for Will to go in there, he knows that the ocean is dangerous, but I do think it is his decision to go there. The film ends a bit badly for Will and I did not really understand why he had to leave the group and take on the job. I guess it could be because he had just been rejected and I think that was a bad move on his part. He does try to find a way out of that situation, but in the end he just ends up losing all of his friends. It seems that he is going through a lot in this story, but it is not very clear. I thought that he was a great character, and Tom Cruise is a brilliant actor. He was perfect for this movie and I loved him. (Note: This movie does take a very long time to get through.

My favorite character is the crazy woman who likes to throw knives and is never seen without a man. She is the only one who doesn't look or act like a prostitute.   3. I thought the ending was interesting.   a. My only problem with the movie is that the ending is not very satisfying. I found the ending not as funny as the movie. I would give it 5 stars but I didn't like the ending. b. The movie was too slow. I felt like the whole movie could have been cut in half. c. I don't think the movie would have been as good without the crazy girl. d. The sex scenes were not that good. They were good when they were used but they were not as good as the other sex scenes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ It is always sad to see an aging star such as Robert Redford lose a little bit of his spark, but I don't feel like I missed much from his performance here. He is very good in the role of a man who has just discovered his life partner. He's not afraid to speak his mind or have a bit of a drink when the mood strikes him, and that's how I like to see Redford. He was always a good character actor, but this is his best film. I also think that the film was more successful if they had cast someone other than Redford, and there are some good performances here. I think he does an excellent job of bringing out the character of the man and the woman who he is living with. It is a great film, and you should see it. Just watch it, and let me know what you think about it. _______________________________________________________________________

There's nothing that really works in this movie. It is not funny and it is not exciting. It has no story or characters. It simply has a bunch of bad actors acting in bad roles. There are some scenes in this film that are just not funny. I didn't find anything in this show that made me laugh out loud.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ What I did not like about this movie was the acting. The actors had no chemistry. The lead actors are all kind of like each other. They just looked at each other all the time. That is why I didn't care about their chemistry. This is the most over the top action movie I have seen. This movie was just a waste of time and I hope they get a big budget to make a real movie. There was a lot of blood and violence in this movie. The movie was also a very confusing. I had no idea what was going on. I know that is not a bad thing because I am a fan of action movies, but that just confused me. It just confused the hell out of me. The plot was also pretty boring. It was also not a very good movie. I think it should of been called "The Dirty Dozen" I really did not enjoy this movie at all. I would have rather seen something else. I was really bored. I am not sure if they were trying to make me watch the movie for real or not. Maybe if I had watched the movie on television I would of had more fun with it. The ending of the movie was not good either. I have to admit that I felt that this movie had a better ending. But, this movie could have been so much better. I hope that they don't make a sequel to this movie and I am sure that they would have a better movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What is wrong with people? Why are people like this? Do they not have the intelligence to be able to realize what they are doing? This is a total waste of your time and I would advise you to avoid watching this. You will not enjoy it and will probably be annoyed by the movie. I wish I could give it 0 stars but it is just a waste of time and money. It is nothing more than a poorly made B-movie with no plot or any character development. You have no clue what the movie is about other than it has a bunch of teenagers running away from a bad teacher and they end up in a house with a bad babysitter.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know that I would have done it if I were to do it today.  I was a teenager in the late 80s when I saw the movie and I don't remember it very well.  It's not a bad film, but it's not very good either.  The actors do a very good job, but the story is all wrong.  As I said, it's a pretty good story, but you just don't see the magic in it.  If you're going to make a movie about a movie, then make it a good one.  Not a bad one, but not a very great one either. I'm not going to pretend that I have a good idea of what makes a good movie, but if you were going to do a movie called "My Favorite Movie" (as I suspect many people would think it is) then you'd better have a very well-written script.  That is the only way that it's going to get made.  But then, who wants to make an "My Most Memorable Movie" as a movie?  It would be too easy to just make a cheesy movie. There are some good things in it, such as the opening scene, but there are also some bad things.  One thing that is very clear is that the writer was a fan of the "Star Wars" franchise.  This is apparent in the story, and the fact that he thought up the concept of the film's title.  He used the words "My Best Movie" in the script. As I said in the beginning, I'm not a huge fan of Star Wars, but I like to see it on the big screen.  So I can see that the movie was meant to be like the movie.  When you have a well-made movie like this, you just know it's good.  There are a lot of things that you don't expect in a movie like that.  And I have to say that I'm impressed.  Although, I know that it would be easy to make this movie and not do anything else with it. "My Best" is the best of the three.  "The Worst" is also a good film.  Unfortunately, it has some flaws that I can't really say I like.  Still, it did make me smile.  You have to admit, that was a pretty funny film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________   I thought it was good. I loved the characters and I thought the director was awesome. I can't wait to see the sequel! I have seen a couple of reviews saying it's good but not as good as the first. I think the first one was much better. I'd like to see what happened to the main character and who he really is.   If you don't know, this movie is a remake of a movie that was made about a year or so ago. It was made by the same people that made the first movie. I thought it would be better and I'm glad that it was. This is the sequel and it's pretty much the same. It's a movie about a guy that was a policeman, but he was a bit too rough on some of the people he had to arrest. Now he's retired and living alone and doesn't like to get involved in any kind of crime anymore. When he meets an old woman he calls "Molly", she says she's his niece. She tells him she wants to move to his neighborhood. He says she doesn't know where she's going and doesn´t like her at all. But she's the only person that knows where he lives. The police don't seem to know where he is either. He goes to the police station and he finds out that his neighbor has been killed. He thinks that the murderer is her but it turns out that it´s actually a burglar who broke into her house and killed her. He doesn't want to be found, but after he has a talk with the police he tells them about the killer and they take him to Molly's house. When they go to the house, they find that the killer has been there for some time and he has taken a woman from the house and locked her in the basement. They go back to the station and they find out that the police are searching for her too. The detective that takes them there is a guy named "Jaws" and he is going to arrest Molly. He asks Jaws to take him there but he tells him to get out of the car and go to her house. But when they go there, they meet a guy called "The Bully". They take him in too but Jaws says that he will arrest Molly first. The Bully tells Jaws that the man who did this is the son of a local businessman who lives in the same neighborhood as them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* It's a comedy. A very funny comedy. It is funny because it has to be. It's not like the others I've seen. It has to do with the fact that there's no real plot to speak of, and the movie is so self-referential. And it's not that it is a bad film, but the way they use the camera and the way the characters act, makes me feel like I'm watching someone else's movie. The whole movie is a gag. It doesn't make any sense. You have to look hard to understand it. It was a good idea in theory, but in practice it was a joke. I don't know if the director intended it that way, but it worked. I'm not the type of person who likes to watch a movie and be told to laugh at it, so I never got the joke. When it's funny, it's very funny. And when it's really bad, it gets really bad. So it was both a good and bad experience. I was laughing at a lot of the jokes. The actors were very good, though, and I didn't think they were trying to be funny. It just wasn't a very funny movie, I don`t know what they were thinking.  Was this helpful?  1 out of 1 found this helpful.  the camera never looks right. it is very soft. the music and sound effects are just ok. it makes the movie seem silly. .

I liked the movie but not so much for the cast and the story. ______________ If the movie was a bad actor, it was bad. ______________________ The only good movie is the movie you have never seen. The only bad movie is a bad actress.  Ralphie May 29, 2014 | 3:k AM The only reason I watched this movie was to see how this actress, Michelle Monaghan, looked like she was in one of her "crap" movies. Michelle Monagh is an actor I've always been fascinated by and she was a great star in a film that was filled with stars, some of whom were just not good. She was a good actress and I like her a lot. I would not watch a movie just for Michelle Monahan. ______________________________ I'm sure that she was acting at a level that the studio was paying her. But she had never acted like that before and it showed. I also would not say that she looked like a bad star, just like any actress. But I would say she was way overrated. I am sure there were many better actresses that were just too cheap to do a movie like this. ______________________________________________________ If you can't get a good star, then you might as well get a bad one. This was the only good star they could find. I guess the studios knew they had an actress they could get away with and that she would be easy to sell because she had such a bad reputation. _____________________________________________________________________ I don't know about the actors that did the film, but I don"t like this movie and it really was a waste of time. The cast was so mediocre that I really felt like they could have made a better film. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but it was so bad I was glad I didn't watch it. _____ I was really surprised when I saw the reviews of this film. It looked like I was in an old movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If a film is bad, it doesn't mean the film is not worth seeing. If the movie has a good story, it can be great. If it is bad (or even just mediocre), it still has the ability to entertain. That is what this film did to me. I don't know what happened to the original and I have no idea what this remake is trying to do. I can't tell if the actors were paid or if they were paid too much. If they are supposed to be playing the same characters, then it doesn;t make any sense. The only reason I watched this movie is because of the premise. I like the idea of this movie. It was entertaining, and I didn't feel bad about it. It's just that the execution was not great. I really don't see why anyone would go to see this movie if it is going to be that bad. I will admit that I liked it a lot more when I read the synopsis on IMDB.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just as bad, if not worse.  If this were a real movie, it would have been called "The Sigh of the Southerners."  For real.   That's how bad it is.  I have been thinking about this movie a lot.     The characters are completely flat and boring.  For a movie called "Wet Hot American Summer," the actors do an absolutely abysmal job.  The movie doesn't have a lot of character development.  It takes place over a few days in a summer camp, and a few of the characters are a little annoying.  At first, I thought they were trying to create an atmosphere that felt like the camp was going to be the setting of a movie, but then the actors just came across as uninteresting.  There is a lot going on in this movie, and it's never explained or brought to the screen.  This is also a movie about the end of a friendship.  So the characters just don't have anything going on with them.  These characters are boring. It was hard to follow.  One of the best parts of this movie is the soundtrack.  I know a lot people say they don't like the soundtrack of a comedy, but I think that's the best part of the soundtrack, the songs.  They are so great.  Some of the songs are great, and some are great.   I have to say that if you are into the music, this is the movie for you.  You should listen to the songs from this movie as often as you can.   They are the best soundtrack in the movie. This is a movie I could see a lot worse than it actually is.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ I am not a big fan of horror films, but this one has a few good parts to it. It was definitely the only movie I saw in the theater this year. The characters were all likable, and the plot wasn't too complicated. The ending, where the main character is forced to go back to his hometown to see his mom after his dad leaves her to go to college in another state, was very disappointing, as I was expecting to see her getting on with her life and not feeling so alone in her grief. I also felt that the director didn't give the ending enough time to be fully realized, and in a way it was a little anticlimactic. I really liked the music, and I liked the acting. I will say though, that the movie could have been better if the characters were given more time. And I think the acting was not as good as it could have have been. Overall I would say that this movie was worth a watch, especially if you like horror. I just wish that it was given more of a chance to really come to life, and had some more suspense and mystery. _____________________________ Score: 2 out of 10 _______________________________ Watch a horror movie for free on YouTube. ___________________________________________ Update: ______________________________________ I did a quick YouTube search for this movie and found a more recent review, which has a lot of good things to say about the movie.

Kevin and his father's relationship is portrayed quite well, and they have some interesting discussions. The plot was not really anything too exciting, but I liked that the story followed a somewhat interesting and realistic path. The movie also features some great music, such as "What Does This Button Do?" by The Cars. ______________________ Update: It has been a long time since I've watched a horror film, so it was great to finally get to watch this one.

The mother asks her if she is all right and she answers "no" but the mother tells her she will be fine. The two women go to the living room where they sit and talk. The woman tells her that she was in a car accident and was hurt and that she will get better. The girl tells her father that she is okay and the father tells the girl she will too. The young girl sits and waits. In the bedroom, the father is having a conversation with the young girl. She tells her mother that she does not want to be with the man and that he does not deserve her. The man says that he did not do anything wrong and that they are not going to have sex. The family says that they have had a long, happy marriage and that the man did not abuse the young woman. The younger man says the older man did abuse her and she wants to leave. The older man says he did no wrong and she should not leave. She says that she loves him and that if she does go, it will be a bad thing. The next day the family gets up and goes to the hospital to see the young lady. The nurse tells them that the young man is there and asks if the older woman is going to be fine too. She is, but she is also worried about her daughter. The men says that it is okay for them to go to see their children and that there is no reason for them not to. The doctor tells them to be careful. The parents leave the room, but they are stopped by the father who says that their daughter is not all right. The sister comes out and says that her sister is sick and needs to go back to her mother. The husband says that the father needs to leave and the older mother asks if she can
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ The only real reason why I give this movie a 2 is because I feel like it was a poor man's version of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. The film was pretty good and was a nice little fantasy movie, but it lacked a lot of the charm and fun of that other movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  The only reason why the movie has been good for so long is because the characters are so likable.  My favorite is probably Tom Hanks, because he plays a character that I like. , who is always a smart and funny guy. He is in a relationship with a woman who doesn't like him. When he finally finds out about her affair, he takes her back. - They don't give him a chance to save her, and it's a shame because he really wanted to. I'm glad the movie made it clear that they're friends and they're good for each other. He does what he has to do, but the ending doesn't feel satisfying.  and the two guys are a bit too annoying. I think I've seen the movie three times. I loved the first one, but I didn't love the second one. I think I saw it in the theater when I was younger. I don't remember what the movie was about. The ending felt too unsatisfying. I was hoping they'd do a movie in the future. The movie has a really nice soundtrack, and I enjoyed the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ I was so excited for this movie, and the trailers were pretty cool too. This is a pretty bad movie. It is just a bunch of random, boring, uninteresting, over the top events. The movie starts off with a great introduction, where there is a really cool futuristic looking city. The main character, a guy, starts the movie in a prison. We are told that he was in a race against the clock to get back to his city, but he never did. The city is now a giant desert and the only way to get out is to climb the tower of the city, which takes a lot of energy. The guy climbs the tower, and then he sees a girl on top. She is a girl with wings and he sees her in his dreams all the time. He then starts to see her in reality and he goes to the police, but they are not interested. The police officer at the end of the movie is a cop that was killed by the girl. I think the whole movie is just about seeing her in dreams. She starts to kill people, and he gets really scared. When he gets back to the city he tells the police that she killed him. The whole movie was just a lot about her killing people and getting caught. She was like a real killer. After that the story becomes about a woman named the Queen who has the wings of a bird and is supposed to be a witch. She wants to have control over the world. The Queen tries to get to the top of the tower by killing people. The bad part is that the people on the top don't seem to care. When she gets to the bottom of the Tower she finds a guy who has fallen down the tower and is very much dead. She tries to save him, but the people in the tower are afraid of her. The last part of the film was all about the queen being killed by a demon. I wasn't very happy with this part. It seemed to be the Queen's way of getting revenge on the demon, because he tried to kill her when he first came to the tower. Overall I found this movie to be very boring. I would not recommend this movie for people who like fast action, action packed movies. If you want to see a really good movie then go see the movies in the Harry Potter series.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Nov 28, 2017 4:59 PM by Anonymous Filed under movie.  1 - 4 of 4  Cancel  VIRGIN  The first time we see "The Wolf of Wall Street" is when Jordan Belfort, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is sitting at a table at a Wall Street dinner party. His hand is on his hip as he watches a man he just met, played to perfection by Jonah Hill, flirting with his date.  "You don't like me?" Hill asks.  in a way that suggests he is in over his head. . 's, the movie's title, comes from Belfort's book "The Accidental Mastermind." The man who would go on to become the poster boy for Wall Street and the subject of a book and film about the financial crisis (as well as the HBO miniseries "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button") was a man who had no business being in Wall Street, but that was his destiny. He was born to be a successful trader, which he was and still is, as evidenced by the millions he's made.  a self-made man who found himself at the heart of a financial crisis. But in the end, it's Belfort himself who finds himself in deep trouble, not his friends, not even his wife, played with incredible nuance by Marisa Tomei.  the woman who loves and trusts him, even though she's always been skeptical of his good intentions. The movie was based on Belfort (played by DiCaprie) himself, and it's clear that he is the one who got caught in the web.  of course, Belfort had to pay for his sins. He went to jail for a long time and is now in the process of serving a 20-year sentence. And yet, the way DiCapricos portrays him, he's the victim of a criminal justice system that, he argues, failed him. The movie, which is based on the book "Wolf of Wall St.," by Michael Lewis, is a fascinating account of the rise and fall of a brilliant man. DiCaprio plays Belfort and he delivers the goods in a terrific performance. DiCaprice has a very dark and very compelling look. He doesn't look like a stockbroker or a stock trader, but like the devil himself, a sadistic

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Feb 2, 2017 8:22 PM by Tim O'Brien in Entertainment | 0 comments  I can't believe the way this movie turned out. It was so bad that I have to admit that it made me laugh out loud. The movie had all the hallmarks of a great disaster, but it was really bad.  When I first saw this movie, I thought it was a great way to teach a little class about sex and gender roles. But it turned out to be one of the most boring, dull and frustrating movies I have ever seen. The main character was so boring that I could barely remember anything about him or her. He was just another boring guy in a bad show, that was trying to teach us something about sex. I don't know how they could have done that. It really makes you wonder if the director and writer ever even watched a single porn film before they made this movie. The sex scenes in this movie are so boring and over-produced that it's like watching porn with an extra hour of scenes.  and I really hate to say it, but the movie was so poorly made that I really hope it never gets a theatrical release. The acting is just so terrible.  (Posted by Tim on Feb 2nd 2017)  This is one of those movies that makes you feel like you are watching a porno. I had trouble focusing on the movie. I mean the acting is atrocious and it is just boring. I have seen some movies where they are over-written and overacted, but I have never seen a movie with such a poorly written story. I am really disappointed that they were able to get a movie like this made. It is just sad that they actually made this. I will never see it again. , (Posted on Dec 26th 2016)

They're about lives, and experiences, and moments. They capture something about the human experience that's unique to each person and each life. They tell stories of the past and the future. They make us look at the people we love and wonder what it's like to be them. They connect us with the past. They give us an understanding of how our world works. They bring us into the lives of characters we love. And they remind us how much more there is to learn.

That's where the characters in this movie live. The man in this story was not only mentally ill but he was also a serial killer. In fact, he is responsible for a total of three murders. The movie's main character is portrayed as an asshole. He was also the one who killed the victim who was found stabbed to death. The other characters in the movie are nothing more than extras. They were just used to further the plot. There is nothing special about them. The only thing that they do well is acting. __________________  "I do not know why you did not like me. I am an idiot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's not just that the movie itself is bad. It's not even just that it's a terrible movie. It is a terrible film. A film that is about the worst kind of racism and sexism that has ever been committed against a woman, and a film that will likely not be remembered for its great cast. It will, however, be remembered as the worst film in a career full of them. This is not the first time a film about racism has been such a trainwreck. This movie is so bad, in fact, that it makes the entire decade of films about racism in America look like a piece of crap.  What I am about to say may sound ridiculous. It may seem as though I'm saying that a movie that is so horrible it should be ignored, but the truth is I really mean it. What is there to say about a movie about racism that doesn't involve all the things that this film does? Racism is not a funny movie, and I do not care that it is. It should never be funny. I think a good example of this is when a character is asked why he doesn't believe that it was the white man who killed him, and the character says he doesn,t believe it. If he doesn?t believe that he was killed by a white man, then he wouldn't believe he was murdered by a black man. Racism should be understood through the lens of its own historical context. I want to know what it was like to be a black person in America when slavery was still going on. When black people were being lynched. When there were so many black people that were lynched, that we literally had no black people left. Racists are not funny. Racers are not interesting. . 1. The main character, Dwayne (Colin Farrell) is a white guy, who decides to try to become a black guy. He is successful, but then he realizes he has no black friends, and then he decides to become the black guy, but that just makes him an outcast. This isn?t funny, it is just not funny, but this is what makes it so horrible. I don't think I could make this film. I can only imagine what the audience of this film was thinking, and it was just bad. The only reason I can even watch this film is because I can laugh about the way it treats its own history

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________, then write about a good movie:_________. This will be your life and your children's life. And you will know what the good is. Don't let this happen to you. It's that bad. If you want to learn about how to make a good film, read the filmography of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Both have worked on every type of film and both are masters of story telling. Steven Spielberg has made several of the best movies ever. George Lucas has made some of the greatest movies ever made. And if you have to pick, they are both good films. The reason why I say that they are good films is because they have a lot of heart and heartbreak. Spielberg and Lucas have a great relationship and they have been together for many years. They are very close friends and they are like a family. They know how to write a good story and how to get the actors to have a good time. Spielberg also has a great vision for the films. He will make the best of the resources he has and he is a very loyal person. This is not all about Spielberg. Lucas has also made some good films that are very good. The good thing is, that George Lucas is a better story teller than Spielberg. And he is also a much better writer. It is good to learn from both of them. If someone is telling you about how bad the movie was, don't believe them. They may be right and you may be wrong. When I first saw this movie I was very disappointed. I was also really sad. I have seen some movies that are better than this one. But this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I'm not saying it is bad. But it is not good. I did not enjoy it and I thought it was bad. I thought that they had really wasted their money. I wish they had spent that money making a good, exciting, entertaining film. This movie was a waste of money. This could have been a wonderful movie. It could have made a lot more money than it did. If they had made a good good film that was really good. It would have been great. But they didn't make that film. So what happened? They just spent all their money on the marketing of the movie and didn't spend any money on making a real good movie. I am not saying that this is the only movie that has problems. There are plenty of movies that have problems

If you're going to have an opinion about movies, and if you have the chance to give a movie a negative rating, don't do it.  I've seen a couple of the other reviews for the other movies, but the ones that I've seen are the ones I'm going to comment on. This is not an excellent film, but I'd argue that it's one of the best films I've ever seen. I know I'm in the minority when I say that this movie is worth watching, and it may be that the more I watch this, the more it becomes apparent. The movie is about a man who is trying to get to the bottom of a case, where the body of a woman is found in the middle of the desert, and then the case starts to get worse and worse. The man is trying desperately to find the girl who is involved with this case, and the man who found her, but it's very clear that he's doing it wrong. The whole movie is full of these scenes that are incredibly disturbing, and really bring out the worst in the characters, especially the man trying to find her. It is very much a psychological thriller, and while the case itself is fairly straightforward, the way that it is played out, and how the characters react to it, makes it so much more disturbing. It has a lot of great performances, but one of my favorite performances comes from the man, who is played by Paul Walker. He has a great performance here, and I found myself thinking a lot about the movie as I was watching it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ The worst movie ever, made by a guy who doesn't know what he's doing, or care about it. If you've seen it, then you know what this movie is all about. There's no tension, no tension at all. If there is any tension in the film at all, it's that one of the main characters, who is a very bad actor, makes a comment in the middle of the film, and everyone in the audience laughs at him. He was so bad at acting that the audience laughed at him for it. This is all the movie is about. One of the characters tries to get the other to make love to her (which she doesn't want to do), and at one point she goes to the bathroom to look at her body in the mirror, and a guy comes in and he says something to her, which she can't understand. Then he leaves. The other character then tells the other character to come back to the bedroom, and the other characters start making out. Then they get caught in the act, and she has to get rid of the body. The guy says, "It's not right to take my body. You should get rid and then take my wife." So the other girl gets in her car and drives away, and then he gets in his car and says, he says, I don't know where I am, but I'm gonna get you back, and he takes off. This movie is so stupid that I can't even make this up, because there are so many things that are so stupid in this movie. Then the movie ends, and this guy who's in the car, turns around and the film starts over. If I had known this was going to be a movie, I would have never seen it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie where a guy who is a master of the black art of murder kills another guy because the other guy is a coward. The movie is so bad that it's a wonder they even bothered to release it. It's bad enough that it should have been called "Badass" but they thought "Bad Ass" would be too violent, even though the guy who killed the other dude was clearly an evil psychopath. So I guess you could call this "Evil" if you think that murdering another person is the "right" way to live your life, and I guess it is. But that is not what this movie is about. It is about how evil people have to be to survive, and how evil is defined as "wanting to kill other people." And that is the problem with all of the other movies I have watched, "Fury Road," "The Lone Ranger," "Conan the Barbarian," "G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra" and the list goes on. These movies are all about how bad the villains are, and it's never about their evilness, it's about them being bad at their job. This movie is not about being evil, it is about being a bad ass. And it's pretty fucking funny. It also has a really cool opening scene that involves a bunch of people getting shot in the face, but it's so bad and over-the-top that I didn't even care. It makes no sense, it just looks like the bad guy is going to kill a bunch more people until the bad guys finally realize that they are about to be killed and then they just stand there, like "I don't care if I die." And then they get their guns, so they can shoot the baddies. I love the scene where the baddie shoots the badder guy in the stomach with a crossbow. I mean, I guess they could have shot the baddest bad guy in this movie, the badass, and then the bad ass would have died in a hail of bullets, but then it would have been boring. I was so excited when this guy shoots the guy with the crossbow, and he looks so much like the character he killed that it was like a scene out of "The Crow." And they didn't kill him with a hail, they shot him in the chest. I know this movie was supposed to be about the war, but this was more about the death of a

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ ___________ __________ The worst movie I have seen in a long time. The story was really bad, I felt it was all made to make a big splash at the Oscars and not have a good movie. The acting was really awful. There was nothing funny about this movie. They had some cool scenes in it but they were all just stupid. I feel like the people who made this were just trying to sell a movie for a big amount of money. I think if they had a good script and a good director they would have had a better movie. I wish they had done a good job making a good looking movie with a great director, a good cast and great acting. I just don't think they were doing anything right. It wasn't funny, it was stupid, it wasn't a movie. It was all to try to get a better Academy Award.

It's one of those movies that are always there, waiting for you to notice it and remember it.

I'm a big fan of the film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This movie was terrible. It was like a bad episode of The Twilight Zone. It started out good but it was downhill from there. The story was horrible. It had so many bad scenes that it was hard to understand anything that was going on. The acting was horrible and I don't think it was very good acting. The writing was bad. The script was so horrible that I couldn't believe what I was reading. The special effects were so bad that they were ridiculous. I think the effects were a lot of CGI. I'm sorry that I watched this movie and had to leave it. I thought it was just a bad idea and not a very good one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I loved this movie, and that's a hard thing to say about a movie with this many flaws. It was so boring I couldn't care. I had been told the story was about a young man who is searching for his sister, and he ends up finding a young girl. But the girl is not the girl that he thinks he's looking for. She is his own sister. The only time I felt any emotion from this movie was when the guy tried to kiss the girl and she said no. It seemed like that was the only time he actually cared. I was so bored that I didn't even care that the girl got raped. I just wanted to see the bad guy get killed. Then I saw the end. I guess they were gonna do a sequel, but I don't think I'd see the same movie twice. I really wanted this movie to be good, but it was just terrible.

RAW Paste Data  The purpose of this movie review is to explain why I hate it. First, I'm going to be brief because I don't really feel like I need to explain it, but if you're curious then feel free to skip ahead. If this movie doesn't work for you then I'm sorry, but I'm also sorry to anyone that watched this because you're going to hate this movie. If it was bad I would have written something different, but since it is so bad I feel like it's necessary to write a review about it. So here goes: A young man (the main character) gets a girlfriend and she's kind of a bitch, but she makes him feel more like himself. It's pretty funny, especially since she's also the girlfriend of his best friend (the "bad guy"). Then he meets the girl who would eventually become his wife. It doesn't go too well, but the movie doesn"t give a fuck about the plot. This is just a comedy and I get that, but they had to take a huge fucking shit on the character. They basically tell you that the girl he met was his "fault" and that it was a big mistake that he didn't get her when she was 16. I'm not even going to bother trying to explain that, I mean it's obvious from the first few minutes. But they don't seem to care because the movie ends with a kiss. So basically you get a big fucking dump on the main character and then they get a kiss for good measure. The girl's name is Stephanie, and she was the main reason for the bad guy"s "fate." She's like the villain of the movie because she's the only thing that makes the main guy happy and he doesn't even realize it because she has his back. Stephanie was also the main catalyst for the plot, which was bullshit. It was a typical "man-
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________________________________________   This movie has a really interesting plot that doesn't work. The movie tries to tell a complex plot with the help of some really interesting characters. However, it's too complex for a simple plot. For example, why are we watching the story of a woman who is the mother of the main character, a little boy? Why do we care about the mother? Why does she hate her son? Why are there so many different factions that are involved in the story? It's really too complicated to be simple and easy to understand. I would have preferred a simple story with a few simple and understandable rules, so that the movie can have a very simple and clear plot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  It's a horror movie and you're watching it in your living room. You're watching a horror scene on the TV in the background. You turn to look at the screen. What do you see? A black-and-white shot of a girl being chased by a killer, who's just about to stab her. A bloodied, battered body lies on the floor of the living room, a knife by her side. The killer is making a run for it. The girl is frantically trying to call for help. But it's too late. She's been stabbed. The camera pulls back and the killer walks out of the house. The sound of a woman crying can be heard as she walks down the stairs. A small child, who is the killer's daughter, stands up in the dark, in the corner of the room. She has her arm around her mother's neck. The blood is running down her face and her eyes are red. The woman calls out to her daughter, asking for help, but it's no use. The child has already stabbed her mother to death. A shot of the killer, running away. You sit there for a long time, listening to the screams and hearing the cries of the murdered. And when you hear the sound of the TV switch off, it's so sudden, it almost sounds like a joke. That's what the whole film is like. You watch the film and you have no idea who is behind this heinous crime, but you can tell from the very first scene that the killer is someone you wouldn't expect to see. But he is a true psycho. He's the most disgusting, despicable, psychopathic character you've ever seen. The film doesn't even attempt to explain why the killer committed this murder. It doesn't make sense, does it? He murders a beautiful, innocent woman. A little girl who is only five years old. The most horrible thing you can think of. It's not like the killer had sex with the girl or anything like that. He just kills her. And that's it. But that's the best part. That was all the movie was about. It wasn't about the horror, the suspense, or the tension. The whole film was about how evil the killer was. And you could feel it in the air. You could feel the evil and the despair in the room and the atmosphere. This film really scared me, and I'm not even a big horror fan

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad film, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It is boring and unfunny, and the acting is horrible. "The thing I like most about him is his sense of humor. It's always got a punch to it." This movie is like a low budget "Halloween" rip off. The idea that an alien would take over a small town and turn it into a zombie haven is laughable. The only person that seems to care is the one who's supposed to be a hero. This film could have been a lot more interesting if the actors didn't constantly give the "evil alien" a "good guy" face. The movie itself is a complete mess. The acting is atrocious, and this movie is a real waste of time. The special effects are pretty bad, and they seem like they were done by a 13 year old. This movie is definitely a complete waste of my time. I can't recommend this movie. Grade-D: "You're going to have to kill me, or I'm going to kill you!"

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________.   I'm a HUGE fan of sci-fi movies, and I've seen a lot. I know a lot of the actors and directors. I knew all the plot points of the movie, and a lot more about the story than I should have.   in the beginning I was excited. The trailer was amazing and had a lot to say about the film. I was expecting a cool movie. This was just boring, repetitive, and overlong. I didn't care about the plot.  . I thought the characters were flat, uninteresting, and annoying. It was very hard to care about them, and it was hard to see how anyone could. I liked the movie so much that I spent way too much time reading the book.     . I couldn't understand how this movie could have such a huge budget and have such little to work with. It's very hard for me to understand why anyone would want to make a movie like this, and why it took this long to make. The acting was very wooden, and the characters didn't really seem to be fleshed out.  - a few more years and the movie would have been great.  , but it didn't even have a chance.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________  "There is a scene where the boy and his father are out riding, and the father, in the heat of his passion, shoots at the boy with a pistol. The boy has just turned a corner and is about to escape out of the frame, and his horse falls over, so he gets off his horse, runs for it and is shot. The man tries to shoot the boy again, and he catches the bullet. He drops the gun, but doesn't get up. He takes out a revolver and shoots the boy a third time. The horse is now on fire, and so are the people who are looking on. The dead are in the street, and are so terribly burned that they can't be identified. There is no reason for the shooting. The father is not in a fit state to kill a child, but his son is, and it is his natural instinct to do so. It was a tragedy."  ____________________________________________________  From a young age I was always drawn to movies with the most violent themes. I was fascinated by the violence and destruction depicted in movies like, "The Godfather," and "The Wages of Fear." I was also drawn to the violence in "Dune," and even "Pulp Fiction." I would always go to the movies to escape from my real life. Movies gave me a place to go that was different than the real world. My mother and father did not want me to watch these films, and I was often forced to by my father. One time he told me that it was better that I was never to watch "Downtown Abbey" again. That is because that was a horror film that I would never want to see. I could not understand why my father would say such a thing. I didn't understand what the movie was about. I did not understand the violent images of violence, death and destruction. But, he said that it wasn't something I should watch. I would only watch the movies my mother and my father allowed me to see, which were the ones that I could relate to. That's all I needed to hear.  I think violence in movies is the best way to portray life. It can show us what life is like in the bad and evil places, where there is nothing but violence and death. I think movies give us a chance to see what it would be like to be a part of a world full of violence and hatred. The violence

If the movie was good, the movie wouldn't need to be negative. I like the movie, but it's a bit lame and I would rather watch something more original. I've never heard of a film like this. I was hoping for a bit of magic and something new and exciting, but the movie is just mediocre. I don't think it was well-received. If you want to watch a good action movie, check out The Expendables 2. But this movie is only average.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why is the best comedy a comedy? _________ Why do bad movies get made? _________________ Do you ever get sick of a movie? _______ Did you see this movie? I did. _______  "I am the King!"  It is the final day of the year of our Lord, 2113, and the day has come when the last and only King of the Dwarves has to go to battle against the forces of a great and terrible foe. The enemy is a race of powerful creatures who are led by the Witch of the Waste, who seeks to conquer the world, but the King is not willing to give up his kingdom without a fight. This is where the tale begins, and it is here where it all comes full circle. We start off on a cliff-side with the King and his court and we begin to see how he grew up. It is an interesting way of showing the King's childhood, and his father is shown as a wise man who knew how to deal with life. It was also interesting to see the King as a young man, as he is much more open and vulnerable than his later years. The first half of the movie shows the King in his younger years, as we see him get involved in the politics of his kingdom. We see the young King's relationship with his friends, and we see the adventures of the young king and his companions. We also see the dangers that come with being a young King, as the King tries to deal in a way that he will be able to protect his people from the evil forces that the Witch and her servants will bring. Throughout the movie, we see that the King cares about his people, and he does try to do the right thing. At the same time, the King himself cares about doing what is right, and that makes the King the hero of the story.  When we first see the Witch, she has the ability to suck the life force out of her victims, and this is where she becomes evil. Her true goal is to destroy the world by sucking the life out of everyone, and she does this by taking over the bodies of other people. It takes the King, his court, and even the dwarves, as they fight to save the kingdom. The Witch is a very powerful foe, and every time she was defeated, she would re-appear with a new form. We are introduced to a few of the other members of her team

The plot is great, the special effects are great, and the acting is great.  .  The acting in this movie is really good, and it's so hard to believe that this is the same guy who played the Terminator in a long time ago. . But it's not just the acting, it's the direction, and most importantly the cinematography. The cinematography is perfect. It makes the movies look so real, and not like a movie made for a cheap audience. (There are a lot better movies made by a lot more talented people, but it's just the fact that this movie looks good that makes it special.)  (It's interesting to note that the first time we see the T-1000, he's in a hotel room, and we can't see anything of him because there's no lighting.) . The last scene of the movie is a great one, and is one of the best scenes in a movie ever. (I've heard people say this is one the best parts of the whole movie.)  and it ends with a great ending, and a great message:  7. The Last Samurai (1954) . And this is a film I've seen a lot recently. It's a movie that's very interesting, and I think it's a good film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. Don't feel guilty. This is my first time writing a review for a movie and it's a pretty crappy movie. The movie is about a man that works at a company called 'Crimson Tide'. The man is the boss and he has two daughters. One of the daughters is a virgin. He's going through a divorce. One day, she calls him and tells him she's pregnant. The guy has no choice but to go and have a quick abortion. The reason why he goes to the clinic is because the woman he married has a bad attitude about sex and he's really sick of hearing about it. It's really funny. I guess it was my first 'bad movie' experience. I was really disappointed in the movie. It was a good idea. It didn't get the story done. There's nothing about the man that I liked. I felt that he didn't do anything special in the story. It wasn't bad enough to be memorable. I don't remember any plot points from the movie and I donned out of it. I really hope this movie is turned into a tv show. I just want a good movie that isn't a joke. I'm sure there's a good version of this movie. I hope.  …

When they find out that their old girlfriend was married and has two children, they decide to leave her and travel through time to find their children.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________" It's the worst movie ever made. Not only that, but it's the absolute worst movie I've ever seen. It's not even a comedy, but rather a series of terrible, stupid, slapstick and ridiculous scenes. The main character is a terrible actor who is clearly in need of a good director. I'd give it 3 stars if it weren't for the ending. There is a horrible scene in this movie where the main character tries to commit suicide and the director decided that he had to go over the top and film this guy doing it on the floor. There's a horrible, over the tops, over-the-top ending that will make your skin crawl. This movie is a disaster, but I would give it 2 stars. I wish I could give it 0 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________________  (A) I have been a fan of both the series and the movies, so I decided to try my hand at this series. The series is an action series in the vein of The Warriors, in which a man is trained to be a fighter, but can only fight so many times before he's no longer able to help his friends. The movie follows his son, a very similar character to the series' main protagonist, but it's not the same. The film does a great job at making the character of Hiro (who's also a main character in the series) a real person with all his flaws, but is also very likable. He's a fighter who is also a father. Hiro's friend Yaku (Kazuyoshi Yamaguchi) is also the same, but not quite as likable, though not quite so serious. The other characters in the film are equally interesting, though I found the portrayal of them to be somewhat lacking. I don't know why I thought they were the main characters of the film, but that's probably because of the first act of the movie, which focuses on them. There are some really cool action scenes, but I didn't feel like I was really learning anything about them, and I wasn't impressed with the CGI at all. The animation is great for the series, but this movie doesn't match the series at all in terms of quality. ______________________________________________________________________________ "Don't mess with a samurai!" ______________________________________________________________________ If you like action movies, then you'll love this movie. I thought it was a lot of fun, and it was good that it was such a short film. I liked how it focused on just the two main characters and their friend Yashiro. I really liked Hiro's character, and found him to be interesting and likable as a main lead. Yash's character was just... well, you'll see in the movie what I mean. I found him a bit flat. I wasn, however, impressed with Kazuyoshi (Kasugai Kazuya), the director of this film, because his style was very different from what I've seen before. It was really cool and different, and made for a really fun film. The acting was great, and the soundtrack was great as well. Overall, I thought this was a fun movie that was good for a quick watch, but probably won't be on anyone's radar. ________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Jan 24, 2017 7:23 AM by Mooz | Views: 730 | Comments: 0  We're about to jump into an article that was published on October 22, 2014. The story is called The Great American Ponzi Scheme: The True Story of America's Most Famous Ponzis. In the article, the author tells how they managed to steal hundreds of millions of dollars from a very trusting public. It's a true story about a scam. It is not a joke.   This article was very shocking to me because I didn't even know that such a thing could happen in this day and age. The author of the article has never received any government benefits. They worked for the government in a government job, but didn't receive any government money. The only people they have stolen from are ordinary citizens. The article also mentions that they have never even been arrested or even charged with a crime. They are the most successful and successful people in the world, but they are still living comfortably.  's true story is the perfect example of how scam artists operate. The way that the author describes the scheme is really interesting.   to put this in simple terms, it's an investment scheme where they steal from everyone, and then keep getting rich from the victims. It goes like this:  The scam artist makes a lot of money from his scam. He pays himself a lot and lives a very extravagant lifestyle.  He then puts the victims into a scheme that they are told is a scam and they get paid a lot for it. They become victims.  a lot  They get more and more victims. They get the scheme going by getting victims to invest in it. , and  As the victims invest, the scammer collects their money and keeps it himself. . They don't pay themselves. Instead, the victims are always promised that they will be paid when they are successful.   (The author's name has been changed to protect their identity.)  How do you know they are scam artists?

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ This is a bad film and not worthy of the name 'Serenity'. The story, while intriguing, was so terrible that I couldn't get into it at all. I know the original movie had a lot of promise but this one is worse than the original. It's like they had no idea what they were doing with the story, and I don't know how the script got written. You have the good guys trying to stop the bad guys and then the bad guy has the ability to jump from place to place at a moment's notice. It just gets boring really fast and the plot is not very interesting at all... The dialogue is terrible, not even funny. There was no chemistry between the cast, they just looked like they were in a crappy movie together. I would have never watched this if I hadn't seen the original, I was so disappointed. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone but it's a cheap movie that you should avoid at all costs.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ I was looking forward to this movie because I was a big fan of Michael Jackson and I am really glad that the movie did not live up to the hype. It's basically a remake of the Michael Jackson movie from the 80's and it doesn't live up. Michael Jackson doesn't have any lines in this movie, but there is a cameo by MJ. There is a scene where the kid with a bad voice who is a clown comes on stage and Jackson says: "Here comes Michael Jackson". I guess the kid is trying to make a movie about Michael Jackson, but I think he's just playing a clown because he has no voice. I can't believe that the producers of this movie made this movie. I don't like Michael Jackson. I think it's a very bad movie. You have to be a fool to think that a movie like this is going to make money. It looks like a low budget movie and it feels like it. I'm glad that I didn't buy this movie and I'm sorry that I saw it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ _________ ______ ___________ _____________ ____________  "The worst movie I have ever seen. I would not recommend this to a friend. I'm sorry but I just don't believe you will like this movie."  A movie that was a "stupid" mess! Not even the director could get it together, not even the star, who was a little "flat" and not at all convincing as a good looking, smart and charming young man who is about to enter a great love. I was not surprised by the negative reviews that appeared in the media and by the number of people who hated this movie. A movie that is a "poor man's" version of "E.T." and that is very similar to "The Omen." The movie was shot for a paltry budget, the acting was laughable, the script was a piece of crap, and the director was out of his mind. The worst movie in the history of cinema.  In an earlier version of this review, I had indicated that this was a bad remake of the film E.T. It has been mentioned that the director is in the early stages of making another film, and that there are some good actors in the cast of this movie, but it's all pretty bad. I think this is a really bad movie, and I can't recommend it.  (March 28, 2007, 10:39 pm)  I just watched this, and it is terrible. I didn't enjoy it at all. It's a really cheap and stupid movie. The acting is terrible, the movie is full of plot holes, and you really can't tell what's going on. The movie is basically about a young man named Nick who has some problems in his life, and he is having trouble with the girl he likes. This girl is a very attractive, pretty, smart girl who is actually the daughter of a rich guy. The guy doesn't care about Nick, but he wants Nick to help him get a deal on a bunch of expensive cars. Nick finds out about the deal and decides to help, and they go to a place where Nick meets the guy. He has to get the deal done and it involves a very complicated scheme involving cars. I mean, seriously, that's all this movie is about. Nick and the girl get into a car, the guy drives off, and Nick and his girl sit in the car for a while.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I like the movie, but there is no plot. The movie was great.  It is an excellent movie. The cast is good.  It is an interesting story. ________________________ Don't get me wrong, the movie is amazing. But it does have a plot. I was really excited to see this movie. Â  I'm a huge fan of the book and movie. I love the book by Joe Hill.   He's a talented writer.  And he's really good at character development.  I've never read anything like this.  It is so well written.  But  it's not a well written book.  The book has some really good ideas but it's a little heavy handed in places.  My only complaint was that the plot was very convoluted.  But that's a small gripe.  This is a really good movie. The movie is based on a novella written by Hill. So, the book is set in the late 1960s in the small town of Oak Ridge.  Hill tells the story of two kids.  One of them is a shy kid who wants to be a priest.  He is very religious.  His best friend is a geeky kid.  They have a lot of fun together.  Both kids have a big crush on a girl.  She's really pretty.  So, they make a pact to stay away from her.  Unfortunately, the girl breaks her promise.  When her best friend finds out, she starts to date him.  Then the girl turns out to be really dangerous.  Her parents don't approve of her dating the geeky boy.  Now the geek gets really upset because he loves the girl. And they both get really sad because the girl is leaving them.  In the end, the geek realizes that the girl isn't worth his time. And so the story ends.  A sad story. But there's a sequel.  If you have not read the book. You will not like the sequel. It's not bad.  However, it's really bad. I think the plot is so convoluted. If you've read the original. You'll enjoy it.  You might like it.   But I think it's way too complicated.  Here's the book cover.  There are a lot more pictures in the book than in the movie. So, it

I was a little skeptical at first, but once I saw it, I really enjoyed it. It has a great soundtrack, and I think it has a really nice plot. It's not too complicated, and you can really understand it. There's a little bit of violence in there, but it's not anything too bad. _______________________________________________________  The movie was very short, and really interesting. I'm really interested to see what the film will do in the future. I'd definitely recommend it!

The people in the town have a horrible habit of killing children. The only way out is for you to kill them all. If you do, then you will be free.   This movie is bad, and it is terrible. The characters are terrible, the plot is terrible, and the acting is terrible and is almost laughable.   in the end, it is like a bad horror movie, and there are scenes where it seems like the actors are just playing the roles that are given to them.   and the music is also horrible. There are some really creepy and creepy tunes in this movie. It is almost like they were made just to make people who have an interest in the paranormal jump out of their skin.   The only good thing about this movie is that it does have a happy ending.   is a film that takes place in a world where people are forced to kill each other for various reasons. A small group of people are chosen to go into a tower and fight monsters that live there. The film has a great premise, but unfortunately this movie falls into the trap of making it seem like a good idea to kill all the people in a town. This is just not how this works. The story is a good one, but the movie loses its way. There is nothing special about the movie. The acting is bad and the story is bad. It just falls flat. It does not have a good ending, and is a bad piece of film.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________  "What do you do, then, when you find out you are going to have a baby?"   In a world where babies are being born all over the world, and there is a worldwide shortage of women who can get pregnant, a woman named Elisabeth, who is having a baby, gets in touch with the 'Babylon' company, which is trying to solve this problem.   The problem: The human race has just one female egg cell and the only way it can reproduce is by artificially inseminating a male, a procedure that is a long and painful process, and one that can only be done by a man who has just been sterilized, because the procedure has been proven to cause the woman's body to reject her baby.   (...)   So, the 'babylon society' is looking for a female who has the 'female gene', the'missing link', and a doctor has agreed to perform the insemination for the woman.   The only problem is that the 'woman gene' is actually a man gene.  - and, of course, he is going to need a male partner - and he is not willing to go through all that trouble - he doesn't want to make a female out of a male.  ...   He tells the woman he is willing to perform this operation, but she can't take the pain. He says he will make a male out of her, but he doesn' t know if he can get the right genes in the process.   "I'll tell you one thing," he says. "The pain will be worth it. It will be wonderful."   "It will be the best thing in the world for you, and for us, too," she says, but at the same time, she asks him, "What do we do then, then? When we have a boy, what will we call him?"  :...  He says he's ready to go, but first he tells her he needs a test, and he wants to know if the woman can have a child. "If she can have one child with this man, then she's ready for the operation," he tells the doctor.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. I thought it was the most depressing thing I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of depressing movies. There's not much hope in this movie, and you can tell they were trying to shock you, but I think they went too far. There are a lot worse movies, but this was just not funny. I would watch this movie again, but not in a group, because you'll probably end up in tears yourself. This is the worst movie I've watched in a long time, and it is probably the worst one of the year, so please be prepared for the worst. The sound was awful, and the acting was terrible. I was laughing so hard I thought I was going to pass out. I am so embarrassed by this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  That's not what I mean by this.  It's not about being negative, it's about understanding and being compassionate.  That is not what the movie was about.  That is not why people were in that theater.    If you look at the comments on a movie, there are usually three things that come up.  The main thing is whether it is good, bad or the worst movie they have ever seen.  There is also an assumption that they watched it when they were younger and that is why it sucks.  They often forget that some of the best movies ever made were not watched by people their age.  This is especially true of the classic horror movies.  If you are watching a horror movie, you are in a place of terror.  What you see is not going to be pretty.  And that is okay.  It is a movie.  You will have your fun.  But you are also watching something that is going to cause you pain.  I don't care if the movie has zombies or vampires or aliens.  Even if the vampires were played by Brad Pitt and he had his shirt off, you would be scared.  How many of you watched the first three films in the Twilight franchise and enjoyed them?  If not, it was because of the characters and the writing.  So when people criticize a movie and say it is bad, it is important to remember that it is not just about how the movie is going.  Why are people in that movie so traumatized?  Is it the language?  The violence?  It might be the characters or the setting.  All of these things are in the movie.   That is why when you see the movie you are still in shock and in terror.   It is still scary, it still feels scary.  When you have a friend say that it was not a good movie and that the characters were annoying, you want to defend them and tell them that you enjoyed the movie and are happy that they enjoyed it.  We need to stop taking movies like this personally and understand that it isn't just about the movie itself.  Sometimes people don't get the movie because they have been in a similar situation and had to make a difficult choice.  Now this might be a choice you had to take.  Or it might be something you were afraid of or thought about.   The movie is not a metaphor.  Like in The

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        Share The Last Jedi: ___________  The Last Jedi has a problem. It is a film that is so far from being good that it feels like it is a complete embarrassment. It has everything that makes a Star Wars film great: a new, exciting, and mysterious story, some of the best action in the franchise, an excellent cast, and the perfect casting of new characters.  But then it gets so close to the end that it makes the film so much worse. What was supposed to be a fun ride into a new galaxy is instead a movie that is more like an exercise in frustration. The Last Skywalker feels like an expensive, rushed attempt to turn a great Star Wars story into a franchise piece. The film's biggest problem is that it tries to tell a story that feels more like a fanfic, than a movie, which is a bad idea. : I don't know if the film is bad because it's an exercise, or because it isn't good. The main problem with The Last Sith, and its predecessor, was that they were both just trying to re-create the Star Wars universe. They were both very good movies, but they just couldn't do it right. The First Order Strikes Back is a good example of a great movie that tries to do it all, and ends up looking like a horrible rehash of the films of the previous two trilogies. The Force Awakens is a great film, but it doesn't have the same sense of place that The Empire Strikes Back had. The Jedi, and Darth Vader, feel more like toys than people, as if Disney is trying to make it feel like a more modern Star Wars movie, but instead of making it feel modern, they just make it look like a re-do of the original trilogy. The final fight, with a huge amount of explosions and special effects, and an awesome score, is actually a disappointment. It's just so bad that it actually makes The Last Phantom look good. It doesn't feel like it has a strong enough message to go with its flaws. It feels like a cheap attempt to try and recapture the magic of the prequel trilogy, but doesn't really have the power to do so. A good Star Wars saga should have some depth to it. It should have moments that can be truly memorable. The best Star Wars films are all about the

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ I bought this on VUDU for the day to watch in bed. It wasn't that bad, but it was too long. I just finished this last night and it's like watching a bad show. I feel like I am going to have to watch this on DVD because it is so bad. I don't even know what to think about this movie. I hate it. The acting is so horrible, the story is so stupid, the music is awful, and there are some really bad special effects. I guess the thing that gets me is the way the characters act. They don't act like real people, they act like caricatures of real people. The main character, who I think is supposed to be some kind of super-genius, has a constant bitch face. He keeps yelling at the screen to "STOP, STOP, STOP!" but the camera keeps going. The other characters are all the same. They are all idiots and I think they are supposed to make you laugh at some point. The actors are so horrible that you just want to punch them in the face. It is really stupid. It makes me think that they used to make this type of movie a long time ago. I hope someone takes it off VUDUC and makes a new movie. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The worst. - June 5, 2005I hate this movie  Reviewer: zychl - favorite favorite favorite - May 30, 2005  Subject: Awful movie I was very disappointed with this film. It made me sick. My mom told me about this when I was about 13, and I decided to watch it. She told me that the film was supposed to portray a scientist who is so impressed by his work, he leaves the lab to become a "science evangelist" to the world. This movie portrays the scientist as a madman, who makes many poor decisions.   For example, the movie opens with him trying to cure the man with a deadly cancer that had been killing his wife and child. He takes out a loan from a bank, and he buys some drugs, which he thinks will kill the man. Instead, he injects himself with the drugs. The man, a friend of his wife, dies from the cancer.     The main character is a very dull character. He is constantly talking and trying to sell himself, but he doesn't seem to have any personality or character.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________ [P] 2002-2006 - SAW: THE FINAL CUT - A great, gritty, and violent movie, but a horrible film that was made by a terrible director. I loved it at the time, but after watching it today, it is an embarrassment. The pacing of the movie is just wrong. It was done in a flash, and the story was not told with the same care and detail that it needed. The story was done to fit a budget, and not to make a compelling film. The acting was terrible. Everyone was a stereotypical character. There was no real development for anyone. The characters were not real. The villains were bland and the only one with any sense was the killer. The film is not a masterpiece, but the best film of the series. It is not perfect, but it is a good movie that should not be forgotten. I would not recommend this movie. It has some of the worst acting I have ever seen in a film. I give it an F. [A]

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ The last thing you want to do in your career is write a bad review of a bad film. If you do, you're going to get it from all kinds of people who will tell you it's the worst movie ever made. And it is. I didn't see it in theaters, and it's really, really bad. It's just a bad story, but that's not why people watch it. I think it's because it's a good story. There's nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't mean it's good. If I'd read the script, I'd tell you to stick it. That's what I would tell you. I don't think it needs any more bad reviews. It needs to be seen on a big screen in a theater, and then you can decide. But that's too bad, because it was so poorly shot and written. I guess I would be okay with the script as it is, but I think they could have done a better job of filming it. It just seems like they were shooting it on location. I can't imagine shooting it like that. They did a good job of making it look real, but they should have done it in a studio. It doesn't look real. The lighting is bad. The cameras are so far away from the actors, they look like they're filming on a soundstage. I also think they should make a movie that's more like the movie they made this movie, The Last Movie, and not this one. There is so much wrong with it. There are just so many wrong things that I don t even know where to begin. You know, I just don't get it. If it had a better script, if it had been better directed, I don ike it more. It is really just a terrible movie, but not in the way that you think it is going to be. I would have liked to see them do a more dramatic version of this movie. You're going out with a gun, and they've got the whole gang in the club. And you're playing the lead, and the whole movie is you walking around with the gun and shooting people. And that's the only way it could have been done. And I would like to see the actors play more like their character. You don't see them yelling and screaming.

The "story" itself is a huge pile of BS and I feel I´ve had my fill with it. The only reason this movie is even on my list is that the special effects are great and it has the best music of the series, which I donít think I can praise enough.   I give this film a 6 out of 10. It has its good points and it's bad points, but itís still a great ride. The special effects, music and effects are the best in the series.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. It has been done to death.  I really don't like horror films. I love films that scare me. I've seen so many horror films in my life. I really do not like horror movies. I will say that I don't hate horror movies, but they are too many and I don´t watch a lot of them. I'm not a big fan of the slasher genre. I am more of a gore and scary kind of guy. I do not mind gore in my films, I just hate when they don't make it clear if the killer is human or not. I feel like a lot more of the horror films these days just have the killer being a monster and nothing about him being human. I don�t care about a killer being human if they aren't scary, but the more the killer doesn't look human the more I donít like him. This film was very scary and had great action. I loved the film, but not so much for horror, I loved it for the action and it's very good, the way it looked and the music. I liked the ending and it made me feel better. I also would have liked to see more of those zombies, it was really fun. I recommend this movie.

They have the same music and all. The opening text is: "In the spring of 1939, the U.S.S H.M.S R.A. (The Queen Anne's Revenge) is en route from England to Cuba, but an unscheduled stop is made at the Cuban port of Mariel, where a cargo ship is wrecked. A band of exiles, led by a young man named Rhett Butler (Samuel L. Jackson), discover the wreck and make their way to the American naval base at Mariel. Aboard the ship is a mysterious stranger (Bruce Willis), who claims to be an American naval officer. Butler and his men are captured and taken to the U-boat where they are ordered to sink or be shot. With their ship and all hands destroyed, they must make their escape by any means necessary, but a new enemy soon appears." In the end of the movie, Butler and the other exiles are rescued by an American ship. The film is based on the novel by James Jones. The director of the film was Sam Raimi. The actor who played Butler in the movie is Bruce Willis. The writer for the movie was the writer of the book. The only difference in the book and the movie from the beginning is that the film takes place during the winter. The movie was based on a book that was first published in 1933. This film was not made by the same writer or director as the book, but it was made by a different director, Bruce Willis who starred in the film, but he is not the same actor that played the part in the novel. The book is written by James F. Jones, but the movie version is not. The first book was titled The Sailing of the R.M, and the second book was named The R. M. (R.M-S). In the novel, the name of the ship was the Queen Anne, and it was in the winter, but in the actual movie, the ship name was changed to the H. M., and the winter was changed from winter to summer. The H. H. was a very large ship and was a British warship that was used as a transport for the American Navy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________  "The Manchurian Candidate" is the first film I've ever seen about the CIA's MKUltra mind control experiments on human beings. The film was released in the 1980s and has since become a cult classic among conspiracy theorists. The most infamous scene in the movie involves a CIA agent (played by Kirk Douglas) being injected with LSD while he's being interrogated by an undercover operative (played with such terrifying charisma by Robert Blake that it's actually hard to watch). The scene has become a sort of cult classic. I've been to a few movies where an undercover agent is shot at during interrogation and, unfortunately, this is one of those.  There are two parts to the movie, the first part being a CIA training film. The second part is a movie of a man who has been brainwashed by the CIA to murder people for their political opinions. The story revolves around the MKUltra program, which was created by the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct research into mind control. , one of the many documentaries on the CIA MKUltra experiments, includes a scene in which Blake is asked what would happen if the CIA injected a subject with LSD in the middle of a torture session. "You'd probably be in trouble. You'd be insane. You would be a murderer." Blake responded.  in which a CIA torturer asks Blake to watch him give an injection. "This is the only way you'll ever know for sure if it's an LSD or a lethal dose of barbiturates. You watch. I'll watch." In the scene, Blake can be seen looking at the needle, waiting for the first drop to hit him. The CIA agent who gave Blake the injection then tells him, "Don't ever question the CIA. It's the only thing that will keep you alive." In this scene, a CIA officer is injected with the barbiturate Nembutal. He asks the doctor to watch as the barbitsurates hit him and says, "This will be the first time in my life I've felt anything other than pain."  This scene is not only one of my favorite scenes in the film, it is one that I've seen on numerous other documentaries on MKUltra. The scene makes it so easy to connect the dots on MK Ultra and the CIA torture experiments. It makes it possible to see the similarities between the CIA torturing an innocent man for political opinions and the MK Ultra torture experiments and the government experimenting

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *************  It was so bad that I was ready to throw it out the window and go back to watching The Omen.   That said, it still managed to entertain me enough that I'll be going to see the sequel.   and I have to wonder if they actually had the budget for this film: ************  I guess it's time for me to give the movie a chance, even though I think it is the worst of the Omen trilogy.   the only thing I can think of is that the makers of this movie did a poor job with the production values. I guess they thought the film was going to be the biggest hit in their history, and thus they were afraid that it would be a flop. The special effects look terrible and the acting is awful.  , which would have been a good movie if it had been released on a much larger scale, was not released at all. It only had 2.5 million in total box office. But the movie was a huge hit in its home country of Brazil. It was the second biggest movie of 1994 and it made a billion reais ($6.6 million). It's only problem was that the film bombed in America. It did well in Brazil and in Russia, but America never really liked it. It's not really that bad of a movie, but it has all the hallmarks of a terrible movie. It also had a big budget. The whole production cost about 100 million reais, which is way more than the movie actually made. It looks like a total waste of money. And this movie is just not good enough to deserve that amount of money to make.The plot of the movie is that an extraterrestrial creature comes from a far away planet and tries to take over the Earth. The government of Earth decides to kill the creature, but instead they decide to put it in a machine that will allow them to control the creature and stop it from coming to Earth. They make a robot that looks like the creature called "E.T." and they put it inside the machine. They have a young boy named Elliot who has a crush on the girl that the creature is after. The movie starts with Elliot playing in the field with a friend named Chris. Elliot is talking to Chris when he notices the creature walking around. Elliot tells Chris to run away and he runs away. But as he runs, the creature follows him and he tries to hide, but the creature finds him.

It was a bunch of people who came together and said, "Hey, we've got to make a movie and we've gotta make it in a week." They took a bunch ideas from all over the place and put them together.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  This movie is horrible, and so bad that you can't even call it a bad film. It is filled with such cliches as a group of "brave" men trying to protect a woman from some evil guy, the "evil" guy trying to escape with his family, the female lead going on a "fantasy" vacation with her boyfriend and the boyfriend trying to get his own back. It even has a group called the "Bad Guys" who are the "good guys" but you never see any of them. The film was so bad and so cheesy that it was hard to take it seriously. The only way you could get some sort of enjoyment out of it was to laugh. But laugh you will, because it is so cheesy. It doesn't even make sense. It really is a horrible film and I wouldn't even recommend it to anyone. This movie is so bad, that even the worst of the worst movie has a better ending than this one.

When I was a kid, it was just a bunch of kids hanging out at my house. My dad had a big ol' desk. And there was a huge poster of Mickey Mouse and a lot of other stuff. And I'd be in bed, and I'd look at that. And then I'd say, "Hey, Dad, I'm going to be a big star one day."  [on his life and career] I've always loved the idea of freedom. I think that's why I'm always in the movies, because I want people to see what freedom is like. I guess that's one of the reasons I've written the books: to give you a real glimpse of life, and how it works, and what it's like to be free. , and Hugh Hef, who co-founded Playboy in 1953, has died at the age of 91.  the Hugh Heffner who was a sex symbol, and the man who inspired Playboy Magazine, and the woman who inspired his sex education magazine Hef's life was celebrated and criticized in equal measure. The tabloid press, for example, was especially harsh. One reviewer described Hef as "a living, breathing advertisement for the sexual revolution," and another accused Hef of "turning boys into sex slaves." But Hef never took offense. "I've been accused of everything. I was once in jail, but I got out," he once said. "That didn't mean I wasn't a man. It just means I'm a different kind of man."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. Please. I want you to make sure I have nothing to hide. If I've had some good times with a movie, I want to show it. If a movie has been good for me in the past, I would want to watch it again. If the film is bad, then I don't want to waste my time on it. But if it is good, I won't be able to watch the next time it comes out. If someone has a bad experience with a particular movie, it can't be helped. The person has to accept that a movie isn't good for them. I don the same thing with music. It doesn't mean I don  I'm so confused. It's like they have two different worlds. A world where they make music and a world where I make movies. I can't believe that someone would be so narrow minded. I have so much respect for artists. I love music and artists, but they have so many restrictions on them. They are not allowed to be a part of the industry. They aren't allowed to have a career. I'm not allowed. I am not allowed by the industry to work with musicians. I wouldn't even know what to say if someone called and said "I'm a musician and I need a song for a movie". That's what I want. I'd love to make music for movies. But I can never work with artists. So I don a movie. I make it. I put my heart and soul into making it. That's all I want in life. I would love to see my music in a movie like that. If that were to happen, I think I would be extremely honored.  As a young person in Hollywood, I was taught that making a movie was easy. If you had a good script and a good director, you would be set. This is the same as how I was in school. If we were doing well in school, we would be given an A in a class. This was what we all expected. But when I became a professional, that wasn't the case. I was told that making movies was difficult. The truth is that I never made a movie in my life. Not one. I went to film school. I attended film school for four years. I did a lot of things wrong. I wasn't a good actor. I didn't understand dialogue. I couldn't read dialogue. They told me that I had to

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________.  "But I can't help myself."  The movie has a lot of positives to it, but it also has a few bad ones, too. The story of an innocent girl who is kidnapped, then turned into a vampire and turned into the vampire of a girl she was raped by, but also turned into an evil demon and forced to kill all the people she loves, but she's still a girl. The movie is not good in the least. The acting is good for the most part. I mean, it's a Japanese movie so there's going to be a lot more lip-syncing and dancing than American movies, but I didn't find it to be all that bad. I found it to have some good moments, and some funny moments. I also found that the movie has some good action scenes. The one where she eats all the blood was pretty good. The bad thing is that the main villain, the demon of a demon girl, the evil vampire, is a bitch. She was a bit annoying and annoying to watch. Not sure if she was supposed to be so evil, but they never explained why she was so evil and mean, or why she didn't kill the girl she loved. I was thinking, maybe it was supposed so she could teach her to kill the vampires. Then she would be a real bitch, instead of a bitch and a demon. I think I could have liked this movie a little more if it was more focused on one girl. I really enjoyed the movie, but that girl was annoying. She made me wonder if the movie was going to go the way I thought it was going. It ended up being more of a horror/romance than a vampire movie. The girl was a bitch, but the girl was also pretty cute. The only problem was that she had a lot too much of a scene with the evil demon. She got a lot in her face, and when she gets it in her mouth, it makes her look so sexy. I know that's not a good thing to do, but for a horror movie, that's just bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This was one of the worst films I've ever seen, it's a terrible movie that I hate and if you like that type of movie don't watch this one."  You're saying the film was a disappointment?  The review isn't about the film, it is about the reviewer.  Why didn't they say the same thing about  the first  movie, about how the writing was awful?  I don't know if they're watching the same movie, but this is one of those movies that's like watching a horror film with a very bad script.  What I mean by that is if you see the first movie you will think it's bad, but the second movie was actually better.   I think that if this was a horror movie it would be worse, the writing is bad, the acting is bad and the directing is bad.  The script was terrible, the characters were bad and it's obvious that they had a budget of less than $10,000.  They tried to do something different and failed.  You could tell that they were shooting for a hit, but it was a hit that they hit so hard.    I could have done without the special effects and the characters, but I didn't want to see what I thought was going to be a mediocre film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This movie is terrible. The only redeeming quality about it is the actors. The movie is a complete waste of time. I hate to say it but the movie is so poorly written, that you will not care if you miss the story. This is a movie where the movie director decided to add a lot of violence to a story that had no plot to speak of. I was expecting something different because this movie was supposed to be the "bad guy" in the movie. But you have a bunch of actors who play the "good guys" and the movie just becomes a waste of a good idea. The whole story is about a young girl who is forced to do the evil thing. The story is so bad that the movie has no plot and you just sit there wondering how the movie will end. The ending was just a waste as well. I do not recommend this movie. It is a very bad idea that just makes no sense and is just a very boring movie.  ...

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________  "A movie is a story told through the eyes of its characters. But it is more than just a story: it is a journey through the world of the characters."  - William Goldman, The Goldfinch (1962)  A review of the movie.  by James  _______________________________________________________________________________________  From the first time I saw the movie, I knew this was the movie that would take me on a journey. It has the potential to be a masterpiece. It took me to places I would never have been able to find in my own life. I saw it on an airplane as a child and have been a fan of this film ever since. It was a movie I didn't have to ask anyone to show me. It's just in my heart.  a must see movie.   By David J.    _____________________________________________________________________________________________ , a new book about a group of young people who come together at the beginning of a film that will change their lives. , by George Lucas, is an American classic, but the movie is the real heart of the story. George Lucas wanted a story that captured the essence of the 1950s and 1960s. He wanted a movie that was not just a movie, but an experience that people would remember and tell their children. This is exactly whatis. George wanted a film about ordinary people, ordinary life. He knew it was important to show the ups and downs of everyday life. The film does this through the characters and the characters through each other. Lucas wanted to show us all how important the human spirit is. He was able to do this because he didn't limit himself to any one genre. The movie is set in space, it's set in the future, it was set in California, and it's about the end of an era. The time is in the year 3000. It shows us what it would be like if things were normal again. It is a film of great ideas. We are shown the future of humanity and the consequences of a war between humans and machines. The characters are believable and have depth. There is a lot of action and humor. It does have some romance, but it isn't really romantic. There's no romance in this movie.is an experience. It takes you to places you may never have gone before. It can be dark and dark comedy, it can be dramatic, and most of all, it has a very personal feel

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This is a good movie. I like it. If you're looking for an action movie, this is a great one. If your looking for a decent comedy, this isn't it. It is a fun movie, but it's not a good comedy. There are a few good moments in this movie, and I do love it when people are thrown into situations that are completely ridiculous. This movie is pretty much all action, and it's fun to watch. There's a lot of action in this film. If there was a way to cut down on the action, this would be a better movie. The writing is a little weak. I think this is because the director did not write the script himself. He is not a great writer, and he should have been more involved in the writing. He just has to be creative. But he wasn't. It wasn't a bad script, but there were parts that were a little confusing. I do like the concept of the movie. It's kind of a sci-fi movie with a bunch of crazy people, and you'll see some really good fight scenes. I'm not sure what's going to happen, but I'm excited to see it. I guess it's pretty good for a first time director. It should have more of a budget, because I don't know how it's going sell itself. I don' want to say too much, but the movie is probably going to be a little more expensive than I want to spend on it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did.  There's something inherently creepy about an old man who doesn't look like he's had a change of heart or any of the other things that we see in horror movies that's so appealing to us as humans.   That he would sit there and look at me and make those creepy, old faces while I tried to get him to stop was disturbing.  I have to say that the movie did not do a good job of keeping us in the film.  We didn't really get a good feel for the characters.  While there were a few memorable characters, there were very few that really stood out.  The most memorable characters were those from the film that played with the old man and kept him occupied, but that's not what kept me watching.  At one point, he asks me to go away.  That just stuck in my mind and stayed with me.  It was a chilling scene that really stuck with me the whole time.  When I finally did get out of there, I was pretty shocked.  Not because of anything he did, but just the feeling of the movie and the creepy feeling of it all.  In the end, it all worked out for the best.  Sure, it wasn't a good movie, but it was a movie that made me feel the way I felt.  Grade: C+ The movie was shot in a very unusual way.  You don't see anything, you just hear things.  Instead of just having the actors walk around, they have them walk around with a camera on their head.  This movie really did not make any sense.  All of the characters seemed to have a very vague understanding of what was going on.  Even though it was supposed to be a haunted house, it had no sense of what to do or how to do it.  Also, I just don't get the movie.  If you have a little knowledge of horror, you'll know what I mean.  But for the rest of us, this movie is a bit of a let down.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________ _________________________________________________________  I saw this movie at a screening in Los Angeles with friends, and I can tell you that this movie has nothing to do with the real world. It is a complete rip-off of a real movie, the plot of which is based on a real story that was not very good. The story follows a young woman named Emily who meets a strange guy named Jack, and is immediately taken by him, even though she has no idea who he is. However, the movie quickly turns into a very sad story about an abused woman who tries to make it in a new place. I liked the character of Emily, she was very well done, and she is one of my favorite characters in the movie. It's sad that the movie takes a real sad story and turns it into a "good" movie, but it does have some redeeming qualities. I would have liked to see the movie with an ending that wasn't so depressing, but I guess that is a nitpick. If you haven't seen the movie, and you like "The Handmaiden", I would recommend you check it out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Hands down the worst movie I have ever seen." I was so excited when I saw this on Netflix.  I was going to see it for the first time ever.     It is so bad that I was so glad that it was on Netflix!  If you've never seen this movie before then you really need to watch it.  I've never read the book so I don't really know how to describe it. The movie is based off of a book called " The Hunchback of Notre Dame ".  But this movie is so much worse than the book.  I am a big fan of the book and I really wanted to see the movie.   The movie starts off with a woman named Catherine, a nun, and her friend going to the tomb of Jesus Christ.  The tomb is where the woman was married to Jesus Christ and she thinks it is the most beautiful place in the world.  It is like the most perfect place in all of the world and it is all dark and empty.  They are walking around the tomb looking at it and Catherine has to keep asking Jesus to come out of the tomb.  She asks Jesus if he can see her.  Jesus says " I am not there anymore" and she says "Why?  "He doesn't come out?   Then she thinks that he has fallen asleep.  But then Jesus says he is in the tomb with her and he comes out of her mouth and they kiss and she runs away crying.  Then Jesus says that this is the only way that she can be with him and that she has to stay with him.  And then Jesus comes back to life and he says to her " You will have to come with me, because I am going to make you a wife".       This movie is just so bad.  This movie is about a nun who is trying to find her missing husband.  Her husband is dead and she is searching for him in the most dangerous place in France.    She is trying desperately to find him. She finds a secret passage that leads to a cave.  In the cave there is a man named St. Anthony who is praying to the cross.  He says that he can't find his wife.  His wife left him and he can feel that he is missing her. Then the nun asks St. Thomas to tell her where her husband is.  So

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________   - The acting is terrible. This is an example of a character who never should have been written. The actor is the worst in the film.   I had high hopes for this movie. I was expecting a good, classic action movie that would be good for kids. Unfortunately, it is more of the same, and it doesn't deliver. There are a few fun action scenes, but they're all the same ones over and over. The dialogue is awful.   "It's not like we're shooting at people!" "Well, then I guess we are!" "You'll be dead before you get there." "You can't do anything about it." "I'll make it so." It's just bad.   to be continued...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie on a bus from Dallas to Houston. I had seen a screening in a theater in Dallas and thought it was a good film. I got off the bus at the George Bush Intercontinental Airport and went into a Starbucks. I was sitting next to a fellow, he looked like a real nice guy. We had been drinking a little, but we did not seem to be drunk. He asked me if I wanted to go to a movie. I said, "I can't." He said, well, then you're going to go see a movie tonight. I asked him what was wrong with it. He said that there was not a lot of dialogue, and he said it was just a bad film. He told me it was made for the local theaters. I agreed. The movie was good, but it was not that good. I have seen better. I guess I could have watched it on TV, but I wanted a real movie. He was right. The only way to enjoy it is to see it with the rest of us. So, I walked out of the Starbucks and walked down to the parking lot, because it was late. The place was packed. The theater was not as packed as it was for the first showing of this movie, but there were still people in the parking lots. We got into the theater, and the first thing I noticed was that the seats were very narrow. We were seated together. The film was about to start. There was a guy sitting in the front row. He turned to me and said, hey, what's up? I said nothing. He kept staring at me. The lights went down, and there was this scream coming from the front of the theater. I thought it must have been a kid, but no, it was some kind of woman. It was the same scream as the first time I saw this movie. Then I heard the same woman scream again. It seemed like she kept getting louder and louder. It sounded like a woman's scream coming out of hell. I kept thinking that this movie was not meant to be seen. Then the lights came up and we got to the part where the people are walking out of their houses. They had been shot. The screams kept coming. I don't know if it was the screaming, or what, but the movie was so bad. I walked away from the theater and sat down in a car. The scene where the guy was shot was in the
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. This movie is so bad that it's hard to give it a 1 star. I think it was a good idea for a movie about a young girl who falls for a handsome stranger. Unfortunately, this movie was poorly written and executed, and the cast didn't have any chemistry. The lead actor, Kiefer Sutherland, plays a very annoying and stereotypical guy who constantly has to be saved by his friends. The movie was so bad and boring that I didn't even care about any of the other characters. I wanted nothing more than to get the fuck out of there. The only redeeming aspect of the movie was the fact that it was set in the 80s and I remember it as a very exciting time. The acting was terrible and it's almost as if the director of this film didn't understand that this was supposed to be a comedy and not a drama. This is just an average movie that was poorly made and has zero redeeming qualities. I can't recommend this movie to anyone and I would not watch it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* (I had to stop halfway through because I was too irritated with the way it was handled)  A good movie: * * * I can't say that it's a great movie, but it's not a bad one either. It's definitely not a masterpiece, but I think it's still a good movie.   I think that I'll be giving this a 4 star rating because it's entertaining, but the story is not that great. It doesn't have much of a plot, but there is enough in it to make it a good one. The ending of the movie is very abrupt and not very nice.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________  "I am the hero, the hero of my own story. That's how I like it. I'm a hero. I don't need any help from anyone. No, no, no. That would be ridiculous. If I was any other hero, I'd have to have help from someone. But I'm not any other kind of hero. And I'm going to be a hero in this movie."  The hero's journey is one of the most powerful narratives in fiction. In it, a character learns a lesson, grows and becomes stronger through the experiences he or she goes through.  What's interesting is that it's a mythic tale that doesn't have a clear beginning or end. The hero's path is an ongoing journey, not an ending.  the mythic hero's mythic journey can be divided into three stages:  1. Becoming a hero  In this stage, the character is not necessarily a hero, but a good guy who is willing to take on the challenges of life. ,,,, and are the examples of the first three stages. . These characters start off as heroes in the first two stages, but they begin to grow into them. They start to overcome the obstacles and learn the lessons that they should have learned from their mistakes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I'm an only child.   My wife and I met as students at a small Christian college. We married, had three children, and spent 25 years in good health. Then one day she developed a severe illness that caused her to lose her hair and lose her mind. She was a wreck for a long time. When she was finally in a state of recovery we decided to make a living as a Christian ministry. After a few years, she was so depressed that we decided we had better get a divorce. We did. I was a man who couldn't help myself. I went on to have three more children, three more wives, and seven more divorces. I had no life, no purpose, and no purpose in life.   the good things in life  The last time I saw my wife, we were both drunk. She had just been through a divorce and was drunk and acting crazy. I tried to hold my wife and calm her down. We ended up having a fight, in which I knocked her out.  ...  When I told my wife about the accident, she asked if I was going to put my car in the lake. I said no, that I would make it up to her. Then I asked her, "What do you mean?" She replied, "If you are going to drink and wreck your life, you are a damn fool. I'm sick of hearing you say you're going to do this, and then you don't. You're a damn liar. You can't trust a word you say. You always say you are sober. But when you get home from work, you always go right back to drinking."   .. ,...   I've heard stories from many people about their marriage breakups. It always seems to be a tragedy. Most of them were in love, they loved each other, they did everything together. They tried to make it work. Then, at some point in their marriage, they decided that they just couldn't go on living the way they had been. One day, the husband just decided that it was time for him to go. He left. They separated. They didn't speak to each other for a while. They had to go separate ways. I guess they never even thought about talking about it. When they did, it took them forever to get back together. Sometimes, I think it's better for them to separate

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________________________  The movie, which has been around for many years, starts with a beautiful girl being chased through the streets of a small town by a man. She falls down a hill. It is then that she realizes she is a little girl. She is picked up by a little boy who is about her age. This is a very sad movie. I think the reason for the film's success was that this little boy was the only person who cared for her. He was a hero and her parents were cruel to her. The movie ends on a very happy note and you will see this child grow up to become a very handsome man.  This is a sad movie and I can understand that a child will be confused about how they are to be looked at. They should see this film as a cautionary tale about the evil of human nature.  the child does grow up into a handsome man and I'm glad he grew up to be the man he is now. The film was made in 1958 and you can see it as a horror film but you also see a little bit of hope for the child. I guess it was made for children. I hope you will watch this movie for a child and make them understand that they are not the only ones who are going to grow up.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  (1) "Don't mess with the guy who's been a superhero for 50 years. The man knows how to get the job done."  "That's a super power, man. The ability to get through anything." , (2) "Man, I love this guy."  I just can't. I've never seen this movie before. My friend and I watched it at a friend's house. We were the only ones in the house.  I think this movie is a bit of a joke. It looks like a typical 80's slasher movie. The story is pretty boring and is full of pointless characters. There is a scene in the middle where a character is hanging upside down and then a guy is trying to catch him. The guy is a very tall guy. There are two people hanging. The tall guy is falling and the other person is trying desperately to catch the falling guy. It's the typical slasher scene where the guy is hung upside down. Then at the end, the guy looks up and says "Man that was a great movie, and it was on TV a lot when I was a kid. So this was a very important movie to me. I think I've made it." It's not a great film. It is not good. The movie is full to the brim with terrible dialogue and some of the most boring acting I have ever seen. There were three or four times when I wanted to punch the screen. I have never seen such awful dialogue. ,(3) "It's like they made this movie on a shoestring budget."    What I really hate is the editing. It starts out great, but then goes downhill very quickly. The camera moves around a lot and there is no real story. There was a scene where two people are in a car and a guy jumps out of the car and runs up to the people. They don't know what to do so they decide to just drive off. The director says to the camera "Just keep moving. Just keep moving, just keep moving." But then the director cuts back to the car again and the guys are standing still. They are not moving. And I don't think they did it to make the scene more dramatic. I just don't understand how this movie made it to the theaters. The acting is so bad and the story is so lame. This movie was a joke and I just couldn't take it

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________. I will probably never go to a Star Wars movie again, I have seen it 10 times already and they are all terrible. But that's what you get when you take a beloved franchise and try to make it more accessible. The story is great but it takes forever to get to the good parts. The special effects are all over the place and they try to pass them off as CGI, I don't think they are CGI. And the dialogue is awful. There are no jokes and no one is making sense. I feel that this movie was written by people who didn't understand the original Star Wars movies, and they have just made a bad clone of it. You can tell the writer has never seen the original movies, the actors just play the characters that they are given. I have to admit that the best part of this movie is the special effects and the effects man that did the effects on the Millennium Falcon, I mean who doesn't like seeing that? The only thing I found annoying about this movie are the characters and the acting, it just comes off as lame and forced. If you like Star Wars and want to see a mediocre movie that is not Star Wars, you should go watch The Phantom Menace. I give it a 3 out of 10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  "Hands down, one of the best movies I have ever seen. A beautiful film that should be in theaters everywhere. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who has a passion for great films."  -Dennis A.  ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  It's hard to imagine what it must be like to be a person in the United States today. It's not hard to picture the horror of what it's like to live in a country with the most powerful military on earth, with the highest incarceration rate in the world, with an increasingly authoritarian president, with a Congress that is controlled by corporate lobbyists, with our military being used to kill people in foreign lands. , a film about the Vietnam War, is an emotional film, and one that makes the war, and the lives of those who were a part of it, all too real. The film, which takes place during the late 60s, is one of many that shows the horrors of war, including one scene where the protagonist, a U.S. Marine, is taken prisoner and held by an enemy soldier, who is only pretending to be his friend. The Marine has a broken nose and a swollen leg, and is beaten, and his captor is brutal and cruel. He is taken to a hospital, where a nurse is so compassionate and concerned about his welfare that she tries to get him to tell her what he saw that day. When he does, he tells her that the soldiers in the hospital were trying to shoot the Vietnamese children. She takes this to mean that the doctors and nurses at the hospital didn't want to be involved in the war and that they were trying their best to treat those who needed help. The nurse in the film, who has an immense amount of empathy for the wounded, is the one who tries to help the Marine. She is, at least in part, responsible for his recovery and for helping him to understand what it means to be human.The film shows the pain of war in many ways. One of the strongest scenes in the entire film shows a Vietnamese family trying to survive the war. The family, who are trying to feed themselves and their children, are surrounded by military soldiers, who refuse to allow them to do so. This scene, where the family tries to survive without food, is a powerful one. It shows a war that is not a simple war between the U. S. and the Viet Cong, but a

And the director should not have gotten a paycheck. He made a movie that was awful. It was really bad. I will probably get a sequel to this movie, because it is a really bad movie. The movie is on the IMDB as " The Man Who Wasn't There ".

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ is a movie that is a huge let down. A bunch of characters get together for a movie about a couple of friends who get lost in the woods, and they end up having a wild time. It's not bad, but it isn't anything you would want to see in your life, because there are a lot of things that don't make sense, and it really gets repetitive. If you are in to big fantasy/fantasy based movies, this is a great movie. The characters are cool, and there are tons of laughs. The only problem is that this movie is not very original, and you can tell that they made a lot out of a very small amount of story.

But, if a movie is bad because of a bad script, a bad director, a terrible directorial decision, or a bad cast, that's a problem. And, if it's bad because the director is an idiot, then that's another problem. , but it doesn't really have a story to speak of. It's just a movie, which, in my opinion, has no redeeming value. So, if you're looking for a good time, look elsewhere.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Don't write about a movie that you've never seen.  Write about one that you have seen a million times and just didn't like.   The good news is that the negative review might have been written by a good person who just got caught up in the hype.  If you want to be a positive person who loves movies and doesn't care if they are good or bad, write about something you haven't seen. Write a review about something that you don't know:    Don't write a review that is so generic and unoriginal that you would feel bad if someone read it.  Do something you know that the person who posted it would like. The other thing you want is that someone who read your review will read it as a compliment.  Don't make a review just for yourself:      If someone is going to write a negative movie review, you want them to give it to someone who will enjoy it. It might be fun to read the reviews from your friends and family, but don't write it just for them.  Write it for a friend who has never seen it. Don a review for your friends:  If it's a movie you've already seen, give it out to a friend for him to read.  Then you can go home and write a similar review for a movie he hasn't seen yet.  Even if you think it's bad, he might like it. If he doesn't like it, you might want to give him a copy of your review instead. Make a list of the negative movie reviews:  Don make a list about all the bad movie reviews you've ever seen and the good ones you've read.  Write down the negative reviews in their order.  If the first movie was good, the second movie was bad, then the third movie was even worse.  Put the positive reviews in an order.  The most negative review first, then a few more positive reviews, and then the first one. If you are in the right state:  What state is the person in that has a bad time with a movie?  If the person is in the wrong state, you can be sure that he will write a bad review.  He will see the movie, but he won't enjoy it because he doesn 't have the right emotions to be happy.   If the movie has a good story and is very entertaining, then he might enjoy

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________   If you were going to go to the cinema to see a movie you don't want to see - this is the one.   I was very disappointed. The director is trying to appeal to the young generation who want to "be heroes" and "get in the action". But the acting is horrible, and the story is terrible. The main characters (one girl, the other guy) are not very interesting. The story is not even interesting because it's just a story of a guy and a girl.  - The main character is a really boring guy. His personality is boring and his character is not original. He is also a very shallow character and his love for the girl is just too shallow and unrealistic. She is only there to be in love with him and to "get him in action". He also has a problem with the "heroism" of this movie because he was not "in the action" for the whole movie. He's just there to see the girl. And he also has trouble accepting that the girl might be with another guy. He doesn't want her to leave him and then leave him for the other man. He thinks she has to stay with him because she is the love of his life. She's only there for him. He was in the "action" only for about 20 minutes.   the other character is just a very dull character. His character is very flat and he's not very good at any of the things he does in the movie. There's not much of a character and the acting of this guy is terrible and he can't act. The plot is just terrible and just made up things that happened in the real life. I felt the movie was made up just to make a movie about a girl who likes to get into action and to be a hero. It's the same as how all of the movies in the 80s are made up.  , but the director of the movie did try to make it better by adding more things and the plot is very complex.  I really hate to hate this movie. It just isn't a good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ Do you know how many times I've seen a good movie that I thought was just OK? I've done this too. You know how I always say, "This is a great movie. It's really funny." "I liked it. I liked it." "It's really good." But then I go home and I watch it again and I see what a fucking piece of shit it is. I have to get my ass out of bed and I look at my wife and I go, "Man, you better stop watching this crap." You know what I mean? And I get home and my wife is like, "What's wrong with you? What did you watch?" "I saw it again. It was really good. It really was. It made me laugh. It had some good parts." She said, "Yeah, but you're not watching it. You're just watching it to see what the other person thinks." It's like, that's a piece of crap. I've made a couple of movies that are really good and I've been in love with them. And then the second time I see it, it's like I don't want to see it anymore. But I can't stop watching it, so I watch again. So I'm watching this movie, and I'm like, I don the other night and I got to tell you, that is really funny. It got to me. I'm not a good comedian. I don,t get it. It gets to me because the movie is really good, but it doesn't get to me that way. I love it when it gets to you. I mean, that really gets to my humor. But it doesn-I'm just not that good. I am really good at one thing and that's making jokes. I guess the problem with this movie is that I don;t know what to do with this material. It doesn't fit into a comedy. And it's so funny and funny and just funny. I can laugh at a lot of things. But when it comes to comedy, I am terrible at it. So this movie kind of left me cold.  If you've ever had the misfortune of hearing someone else's opinions about a film and you've always wanted to know what the person was saying, here's your chance to ask them about it. The next time you're in the theater, you can ask any movie person what they thought about it,

I love those movies that have you on edge and on the edge of your seat. It makes me happy to see movies that I've missed or never heard of, because it makes me feel like I should go see them. This movie doesn't even have that.  -The sound is okay, it's nothing special. It's just a background noise.  (2/5)
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________. You can't really review a bad film because it's only bad if you haven't seen it, and if you have seen it then you probably know that it's not a bad thing. And if you don't know, you can find out by just reading the comments and reviews from people who've seen it. I'd recommend you just watch it on Youtube or Google. Watch a movie from start to finish, if you're not interested in spoilers. You might find something new that you didn't expect to find in a bad, crappy movie. The badness will not surprise you.  ...
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________  I know you don't care what other people think about a movie but this movie was boring, bad and so overacted. The movie was called "The Return of the Jedi". They were going to make this a prequel but then they went with the main character and made the movie about him instead of the main characters and it is just a bad mess of a movie. It has bad acting, bad acting that made me want to throw up and bad acting at the end when he had to go back into the force and he was gone and then he was back and he just went back into that hole and then you heard the voice of a child that was supposed to be his father and he said "I'm back!" and then they showed him with a helmet on and he looked at him and said "Is that me?" and he turned around and he went into the black hole and they cut to black and that was it. I hated it and the ending made no sense. I had to listen to it three times to get it and I thought that was kind of weird. I know I'm not supposed to but that was the worst thing about it.  If you don'y like Star Wars and you just want to go to a Star Wars movie then you should go to Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back. It's not as good as Episode VI - Return of The Jedi but it's much better. You won't have to wait two years for a new one. It is more entertaining. It also has a different ending than the prequels.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. The only negative review I will ever write is about a movie that I hated. I really hated that movie. It's really the only one of those movies that I can't understand how anyone could like it. If you want to watch a movie where a couple of guys get a job as bouncers in a nightclub in downtown Toronto and a woman is murdered at the end of the movie then you will enjoy it, if you don't like it, then you really have no reason to watch it.   The movie is based on a book called "Tough Guys". The book is a non-fiction book by John Grisham, and the movie is a movie based on the book. It is a very good book and the character of Mike is a great one. He is a real guy, he has problems in his past and the guy who kills the woman in the movie looks exactly like him. It was a good story that I didn't enjoy but I guess it is not a bad book to have as a reference. The story is about an ex-convict named Mike, and his ex-girlfriend, and her boyfriend. The two main characters, Mike and his girlfriend, were living in a big apartment in Toronto, Canada. There was a lot of sex in the book and I don't think that it is a good idea to show sex in a movie, but I can see why they did it. They didn't have to show it, but they did. I don' t think that a lot was actually shown but that doesn't really matter. The book has a lot to do with the characters and the relationship of Mike and the ex-gf, and I think that this is what made the movie work.   I really don't know what the author intended with this movie. I guess he wanted to show that there is a dark side to some people, and that some people are bad people. I just don't understand why he wanted people to watch this movie, because it is just not a good movie. The characters are really bland, there are no interesting parts about them. The movie is really boring. I would give it a 0.5 or 1.0, I don;t know, but it is really bad. The reason why it is so bad is because it has a story, but there is no story to it. There are no characters to connect to, there is nothing interesting about the characters, and there is only

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________   I would recommend this movie to: people who love horror movies, people who like horror movies but are too young to have seen them, people with a weakness for horror movies.   WARNING: SPOILERS FOR THE MOVIE BEHIND THE SCENE:   The movie begins with a young boy playing a musical instrument. His mother asks him to play a song and he does. This is very typical of the movie. A young boy who's parents are busy in the kitchen playing music. The boy then walks out into the front yard to have some fun. As he's leaving, a giant creature appears from the woods and begins to walk toward the boy. The mother is horrified, but her son laughs. The creature walks straight for the boy and as he's approaching him, the mother yells at him to run and to not to play with his friend. The monster turns around and the mother runs back to her house. As she's leaving the boy plays with his toy. As the creature approaches him, it looks like he's getting closer and closer and it looks very real. The girl walks up and asks the boy what he's playing with. The kid says it's a toy. The demon then says "You know what a toy is?" and points to the toy. She then tells him that he shouldn't be playing with a toy and that the creature has to go.     In the next scene, the girl is playing a piano. She starts playing a song. The next scene is a flashback showing a young woman playing piano in a music room with her mother. As soon as she starts to play, she hears a noise. She turns and sees a shadow in the window. She looks up and sees the creature, who is standing behind her. The young woman screams and runs. The child runs into the room where the mother is and screams at her. She says that she can't do anything and that she's scared. The daughter says that there is nothing to be scared of and that he's just a kid and she doesn't understand what's going on. The mom comes out and sees her daughter. She asks what happened and why she ran. The son tells her that it was a toy, but she says that it's not. She pulls out a knife and tries to stab him. The dad then comes out. He tells the mother that they are going to take him to the hospital. The woman then goes back into
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________________________ "If you are looking for a great story, and the most realistic portrayal of a person with a severe case of aphasia, look no further. This film is not for the faint of heart. I saw it and was in the middle of a very dark, lonely, and sad day in my life. I had nothing to say. I just looked around me and thought to myself that no matter what happens, no matter how difficult it may be, I will always be able to look back on that day and say that it was the most fun I've ever had. I felt so safe and comfortable in that theater. The people around me made me feel like I was with them, they made me smile, and they made sure that I knew that I was never alone. They never forgot a single detail of what we did that day. They didn't even seem to notice that we were not together that day, and I was so glad to have them there. It was a perfect day. I have always been a big fan of films that depict the world in a realistic and vivid manner. I really hope that there are more like this in the future."
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________.   This is the worst movie ever made. The worst. The lowest of the low. This movie is not good. I was so disappointed that a movie could be this bad, that it is still available for purchase. I could not watch this movie again. This film is so terrible, that I do not want to have to see it.   I could give you a list of all the ways in which this film is bad, but I would have to ruin the movie for you. I will give you just one example. In the beginning, there is a scene that I found absolutely disgusting. A little girl is being molested by a man, and the man puts his hand down her pants. The camera zooms in on his hand. This was completely disgusting. The movie also has a scene in which a woman is raped. The scene is incredibly graphic. I find this scene to be even more disgusting than the molestation of a little girl. This scene, as you can imagine, is disturbing. This is a movie about children. The idea that children are sexually abused and raped is sick and disturbing. I have no idea why the producers thought this was a good idea. The producers thought that by making the children victims of their abuse, that the movie would be more "tough" on children.  -The soundtrack is horrendous. The music and sound effects are terrible. It makes me feel that this movie is made for children. No adults could understand what the soundtrack was saying. I don't think that the children could, either.   to top it all off, the movie is so stupid. I think that this is a very bad movie. I feel that if this movie were made today, the kids would not understand it. It is not that the plot is bad. It's that the story is terrible. If I were to make a list, I would say that the entire movie is stupid. The story, the characters, the acting, the plot, the story...the entire movie was stupid.  .

The acting is really well done, and it's just a fun movie to watch if you enjoy good sci-fi.

There are so many mistakes in this movie that I can't even go into detail about them. But I will tell you that this movie was horrible. It's like someone went to a slasher movie and they decided to turn it into a horror movie. If you are into slasher movies and don't like gore then you'll like this movie, but if you don't you'll hate it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was just a disaster. The acting was horrible and the movie itself was poorly done. The plot was nonsensical and was just plain boring. The cinematography was terrible. It was so bad it made me want to just throw up. The music was not good either, and it just made it worse. There were times in the movie where the characters did not look right. The ending was terrible, and I could see why this movie was not as successful as it could have been. The production quality was awful as well. I felt like it was shot on a budget of a low-budget film. I am not sure if I would have even paid to see this movie if it was a free movie. It really sucked. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. It is a very bad movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________ The first movie that I saw in the theatre was "The French Connection" and the only thing that I remember is the opening scene. It was the first time I was introduced to the character of James Stewart and he looked like he had the world all figured out. His smile, his voice and his physical attributes all seemed perfect. The first time that I ever saw this movie was at a midnight showing at the New Orleans French Theatre on March 6, 1973. This was a night to remember for me and I was very nervous about the movie. I was so nervous that my hands trembled from the anticipation of the movie as I stood in the lobby of the theater. After the movie ended, I walked down the hallway to a little cafe where I was invited to join my friend for a drink and a little conversation. It is funny that I have been looking back at my memory of the first movie. The only thing I can remember that I was nervous about that night was my dress. I had decided that I would wear the dress that I had worn in "The Long Goodbye" and that night I was not able to put it on properly. This caused my dress to ride up and I looked like a bride walking down the aisle. I am so glad that my dress did not cause me to look like a fool. My dress also caused me to become more confident in myself. I started to make some good friends and I felt like I had a good time that night. My first impression of "The Italian Job" was not positive. I remember being in the bathroom at the end of the film and looking up at the mirror and seeing the reflection of myself and seeing that I did not look as good as I did in the movie "The Americanization of Emily" the year before. I would also see that I looked much older in the mirror. The reason that I can still recall the events that took place in that bathroom are because I had my hands full that night and I needed to take care of myself. It took me about a month to recover from the stress of that movie. That is the one time that it really bothered me that I look older in a movie. My last movie that was released was "Vantage Point" which was a film that I thought was going to be great. It did not live up to my expectations. I think that it is safe to say that the reason that the movie was so bad is because the movie studio did not
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was terrible.  I would never recommend this movie to a friend.    It was over-the-top ridiculous.    It was like watching a bad joke on TV.  The acting was horrible.  I can only assume they hired some actors to act, because they weren't actors, but people pretending to be actors.  It was the worst movie I've ever seen.  This movie had some of the worst acting in the history of movies.  And the best thing about it is that it was filmed with CGI.  You'll have to look up what CGI is, but CGI is a special effect that was created by a computer, and it looks fake.  This movie is so bad it actually has a great soundtrack!  The song is called, "Wake Up! Wake Up! The Moon is Crying", and it's a great song.  But the song isn't good enough to make up for the terrible acting and horrible CGI.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ I was at a movie theater the other night with my sister and we decided to check out the new movie called "Wanted: Dead or Alive." I loved the premise, it was so well done. I loved how it ended and I loved that the ending was just plain ridiculous. We went in, the movie was in 3D and it was just amazing. The guy in the movie is just amazing, it made my hair stand on end. But I guess I shouldn't be too shocked, because it was pretty well known that he was a psychopath. After seeing it, I knew it was gonna be a big deal. And it was. It was a huge success and everyone loved it. It made a lot of money, which was nice. But it's a shame, because I feel like it was way too long. I mean, if you're gonna make a movie with the title "WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE" you'd think that you could have at least a couple more hours. You know? You know, just a little more of the story. Just a little bit more. It really was just a wasted opportunity. But at the end of the day, we all just wanted to see a good movie. So I guess it all works out in the end.  Advertisement  Mike:  One day a few years ago I got an email from my buddy, a guy I've known since I was 10 years old, saying, "Hey man, you should come over to my house and hang out." I don't usually like to hang out with my buddies, and I usually try not to go with people I don?t know very well. But when this guy said it was his birthday, I thought, "Yeah, I can't wait to get to his house and see what's up."  He drove me over, it turned out he was married with kids. And, well, we got to hang with him and his wife for a couple hours. It turned out they had a pretty nice house, and the guy's wife was a really pretty lady.  the guy was a little weird, but we all kind of got along pretty well, even though the wife was just so nice. It ended up being kind of a fun time. We all had a good time, and it all kind-of just faded into the past. I guess the weird thing about it was, when I found out he'd been murdered

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "the whole movie is like a bad episode of Family Guy"  No, I would argue that it's better than a good episode of family guy, but it is still a bad.  The pacing is horrible, the dialogue is ridiculous, the characters are boring, and the action is completely unnecessary.  The plot of the movie is about a group of people who have taken the body of a woman and are attempting to find her husband.  The movie goes from a guy running away from his wife, to a guy trying to get the woman's body back, to an old woman who is trying to stop them, to some guys in a tree house trying to hide their treasure.  In every scene, the character who is the focus of the plot gets more stupid.  If I didn't know that this was a bad film, I might have actually laughed.  This movie is just bad. In the movie, you get a lot of stupid dialogue: "She was like the most beautiful woman I had ever seen." "I think we should kill that man right now." "There is no question, there is no doubt, there are two possibilities, and one of them is definitely not a possibility."  This was the most annoying dialogue in this movie, as the director and his writers seem to think that "a" is the only correct word to use.  I really think that this movie should have used "s," as "the" is a word that should never be used in a sentence.   There is also a scene where a guy is in a car and he is talking to a girl.  She is talking on the phone, and he just talks on the car stereo and she just talks to him.  At one point, she tells him that he should "turn up the radio."  She's not talking to him!  I was also annoyed by the fact that the main characters, the two guys in the tree house, were completely useless.  They were talking about their treasure and there was a man that was standing there.  What's worse is that they never talked to the man who was standing in the street.  Even though he was standing right there, the guys just turned around and walked away.  There are so many things wrong with this movie.  It's just bad! This movie has some of the worst effects ever:  "the whole tree house looked like a scene out of Lord of the

If you are looking to improve your productivity, you are probably aware that there is a lot of conflicting information out there. Some say it's to be mindful, others say it is to be disciplined. There are also those who say it can be improved with more self-discipline. As a result, it can feel overwhelming and it can also be difficult to choose what to work on. For this reason, I asked some of the most prolific productivity thinkers in the world, including the author of the New York Times bestseller The Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg, and the legendary James Clear, to pick their favorite productivity strategies. They both agreed that it is a skill to master, and that there are a lot more ways to practice than you may think. In this episode, we cover all the bases: what is productivity, how does it differ from creativity, and how do you know if you're doing it right? They both have great stories and insights to share.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________   "What did the doctor say?"   This is a very long film, a very elaborate and very expensive film, but it's an incredibly weak one. There are two reasons for this:   1) It takes an awfully long time to get to the point. It takes a very, very long time for the doctor to even realize that the problem is that the patient is not really a patient, but a murderer. And this is not a small problem, it is a big one, but the film tries to give the doctor too much to do.   2) The doctor is a terrible character. I can't even think of a good way to say this. He is a bad doctor, a bad husband, a husband who is clearly a psychopath and who tries to hide it.   The best thing about the doctor is the fact that he does not have a heart attack when he realizes that the girl is a murderer and tries to take her back to her family. It's the most moving moment in the film.  , and he is so pathetic that it's not even funny. I think he is a kind of a sadist who can't stop himself from killing people.  The film is not bad, but I think it would be better if the doctor was played by a different actor. It is all over the place and the acting is horrible. The only actor I liked was the guy who played the guy with the "big feet". But that's not a good actor, I mean he was a bad actor.   the scene in the hospital is pretty good, it shows how bad the woman is, and that she is a sadistic psychopath. But the scene after the murder, in the police station, is just not very good. It shows the police trying to get a statement out of the girl, and how they are unable to get her to tell anything. She is totally uncooperative, and the police are unable, or unwilling, to help her. I was not a big fan of this part of the movie.   _________   Overall: 4/10  This film is an elaborate, expensive and very boring film. The acting is very bad, the story is a little too complicated and the plot is not very interesting. But if you like dark films and love horror movies, this film is for you. The violence is extreme, and there is some nudity, but this is a film about a woman who

They all seemed so happy and in love with each other. However, they never got the chance to fully develop their characters because they were always acting off screen. If they had been in the room together the chemistry would have been even better. (review of free movie)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  - I had a hard time with this one.  I was a little underwhelmed.   It seemed like they were trying to make this a really good movie and they had some really cool shots, but they just went too fast and got away from the plot.    I really like this movie because it is so well shot and the actors are so good.  I liked this movie and it was not as bad as people say it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  I just saw "The Room" in the theater. I was so bored I almost didn't notice it. The plot was so simple that I thought it was an old western movie. It had no mystery, no twists, and a total lack of emotion. It was a very bland movie. The dialogue was also very stilted. It took me a long time to realize that it was just a guy named Jim who did nothing. I don't think the writer intended it to be any more than a gimmick. It's not a good film. The story would have worked better if the movie had been a comedy.  - August 12, 2008The Room

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has too much wrong with it. The acting was pretty bad and I was never able to understand what the characters were talking about. The music was terrible and I never heard the words they said. The plot was so stupid and I would never watch this movie again. This is one of those movies that are made to make money, but this movie is very un-entertaining. I don't know what the writers are trying to say. It's so confusing that I had to stop watching it. I thought it was a comedy at first but after the first hour I couldn't understand what was going on.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Fun movie, very confusing I think this movie was made for kids. It has a lot of different topics discussed and it's very interesting to watch. The kids can tell the difference between the movies. I like this movie and the director does a good job at making it interesting and interesting. It would be better if it was more confusing. There are so many things to think about, but at the same time, the characters are so relatable. The only negative is that some of the scenes aren't as clear as they should be. It could be that I'm only watching it with my dad, but it's kind of annoying.  the reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I feel like it has a more good-to-great ending than bad-to--great. I'd recommend it if you're interested in a simple movie with a simple plot and a good plot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  Why is a movie so bad: _______.  the worst movie I have ever seen: ____. ,  (If you're wondering why I'm writing about this movie, that's because I saw it and I didn't like it. It is so bad that it's so bad you can't even call it a movie anymore. If you can call it even a horror movie, I guess that's better. Anyway, I was a bit nervous before the film because it was rated R, and I had no idea how bad it was going to be, but I didn`t know. It really is awful. I'm not sure if I should rate it a 1 or a 10 because I've seen worse, but it`s just so bad. It's the worst horror movie I`ve ever seen. The acting is terrible. It`s so bad the actors aren't even in the same room together. It has no suspense, and it`S so stupid, but still it`D be a decent movie. It just has nothing to do with anything. The ending was so stupid. It wasn`t even bad in the movie. I would have preferred if the movie had a good ending. It was just a stupid movie that had nothing to it. I think it`d have been a decent horror movie if it had a decent ending. That`s how bad the movie is. It had nothing going for it. This movie has nothing going. You have to see this movie if you have a low heart and want to get out of bed and watch a horrible movie. He's been in more than 100 movies. His favorite movie is "The Shawshank Redemption" by Andy and Andy. His biggest regret is that he didn't get to play Dr. Evil in "Austin Powers in Goldmember." When he`s not acting, he likes to hang out with his family, watch baseball, and play cards. His number one favorite TV show is "Family Guy" and he`ll also enjoy watching "Mad Men" whenever it comes on. He`s always thinking about his next big movie role. He's an avid reader and has a passion for reading and writing. He hopes to get a job with his degree in marketing and public relations. He also wants to get married one day and have a family. He has a little sister, Riley, who he likes very much. What he enjoys about
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ Did you like this movie? __________________________ Do you agree? ________________________________________ Do you have a problem with this movie/TV show? _________________  -  I am a fan of the X-Men. I like the characters, the action, the writing, the acting, the music, etc. This movie has no redeeming features for me. It is a cheap movie, a bad film, and a waste of time. There are a few moments where the film had some good ideas, but it's a far cry from good. The actors do not have any talent. The acting is not bad, but they could not bring a character to life. The cinematography is not good either. The music is not terrible either, but the way it is used is the biggest problem. It was a movie where there was not enough substance. I do not think the actors or the writers were thinking of anything other than to get the movie made. The movie was supposed to be about the X's journey from Earth to space. The X's had to go to space because of the destruction of their planet. The planet they had to leave was called Genosha, a small desert planet. They had to find a new planet to live on. They left the planet and were able to find one. They built a space ship and left it to be destroyed. They flew to a planet where they saw the mutants. They were not able to take any of them. The mutants had a secret base where they were able use the power of the sun to grow a new tree, a tree that had to be brought to the new planet. When they landed, they were attacked by the aliens, but this time the aliens were not the mutants, they had been programmed by the government. The government was using the mutants to take over the planet. So the Xs went to the government base and the aliens tried to stop them, but X-Man turned into a mutant. He was able to defeat the government and save the mutants from destruction. After the X went back to Earth, the government started to control them. They started using them to make bombs and to kill people. They also wanted to control their minds. They would hypnotize them and make them go on missions. They found out that the X had a special ability. The special ability was called Cerebro. Cerebro would give the X superpowers. X-man was able take over a building and shoot
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I was hoping that the story was going to be a comedy, but instead it turned out to be something that was even more ridiculous than that." I didn't watch it at the time. It was a "filler" on the network. I didn't even realize I had watched it until I watched a re-run on the local station. But, after I watched it and learned that it was a big mistake, I didn.t watch it again for many, many years. I still don't remember the plot, but I remember that there was some "badness" in it. I remember the characters, I remember their dialogue. It wasn't like that "bad" movie I read about in a book. But the characters are not memorable, except for their dialogue, and they do not get a lot of development. The only thing I remember about the character is that the girl who had a crush on him had an abusive childhood, and was mentally retarded, but still very smart. I don't know who she is, but she did not seem like a typical girl. The actors were very good, but their performances were not very memorable. I also remember that I read in a magazine or something about the bad movie that the director made before he became a director. But I don;t remember the movie that well. I only remember the bad acting and the script. I also remember the title. This is what I read: "A film in which the director has to shoot some scenes at a certain time and the actress has to act the scenes, but does not have much to do. The director tries to make the actor act his scenes by giving her the wrong lines. He does this by giving the wrong directions to the actor, telling her to do something she cannot do and asking her to say something she does not say. The actor does not know what he is supposed to say, so he says nothing." The movie was a success. - - - - * I found this movie in the "movies" section of the movie guide at the library. - - - This is a "classic". I found a copy of this movie on video once.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________  There's nothing I can say about this movie that hasn't been said before. A film about a young man who becomes a member of the Church of Scientology who is then sent to a psychiatric hospital in Los Angeles. While I've never been a fan of the religion, I did like the film for what it was.  The film does not do well at portraying Scientology. The portrayal of David Miscavige is at best bland. His mannerisms and demeanor are at odds with his role in the movie. I did enjoy his performance as he was more of a charismatic personality that made you want to watch what would happen next. The actor was really trying his best, but he just didn't come across as the type of guy you would want to see in a movie like this. - August 13, 2005Re: What I don't like about this film  Reviewer: jfk44 - favorite favorite favorite - August 6, 2005  Subject: Re: What is the problem? This movie is not very good, and that is not the film's fault. I was never a huge fan of David and his personality. I thought it was a bit of a stretch for him to take a role like that. He didn't really seem to want to be a part of this cult and his actions are very odd. I guess I was expecting him to be like other guys in this movie, which is a bit sad because he didn't seem like the type to do this sort of thing. I felt he was the one character that had the least impact on the movie, and it wasn't until later in the film that you see the impact he has. I think a lot of people are not going to enjoy this film because it is not as good as it could be. But if you are a Scientologist, I would give this film a try. - August 5, 2005Ran a marathon today and this was on at the start. It was a great film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. I'll do it anyway. This film has no redeeming value. It's just a poorly directed piece of trash. I've seen worse. The worst is probably the original Alien. The sequel is actually better. It even has the same cheesy acting, and even the same bad effects. There's nothing to look forward to in this film. The best way to describe this movie is the same as I did in my review of the Alien movie. This movie is not worth seeing. I don't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ It's a movie that makes me feel sick to my stomach. This movie made me feel like my stomach was going to explode. My stomach did. I couldn't take it. The whole movie was so sickening, and the plot was so ridiculous. This film made me sick to watch, and I'm not ashamed to say that. The movie's story is stupid and made no sense at all. I could not believe it when I heard that the main character's name is "Papa," and it's not even a real name. It's just a nickname. The main character is named "Pete," and he's a clown named "Mister Pete." Pete's dad was a clown, and he was a great clown. And he was so mean to Pete. The other characters are clowns, too. They're all clowns. This is just a clown movie, and it is very sick. There is no way that a movie could make me feel this sick watching it. It made me so sick watching this movie. It was so disgusting, I was shaking and crying. The film is full of bad jokes, and all the jokes are stupid. I mean, really, how can you make fun of someone for having a huge belly? I mean really, who would make fun out of someone having a belly? You would think that someone would make a joke out of something like that, but no, it's just like that. There are so many other things in this movie that are so stupid, it makes me want to throw up. It makes me sick. This picture is so gross, I don't even want to watch it. ____________________________ My rating for this movie is 1 out of 5 stars. It is so disgusting that I will never watch another movie that is this bad. This was the worst movie that I have ever seen. ___________________________________________________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is always so easy to hate a movie, but you will be wrong.  You will be so wrong.  In my opinion, this movie has so much potential and so much character development.   But then it fails at all the basic elements of good storytelling.  I was excited to watch it, but it is a bad idea to watch something that you have heard is going to be good.  It is so boring and unoriginal.  So much of the movie is taken from a book, but the movie doesn't do much to expand on that.  The movie is full of clichés, it is not a well made movie, and it is so obvious that the producers thought they could make a good movie out of a book.  There are some really good things about the movie, it has some really original characters and the movie has some great moments, but then it is just so mediocre.  I'm sorry for my review, but I have to say I was disappointed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What do you think about this movie? I liked it, but I wish they didn't use a whole bunch of shots of a girl who never speaks. The other people in the movie are talking. What's wrong with this movie is that it's a story about a girl, and she's a girl. That's it. That just about sums up this movie. I know that a movie with no girls talking doesn't mean anything, but the only girl in this movie, that I think is a pretty good actress, is the one who's always talking. I don't know if it's the actress's fault, but it was kind of annoying. I guess the girl who's the focus of this movie wasn't the focus because she was always looking at the camera. I mean, I'm not saying that it was a bad thing, but she was the only one in this picture that was just looking at somebody. That was it. I'm sure that the movie would have been even better if they used some other girls. I think it would have made it more interesting. But there you have it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________   It's really a shame that a movie like this was made. It's really not a great movie, and in fact a few bad parts really kill it. The movie itself is very short and the ending is so cheap that it's really hard to believe that this is a movie. I know this was a short film, but that just means that it would have to have been much better.   The acting was a bit weak and I didn't like a lot of the characters. I really don't understand how they ended up with these characters and why they were given this role. They don't seem to have much to do with each other and you just don't care about them. They have no chemistry with each others and they don't even talk. I guess they did this because they thought it would be funny to make a movie about two guys that never talk and never do anything.   for a short movie like that, it was pretty lame. I don't know why they thought this would be a good idea.   of course the music is pretty good. I think the only bad thing about this is the title.  , I mean it's a very short movie, but it is a good movie and worth seeing. The only thing that I don.t like about this movie is the ending. The ending is kind of a lame ending. It doesn't have any punch to it at all and I'm not sure why it was made, it just doesn't make any sense. I mean, it makes no sense that two guys don't talk and that they just sit around and do nothing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  In the year 2034, the world has been taken over by the machines, a world where people are controlled by machines. People are constantly being tested and manipulated, and when the machines get their way, it's a pretty grim future. A new breed of man has emerged, the ones who use technology to control themselves and the machines that they control. It's a world of control, where everyone has a number, where a number is everything.   The story starts off with the main character (who is called R, who stands for 'Revenge') waking up from a coma in a lab. R is being experimented on by Dr. K (who stands for Control). The purpose of the experiment is to find a way to control the machines. The main character is given a new number, 644-731. The reason for this is because 644 is the number of the first generation of computers, and 731 is the digit of the second generation of machines. After R wakes up, he begins to experience things that he can't explain, like the fact that he is not the only one who is a robot. R begins to figure out the whole thing and it gets pretty intense.

It had a good storyline and it had an amazing performance from Ben Stiller. I loved the character that he was playing. The movie was very entertaining. I really enjoyed the way they handled the situation. It was really entertaining and it made me laugh out loud at times. The only thing I would change is that the scene where it shows the police shooting the guy was a little slow. It shows the scene of the police coming in and it shows them shoot the guy but it doesn't show him getting shot. I thought that was very bad. I would have liked it if it showed the cop coming in with a gun. It should have showed the guy getting shot first. This movie had a lot of laughs and I really liked it. It has a great storyline and I loved it.

This movie was so bad, it was hard to watch and I did not care. It was terrible. I just wanted to throw it all in the garbage can and go back to sleep. I thought I was going to die. I don't think I will ever go see a movie like this again. " "The worst movie i ever saw. The only good thing is the fact that i have seen this movie at least a million times and can remember most of the lines. I can't stand this movie." "There is no redeeming feature in this movie. It is a terrible film." I can't say this enough: I didn't want to see this movie ever again. I am in disbelief. I wanted to cry, I wanted the movie to end. This is not even a bad film. It's just awful. It has some good lines, and it's a fun time, but it is an awful film. The best way I can describe it is the horror movie "The Amityville Horror" with a "B" rating. The story is terrible, the acting is horrible, and the direction is awful. The camera angles are just horrible, especially when there are monsters coming out of the screen. If you have never seen it before, you will not be able to enjoy it. It will be just a horror movie. If the actors in this film had their own movies and had to star in this one, they would not be very good actors. This film just doesn't have the best actors in it. Some of the best ones are not in this. "This is a bad, bad movie." "I wish I never saw this film again" "I'm sorry I ever watched it" I am so disappointed in this, because I had been looking forward to watching it, and now I can not remember anything. I didn,t care about the plot or the actors. It just made me want to throw the movie away. A few months ago, I saw "A Walk Among The Tombstones" and was so disappointed that I didn;t even remember the characters, or what the plot was. This has to be one of the worst movies I have seen in my life. I just saw this at the theater and my first

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ Do not watch this movie if you hate comedy. It is very sad, but funny at the same time. It should be seen to get the idea that the world is not perfect. The movie shows what we all have to go through, even though you think it is not that bad. I thought it was funny. If you are looking for a good laugh, then you will not find it here. The film is about a guy who gets a bad job and loses his girlfriend, who leaves him. The only person who cares for him is his mother. He is also the only person in the movie that thinks he is an idiot. When his mother says that he is not the one who got him into the job, but she herself. That made me laugh. This is what we always think and the only way to change is by getting a good job. The girl does not give up on him, even when he is a drunk. The guy is the only one who really cares for her. She has a little problem with her sister and they have a big fight. The brother tries to make it right with her. The sister does not understand what he says and she runs away. The dad is the one to stop the fight. He tells the girl she will never find the person she is looking for and she does not listen to him. She starts to hate her father. It ends in a bad way. It has the same ending as "Gone in 60 seconds" (another good movie). This is a good movie, but I would say it is better than the first movie. This movie is very good. I just want to see this movie again.  No Was this rating helpful to you? Yes  Posted By:

This is a big, big movie, and I love it. I love that we got to see Rey and Finn again and they're really in love and they have this great friendship. They fight side by side. I also loved seeing these characters in an all-new setting. We see Rey running around a city, and that's where we find out the bad guys are hiding out. And then we see them, they're not just hiding out, they are out for blood."  It was an impressive opening to what has become a huge summer blockbuster, but it's also one that was largely expected.  When Disney's "Star Wars: The Last Jedi" was first announced last December, the film was expected to be a massive blockbuster, with Lucasfilm's Kathleen Kennedy having confirmed the film would take place between "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi." , the new movie will be the first in the new canon and will continue the story of Rey and Luke Skywalker, as they go to Tatooine to find Han Solo. Luke Skywalker is still missing, but the search for the missing Jedi is one of the themes that runs throughout the new "Star wars" film. - With reporting by Variety's Todd Krainin.

I'm a big fan of the film. The first half is hilarious, the second half is lame. The characters are the worst. The two leads are annoying and over the top. There's not a single character who is likable. The movie is boring. The ending is lame and stupid. The acting is just bad. The special effects are bad. It's like they went to the dentist to get a tooth pulled and forgot to buy the drill. It was not good. This is a real letdown from the first half. I am sorry but I would not watch this movie again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this one is just plain awful.  I've seen this before, and it's not as bad as it sounds.  What's with all the bad reviews?  The first half of the movie is about a young man (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is in a relationship with his high school sweetheart (Cate Blanchett) but is about to break up with her because of her boyfriend (Michael Shannon) and his best friend (Ben Kingsley).  The rest of the story is about them and their relationship and a few people.  I've never been that kind of a fan of the movies with romantic movies but I guess that is why I like this one.   It's a movie with very little in the way of plot.  There's no romance or anything really.  This movie was not that good.  The main problem with the movie was that it was so long and that the characters did not have enough screen time.  Gyllenhall is in the movie for over two hours.  They didn't have enough time to develop his character.  As for the main characters there's not much to say about them.  It was a pity that we didn't get to see the whole movie, because if you do, it's just a terrible movie.  Jake Gyllenghal's character was too passive and boring and Michael Shannon's character, though a nice guy, is nothing special.  Blancheppett is just a generic, blonde, pretty girl.  At times I found her to be pretty hot but she's a very bland and bland girl.    The only thing that this movie had going for it was its soundtrack and the music that was used in the film.  If you have not seen the movie then just skip it and do not waste your time on this movie.   This movie is just another example of bad movies.   There is a lot of talk about movies that are bad but this movie does not fall into that category.

"This is an epic movie that I will never forget."  -J.W.  What do you get when you combine a story of survival with a story about a man who is willing to risk everything to help others?   The answer is The Big Short.   It is the story of how the biggest short-term investment turned into a huge long-term gain.  :)   I've always loved the story behind The Biggest Short, and the amazing cast, including Ryan Gosling and Steve Carell, have made this a must see for all movie lovers.   the only thing I didn't love about the movie was that the ending was a little abrupt, but that's just my opinion and I hope you all don't feel the same way.  .   was it worth the money? :D   If you like movies about the best and the worst of humanity, The Big short is a must watch. It is a great movie with a good script, and amazing performances from all of the actors.

I found the film rather disturbing and I have been thinking about it ever since.  a man was shown masturbating in front of a group of teenagers, which is not something I would have thought that the creator of the film would have intended for anyone to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I had the misfortune of seeing this movie last week, and I had a bad feeling about it. It's the kind of movie where a lot of the time you're not sure if the camera is actually recording or if it's just being moved around. But then it starts making sense, and then the whole thing starts to come together. I don't mean that it makes sense in a cinematic sense, but I mean that you get a feel for the character, what's going on with them. And by the end you're so glad that you were even able to see this movie at all. It wasn't a great movie, but the ending made it a good movie.  - Michael R.

And what about the people who are going to see the movie anyway? I don't think they will care if you give it a bad rating. They're probably going to love the movie and enjoy it as much as you did. _______________.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The movie sucked" If the movie sucked, why did you come out and watch it? If the movie sucks, why are you watching it?  If the film sucked, there's a chance that the people behind it are really bad people and you should probably leave.  But if the film sucks and you still decided to watch it, why?  If it sucked, you wouldn't have paid to see it.  If it sucks, there are people out there that love it. And if it sucks and they're not you, maybe there's something else wrong with it. If the film was a success, then people should give it a chance and see what they have.   "The film sucked.  Why did you watch it?"    I don't think that's a fair question.  But I do think that there are a lot of people out in the world that want a great movie, and if the movie wasn't good, they wouldn't come out to watch.  I just don't know.  Maybe they think that they don't want to watch a movie that sucks.  And it's not my place to judge those people, but if the filmmakers behind it really thought the movie was a piece of shit, then that means they probably don't care about their movie.  You'd think that if the makers of a movie didn't care, they would have made a movie with better production value, better writing, or some other thing to make it worthwhile.  Then again, maybe they're just really bad at making movies.  This isn't the first movie that I've seen where a movie really sucked. There's also the movie "Superbad", and "Get Him to the Greek", and a lot more.  There are so many other bad movies out there.  So maybe the people that don't like the movie really don't understand it, and that's the reason why people have seen it. Maybe people don't have a good reason to see a bad film.    I'm not saying that people should avoid watching bad movies. If they don-t like it, then they don' t have to watch or give a shit about it.   But I don' y have a reason to watch one if it was so bad.  Or, if a movie is bad, but it was great in other ways, then I have a great reason to enjoy that film. But if

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Don't even go there. There are so many bad movies out there, I'm sure I'll come across more, but I think this will be the last review I write about it. I mean, it was okay, and it didn't need to be. The story was a little silly, but the story of a bunch of people trapped in a car and the consequences of their actions was entertaining. And I don't mean just entertaining, I mean really entertaining. The humor and the tension were perfect. I've always been a fan of horror movies that use this device of a car as a vehicle, and in this case, it worked. The film is just an odd, twisted version of a movie about a group of people who are trapped in the car for hours on end. There is a lot of gore, but it's all over the place, and I don�t remember any of it. The acting was okay. I thought the lead actors did a decent job, and they didn't really have any memorable lines. There was just nothing special about the film. The only reason I gave it a 3/5 was because of the ending. The final scene was really funny, and really creepy. I don �t know if it was intentional, but something about it made it seem like the ending was written for the film by the actors. The way it was edited, it felt like they were just playing around. It was kind of a weird, awkward ending. I'm not sure how it was supposed to end. I just don�ts like it. It's a very strange movie, but that doesn�t mean it's bad. It just doesn�ts fit in with other bad movies. I can see why it's so popular, though. It�s a good movie, and a good time. If you like horror movies, or you�re looking for something new to watch, this is probably the film for you. It doesn�T feel like a typical horror film, and that makes it better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  "It is the film's most striking feature, and is the reason for the film-maker's popularity." – The Times (London) "In this excellent, entertaining, and surprisingly witty novel of the English working class in late-Victorian England, the reader is introduced to the characters of a man, a woman, and a child. All three are working-class citizens, the woman a child of a working-man; all three are in the same street, in the exact same predicament." – Time Magazine (US) "A very interesting novel, in which the characters are rich and the world is poor." – Locus Magazine (Australia)  I'm sorry to say that my parents were never very good readers. But I was always fascinated by their ability to get so much from a word or a phrase that they could interpret it in a way no one else would. When I was a child, my parents read me a lot of poetry and short stories, and they always tried to find things in the books that they would enjoy reading themselves. So I loved books with an odd title like, "How the Dead Know How to Sleep." That was a favorite book of mine growing up, and I was very surprised when my parents found out that it was a very bad book. They'd already known that it wasn't very good, but when I told them it was The Great Escape, they just couldn't believe it.  They both loved that it had the great line, "A man has a thousand ideas and he is only one of them." And they loved the line, "'O, you fools!' said the man, in despair. 'All my life I've thought I could make a fortune out of life, but all I've done is make myself miserable.'"  And I think that's the essence of the story. If you read it as a man who has been trying to make a lot, he's failed miserably. ...  The Great Escape is a novel that, at first, I was afraid I would not like. But it was one of the few books I can remember with an original story that I was willing to read over and over again. And I'm glad I did.  I was also surprised to learn that this is not a book that was actually written by a working man. It was written by an English teacher.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ This movie is a disaster. The movie is set in a future where women are not allowed to wear makeup, where they are taught that men are superior to them and women are inferior. The film is filled with all sorts of stupid things and awful acting. The plot is also not very well thought out. It seems that there is a man called The Engineer (Harrison Ford) who has a computer that tells him when and where the enemy will appear. This man has the ability to travel back in time and stop this terrible evil that is about to destroy the world. He gets a female assistant called Linda (Judi Dench) and he sets off on this quest to stop the evil. But in this movie, Linda is not a smart person, she is not strong or brave and is only there to be Linda. She does not know what she wants and does not do much of anything. It was obvious that this was going to be a horrible film. It's hard to believe that such a bad film was made, but it is. The only positive thing about this movie is the acting. Harrison Ford is terrible in this film, but he is really good in other films and I liked him in this one. Judi Den Choury is not very good in this and I did not like her very much either. However, I liked the way the director tried to make her look like a man, because she did not look like the character she plays. There is also some really good music in this, but you will have to listen to it in order to get it. I liked all the songs that were in this but the music did not work for me at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ I don't think it was ever clear why we were there. The movie seemed to be saying, "Look, I'm just going to make a bunch of people cry and that's all that matters." The whole film felt like a sad attempt to make something that didn't work into something that did work. The ending felt like the "I told you so" of the movie, but it didn't make a difference in the film. I feel like the movie was trying to do something different but it ended up doing exactly what I expected it to do, which was to make people cry. _________ I can't believe that I just went to see this movie, and I have not yet watched the movie itself.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________.  If you see a movie that you like and hate, tell me what you liked/hated about it, and if you have any other comments about it (e.g. how many times does it repeat a plot point?) I'll be glad to see them.   If a movie has a great story but is very bad, I'll still watch it. If it is just as bad as I thought, I won't. I will go watch something else.   was I disappointed with this movie: Not really. I think the writing and acting were pretty good, and I didn't feel like I was missing anything by not watching it.   (Note: I'm not saying that it wasn't bad, just that it was better than I thought it was going to be. I don't like the idea of a "bad" movie that's better than the original. And this movie is very similar to the first one, so I figured that I might as well see it.)  Was this review helpful to you? [ Report Abuse ]  Pick Up! Love This Movie! July 11, 2011 By John P.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________ If you want to see the real movie you can go watch the original on youtube. _________________________________________________________  "I think that the movie is pretty much a big waste of time."  -Michael J.  ___________________________________________________________  The story is terrible. The acting is terrible, the acting is horrible, the cinematography is terrible and the story is not at all believable. There are so many inconsistencies that make it very hard to accept. , you have a woman who was raped at the age of 13 and who later had sex with a man who was a police officer. This woman later became a prostitute and had a relationship with another man who also was a cop. The whole thing is a complete and utter hoax and a huge waste of a movie. The movie makes you think that a man was able to do what he did to this woman, and this man was given a great career as a cop, and is now married with a young child. Yet, he was a sex offender who molested this woman and also raped a boy who is also a police man. The victim is also seen as being 'too good for him' and is also viewed as being stupid. Yet in the next scene you see her as being an educated, intelligent woman who is married with children, and it's all because she was a prostitute. The same thing happens to a character who is later murdered by another character in the movie, but she has no memory of this. The only thing you can say about this movie is that it was made by a woman with a twisted mind. . It seems that there are so few movies made that can get made by anyone, even a woman, but not by her. I hate the idea that this movie was made to make money, but in fact, I think it is a great waste of money. The production company must have spent at least a million dollars on this movie and then they went out of business. I really think that it is one of the most stupid things I have ever seen in my life. ___________________________________________________________________________________ A lot of people will disagree with me, but I am pretty sure that this is a movie made by women with a big twisted mind, and I'm pretty sure they made it just to get a big paycheck and have a movie to show to their friends. The people who like this movie will probably not think that this was a waste of resources. I hope that this article makes it
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. It's as if the movie is trying to make a point, but fails because the meaning is lost in the translation. The movie takes place in an insane asylum, where people are killed and tortured by a madman. The protagonist (James Woods) escapes from the asylum, and then finds himself on a hunt for the madman who killed the people in the asylum. The story is simple, but has a good twist at the end, which I liked. I don't remember anything that was important to remember from this movie, except that it was not a very good movie. This was a movie that was made for a few bucks to get people to go see it, and it failed miserably.   Was this review helpful to you? [ Report Abuse ]  Pick Up! A Great Escape Movie 5/8/2013 Rating: 5   The plot was a good one, but the execution was flawed. For example, there is a scene in the beginning where the protagonist is driving in a car. He drives over a cliff. The car skids for a while, but eventually it hits a guardrail. The guardrail is so high that the car is thrown off the cliff. This scene is very realistic, and I guess the director wanted the audience to experience that kind of thing in real life. The rest of the movie was pretty much a set up for the climax. It was supposed to be very shocking, but in the end was not that good of a film. The first half was alright, but it got boring after a while. The second half was okay, but there was nothing special about it. The finale is pretty disappointing.   is a very interesting film about a man named William (James Franco). He is in the middle of a murder spree, and he finds out he is the victim of a double murder. The man who murdered his wife and daughter was his former lover, and the man who killed his son was the brother of his former girlfriend. After William escapes from jail, he has to escape from the insane asylum.   in the movie the main character was played by James Franco. I guess you can say he is a character, but that's not exactly accurate. William is in a coma. He is not aware that he is in prison. He doesn't know that he killed his wife or his daughter, he only knows that they died in a horrible accident. This leads to him killing people to get out of prison, and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  That's not a bad thing at all.  It's a very good thing, and there are some really nice movies out there that don't get any love from critics or fans, but the truth is that this one's a gem. _________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________ This one's been on my mind for a while.   This is a horror movie, but I'll be honest, I haven't seen a whole lot of horror movies.  This was the first time I saw a movie with a zombie, and I was really nervous, but it was a really cool movie, and it got me really interested in zombies.  The ending was kind of a let down, but that was the movie for me.  It's also worth mentioning that the guy in the movie had an awesome accent.  I liked the zombie.  He was fun to watch.  A very good movie.  And it's got some pretty amazing effects.  There was a lot of gore in this one.  If you want a good movie that has some great effects, go see this.  You won't regret it.

The early civilizations were small, and they developed a large range of technologies. For instance, the earliest known civilization in North America was a band of hunter-gatherers, who, after leaving Africa, settled in the Americas, establishing settlements that were spread across the continent. The oldest remains of early man, found in a cave in northern Spain, are roughly 8,000 years old.  But while there are some interesting developments in the field of paleontology, there are no indications that a civilization of this scale ever existed. And this is not because the evidence has been hidden. On the contrary, in recent years, scientists have unearthed evidence of human settlements in the Arctic at a time when the ice caps were much higher than today.  a recent scientific study shows that there may have been an ice age that lasted for some 200,000 to 300,000 year, which is much longer than any ice age seen in our time. ( Image credit: NASA)  What happened?  This is not to say that there was no civilization of any kind on Earth. Some researchers believe that the world's first civilization, which existed about 10,000 BCE, was an ancient Mesopotamian society. But the evidence for this comes from pottery and artifacts that were recovered in the Mesopotamia region, which was far more developed than the rest of the world. This was the period when the first civilizations emerged in the world, and the Mesoamerican culture was the most advanced. It is thought that these early civilizations evolved to a much more sophisticated level in the last 2,000 or 3,000 BC, when the climate in the Middle East became more stable. , a series of geological and geological maps that shows how continents and oceans are arranged relative to each other in the Earth's crust.

I hate to give this movie such a low score, but I really hate the idea that they put a kid in a coffin with a bomb strapped to his chest. This is a very depressing movie to watch. It was kind of like a cross between the last two episodes of The Twilight Zone and The Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch. This story of a man who dies in a strange way and his soul has to be reincarnated in another body is the type of story that would be very interesting if it weren't for the fact that they didn't do anything with the character, or even the plot. There are very few scenes that didn't have me rolling my eyes or getting a headache. I really didn't like this movie. It really sucked, and I hope they do not bring this movie back.

HAROLD BECKER  Dr. Harold Becker was born in Boston, Massachusetts on September 21, 1916. He received his bachelor's degree in physics from Harvard in 1941. In 1947, he received his medical degree from Columbia University. After a brief internship, he was assigned to the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, New Mexico. He began working at Los Angles in 1950.  The next year, Dr. Becker was given a fellowship to help with the atomic bomb project. He was assigned the task of helping to design the uranium core for the Trinity test in New Mexico on July 16, 1952. , a physicist at Los Angeles's Radiation Laboratory, helped Dr. Arthur Compton develop the theoretical framework for the new atomic bomb, but was overruled by the nuclear scientists. He later recalled, "My main objective was to help Compton and the other nuclear physicists with the development of a more precise way of measuring the properties of fission products." "We were all pretty much in agreement," Compton said. "That was my main goal, to develop the best fissionable material and put it into a bomb." -from the book "The Manhattan Project" by Lawrence D. Diller, Jr. If it was a great success, the United States was poised to end World War II and be able to rebuild the world. The scientific community hoped that a nuclear bomb would make possible the use of a bomb against the Japanese. In the end, the bomb was never built and the nuclear program was abandoned.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************* *********** The main problem with this movie is that it is full of crap. I mean the worst thing about it is that there was a plot to the movie and it all got completely screwed up. The best thing about the movie is the music and the effects. The music was great. And the effects were amazing. If you're into horror movies and don't want a good movie you can skip this movie but don't waste your money. I'm sure that this movie was made by some young kids to try to make a few bucks. But it didn't work. I know that you don't like it because you think it's a cheapo movie but there's nothing cheap about it. It's not a good horror movie but it's the best horror movie you will ever see. I really enjoyed this movie. The only bad thing about this movie that I can say is that the ending is a little too quick. That was one of the problems with the movie but you can't really blame the director for that because he was only trying to do a movie. It is a good short movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ The story is good. It's about a guy who becomes a zombie and a woman who's been turned into a zombie. The zombies are the good guys. But they are the bad guys. It is a very bad movie. It has a great soundtrack. But the movie is so bad it's not worth seeing. I saw this movie when it was first released and I loved it. It was one of the first zombie movies I saw and it still stands out as one of my favorites. But I don't think I'm ever going to see it again. I don' t like the way the film was edited. The ending was very abrupt and didn't add to the story. The actors and the plot are terrible. The whole movie was very bad and I couldn't understand why they wanted to make this film. The only reason I would see this movie again is if I was going to watch it on a long plane ride. But even then I wouldn't see it. I think it would be better if they just made a movie that didn't have the zombies and just did a documentary about it. If they make another movie I'll probably see it, but this one was just awful. I give it a 2/10

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ How can you give a film such as this one a 5? The characters are extremely boring and you won't get any good emotions out of them at all. The acting is not good, either. I've never seen such bad acting from any actors in my life. It's not even funny because most of the actors in this film are so dumb that they make no sense at all and I feel so bad for the director, too. The film was made by a guy who's only good quality work was in the movies where he was the lead. What a waste of his talent.   I am not sure how much I can give this film a rating other than a 2.5. It just doesn't deserve it. The writing was so poor and so bad that I cannot even call this a film. I am not even going to try to explain how stupid it is, since I really don't have the time. I know people don't like bad movies, but this is just awful. I'm sure it has something to do with the fact that this is the director's first film, but I can't say anything about it because it is so bad. I feel like I'm in a bad dream, but it is not the kind of bad dream that you wake up from, but a horrible nightmare that you can't wake up.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  A few days ago I saw "The Wicker Man". I think I'm going to have to go back and do a little more research to figure out how to review it. I loved it, and I loved my friends, but I'm really starting to question if it's worth my time.   I think the problem is that it is so well-known, and it's been so well studied, that we have come to associate it with being a truly horrifying experience, but in reality it is a fairly innocent film. I don't think it's really a horror film, I think it has a more of a fairy tale element to it. It doesn't really feel like it has much of a narrative at all. I've never seen a movie where everything was so perfectly staged. The whole thing feels like a magical tale.  .
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ 1 out of 5 stars! I saw this movie when it came out on DVD and I loved it but it was just way too long. It should have been under 5 hours. It took a lot of time for this movie to get going. There were so many different characters and all of them had their own story. I loved that it was in a car and not a plane. It is really hard to watch this movie and not cry a lot. The ending was just horrible. I think that the director just didn't like the ending of the movie. It was a very emotional ending for me and it was hard for me to watch. It made me feel really bad for the main character. There is a little bit of romance but it just wasn't what I was expecting. This movie should have had more of a story and the ending was really poor.

And of course, the story is the thing that makes a movie great.  But even that is not a true statement. The movies that are great are often great because of the story they tell. , and are among the most successful movies ever made. What makes this movie great? Well, let's see...  1) The characters  One of the most interesting aspects of this movie is that there are no characters. We have only the story, and that's it. It's a really great thing to see because of that. It makes the movie a lot less about the characters and more about the story itself. It also makes it much easier to get into the story because you know exactly who the characters are.  The whole movie is told from the point of view of a group of kids, who are living on a ranch with their parents, who want them to become good actors. They want them both to be in the film, but they don't know how to. And as the story goes on, the characters learn to overcome all kinds of obstacles. : This movie has a story with all kinds and types of people and situations.

She was on a trip to Hawaii with a bunch of her girlfriends and decided to go see the original Star Wars.

After the movie was over, her friends decided to leave her alone because she was a princess and should stay quiet and act as if she were a normal college student.

She had never really been in a situation like this before, so she had no idea what to do. The dude was like, "I've seen you on TV before." She said "What's the problem?" He responded, "The same thing happened to me. I was on TV, but I wasn't wearing a mask. I guess the producers didn't like the look of you." She just looked at her friends and said, "Hey. Don't look at me like that." She was so happy and relieved to not be treated like some random stranger.  the princess is the best. , she's the real deal.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Crazy, a little cheesy but it works as a comedy and a thriller." I've been to see it twice now and this was one of the better movies of 2015. A good thriller, it's got a few cheesy moments but the film is well-acted and well-directed and it's a good thriller. The film has a good story, and the characters are all well-developed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ If you're looking for a movie that can be enjoyable and educational, go see The Human Centipede. I mean it. This movie is just too damn scary and I have no idea why people continue to watch this. It's a piece of shit and it's absolutely horrible. The movie was made by one man (Bruce Campbell) who thought it would be a good idea to make a movie about a person who had a human centipede implanted in their body. That's all it was: a piece a shit. I don't know what the movie was thinking. It was a horrible attempt at a movie and it deserves to be called a piecea shit. There was absolutely nothing redeeming about the movie and there is no way it should be seen. You won't get any laughs out of this and you'll probably be shaking for the rest of the movie. The only reason you're going to see this movie is because you want to be terrified of a piece o' shit. You should also remember that it is not a good movie and that it makes you sick to your stomach.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: or the reason the movie was a success, it wasn't the acting, it was the plot. I didn't care for the plot at all, which is why I'm not a fan of horror movies. The acting was decent, but not great. The characters were all really weak. heres one example of a character who had potential, and then she gets destroyed by her own character flaws.  I think the whole story is too confusing and hard to follow, which isn't a bad thing, but the pacing could have been better. _______________________ "In the name of the Lord Jesus, Amen."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. Read the movie and give me a negative one.  4.5 out of 5 stars A movie that I will never forget. I was a huge fan of the show and had heard about it many times but never watched it. This movie was amazing! This was my first time watching a movie with a cast of all new and great characters. It was just as fun as the show! I will definitely be watching the show again!  5 out. 5 It was one of the best films of the 90s. I loved it so much that I re-watched it at least 3 times. The characters were all unique, and there were so many plot twists. I think this movie will be in my Top 10 all-time.  of 5 The film was just the perfect blend of classic and contemporary!  (and it still stands up to all the rest)  7 out of 10 Very funny! I loved how the characters were different. The actors were great and the story was just wonderful. A good laugh every time!  and of 5 My favorite. This was the first time I watched this show. The cast is amazing and the plot was so interesting. My favorite moment was when Jughead shot that gun in the back of the car. I'm a fan!  the director of this film is a genius. He was a brilliant director. I'll never forget this film. It really was one-of-a-kind.  to 4.5  6 out of 6 stars A very fun movie. The soundtrack is great and I liked the song that played in the beginning. I didn't like Jugheads speech in the end though. I thought it was too corny.    The movie is about Jug head, a high school student who is obsessed with the show. After he sees the show on TV he is drawn to it. He goes to see the show as a fan of it and tries to become a part of the cast. When he is hired for a part he finds out that he will be doing a very violent scene. He is given a gun and told to shoot the other actors. The scene is played for laughs. The gun is later used to shoot Jug Head in the stomach and it makes him very ill.   I enjoyed the movie a lot. It had a lot of twists and turns. It is definitely worth watching. -Liz  of 5 The

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To: a friend Brought to you by: The New York Times Book Review The New Yorker, The Atlantic, The New Republic, The Los Angeles Times The New Press, The San Francisco Chronicle The Nation, The Guardian, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and Slate.   The title of my book is: "Why Hollywood Doesn't Give a Shit About Race." If you're at all interested in film criticism, it's a book you'll want to buy. (This is not an indictment of Hollywood. It's a criticism of a system.)   I was a critic when I was a kid, and I was in my late twenties when I went to see "Saving Private Ryan." I thought the movie was good. My parents bought it for me, and we all liked it. Then I started writing about it.   a few years later I began to notice that I was having to change the way I wrote about movies because they were no longer giving me what I thought I deserved. The industry had changed. I thought it was because of the way the war was being covered. Now, the war wasn't being covered very well, but it wasn't because it wasn�t being covered well. It was because it was being changed by a war that wasn�T being covered at all. And that is what I think about when I think of how the war has changed movies. I think it is a metaphor for the way things have changed in the world. I am a film critic, but I am not just a film reviewer. I'm a critic who writes about Hollywood, and the film industry, and how they are changing the way movies are made. This is what my book covers: how movies have changed since 1945, and why the way they are made has changed in ways I think are bad. It is a history of Hollywood, how it is made, and what it is now being made about. I try to put the changes into a historical context so that the reader can see why they are bad and how the changes are bad for movies.   The book is divided into four parts. The first part is an introduction to Hollywood history, and tells the story of how it started, how movies got made in Hollywood, what movies they are now made about, and where they are being made. The second part is about movies now being about things that don't have to be about war. The third part is called "War Movies,"

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ This movie is terrible. The only thing that was funny was the guy with a giant cock. The story line is just not interesting at all. The characters are not even real characters. They just walk around and talk. They have no personality. The movie takes way too long to end and you will probably hate this movie because it just is not very good. But, if you like action movies and giant cocks, this is the movie for you. It's only 8 minutes long but it is a very exciting ride. You will never be able to look at this movie without getting hard.

It's a lot of fun and has some great lines and good acting. It's hard to pick a good one, but "The Empire Strikes Back" has some of the best dialogue ever. It has a lot more depth than the previous two movies. I think if you enjoyed "Star Trek" this movie is going to be a good time for you. I'm not going to spoil it. It will make you want to watch the whole series and the movies that follow it. You'll have to wait to see it. I give this movie a 5 star rating.

The three films in this section of the collection are all decent films. The only problem with the last one is that it is pretty much an ad for the show. The characters are pretty much one-dimensional, and the story was not very original. The three main characters were very uninspired. They are all good-looking and seem to be very wealthy. Their lives are very good, and they travel around the world. This is pretty good stuff, but not for the price. The DVD's are a bit better, but it's still hard to recommend this collection to people who aren't diehard fans of the show, which I think most of them are. - May 30, 2011Best of the batch?  Rating: [ 4 of 5 Stars!]  Review was collected by: kyriakos   I have to say that I was a little disappointed by this one. This was a movie that I always wanted to see. I had seen a copy in the theatre and had wanted to check it out. However, after seeing the movie it was a real let down.   The movie starts with the characters all living in a villa. They all look really good and live very nice lives. There is a party going on for a guy from New York, and his friend is there to watch it. The main character is also there, and she also looks really nice. I guess that's a good sign. Anyway, the guy's girlfriend is at a party in a nearby city and is also dressed really well. She looks really good too, and is the only one that doesn't look out of place.   (I had to look that up to figure out who that is.) The guys are all really interested in her. The guy is obviously in love with her, but his girlfriend says he's being silly. The friend also looks good. I was expecting something very much like an American Pie, but this movie has a lot more going on than that.  ........ - May 31, 2011I have a few issues with this one  The three films are pretty good, but they are not really great.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________  A great movie but I don't understand the title.   I saw this movie in a crowded movie theatre (as it was the first time I had ever seen it) on a Friday evening and was totally unprepared for the film. I remember seeing a few horror movies when I was young, and this was one of the first ones I'd seen. I loved it and it was a great film to go to with friends. However, I didn't think it was so scary, it wasn't as scary as I thought it would be. I liked that it was funny and that the plot wasn't too complicated. I thought the film was great, but it was very poorly acted and the ending wasn't satisfying.   the ending of the film didn't make sense. I don' t think there was any sense of urgency, like it was rushed, and it just felt like it wasn' t good. I felt it wasn''t very good at all, and the movie seemed rushed in the editing of some scenes, but other scenes didn''t seem to be edited at all. I feel like the movie was rushed because there was no plot or characters to connect with.  :  -the ending didn'' t make sense  (and I'm not talking about a cliffhanger, that was good)  but the whole film was rushed in it's editing. The story seemed to have no plot and no characters, the characters were just there. It''s like they were just walking through the streets and saw someone walking towards them, but the person didn''st move, and then they were walking around, and they saw the person again, but this time they didn''d run away. The film was a bit confusing, like the editing was a little rushed and the characters weren''t there for the main plot.  .   The sound of the movie wasn''s good.   (: -The music was okay  The movie was well shot and I liked how it looked.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________" The movie that started it all! The movie with the best plot, the best acting, the most amazing soundtrack. The movie has some good scenes and some bad scenes, but the best scenes are the good scenes. The story of the movie is very easy to follow. You can see the main characters, the main events and even the endings. The acting in the movie was amazing, especially the scenes with the main character, James Dean. I loved every scene with him and his character. The sound effects were great as well. I was really amazed by how much detail they put into this movie. They used the same movie posters and the same music that they used in the movies. Even the costumes and the cars were the same. This movie was great! I just wish that they could have used the actual movie posters in the theaters, so that the fans could see the movie posters. I can't wait to see the next movie in the series, "Easy Rider".
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ (The following is a review from a movie that I loved and have seen many times. It's a classic. The plot is very similar to the book, so if you haven't read the book you can still enjoy the movie. The movie has some of the best acting, music and writing of any movie of the 20th century. The acting was really good and even a bit better than the book. The film is great fun to watch and the best way to end the war.) I have been watching a lot of movies lately and while there is nothing new, there is still something to watch. I don't know if it's because I've started to notice a trend of movies that seem to be about some kind of war in the future, or if it is because I have just seen enough of them to be familiar with them. This movie is about a little boy named Jake and his family in the years between World War II and the 1980s. Jake is the middle child and it is obvious that he doesn't like being called "Little", he would rather be called "Dirty", but that doesn't stop his dad from calling him that. When a new war starts in the United States, Jake and the rest of the family take up arms and help fight the bad guys. When they go to war, the soldiers that they recruit for the war are really stupid. They don't understand what is going on, they don't care about the war and they're actually just trying to get a raise and they all have a bad attitude. When the war ends, all of the soldiers go back to normal, but not before one soldier takes it upon himself to murder Jake's father, the king. This leads to a very tense and emotional ending. The actors are great and the movie has a lot to offer, even if the ending is a bit over the top. The ending is one of the better war movies, but it still isn't perfect. The story is interesting and even though it is very well done, it has some very obvious flaws. One of them is the fact that they have Jake's mother go back into the past to be with him and his father. I was glad that they didn't have Jake go into the future to be a father, it would have been too depressing. Another flaw is that the story takes place in the late 60s/early 70s, but at that time it wasn't too difficult to imagine how the war was going

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________ I went to see this movie for the first time, on opening day of a holiday weekend. The theater was full, and the movie was in 3D. I liked the idea of the 3D, but it was very hard to see the characters clearly, and even the 3-D glasses were not really necessary. I have seen other 3D movies that have a 3-dimensional feel, but this one was a disappointment. I am disappointed that this movie will not be shown again. It was too short, and I was disappointed that the story was a waste of time. The ending of the movie is very strange and unsatisfying. The movie would have been better if they had focused more on the characters and less on the plot. I would have liked to see a better 3-d movie. I think it is very hard for a 3D movie to succeed when the characters are not really well-drawn. This movie was a big disappointment for me. I hope that this will be the last 3D motion picture I see.  Rated 4 out of 5 by John M from A good 3D I was very impressed with the 3d. I was watching it with the glasses on. It's really cool. The only downside was that it was a little bit hard to watch the 3 dimensional stuff. It did not seem to be 3d to me, but just a movie. The glasses were fine though. :)  This is a good movie. It takes you to a different world and shows you the life of a little girl living in a fairy tale world. The story is interesting and the actors are all very good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********This is a terrible movie and I would not recommend it to anyone. The acting is really bad and they all suck and are all terrible. The story was boring and the plot is so stupid that you could not believe they even made it. The special effects were really bad. I mean the best special effects they could come up with was this guy jumping out of a tree and doing the wave. The best actor was the one in the blue shirt that said "Hang on for dear life" but that was all he did. The worst thing about this movie was the acting. The actors were awful and all of them are good for the most part but all of these bad actors really did not look like they were having fun doing the movie. The only thing good about this film was that they had to make a big deal out of the guy in the movie jumping out the tree. I can't believe this is a real movie but it was. The music was awful and I thought it was going to be bad but it turned out to be one of the worst music films I have ever heard. This movie is not worth a second of your time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________. You may think it's a bad review because it's negative, but it isn't. This is a review of a movie that is a bad film, and it's really bad. It's like someone said "hey, we should make a movie about the worst movie ever made, that is made by an actor who was really bad in that movie, but we'll make it so you'll love it. If you can't love it, then you don't love movies." It's terrible. I really liked the movie, and I didn't hate it. The acting is terrible, the writing is terrible. But I really don't think that's a reason for a movie to be bad. The story is about a guy who has to pretend to be his wife's boyfriend in order to get away from the girlfriend that he really wants to see. But the girlfriend is really the worst. She makes the boyfriend really creepy, and then she's really mean to the boyfriend. And then she makes the girlfriend really mean. And the boyfriend is really a dork. And he's so much fun to play, but he has a really bad character. So it's not a movie where you're supposed to like it. It is a movie with a bad story, and terrible acting. The writing is bad, and the acting is bad. And I think the reason that the movie was made is because they really wanted to make a bad horror movie. And they didn't care about making a good horror movie, because they just wanted to piss people off, and they really, really wanted a bad score. I don't care that they made a bad "movie." I don''t care that it was made in the '70s. It was made for the sake of pissing people off. And it was so bad that the people who made it actually went back and re-cut it. They had to. It''s bad enough that you''re supposed to think that it''s a horror movie because it''S so bad. You have to go back and see if you can still enjoy it. Because there''s not a lot of fun in that. I guess I''m glad that people still enjoy horror movies, because it was fun to make that movie. But this isn''t a good movie. This isn''T a good film.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________  I just finished watching "The Thing," a horror film that is about as scary as a bunch of kids who grew up watching a lot of movies about zombies and monster trucks and then got really scared by a "found footage" film. I don't know what the movie was about, but the ending left me in a complete state of shock and disbelief. The kids who were supposed to be the survivors in this movie were in fact the monsters in the movie. I have never seen anything like this movie, in all the horror films I have seen. The children were so well acted that I never thought that they were monsters. I thought they were actors playing children. There was a lot going on in this film that I was not prepared for. I would have never imagined that it would have such an effect on me. It was a movie that I had seen in the theater and I had been really scared of it. I did not expect that the horror would be so much stronger than I was expecting. The ending was absolutely shocking. I just hope that this film was a good learning experience for the children who were in it. It is an excellent horror movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "A bad movie. It was bad. I wish I could've seen it with my family, but I couldn't because my mom had to work."  That's it. The entire movie is so bad it's unbelievable, and you're supposed to feel sympathy for a man who was being harassed by the cops. I can't even begin to describe how painful it was to watch. It's so bad, that I don't even know what the movie was supposed to be about. It wasn't even that the cop was racist, I guess. I don;t think the movie even has a plot, and the characters just keep being killed. I was so disgusted by this movie that I decided to give it a zero because it was completely unnecessary and it wasn't funny. I really wish someone had told me that before I went to see it.  I was so angry that I left a message on the phone of the person who rented it for me. I'm so sorry that I went and watched a movie with my friends and I didn't see this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________.  ___________________________________  (1) The opening is fantastic, featuring a gorgeous opening credits sequence, and a fantastic score by the legendary composer and conductor, John Williams. I especially like how he uses the original Star Wars sound track in the opening.   (2) The movie begins with a great chase sequence, with an old man chasing a young girl (played by the great Shirley Jones), and the old man crashing into a tree and the girl running through a park. It is pretty intense and makes the movie immediately feel like a science fiction film. The old man's appearance was a great touch and it gives the movie a nice sense of urgency.  .   the chase was pretty cool.  , (3) I really like the movie, even if it is not a great movie. The movie has some nice effects, especially the opening scene with the old woman running through the park.   I am also really impressed by how the special effects used in the movie work. I particularly like the shots of the old men running in the park, and the shots in the rain with the water and the water dripping, and some of the shots with the rain falling on the old people. The special effects really do give the movie its own look and it does not look like a typical Sci Fi movie.   (4) The action sequences are very good. There is a great scene with a little boy, a little girl, and her parents. The little girl has a laser rifle, and she uses it in the battle scene with one of the older men. The other man is hit and falls over and is hit with the laser rifle. There are some good shots of one of them being hit.   in this scene, the old mans wife comes up to him, and he says, "Do you know what you have done, son? Do you know you have killed a good man? Do not try to hide from the truth. I know the truth, you have destroyed the only good man that ever lived in this world." The old mans son looks at him and says, in a very small voice, "Father, I was born here. I was raised here. It was my home." Then, the father gets up and looks at the boy and says to him: "My son, you are to be my son again." The little boy turns around and looks down at his dad and says "Yes Father, you're the only one." The father then

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ This movie is a classic of the genre of westerns. The story was good and the plot was pretty interesting. The actors did well in the roles. This movie was a lot better than the remake of "Cimarron." The acting was good, the plot interesting and the actors were good. The plot is about the western. The movie was very realistic and had some good action scenes. The Western movies were very popular in the 1930's. This was one of the best westerns ever.

If you're looking for something to watch on a lazy weekend, this isn't it.  The Bottom Line:  If you're going to watch this movie, make sure you have something better to do.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________  So this movie was released a few years ago. I had seen it several times when it was originally on DVD. The only problem I had with it was that I felt it was a bit dated. I know the movie is a bit old, but I think it was just a bit too dark and gritty. I'm not sure why it is being remade, but it's not like it was terrible, but if it was remade I think they should try to do a little more with the film.  Was this helpful? Yes No 0 / 0 users found this helpful p.s. I really want to see this movie, but the new remaster is just too much of a downgrade. .
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** This movie was so bad I would have thought that it was made by a 3rd grader. The movie was based on a series of children's stories, about a little boy and his friends who have a pet bear who helps them in their adventure. The plot was a bit hard to follow at first, but you get used to it. The only good thing about the movie was that it had a nice ending. I really wish that they made a remake of this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________  (This review was first published on April 30, 2014, and is being published here as a follow-up to my first post in September, 2010, about this movie. I had seen it several times before. I saw it in theaters at the beginning of 2012. I have now seen it in 3 different cinemas, and it is consistently awful.)   The first thing you notice when you start watching this movie is that it is really, really long. It is about 90 minutes. If you have seen a movie like this before, you will notice that the scenes are cut together in a very choppy fashion. I think this movie would have been more successful if it had been edited down a bit more. There are a few scenes that seem to have been added just for the sake of it, and there is an awful lot of dialogue that could have been cut out, but the film never really gets a chance to, and I just couldn't bear the amount of time they spent on that.   There is a scene in the film that has a lot of interesting things to say about religion and how it has shaped our culture. However, the film tries to make the entire religious discussion seem like it is somehow the focus of the movie, and even though I did understand what the movie was trying to say, I found it incredibly difficult to care about this religious discussion. I don't understand why it is even necessary to have the characters be religious. This is an issue that seems to plague every religious movie ever made, and the movie in question does nothing to address it. There is no attempt to examine religion in a nuanced way, and in fact it almost seems like this movie has a political agenda. I understand that the movie is making a point about how religion has been used to divide people, but this is a problem that exists in every movie. There needs to be more of a focus on how religion is used to justify and legitimize the very violence that it purports to fight against. The movie makes a point of discussing the atrocities of the Catholic Church, but doesn't really go into what the Church is actually doing. I am not sure what was going on with this movie, but I felt as if the movie tried to make Christianity look bad. I would have liked to have seen more about the Christian church, and more about how the Church has affected the world, instead of a few quick mentions of how horrible it is.   to the rest of
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ "This movie is really stupid and sad. I really think that someone needs to show a documentary about a person who was in a coma for a year and died after that. The reason that this movie is stupid and it was sad is because it is really hard to believe that a person can have an epileptic fit and die. The movie tries to make it seem like that can happen to any person but it is just not true. The people that had that problem and died were really smart people and they were always very healthy people. It is just hard to imagine that someone can die from an epileptical seizure. This movie made me feel sad for those people. That is what I hate about this movie. I feel sorry for them. I felt sorry for the families that had to lose their loved one. It was sad. It made me hate this movie and that is a very bad thing."

I found that I was much less interested in the plot, and less interested with the characters. The movie was a total disappointment, and I'm really surprised by the negative reviews I read on here. I'm not sure why. The characters were all well written, and there were some funny moments. The main character (Laurie) was a great, and the actors did a good job. This movie is definitely worth a watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  I was really hoping that this would be better than the original movie, but unfortunately I found it to be worse. The CGI is a bit too over-the-top for me to be interested in it. The main character is also really annoying.   It would be a lot better if the characters were different, but at the same time it still has a lot of the original characters. The way they interact with each other is interesting. I would have loved to see them interact with the aliens and the "humans" in different ways. I hope the director will come up with a new storyline.   is a good movie. The aliens are scary and the movie is pretty well done. The only thing that bothered me was the way the film ended.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Powered by    It's a sad day for horror fans. While I know that we'll always have a place for the classics, it's just too bad that the ones we love aren't as good as they could have been. In the case of the original 1978 horror classic, The Exorcist, the filmmakers did everything they could to make it seem like a real, true-to-life exorcism. They had an actual real-life preacher, and real-live exorcisms! I don't care how many times a priest tells you "It's only a movie," it's still terrifying. There was just so much going on.  So, what's the best example of the kind of horror that you guys will never see again? Well, I'd say it's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 2. It was a different time. The first film was a pretty straightforward horror film, and it was just a good time. It wasn't trying to be anything else, it just wanted to be scary. It just didn't work. The second film, though, it was an attempt to take the first film's formula and just push it in a different direction. It tried to be a little more psychological and a little bit more psychological, and I think that the audience responded to that. "Texas Chain Saw 3: The Next Generation" was a reboot, and to a certain extent, it did succeed. But it was a little too different for some people, and they weren't ready for it. It became the most hated film of the '90s. So it's really unfortunate. I think it's a shame because it was really well made, but I think most of us have moved on from that kind of film. . In addition to a new generation of viewers, a lot of people have stopped seeing the original movie because of all the violence. How do you feel about the idea that it's become something of a horror cliché?  I guess I would agree with you there. I remember the first time I saw it, it had a really strong beginning, but it just fell apart later on. But, I think I'm in the minority here. I do think the violence in the movie is a little over the top. I really don't like the violence, and the first movie had a lot more violence. But

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________ This movie is about a boy who is in love with a girl. The boy gets a friend, who is a girl and they both are in love. The girl, who has been bullied by the boy, has a secret that she will tell him if he will agree to help her get revenge on the boy who bullied her. I didn't understand what they were trying to say or show. The only thing I can understand is that the boy wants revenge, but the only way he can get it is to get a girl who hates him to fall in love and kill him. The movie was not good and I didn' t really like it. I mean, I was expecting a horror movie but what happened to the boy was horrible and I just had a bad feeling about it. There are better horror movies out there.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________  "When the sun goes down, it goes down hard."   This is a movie that I was hoping would be an important piece of cinema history. I didn't want to see it and I didn. Not because I was disappointed or didn't like it. But because the story is so poorly told, and the acting so uninspired. I thought the movie was being directed by an Italian, not a British, and it was a very silly story, with a very uninteresting ending. I think that if this movie was made today, it would be a dud. There's a scene where a woman walks down a street in a bad rainstorm, and she sees a woman with a sign that says "LOST IN A RAIN" and she yells at the top of her lungs "YOU LOST IN THE RAIN, MY FRIEND." Then she sees the sign, and says "How come there's no sign like that now?" and it turns out that it was written by a German poet.   I think that one of the problems with the movie is that it's trying to be "a" film about World War II, but it's really a film about a woman who lost her husband in a storm. I would have been more interested if the movie had been about the war itself, not the aftermath.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You don't see this one a lot. I can't imagine a lot of people would want to watch this movie.  This movie is so bad.    I don't think there is any way the director could have thought anyone would like this movie at all.  So many things go wrong in this movie!   And the last 15 minutes are just a disaster!  The film starts out with a pretty decent story about a little girl named Kaela who is lost and has to find her way back home.  She gets lost and is almost caught by a man in a red jacket.  He has a strange look to him and is wearing a red bandana over his face.  It's like the guy was dressed as a ninja from some movie or something.  But Kaelas friend helps her out and they go looking for her friend's car.  They find it and Kaelar takes a picture of the car and then they find her friend.  The girl was really upset when they found her but they calmed her down and took her back home and they all go back to sleep.  Kaeler is kind of sad because she is lost.  They decide to go out the next day and try to find Kaeles car. Kaelers friend tells her that her friend is out of gas and she will go to the gas station to get gas.  Then they see a car on the side of the road that has a girl on it.  One of the guys from the gas place is suspicious because he is missing his head.  And then he notices a man behind him.  His name is Jeffery and he looks a little bit like the movie guy in the red bandanna.  Jeffery takes Kaelaris car keys and they drive off to find the girl.  As they get there they find out that the girl is Kaelara who is about 7 or 8 years old.  Her parents are a very nice couple.  Their name is Tom and Laura.  I think they could have done a better job of making Kaeloras parents look better.  Also Jeffery was a little strange and strange sounding.  This is the only reason I can think of why this movie was made.  Now to get to the movie itself.  A group of kids get lost and they get lost in a cave that has some weird monsters living in it.

I was expecting a sequel. I did not get a sequel because, there was not a sequel and there is no sign that there will be one. The ending was just not worth the money and I was looking for a happy ending. I would have much rather seen a different ending. If you want a great action movie, I recommend this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it's easier to write about a good movie, but the bad ones can be more interesting.  There's something about the way that films are presented in theaters that makes it harder to make a good film. Â This isn't the case with a film like The Last Starfighter, but when it's presented as a theatrical release, it's almost like a bad documentary. _________________________________________ _________________________________________________ The Last Jedi is an entertaining movie, if not for the way it handles its characters.    I found myself enjoying the film a lot, especially when it was about a character that I hadn't really come to care about, but as I progressed, I grew to care for him.  When it comes to Star Wars, there are few actors who have been as consistent, and even fewer who have done as well, as John Boyega.  The man has had a great career, and I was happy to see that he continues to do well.  John Boyett, who plays Luke Skywalker, was my favorite of the actors who portrayed the main characters in the films.  In the end, it was a good character, and the fact that the character isn't fully developed really made me a bit upset.  Star Wars: The Last Battle I was disappointed when the film ended on a cliffhanger, and when Luke finally returned to Dagobah, it seemed to be a cop-out, and not a true ending.  It felt like a cheap way of ending the film, and something that I'm sure they could have gotten away with.  There were a few things that I didn't care for, but nothing that really ruined my enjoyment of the film. One thing that I did love about the film was that they managed to make the film work without a huge budget.  They managed to bring in some good actors to play important roles, and this allowed them to get some great performances out of them.  This includes Riz Ahmed, Adam Driver, and Domhnall Gleeson.  I loved Riz as he was a really cool character who was very relatable.  He wasn't afraid to use his wit and his charm to get out of some very tough situations.  Driver was a bit of a throwaway character in this film, but was fun to watch.  Gleeson, despite being an alien, has a lot of screen time, and was a great addition to the cast.  For

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ***********  ***********   I love to watch this movie, but the last 3rd act just gets worse and worse. There was a huge cliffhanger, and now it's not clear if the ending will be good.   The film is not the greatest. The acting is good, and the movie is well made. The story is well written. It's the last act that really ruined it for me.   The movie was really great in the beginning, when the characters were just getting started. I loved that they were doing the most ordinary thing you can do, but still with a twist.  . The ending just seemed rushed, as it's a little too obvious that the movie will end the same way. I thought it would be interesting to see how it would end if they hadn't tried to do that, but they didn't. I don't know why, but it seemed like it would have been a better movie if it had been left to the end, with no twist, no ending. It felt like they just couldn't decide if they were going to have a happy ending or a sad ending.   on the other hand, the ending is so sad that I still loved it.  , so this is why I gave it 3 stars, but my overall rating is 3.5. I would give it 4 stars, if they would have cut out the last 10 minutes, because that would have made it a 4 star movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________ The Worst of the Worst: _________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________ The worst of the worst is a genre where the worst of all bad movies are the movies that were never good to begin with, such as "The Last Man on Earth", "The Exorcist", "Night of the Comet", "Dracula", and of course "The Goonies". A "worst of the best" list is always fun to write and I think this is no exception. _________________________________________________________________________________________ The Worst: "The Day the Earth Stood Still" (1960) This was the first movie I ever saw and I loved it. The plot was brilliant. A scientist discovers that his daughter has a brain tumor that is causing her to lose all memory of his existence and time. This makes it easy for the man to escape, as he has the technology to make a wormhole to the past. The movie's theme was simple: love and friendship, but the film also had some great scenes. "The Time Machine" is one of my favorite movies. It was about a guy who finds out his wife is cheating on him, but he doesn't go crazy, he tries to be a good husband and father, and then a spaceship shows up. He gets in the spaceship and goes to the future where the spaceship's owner and his wife have moved to, but it turns out they are married and she had a daughter, but that the girl is actually a boy. The spaceship is going to take the boy back to the present, but is going backwards instead. The boy is stuck in the past and he is in danger of being trapped. A little later, the spaceship leaves to go back to where the boy was. The film is a classic, and I have seen it hundreds of times. It's the best movie ever made, and you should see it. _________________________________________________ The Best: "Spaceballs" (1987) I loved this movie and it was a big part of my childhood. I loved watching "Spaceball" because it had a really funny tone to it. There was a lot of heart in it. It also had a great soundtrack, and it also had amazing scenes that I just love to watch. _________________________ The Worst: I don't think this movie has been made yet, but I will be waiting for it.

One day, he and his girlfriend are walking through the neighborhood when he spots a car that looks like it has been wrecked. When he stops to investigate, he finds a woman inside, dead, and a man with a bloody face, walking away from the car.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ Do not watch this movie. This is not a good movie and the acting is not good. The only good thing about this movie is that it is short. The movie is a waste of time. The film does not have a story. It is just a bad story that does not deserve to be made. The story is about a guy named James who is a police officer. He is a nice guy but is kind of a jerk. His family has a housekeeper named Helen who has a problem with the boss. James and his wife get into an argument with her and then he goes to work. He does not care about the housekeeper. He just wants to go home to his wife. He takes her into a room and starts beating her and throws her against the wall. He then rapes her and kills her. The guy's wife goes to get help but the police does not believe her. They also do not believe that she would kill herself. Helen is so distraught she kills herself. James goes to his boss and tells him what happened. The boss does not take the news well and he orders the cops to do something. They come and arrest James. He goes to prison. His wife's body is still in the house and the police are looking for her. James is not happy about this and he does not want his wife to get in trouble. He writes a letter to his family telling them to not tell her about his prison life. His daughter wants to talk to her mother and tell her what has happened. James' family does not approve of his actions. They don't like James and think he should have left the house. They think he is a monster. The wife is so angry with James and thinks she can change him. Her husband thinks he needs to go to prison because he is so bad. He thinks James is a good man and that he has not been the same since he left. He doesn't like what his wife has done and thinks he is just like his wife, but he thinks he can be a better man. The girl is so mad at James and is so mean to him. He tries to defend himself. She hits him in the face and calls him a monster and tells everyone in the neighborhood that he is bad. The daughter thinks that her mom is bad and her dad is bad too. The parents are so upset and the girl is very upset about the whole situation. The family is so worried about their daughter. She is a little
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The most obvious thing that needs to be pointed out is the quality of the acting. I don't care how big of a star or how big a director they are, when they have no chemistry it makes the movie a joke. That was true of the movie and I can tell you that the actress playing the main character was just an average. I could've cared less about her character. I wanted to punch her.  I wanted to have her die a slow and painful death.  The movie was just plain awful and there was just nothing interesting about it. I mean I was already sick of seeing this type of movie so I guess I was sick of watching this movie.  There was nothing in the movie that was going to be interesting, the acting was awful and the plot was just a bunch of things that happened to a couple of people in a room.  The acting in this movie was awful, they were all just playing the same characters.   I am not kidding.  And they just couldn't get their characters right.  I mean when they had the same lines over and over again it was just tedious and I was bored.  This movie was bad and there are a lot of other bad movies out there.  But this was just too bad to ignore. I guess the film was bad because I would have rather had a bad TV show instead.  So I guess that is it for this movie!

"In the end, though, it was too little, too late," he wrote. "This is a story about a young man and a young woman who have the opportunity to go to college and do great things, and instead get mired in a very deep, very troubling tragedy."  The story of the movie is that a 17-year-old girl is found dead at a secluded cabin in the woods, and she was sexually assaulted and shot in the head. The investigation of the crime is handled by two FBI agents who are obsessed with solving the case, as well as a local sheriff who's determined to solve it himself. They spend a lot of time in the cabin, where the investigators begin to notice that the woman was not alone.  the film is a mess and a mess with a point of view and it doesn't care about that and its characters are not likable. And they never stop looking for the killer and the murderer doesn't stop looking. And it is a lot to get your head around because it has so much going on and there is so much to talk about that it feels like there is a big gaping plot hole in the middle of the film. There's a scene in the first part of the story that is about a man walking down the street and it's pretty much a long shot that cuts between him walking and him in his home, but there is no explanation given as to why he walks. We have no idea if he has been in the house or not. And he never seems to go anywhere without having a camera in his hand or on his shoulder. And the scene with the FBI agents is the most ridiculous thing in the movie, because the agents walk around in a circle and they don't seem to know where they are going or where they have to go. The whole thing is just confusing and doesn't make any sense. You can't even get into a good movie by playing it safe. I have nothing against John D. Lee, who directed and co-wrote the film with Paul Dano, and I'm glad that he got the job to direct this film, because he's a great director and he's got a great vision. But you can't just make a movie like this. You can't
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________________________________________________________ (Wink Wink) This movie was not bad. It was not even average. It has the best story line of any movie I've seen in a long time. I loved the characters. The acting was all right. The story was great. It took a great journey and made me feel for all the characters and their troubles. If you love a good movie with a good story and good acting, then you will love this movie. I wish there were more movies like this. I'm just so sad about it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________   On the other hand, I've never watched the movie, so I can't comment on the performances or the acting. However, as I was waiting for the end credits to roll on the screen, the opening song "Fantastic Voyage" came on the soundtrack.   I was excited, and I was disappointed. The movie was boring. Nothing was happening. There was no tension. I felt that it was a really boring movie.   the characters were not realistic: __________________The characters were really boring. There were some cute girls in the movie. But they had no personalities. They just acted the way a typical movie heroine would. They acted like a typical Hollywood movie heroine. They were never given any kind of personality, no sense of humor, no intelligence, nothing. They are just there for the plot, and nothing more. I guess the plot needed a little more action, and some better acting, but otherwise the movie was just not very good. I don't think this movie was meant to be a good movie. I think the movie should have been a disaster. I just hope that there are other people out there who watched this movie, and were disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________  The worst thing about bad movies is they don't know when to stop. When a movie is this bad, it can be really hard to figure out how to talk about it. But in this case, I'll do it. It was a bad film and it sucked. But it didn't suck because of its badness. I really don't care about its quality. It sucked because it was a cheap movie. It wasn't bad because of the acting, the writing, the acting or the writing. It sucks because it's a cheap, lazy movie. The story, which I really thought was interesting, is a joke. There was no need for a story to start, because I already knew it would end like this. I don't need a story for a movie to suck, because the movie should be bad. The ending was just as stupid as the beginning. And the story was so poor. It made no sense. I was actually kind of shocked when the movie ended, because if it had ended better, I would have had more fun watching the movie. I felt like I had wasted my time and money. This was a poor movie and it deserved to be laughed at. But not only that, it deserved a better ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought the acting was bad and the plot was bad. The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because of the ending. It's not a bad ending, but it doesn't add much to the story, just makes you feel bad.  The acting is good and the story is great, but that doesn't mean you should watch it.  The story of the movie starts with a very strange twist.   It's not really a twist. It just adds more of a mystery and it's not much of a twist at all.  The first part of the film is basically a story about the two main characters, Jules and Alain.  After watching a documentary about the men and women who have lost their lives, they discover a book with their stories written down.  Jules is an artist and Alains a writer, they meet each other at a small bookstore called The Dime Store.  Alain is writing a novel about a man named George, who died and was brought back to life, he has been asked to make a movie about him and his friend, but when the two meet, they find out that they are very different.  They begin to work together, but they discover that George's book is missing.  Then it's revealed that George is in jail and his friends have all died, but he hasn't yet been freed.  This leads them to make their own movie, which they call "The Phantom."  They are to make this movie because they know George is out there somewhere and that his movie is the key to finding him.  It starts out good.  But as it goes on, things get more and more strange.  First it seems that George has been dead for a very long time.  He looks and sounds exactly like his friend from the movie.  In the movie he has an enormous smile, his eyes are big and round, his hands are long and skinny, and he has the same hair.  I know, right?  But the story keeps going.  George is being tortured, he is being forced to relive the last days of his life over and over again.  And the torture is getting worse and worse.  As they go through his memories, they realize that his story is being made into a movie, but the movie is being directed by the real-life characters, the real George.  Finally they learn that George and his real- life friend, Daniel
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. (It's a pun, don't worry.) The "good" part of the movie, in my opinion, was the beginning. It's just when the kids are first starting out in the "real world." That part is funny. It makes you laugh. I'm sure that you don't remember the first "good part" of your life, but that's because you weren't a teenager in the late 80's. The "bad" part is the middle. It was really depressing and sad. It made me feel sad for them, which is something that I don't usually do. I like to laugh at bad movies, especially comedies. I don`t know why people get upset about this one. It`s not the first movie that I've seen that I thought was really stupid. I thought it was good at the time, but it was stupid. The kids don't understand how to handle a situation. I never understood why they were in this movie. I think that this movie should have never been made. It had no value. It just made them look like idiots. The movie had no logic, and I think it was made for kids to watch. That's the worst part of this movie for me. I`m sure that there were a lot of other kids that loved this movie and would have enjoyed it too. I just can't understand why anyone would waste their time on this. I hope that the movie gets better with time.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** The story is very good and I really liked it. The acting was good. The story was really good and very good. But the way the film was shot and the editing is just bad. The editing was so bad and I'm very sad about it. It made me really angry because this was my favorite film ever. I was very happy and happy to see it. I didn't like how the director tried to make it seem like a movie that was made by a big studio and that was a big production. I feel like they had a very small budget. They had to make everything look very expensive. This was a very amateur movie and a big failure. And I think it should be really ashamed of itself. It's just bad editing. I really feel like this film was made in a bad way. It should really be ashamed of its name. It just feels bad and cheap.  Rated 5 out of 5 by cpts from Good Movie Great performance. This is a good movie.  and here's my 2 cents....this movie is a great idea. Its the kind of movie that a kid can enjoy. The film is not so much for the adults. The movie has a lot of action and there's some great fight scenes. The character development is good and the acting is great. It feels like an independent film. The director knows what he is doing. The actors are great. The cinematography is great and the music is great too. The ending was great. Overall, this is a fun little movie. I would highly recommend it. .

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "it's a terrible movie that's terrible." "It's not worth seeing." "I don't want to see it." "This is the worst movie I have ever seen." "A terrible movie. The story is horrible and the acting is horrible." "What a terrible film. I wouldn't have paid $9.00 for it."   "A horrible movie with horrible acting and horrible plot. It's just a horrible movie. I hate it."  I'm sure you have seen this movie, and probably heard about it. I was at a friend's birthday party, and a guy came in and wanted to see the movie. We got it together, and watched it. We were really disappointed. I had no idea how bad this movie was. There is so much wrong with this movie. In the beginning, the audience is given a nice intro. The movie is about a group of kids in high school. They are playing a game called "Fishing" where they have to use their eyes to see a picture of a fish, and then use their ears to hear the sound of the fish in order to catch it. The kid in the front is called Jax, and he has a problem. He can't hear the fish and doesn't have any eyes to look at the picture. He ends up going to a psychiatrist (the movie doesn't say this, but I would think that Jax would go to a doctor to see if he is really deaf) and being told he has some hearing problems. He's also told he can't go to the prom because he's deaf. Jax goes to his dad and tells him that he wants to go to prom, but his dad says that JAX is going to have to come up with a "new" way to fish. His dad tells him he should use a tape recorder. JAX goes home and tries it out. His friends start to tease him because he can hear the sounds of the reel, and they give him the tape recorder and tell him to record the fish sounds. JASD and his dad start going on a fishing trip, but when they get back to JASH's house, JASF doesn't want JASJ to go fishing. He tells him if he goes fishing, then JASK can go to his house and get his picture taken with JAST. They leave JASS's house and they get into a car with the sound off and then
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. This is an epic that is more of a "must-see" than a "good" film. If you are looking for a gritty, over-the-top, fast-paced action movie, this one is not for you. If, however, you enjoy a good film with a great script and some very good special effects, then this one should be on your must-watch list. It is, in fact, the best "Hollywood" film I have seen in years. There are so many amazing scenes in this movie, and I love the character of the villain. The villain is just so evil. He does not seem to care about anything except his own agenda. He makes no attempt to hide his evil deeds. He is a man with no feelings. He's just a machine. And I am not joking. He truly is a machine, with no empathy whatsoever. His whole life is just a game for him. The film begins in a very typical way. We have a young man (Bryan Cranston) who lives in the middle of nowhere. The first scene in the movie shows him riding his horse (I think it is a horse) into the middle class of a small town. He has a beautiful home, a beautiful wife and a beautiful son. His wife is a bit of a bitch, but she is pretty much a perfect person. She is a good mother and he is a loving father. And we are told that he has no problem with this. The next scene shows him going to a dance at a fancy club. A group of beautiful women (I believe it is about five or six women) are all dancing in front of him. As soon as he arrives he sees one of the women, she is so pretty that it is almost as if the camera is focusing on her. The women are all having a wonderful time. And the camera, it seems, is also having a great time. So what does the villain do? He picks up one of these beautiful women, puts her in his car, and drives off. It seems that he does not care that this is a woman. He wants her body. His car has a lot of speed. And when he reaches a town, he speeds up even more. He doesn't care that he is speeding up. He just wants the beautiful woman in his hands. And that is the film's hook: The villain wants this woman, and he has an army of beautiful young women

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________, ___________, _____. ______________. __________________. _____" You don't have to know any of this to get the point, but it's important to understand what you're dealing with. And this movie is an excellent example of how to use this method. The problem here isn't so much the badness of the movie. It's that the entire movie is built around the idea of the evil mother. It makes no sense to have an evil mother at all, and when she is introduced the movie just goes downhill from there. She's a character who has no motivations or back story and is just used as a plot device to drive the plot forward. I won't spoil the movie, but the best way to describe her is a big fat female stereotype. She wants to be taken care of, and is obsessed with her child. The movie tries to make it seem like she's a caring mother, but she's not. I don't think the movie would have been as good if it had been about her love for her child instead of her desire for power. And when the movie starts to get good it becomes pretty clear she's just there to drive up the tension and make the audience feel a sense of dread as the story progresses. She has no character, and her only purpose in the story is to drive you to watch. When the story gets good the mother disappears for a while and her child is taken care in a foster home, then she reappears and she doesn't even care what's happened to her child any more. She is the villain and she should have been killed off, but instead the writers went and made her the mother of a baby. I can't imagine anyone who saw this movie in a theater being able to watch it now. It was terrible, and there was no way to watch the film at all without having a horrible feeling of dread every time the movie got to the part where she's in the foster home. It really was a bad film. It might not have been the worst movie of all time, but for a film made in 1980, it was the absolute worst. I guess the thing to say about this movie was that it was a really bad time to be making a film about a mother with a terrible personality. It would have made more sense to make the film about the evil father instead. It may not have made the movie as good as it could have been, but I think it was still

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. This is not a good movie. The movie tries to make you feel bad about the death of a child, but the whole movie is about an overprotective mother and her child. The child is really cute and has the personality of a puppy. He never got to see his father, who was really a great father. It's just a sad story about a child and an over protective mother who is in love with her son. The whole movie was really bad. I just can't understand why they thought that this was a good idea to make a movie about a mother and child. It just doesn't make sense. I think that the producer, and director should have taken a different route. The producers and directors should have put their heart into this movie and had a good heart. It should have been a good film. It was not.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________  Story: A group of people who have been separated by war are transported to a new land where they must work together to survive and thrive. They do this through farming, hunting, and warfare. They find that the new land is more like a prison than a paradise. There is a man who has been in there for 20 years. He has had no contact with anyone since he was a boy. He finds out that he has been given a great power to protect his people.  The plot is simple and well done. The main character, Dwayne, is the only one that makes sense. There are several other characters that I have trouble getting a feel for. I think they may be a little too strong for some viewers.  the characters are all believable and likeable. Some of the scenes are very dark and have a bit of a disturbing feel to them. The acting is very good. The actors do an amazing job. They don't seem to be acting on stage. The soundtrack is also good. : A good story, well executed. The story was not interesting and the characters were too much of a cliche. I would have liked to see a more original story and characters. I am a little confused about the plot and why these people are being transported to the new world. I thought it was strange that the main character was in there all those years. The ending is also not very satisfactory. I didn't understand why it happened and why the new people couldn't return home. The film has a very dark story. I can't imagine it being good to watch.

The film was directed by James Cameron (Terminator 2) and stars Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford. The story follows Princess Leia (Fisher) as she is abducted by a malevolent force that turns her into a slave and takes her to the Death Star (where she eventually saves the life of Luke Skywalker). This was a big deal at the time, and it was the only film that was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. The movie received a lot of criticism for the portrayal of female characters and the sexism that is prevalent in the story.  1 of 1 people found the following review helpful:  , April 25, 2010  "Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back" is one of those rare examples of a film that does a great job of creating its own universe. It's not that it's the first movie to feature a female lead, but it does so in a way that makes it feel like the Empire has been turned into a female-led group. The women of the Rebel Alliance are led by Princess Leia, and the film is focused around the battles of Alderaan and Hoth. It has a lot going on in its world and it's not just a straight action movie; there are a lot more character development scenes than you would typically find in a Star Wars film.   In addition to the characters, the world that is created is great. The original trilogy was the first to be shot on digital film, which gave the film a more realistic look. This was also the first Star Wars movie to include an intergalactic computer system. The computer system was called TESB, which was basically a computer of sorts, and TESBs were used by the Rebellion in order to track the movements of the Empire and coordinate the resistance.  :

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.   I just got to watch this and my first impression is that it was awful. I've been a fan of both the Star Wars and Star Trek franchises for many years, and have seen the first two movies on VHS. They were absolutely fantastic in their time, and I was hoping this one would be as well. Well it isn't. The only thing good about this movie is the performances from Harrison Ford, Leonard Nimoy, Anthony Daniels, and of course Walter Koenig. However, they are all pretty much there for one reason and one reason only. They play their parts well, but they aren't really there to add anything to the film. The movie is so bad that it doesn't even have any of the charm of the first movie.   the writing is bad: the writing and the acting are so bad, I am surprised the director was given the green light to do anything else with it. It is absolutely unbelievable that a movie of this nature can have a script that is this bad. There is a lot of bad dialog in this movie, and some of it is just really stupid. For example, the scene where a guy has his penis cut off in front of his girlfriend is so stupid that it is laughable. If that isn't bad enough, some of the dialog is so awful, it just makes you want to throw the DVD out of the window. There are also a lot more bad lines than good ones. The best part is that the bad lines are just so bad they are funny, and the good lines are so good they are even better.   at least it had good acting: I actually did enjoy the acting. It was just bad. Some of the acting in this film was good. I thought Anthony Daniels had a good performance. The rest of the actors were pretty bad. Walter Koenigs was pretty bad, but at least he was a good actor. The other actors were just as bad as Walter Koeniger. The most I can say about it is that some of them are worse than Walter Koenige. There were also a few good performances. For instance, I liked the part of John Mears from Star Trek: The Motion Picture. He had some good lines.   for a bad film: it is still pretty bad: some of this film is just downright horrible. It isn't really a Star Wars movie anymore. It has no redeeming qualities. It just makes me feel horrible when I think about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm in my early 30s and I'm pretty bad at movies, but I watched "Crazy Heart" a few years ago. It was a pretty decent movie and I thought it was worth the price of admission. When I saw this one recently I realized I'd actually forgotten what happened to the girl in it, and I guess that makes it all the more disappointing.  When she is shot in the head she looks perfectly fine, she has a little girl's voice and that's about it.    She never recovers from the blow.  That was the end of the movie.    I don't know how she recovered, because I had to go back and watch the original version.  I have no idea what I was watching.  They put a little red light in her eye which gives her some kind of vision, but she never gets that.  The movie was about a man and his wife who live on a boat on Lake Ontario.  A young girl falls overboard and is found by the man.  He takes her to a cabin and has her take a shower.  It doesn't take long before he has sex with her.  Then he decides to take her back to the lake so he can take a bath.  She thinks he's going to kill her but he wants to take care of her. She tries to get him to stop but he insists.  When he starts to get in a little trouble with the cops he finds a shotgun and he puts it to her head.  As he tries to shoot her again she's knocked out.  At the hospital they are told that she was shot in both eyes.  But there's no way she could have survived that much pain.  Now she has been put on life support.  Apparently they took her to the hospital because they thought she was going to die.  Why didn't they tell me she had been shot in one eye and the other was shot off?  If I was a doctor I would have said that she'd have died the minute she was put on the life support machine.  There was a lot of blood coming from the eye, and she was obviously going to bleed out. But she was still going to survive, even though the doctor had to tell her that.   There was one scene where they show the doctor trying to operate on her eye.  In that scene they're going to put a tube up her nose to drain the blood

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The best movie in the world, except for the acting. This movie is about the great tragedy of the life of Christ, and is a story of faith, faithfulness, and the triumph of good over evil.  It has been called the best movie ever. This is a movie that is not for the faint of heart.  I hope the story of Jesus and his disciples, in the life and death of a humble shepherd boy is of comfort to you.  I wish that you will enjoy this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________ If you're looking for a great movie with great performances, this is the one. There are a lot of "funny" moments that make this film really enjoyable. The story of this movie is very funny and I enjoyed it quite a bit. This is a great film with a great cast. It was great to see them all together. The characters are all great. There is one bad character, but that's it. I didn't have a problem with the movie itself. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes movies. It's a comedy. It has a great soundtrack, and it's worth watching. I give it a 7 out of 10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________________________  "The only good thing about the film is that it gives us a new way of thinking about the world." - David Ehrlich, "A Guide to Understanding Film"  The first movie you will watch on this list will be a little scary, but it is not the scary one. The scary one is in the film "Moulin Rouge," where you are surrounded by people who want to kill you. You are surrounded in a film where the characters are not people, but machines. There is a movie about a man who wants to make love to a woman and has a machine that is the perfect woman. He tries to make the perfect girl with the help of a machine, but eventually, he just destroys her.  So, what is a machine? A machine is a man. A man who does not know how to love and a machine who loves.  a man that loves a machine. A machine that can never be happy. ...  A movie that shows us the most important thing in life.

It's a very long movie to watch, and you have to watch it over and over and it will just get boring. I could say many things about it, but it's a bad Movie. ***1 Star*** ***2 Stars*** **1 Star**
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you in any way. I was simply referring to the fact that it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's just plain bad. The story is really bad, the acting is atrocious, the music is awful, the graphics are horrible, the cinematography is bad. And it's all about this one character, that's all. He's the worst character I've seen in a movie in my entire life. If he was an actual person, he'd be a moron. He has no character at all. And he's a complete asshole. He just yells and yells and screams at everybody and yells at the top of his lungs. The whole thing is just terrible. And you should see the horrible acting of this movie, it's really bad. It sounds so awful, like someone just yells all the time. It makes me feel sick. And that's why I never watch this movie again. I don't know why I watched it, but it was just so bad. I'm really disappointed in myself. I've never seen a bad acting movie, a bad story, or a bad music before, so I thought that it might be ok. I watched this movie thinking that I could get some entertainment out of it, so when I finished it I was disappointed in my own stupidity.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ _________ ____________ ___________. That's what I did in "Fantastic Mr. Fox." There's a part in the movie where a character is about to be shot. And this character is a dog. And he has to bite into a bullet and pull it out. I always thought that was really lame, but when I saw it on TV, it looked so good, it was kind of hilarious. And when they shot it on video, they actually showed this part, and then it got cut out. But you can see it in the film. And it was really funny, and I thought it was a really great scene. So I thought I'd do a scene like that for the next movie. ________ _________. ________. _____. So then, when I wrote this scene, I knew it was going to be a big one, and it was also going to change a lot, because in the first one, it just kind of happened. And in the second one, the dog's going to have to make a decision about this. _______ _____________. _______. _______________ _______. It was a huge change. It's hard to get it out of your mind. And that was one of my favorite scenes in the whole movie. And I was just really, really excited when I was doing it. It changed a lot of things. ____ _____ ________. ____. _____. I was actually just going to do that with the character in the beginning, but then they got rid of the dog, and they had to use a dog for that. So it was like I got a new character, and we had to change him and everything. So that was fun. ___________________. _______________________. I like that scene. ________________________. __________________________. I liked it. _________________________________ _____________________________________. Yeah. _____________________________________________________________________________________. So the next thing I did was something I really wanted to do. And so I had the idea of doing a scene where there's a really small part. And what that scene would be was this guy goes in the woods and he sees a big dog, like, maybe he thinks it's a big wolf or something. And then he gets closer to the dog and he starts to pet it. And the dog starts licking his hand, and he tries to keep it off, but it just wants to be on him.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: **********  ***********  If you don't have the time to watch the movie, go to Youtube and search for the movie and watch it.  It is not worth it to watch a movie if you don`t understand the words that are written in the movie.   I can`t say anything bad about this movie. It is well-made. The story is good. The actors are good. But, for me, the movie is not very enjoyable. There are so many plot holes that I could have written the movie by myself. It would be easy to create a plot with the story of a small-town, and then add a few more plot holes, because it is just the kind of movie I like. But I didn`t do that. , so I don`ts get into this movie because I didn't like it. But when I am going to watch movies, I watch movies with subtitles. And when the movie subtitles don`tt understand what the movie they are watching is about, they are just useless. A good movie that doesn`t need subtitles is, I believe, a movie with subtitles, because then the movie can be understood. A movie with the words in the script that don`tis explain how the characters think, but the movie that isn`t written by a genius, so the movie becomes a movie about nothing, because nobody can understand the movie except the movie-maker.

And a big fat ass."  – The Dude  The Dude: "I've never seen anything like it."  and "That's just the kind of shit I like."  in a scene from The BigLebowski. (via wikipedia)  This is probably the most well-known, if not the most famous movie from the 90s. The Dude's character, the title character of the film, Walter Sobchak, has an affair with the wife of his boss, who is a pornographer. This is not a movie about sex or nudity or even any kind of taboo or taboo behavior. It's about the idea that you can have sex in the middle of the desert. It was one of those films that made people think, "that's the way it's always been done." You know, you go into a bar and get some people to watch you fuck. It could be a movie in a different time and place. I don't know if that's true or not, but it certainly is an image that has stuck with people. The Big Lobe is the only thing that comes to mind when I think of The BigLobe.  I first saw The BigBuck in the late 90s, and I remember being impressed by the visual effects. I had no idea they were as advanced as they looked. I also thought it was funny. There were a few scenes that were more ridiculous than funny, but even those are a little bit funny, and the movie isn't as pretentious as many of the other comedies of that era. There is a scene in the movie where the Dude and his friends get a ride from a girl who is also Walter Sobchenak's sister.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this one in the theatre before.  It was a really bad film, I'll admit that.    I was expecting it to be worse.   The acting was really poor.  And the writing was awful.  I could see that the director was just a bad actor, and the script wasn't written very well.  But, in the end, I thought that it was a pretty bad movie.  My rating:    3/10 The story:  It's about a guy, who has an encounter with the evil ghost, and tries to find the answer about it.  The way the story was told in the movie, I was very disappointed with the movie. The plot is very simple.  It has a pretty weak plot.  If you are looking for a thriller with some suspense, this is not for you.  This movie doesn't have any real suspense.  In the end it was pretty boring.  There were too many things that I didn't like about this movie.   It was very slow paced.  No tension.  Not a good movie to watch in the late evening.  The acting:  There is a lot of bad acting in this movie, and I'm sure it's one of the main reasons why people like it so much.  You would think that this movie is good at least.  Yes, it has a lot good acting in it, but it's still just a mediocre movie. There were a lot bad acting performances in this film, but I didn' t think that any of them were that good.  For example, one of my favorite actors, was the only one who was good. The rest of the acting was pretty bad.  Overall, I didn't like this movie that much. The writing:  This was probably the best part of the movie and it was written very nicely.  A lot of good lines are used in this movies.  Even though there were a few characters that didn 't have much character.  They were all really well written.  All the characters were likeable and you didn't feel that they were doing something wrong.  Also, there were some funny lines.  Sometimes, the director wanted to have a funny joke in this one, but the script didn't allow it. But, I'm glad that he didn't make the movie as long as the movie that he did with The Conjuring
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. This is a movie about a guy who goes on a cruise. This guy does not like the cruise, because he does not want to spend his life on a ship. So, he gets off the ship and goes to an amusement park. He goes to this amusement park and has a good time. The next morning, he goes to the park again. This time, he wants to have a good ride. So he goes into the roller coaster and it starts. He gets off and he tries to get on the next roller coaster. He tries to do it. It does not work. So that's how the guy died. The only good thing about this movie is that the whole movie is made up of just a few minutes of footage. If you are a roller coaster freak, this is the movie for you. But if you are not, you will probably find this movie boring and tedious. If the film had just been about the ride, then it would have been fine. But, it wasn't. The film had some good moments, but most of the film was just repetitive. This movie was made for a television show and so the editing was not that great. The characters were not real, so they all looked like a bunch of cartoon characters. The voice acting was not good either. The movie had some great shots, but the editing made it hard to understand what was going on. There were some great special effects, but there were also some terrible special effects. The ending was really bad. The reason for this ending is that a man is dead and a woman is pregnant. If this ending had been left out, then this movie would have had some potential. This was a bad film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________   The bad movie I have to review is The Last Samurai. I don't have much to say about this one, other than its pretty bad. The movie is based on the movie, The Last Of The Mohicans, by William Faulkner. This film was made in 1937 and stars Kirk Douglas as a British Lieutenant who is forced to join a war against the natives. He must travel to a remote island in the South Pacific and rescue his commanding officer.   I will admit that I liked the movie. It had some pretty good acting, the cinematography was nice, and it was very well shot. The story itself is pretty interesting, and has some good historical references. The bad movie is about the same as the movie except it doesn't have Kirk Douglas in it. The main character is a Native American called Tonto. This Native American has an axe and is the best friend of the main character. This movie doesn't work, and I don 't think it should have been made. The director tried to do too much with this movie and it is kind of boring and boring. There is one scene where the main Native American is shot in the head, and there is also a scene where Tonto is killed by an Apache.  , a book about Native Americans who were the victims of genocide, and a documentary that follows the events that led to this. This book was written in 1941, when there were only about 200,000 Native Americans in the United States. By this time, their culture was completely destroyed by white people. This was the same thing that happened to the Cherokee people. There are a few scenes that are based on real historical events, but they are only very brief. The historical references are too vague, and the characters are not believable. This is a pretty terrible movie, and should have never been made in the first place.

The best of the '70s  – Some of the most beautiful music I've heard in a movie. And it's not just the main score. The background music is just as beautiful.  THE BAD  — Some of this movie's more interesting sequences are a bit too fast-paced. The action scenes in the movie are a little too frenetic. The editing of some of the more suspenseful scenes can be a little clunky. And I felt like there was too much going on with the movie. Some of it feels like it's going to be an action movie, but it seems to be dragging on. And sometimes it feels a little like a character story that gets pushed to the side for some of these more intense action sequences.

I don't remember the names of any of the people in the movie, but I do remember the actress that played the girl who was raped. It should have been an interesting role, but it wasn't, and I don  I was not at all impressed with this movie. The characters were bad and the movie was bad.

We both agreed that the film was bad, and that the actors should be ashamed of themselves. I would recommend this movie to the worst of people, and if you are going to watch it, make sure that you have at least two people with you who are in it with you. I think that a rape movie like this should be watched in a dark room with the lights turned off. It doesn't seem to have any story, and it's really hard to believe that this movie was made by some people. It really shows how bad this movie is.  …

The story just isn't that interesting. This movie has a very poor ending, but it doesn't seem to be intentional on the writer's part. It is a bit strange. The main character, Mr. Zabriskie, is dying. His wife is dying, and his son has just died. The family is dying as well. The director says he was "motivated" to make this movie for himself, and that is true, but the movie just wasn't made for him. The movie seems to be made for people who are just interested in seeing a movie about a family's struggles, and not so much for those who actually know how a movie is supposed to be. The writing, too, is not very good. Mr. Bierbaum, a character who is supposedly Mr. A's best friend and the only one that can relate to him, is actually an awful writer, not to mention an awful actor. The other characters are also bad. The son, Michael, is so stupid, and the wife is just so stupid. She never shows any real emotions, and she is constantly being mean to her husband. The mother is really boring, and all the other characters, including Mr. D'Amato, are not very interesting. The ending has nothing to do with the story, so I won't give it any points. (2) The characters are all kind of stupid. The only ones who actually have a personality are the characters who are good or very good at what they do. Mr Zabiskie, the main character and the guy who makes the movie, is an idiot. Michael, the son, is stupid, too. His father is just really stupid, but I guess he was trying to be funny. The wife, Ms. D', is not really interesting, though she is still the most likable character. She is the most realistic, too: she is a woman, and there are many things about her that are very strange and very weird. I don

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I was looking forward to this movie because it was an old one. When I found out it was a remake of a movie from 40 years ago I was a little worried but the movie itself was fine. It was a pretty good movie but I was not a big fan of the remake. There were a lot of things that didn't make sense to me and it didn't hold up very well. The acting was great though. The film was set in an old hotel that had been around since the 1940s and they used the old sets and everything. I was in the mood to watch a movie about the hotel that I didn't know very well but it was ok.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. _______________________  My brother has a great idea for a movie called "The Hanging Tree". We should do it, it's really funny. The idea is that a guy walks into a restaurant, and the manager says "Come in, come in!" but there's no table, he just sits down on the floor and the bartender comes in and says "What do you want?" and he says "I want a Hanging tree!". The bartender says "How about a Hanged Tree?" and the guy says "A Hanged tree! Hanged trees, the most dangerous trees in the world."  If it were not for a guy named "Gus", I wouldn't have the idea. I would have had no idea what a HANGING TREE was, and wouldn't know what a "Hanging tree" was.  So, what is a HANGLING TOWER? Well, Gus was the guy who found it in the middle of the desert, and he told us about it. He was a pretty wild guy. Gus has been hanging in the desert since the 1930's, when he was just a kid. He didn't like the way he looked. He had this thick, greasy hair, and a big nose. He'd never had a shave. He wore old worn-out clothes, and wore boots. He wasn't a very good fighter, but he was a good survivalist. He used to be an engineer, but now he's a hobo. He lived in a little house with a porch, and we used to go there to smoke dope, or to eat. We'd take a sleeping bag out there and lie in it. Gus would make us put our clothes on the ground, and then he'd roll the sleeping bag on his back and get out of the sleeping area.  a couple of weeks ago we saw a movie "The Last Days of Disco" on TV. I had never seen it before, but the movie was really funny and we thought it was a great movie. We watched it the next day and we loved it. We talked about how crazy it was that Gus was still hanging around. We started thinking about what he looked like, and how he was dressed. We decided that we wanted to do a movie with Gus, but we couldn't afford a movie crew. We didn't know how much we could get for a HINGED tree. We also didn't want

It didn't live up to the first film. I recommend that you don't watch this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________ (about the movie in question). You know, the one that has a stupid story, or a bad performance, or doesn't make any sense? That is an easy thing to do. The reason why a bad film is bad is that it lacks originality. But if you're making a good film, that's something else. So, what makes a good movie good? Well, you have to have good actors, a good script, and good direction. You also have to make your characters interesting. And, to be honest, the first two points are the ones I care about the most. But, there is something else I care a lot about, and that is how well your film is shot. I've been making movies for a long time. In fact, I made a lot of them during the 80s. And I've noticed that the first film I made was the worst. The camera was too slow, the lighting was way too bright, the actors were too bad, and there was no background. But the one thing that I learned is that you can never make a bad picture because you will never make it to the end of the process. I had to go through so many stages to make a good picture. I mean, I started out with just a $5000 budget and I had no money, but I made that movie in three months. I made the movie for just $5000, but then I made three more movies that cost almost a million dollars each. So it is possible to make something very expensive that you don't need. But it takes a lot more time and a lot less money. But that's not the problem. The problem is that if you don"t make the movie right the first time, the movie won't get finished. It will end at the point that the actors aren't interesting, the scenes are boring, and the editing is bad. And if the movie is made the first way, it won't even get finished in the first place. So the first movie was not a bad one. The thing that makes it a good one is that I made it right the second time. And the second movie was even better than the first one. I'm sure the next one will be even better. It's just a matter of time. But what's interesting is that the same thing happens in many other areas of film making. There are no rules in film making, no one will tell you how to make it better.

"I watched it in its entirety in the theater, and I loved it."  I thought this movie was really interesting and well written. The script is good. The acting was all right. The story was intriguing and well thought out. The ending was a bit rushed. The cinematography was nice. I don't know why it's called a horror movie, but I think it could have been a good thriller. The final act had a nice twist. There are also some really good special effects. I thought the effects were a bit over the top. I did not think the script was great, but that was not a problem for me. I enjoyed the movie. I think you could make a really good movie out of it. I would have liked a little bit more development of the characters. I just felt like the actors didn't really get enough screen time. The movie could have had more depth. I felt that it was rushed. I liked the ending, but it was kind of a waste of time. I'm glad I watched it. It was well written and interesting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I hated this movie" - A bad movie is a movie that I don't care for, but still watch it because it's on tv.  I never really cared for "Halloween" either, but it was a good movie and I didn't really hate it either. I hated the original "HALLOWEEN", but I still watch the movie, but I have a hard time saying "I hate this movie." The only other negative thing I can say about this movie is that I was surprised by how bad it was.  The movie is set in the future, and the future is filled with cybernetics.  It's not like the future where the only technology is a gun, and it's not a "futuristic" future.  These people were in the past, and they have cybernetized bodies.  They are now people with normal bodies, but they have this cybernetic thing going on, and this is not like in the movie.  This is like in a comic book.  There's no electricity.  People have no telephones.  No computers.  Everything is digital, and you can't get back in time to fix things.  That's why it's called "The Future".  It was a very weird movie, and I can't imagine how much it would suck to watch it.  But I guess it was made by a group of people who didn't like the original movie, because I really enjoyed the first one.  Plus it was fun to watch this movie as a kid.  If you hate movies, this is the one you want to see.  And I recommend you to watch the original one, if you have the time.  It's the only good thing that this movie has going for it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Last Starfighter.  This movie is a terrible piece of work.  I think the only reason why it is on this list is because it has some of the most bizarre and ridiculous dialogue of any movie ever made.   What a strange movie!  If you like silly dialogue and slapstick then this is for you!    The main character is a guy named Tom.  He is an old timer from an alternate history where the United States and the Soviet Union are at war.  His grandson has been captured by the Soviets.  Tom has to get his grandson back and has to take him on a journey through time and space.  They get to the past where the Soviets are winning the war and there they find a girl with a gun.  She has some sort of special powers.  The Russians are having a hard time fighting off the Soviets and they have to retreat to a space ship to escape.  When they get to space the Russians destroy the ship but the boy is still alive and they get him to safety.  However the Soviets send a missile and destroy the space ship and all the astronauts on it.  All the astronauts get blown up and die.  Then Tom has the idea to send all the humans on the planet back to the future and then send them back home to the present and change the future so that the Soviets can win the war.   It works.  It is hilarious.  I really can't believe that this movie exists.  Everyone else hates this movie and I am glad that I have a copy of it so I can share it with all of you.  One of my favorite parts of the movie was the dialogue.  Most of it is completely nonsensical.  At one point they are in a time machine and they are about to go to the 60's.  But then Tom and his grandson are in an elevator with this girl with the gun. He calls her and she says "What do you want?"  Then they talk about how much they love each other and how they have so much in common.  That line made me laugh so hard.  Also the guy in the elevator with the girl has this weird thing going on.  Well the guy is supposed to be a robot but he looks like a human and he is very weird.  Oh my gosh I wish I had a copy!  The last thing I want to mention about this movie is that it has a lot

(1942) - I have not seen this movie since the late 80s. This was the movie I grew up with, it was a classic. It is not as bad as you would think. The actors are not that great but they are good and the director knows what he is doing. It has a great ending.  The movie was about a girl who moves from Texas to New York City in the 1940s. It tells the story of her first time in New York. She meets a boy, who becomes her boyfriend. The movie has a lot of great music. It does have a lot in common with The Great Gatsby.  and if you love that movie, you will love this movie. .    I will watch this movie for many years to come.   ___________________________________________  I don't even know why this movie has such a bad reputation. It's not bad at all. It isn't as bad, as some might think. I think this movie would be good for kids. It had great music and it wasn't as scary as some people think. It just had a great message.  to the people who don't like this movie: I don't care if you don't. If you don;t like this film, just ignore it. I don;'t think you will like it either.  the movie was released in 1942 and it has some great music to it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* I have been a fan of the original trilogy of Star Wars for almost as long as I've been alive. It was only when I saw Episode I: The Phantom Menace that I realized the true potential of the saga. It would not be until Episode II: Attack of the Clones that I fully appreciated what Star Wars was. As a lifelong fan of science fiction I'm still in awe of what George Lucas was able to accomplish. I don't think the original series has been given enough credit for what it is. Even though the films were far from perfect, they were so well done that they have become a cult classic. I still watch the prequels to this day and I'm glad that I started with the original.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's bad.  I'm not sure why it's rated as PG-13, considering that the movie's pretty much just a glorified slasher flick.  The story is a bit weird, and if you're not familiar with it, you might be confused about the characters.  It's the third film in the "Punisher" series.  Frank Castle is a former U.S. Marshal who is living in New York City and gets a chance to be a vigilante again.  The plot is that a mysterious killer is after a person named Frank Castle.   The movie is basically a glorification of the "Halloween" franchise with Punisher being a masked vigilante who kills criminals.  There is one scene where Frank Castle kills a criminal and then the police comes and asks him to go to the hospital, which he refuses.  He does this because he's been told to, and the police doesn't believe him.  I really like the Punisher movies.  They've been good, but this movie is really weird and not really the Punishing one.  What makes it worse is that it's a remake of a movie where a lot of the action is done by a man in a wheelchair.  If you don't know who he is, he was in the original movie and played a similar character.  And even though it's called "PUNISHER", this movie doesn't have the Punishment part.  This is a pretty standard slasher movie with the only difference being that this Punisher is a retired police officer.  Now that's a lot better than a guy who is in a chair who kills people. The acting is pretty average.  Some of the best performances are from Jon Bernthal and a young Michael Biehn.  Other actors who were great were Samuel L. Jackson, Frank Dillane, and even the young John Leguizamo.  Bernthal was good in this movie and it didn't really take me long to forget that he was the guy in the wheelchair. The rest of the cast was decent.  But the best acting came from the young Michael B. Jordan.  His character is actually a friend of the Punishers who is a good guy.  Overall, this movie was alright.  Not as good as the first two, but it wasn't bad either.  Just a bit boring and not what I was expecting.

They are the only group of people in town who are all into bad movies, and they're the only people who get into a group movie because they don't think there is a good movie at the next one.  They are all crazy like crazy and think they're funny.  The only funny thing about this movie is that they have to watch the bad movies for a living.  It's so bad that the only thing funny about it is how the women think it's funny.   It's not funny, it's awful.  So they watch bad movies to make money.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It's a waste of time and money, and the actors are not good." That's the worst review I ever got for a movie, even if the film had some good parts. I've seen it more than once, and even after all these years I still think of it as the most boring, stupid movie ever made. But the worst part is that I loved it. I thought it was great, and was surprised to find out that it is really bad. I can still remember it in my head. What can I say? I had been a little bit of a fan of this movie since it was first released. I loved the concept, I thought the film was really funny, and I thought they had a great concept.  It wasn't until years later that I realized that the entire film was just a huge waste of money and time. It is a stupid film, but it's still a great movie. It's a story about a girl who has been cursed by a ghost to have no control over her body. The ghost is actually her father, who is a very creepy character. The only character I liked in the film, was a character called the Man. He's a creepy old guy that can change his appearance at will, and he's basically a creepy creepy creepy old man. I loved how the film didn't just focus on the curse, but also on the ghost. The way it was filmed really made it seem like the ghost was actually in control. The ghosts are supposed to be evil, and you don't see that in the movie. I think this is one of the reasons why the film isn't as popular as it could be. It has a few funny scenes in it, but they are a little too funny. They were kind of pointless and just kind of came out of nowhere. There was also one scene where they were filming a scene and I remember it really well. The director came up to me and said, "Do you know the words to this song?" And I said, no, but I'll try. I did know the song, but he just said, that's what it sounds like, it's pretty good. But the film is really boring. It doesn't do anything that's very original or very good. There's nothing really good about it. The plot is not very original. The only thing that made it interesting was the idea that the ghost could change people's bodies at will

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Close  The Dark Knight Rises: Here's why the Nolan Batman trilogy is the worst in history 1 / 12 Back to Gallery  Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight" is a great movie. But as the movie progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that its main character is just a hollowed-out husk of his former self.  There is a reason that Batman doesn't wear a mask anymore. He is dead. His only reason for being is that he is Batman. He can't be any more human. He's too much of a superhero. .  the real Batman is not the one that you think he is, he is the other Batman, a real man, a man who has given up his life, his family, his reputation, everything for a mission he's been working on for decades, and who now is dying of a terrible illness. It's the same as in the comic books, where Batman can't go on fighting forever.  (Batman is literally dying in the movie, and his last words are: "I'm sorry." I can't tell if he's really sorry, or if he really does think he can win. And he really isn't sorry, not really. He just wants to live in peace and quiet for the rest of his life. Batman is literally suffering from terminal cancer, and he just wants his world to end. He wants to be alone, and if that means that he has to die for a greater cause, so be it.)  The movie's hero is Bruce Wayne. His life has been ruined. The world has been destroyed. The only thing that he can do is find a new one, and that new life will be his. He doesn't want to leave Gotham. But he doesn't have any real choice. He has been in this situation before. He needs to find a way to end the cycle of crime and violence in Gotham. The problem is, it's too late for that. He destroyed the city, and now there's no way to bring back what he destroyed. It is up to his new, more idealistic, friend, Talia Al Ghul, to find the way to rebuild Gotham. And that is what she wants, and what she believes in. She believes that she can restore the city by destroying it. She wants Batman dead, and she wants her own version of him to replace him. And she's right. She can.

She decides to confront them one by one, and they each turn out to be a real human being. One of the men is actually her father. She confronts him, and he confesses to his crimes. The movie starts out with a scene where the father and his wife were out in the yard with their son, when they were approached by a stranger. She threatened them with a knife and demanded money, so they agreed to give her the money. The stranger then stabbed her husband to death. The wife had to leave the house to get help. She was later found murdered. The father went missing, and his body was found in a river with his wife's body in a bag in front of him. Posted by jordan.t.kessler at 8:08 AM
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why I did not like it: ___________________________________________ _______________________________________________________ I have been a huge fan of the series since the first movie came out. I loved all the old style movies, and even the new ones, and I have always been a fan of this one. However, this movie is just too long, and has so much filler that it has lost what makes the series so great. The main reason I did this review is that I am curious to see if the writers of the movie actually have a plan for the story. I don't want to see a movie that is just a long list of scenes and dialogue. The movie starts out good, with a great music track. The whole movie is great, but there is so much story that is cut out, that it just becomes just a bunch of scenes that I don''t feel that are important. There is a lot of filler in this movie. This is the second movie where the movie was only a collection of scenes, and not a story. The first movie had a really great story, and the second is just as good, but cut out. The only thing that I liked was that the story seemed to be a bit more intense than the first one. Also, there was a bit of action in this, and they do a good job with it. The last thing that this movie does is that it does a really good job of not spoiling any of the upcoming movies. I am not a huge horror fan, but I do love the movie, and it is very entertaining. I just wish that it would have been longer, because it is getting boring after awhile. This movie is a must see for anyone who wants to watch a really old style horror movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________, it's not the movie that's the problem, it is the way the movie is made that's wrong.  It's just a simple film about a father and his two sons, and how he lost his temper. And now they have to live without him. The story is simple, but it's done in a simple way. You have a very old father, and his son, who are both in their 20's, and they want to live life without him, without their father, without him always being in the background, just because he lost it, and now they need a way to survive. But there's more than meets the eye with this film. It's a movie with a very good story and good acting. The acting is great, and it really makes you think, it makes you wonder. But it's also a very bad movie. Because it's made in a bad way. The script is a mess. I really can't explain it in a few words. It makes no sense. The first script that was made was good. The one that was adapted was worse. The movie was made to have an effect. And the effect was bad. The original movie was good, and the one that's adapted is bad. And that's what makes this movie so good. Because the first script was good and the second script was worse, and that's why this movie is so good, because it has a very different story and a very important message, and we can all learn from it. But this movie, it has been adapted to make money, and not for the truth, and there's no point in trying to explain it. It has nothing to do with the truth. You can watch it and understand what's wrong with it, but you can't really see it, because the movie was just made to make a lot of money. The truth is that the movie's not bad. It is just made in such a bad style, so bad that you can never understand what the movie tries to say. I mean, it was so bad, that the director wanted to call the movie The Wrong Man. That was the reason for the name. But I guess that was not good for the film, because that's not a very nice name. So I think the only reason why it was called The Wrong Woman is because of the title. Because of that, it just has to be the movie. I guess there's nothing else to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It doesn't matter if you love the movie or hate it.  If you didn't see the movie, you can't tell what the movie was about.    This movie had me thinking that a guy named Charlie would never be in a movie again.  He was supposed to be a guy that went to prison for rape and he was supposed  to be in prison for 25 years.  When he got out he started his own company and he ended up marrying a beautiful girl named Kelly and they had a baby boy.  The guy had been in prison  and had been raped and it turned him into a killer.  And then he gets out of prison and gets back in the game.  It was a pretty good movie, but it's not really a good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________  When a movie is bad, you are supposed to enjoy it, but this movie was just boring. It was the same old story about a girl who lives with her sister and their cat and her father's sister and her cat. The sister is supposed to be in college and she and her parents are moving to a new town. But she wants to have her own cat so she gets a cat and that is how the story starts. The movie was really boring and I didn't feel any emotions for the character. She just got the cat because she was a good girl. But that was it. And I didn?t have any feeling for her or the cat or her parents or her sister. It just didn?'t get me. ____________________________  I liked this movie. But it was just too much like the other movies that are on TV right now. It is a good movie, but it has a lot of similarities with other movies, so it was a little disappointing. ______________________  The best part of this movie is the ending, but that is only because it is a very bad movie. I loved the characters in this movie, they were all great. I liked how they had fun and had a good time. And the ending was really great. But, it is just soooo bad. _________________________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It's a good movie but it's just not funny.  The writing is awful and it's very hard to watch.   It's the worst movie I've ever seen.!" I'll start with the bad:  The acting was atrocious.  The writing is just bad.  You can't really say anything bad about it.  It's just horrible.  And the actors in the movie are just terrible.  They're all terrible.  The only good thing about this movie is that it's not terrible. It's probably one of the best movies ever made.  It's not bad in a good way: It has some great lines, some great scenes, some funny lines.  But it's awful.  Not in a way that I want to watch it again.  I would never watch it. It may not be a great movie, but it may be one of those movies that people will never forget.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________________ I was watching a movie the other night (this was back in the early 90's) that was about an archaeologist. He's in a cave, in a long cave, and there are some dinosaurs there. He finds a little girl. The little girl was playing in a pool with a couple of other kids, and the little girl falls and falls and faints. The archaeologist is trying to get her to stay down. Then he finds a baby. The baby's been born and has an eye on its forehead. He takes it and puts it in his bag, then he goes back to his cave. He has a couple more babies, but he gives them away. He had one baby that was a little boy. He puts it on the beach with some other babies and a dog, and he puts a blanket on the baby. Then the little boy's mother comes by and she goes, "I've got a little baby, what's he doing with that?" The archaeology guy goes, yeah, he's going to do what he's supposed to do, and she says, "It's your job, you're supposed to find out what happened to this baby." The archaeological guy goes "You know what happened?" The mother goes "Oh yeah, it's pretty obvious. It was the dinosaur that ate it. The other ones weren't doing too well." The little boy says "What dinosaur?" The archaeologists goes "Well, the T-rex's been here a while, it had been dead for a long time. It ate it and it took the little baby with it." The mother says "You sure that's it?" The archaeological guy says "Yeah, it sure is. I've got all the bones I need to find it. There's only one problem. It's a dinosaur. I can't find it anywhere." The guy gets a little nervous and he runs back to the cave, but the baby is gone. He starts back down the hill. The guy's going, "Oh my god, I think I'm going to get myself killed." He finally finds it again, but it's not there. The archaeologists calls the police. The police say, "Well why didn't you get your hands on the little guy?" The guy says, well, it was in the baby, and I was afraid to take it home. The cops are like, "You can't be afraid of a little dinosaur." The girl's mother

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  My favorite movie is a movie that I hated from the beginning.  I was very disappointed in this movie. I didn't care for this movie at all. ,  - "I don't really remember much of the movie except the final two minutes where the man is talking about the bad things in his life."  It took me a while to find this movie because the movie was not very good.  the main character is a horrible person, he does horrible things to his wife, his son, and his friend. The main problem with this movie was that the whole time I was watching it I was thinking about the guy's wife and son. After that I realized that this guy was a real horrible person. He has all these horrible people around him. His son doesn't understand that his father is an evil person. So he doesn't even care about the fact that his dad does bad things. I'm not sure why my father would have kids like that. The other problem with the movie is that the story was not told right. I really wish I could give this movie a 1 or a 2 because of the story. It took me to the end of the film and I couldn't believe how bad the movie actually was. This movie is not worth watching. I don't think it's worth seeing because of this movie, I give this a 0 because it's so bad.    Overall: ____________________________________  This movie is terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ The movie's not bad, but it is kind of hard to watch. You have a girl who is the daughter of a scientist, and she decides to try to save the world. She has to do all of this by being a badass, and not dying. The plot is pretty good, but the pacing is too fast and you really have no idea what is going on. Also, the way that the scientist is depicted as being kind of a jerk is really annoying. I think that it is just his way of being strong, but I was kind of disappointed with it. And there is no point where you can actually understand what he is trying to do. The movie has a pretty short running time. I would not recommend this movie to people who don't like action or science fiction.  Helpful to the plot. You don't really get to know any of the characters well, which is a shame because it would have been interesting to know more about them. It doesn't really give any plot to the movie, just more action and explosions. If you like action movies, then I think you will like this. But, if you are not a big action fan, then it probably won't be for you.The soundtrack is pretty nice. It is pretty catchy and the ending song is pretty cool.The special effects were really good, even though they were kind of cheap. If it weren't for the cheap special effects, I think the movie would have had more than three stars.The acting is decent for the most part. Most of the people who were in this movie were really bad, and it's not a surprise since this is just a cheap action movie. I don't know how the people involved got hired to do this, but if you want to see some bad acting, then this is probably the movie for you.(4/10)Personal Rating: 4/10

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  Don't think I have a good track record of giving my own films bad reviews. I know it's a good thing for other people to know this is the case. However, I don't think anyone should give me a hard time over my movie reviews. Why should it be any different when I give a bad review about another movie? I am a critic, after all. The review of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire was not meant to be a scathing attack on the film. It was simply an opinion about the film as a whole. And I can assure you, it is not as bad as it has been made out to be. I really did enjoy the movie, and I would love to see it again. The movie is not without its flaws, but it is a very enjoyable film that I highly recommend to everyone. It is a great movie that is worth watching even if you do not like Hunger Games movies. If you have not seen the movie yet, please do. It will make you happy you did. And if you have already seen the film, I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I don't know what the hell this movie is about."  I love the title of this movie, but I can't stand the movie. It's just a boring, stupid, stupid movie that has no redeeming qualities. It has no plot, no characters, and no direction. The actors are all the same, and the movie just runs around with no plot and no character development. The ending of the movie makes no sense. The movie ends with a scene where the main character (Travis) is standing outside of his house waiting for his wife to come home. When she finally comes home, he jumps out of her car and walks to his house. But when she arrives, he has to leave and go back to the car and the scene goes on with him going to his home. I can see how this could have been interesting, but this movie just sucks!  It was boring, boring, and boring. It was hard to watch this movie because I just wanted to laugh at the stupid movie.  The movie has the most cringe-worthy scene ever. Travis is in his car, going to a meeting at the university. The first scene of the scene is when he's driving to the meeting and he's thinking, "what if they're not there?" He then realizes he's on the wrong road, and he has no clue where he's going. He then makes a u-turn and runs out of his car and falls down. ______________________________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________I'm not a big fan of the new Harry Potter films. They are basically just one movie after another. I've only seen two of them (which is why I'm not going to bother reviewing them) and they are simply mediocre. However, I did love Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. I also loved the books and have read them several times. However the movies do not live up to the books. They're just bad and not good at all. Harry was supposed to be a great character and a hero, but the whole thing was a huge letdown. The books were good and the movies aren't. I hope they are never made into movies again.I loved the new movies, but I was sad to see J.K. Rowling go. She was so good at creating a universe that I could see myself in. I loved the idea of the twins, Dumbledore, and the Weasleys. They all had different personalities and were like family. There was so much magic and mystery that I just wanted to read more. I really wanted to be in the world of Harry Potter. I don't know how I'll react to the death of the last character. Hopefully she has another thing planned.

But it was a terrible movie and not worth watching. The bad acting, the cheesy voice acting, and the lame script were just all over the place. The story was so unbelievable, I could not believe that it was happening to these people. The director made it seem like he was trying to tell a true story. But this was a made-up story. I never would have believed this if I had seen the movie. The way the movie was filmed was very amateur. The cinematography was poor, the action scenes were not very good. The only reason I watched it was because it was at a friends house. I am going to try and get a refund for this film. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  A bad movie is just like a good party. I've seen a lot of bad movies, but I've never seen one so good as a bad party.  — Paul Thomas Anderson (The Master)  Advertisement  If I told you the film was about a young woman whose best friend is murdered, you might get a kick out of it, but you would also think that the woman was going to get raped and murdered at some point in the film. You might also get a lot more out of the film if you knew how the story was supposed to end.   In order to get to the ending, you have to get through a lot. In a way, this is a very slow-paced film, because there's so much happening. It takes a few hours to get from the beginning to the end, and then you have a long and tedious wait to see how everything ends. But once you finally get there, it's great.  in many ways, the film is about the woman, who, in a way is like a victim in a crime. She has lost a good friend and she can't deal with it. She can't go to her best friend's funeral, and she doesn't even want to talk about it.  and also, she has to deal with the fact that she's dead, so she can no longer go on the life she's living. She doesn't feel a thing. The woman is actually very brave and strong, and in many respects, she really is the main character of the movie. She feels so lonely and disconnected from people, and so she needs to go out and meet people. She needs to do something that she doesn the life of someone who is going through some kind of crisis. It's really quite fascinating how she's going to meet people, but she has this strange sense of urgency to do it.   "I think you've made me a little bit crazy."  The whole movie takes place in a small town in France, but the film's plot really takes place at the college of the same name. The movie takes the place of a kind of murder trial that's been taking place at this college, and it focuses on the college students, and the college's president. In some ways, it is a film about the college, because it takes place around the college. "I'm afraid of the future, and I want to die."  of course

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. Do this.  If I were you, I'd write something like this:  "The last 30 minutes were boring and uninspired, especially considering the film's intended audience: children. And yet, I couldn't stop thinking about the movie. Why is this film called The Wizard of Oz? I mean, the movie starts with Dorothy coming to life. There are no ghosts or witches in the story. Why would they make a movie like this? I'm guessing it's a marketing ploy. I was looking forward to seeing the story of the Tin Man and the Scarecrow again and once again they disappoint me. The movie isn't bad, but it is not good. It's just not. "  The above quote is from a friend of mine, a former teacher who now lives in a town just outside of San Diego, California. And I know what you're thinking: "But wait, you're not one of those people who has to see The Wizard Of Oz? You don't have to see it anymore, right?" Well, not really. The Wizard, or the Wonderful Wizard of OZ, as he is commonly known, has been a staple of childhood entertainment for generations. But the current version (which was released in the late '50s) was released at a time when a lot of parents (myself included) were afraid that the film would scare their kids. It was too scary. It featured too much violence. It didn't have enough heart. So I didn't see it for years. But in the last few years, I have been watching the movie over and over again. And it still scares me. It makes me think about my childhood. I see so much of it in this film. The feeling of being lost in the woods, the feeling of fear, the way the Scarecrows go on a journey and then disappear, and the way Dorothy goes into the Tin Woodman's house and into the story, just to find that she's not the one who's being fooled. I mean why would she go in there if she knew she wasn't the Tin Woodsman? This film also reminded me of a time I went to my sister's house in the middle of the night to watch it. It had been two months since we had been to see the movie, and my sister had to go to work the next day. I sat there watching the film, and as I did I couldn the sound of a

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. I'll just put it this way. This movie was just plain boring. I guess I'll be more apt to write a positive review about it. I was just going through my usual routine, but when I started watching the movie I realized how boring it was. I think that the producers had the wrong idea when they decided to make it a movie about a group of students at a college who are having a party at their dorm and are having their usual fun, but one of them is actually a robot. It was just really stupid and not even entertaining. I just didn't like it and I'm sorry if it's not good enough to recommend it.  ...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it's the same story. This one is not even a good movie. It is a boring, uninspired, and generic story about a guy named Sam. Sam is a very smart guy who has a very bright future. He has an apartment, a girlfriend, a car, and his very own website. This is not like other stories of this genre. The movie does not have a unique concept, nor does it have a really interesting story. The story was only just okay. It's just an average story that has nothing to say. It was very unoriginal. The best part of the movie was that it was very funny. I loved that it had a bit of a comedic edge. The jokes were very funny and it did a great job of using this aspect to its advantage. This movie is a complete disaster and it shows. The plot is so poorly done that it's not even funny. This movie has so much going for it. It has some good moments and some very funny moments. But it just has a huge problem. The ending of the story is a total failure. It does not add anything to the story and does not resolve anything. It also doesn't explain anything. I feel that this movie should have had a different ending. It would have made this movie a better movie. I would even say it would have helped make this movie worth seeing. The last part of this movie is not at all what the movie wanted to be. The whole thing is a mess and I don't think the writers were even trying. The main reason this movie sucks is that it does not tell a story. It just does a poor job at trying to tell a good story. 3 out of 5 stars So I'm a big fan of a few movies from the 80s. I love films like The Goonies, It's a Wonderful Life, It Could Happen to You, and even the Lord of the Rings. This film does not disappoint me in any way. It stars the great Johnny Depp. Johnny Deppy is a perfect fit for this movie. He brings a lot of energy and charisma to the part. This actor was able to make this film a lot more entertaining and memorable than it needed to be, and it worked. This was a very fun movie to watch and I recommend it to anyone who loves the 80's.

The main character, a young, hot-headed male (played by David Naughton) has to take his first test at a law school. He's in for a rude awakening when he's sent into a hallway where a group of women are discussing something and all of a sudden they start kissing. As if on cue, another guy comes up to the young male and the two start kissing, and it all goes from there. After the initial awkwardness, I found the movie to be quite interesting. The characters were well drawn and there were some interesting themes being discussed. As a matter of fact, the main female character was very interesting. I could not help but wonder what was going on with her. In a way, I had the feeling that the movie was trying to be something other than a typical high school romance story. The sex scenes were not too graphic, but that was okay. The scenes where two women were kissing were not shown too often, and I found them rather sweet and innocent. It was nice to see a movie about a group that included two men. I liked the idea of the movie and I am glad that it was made. I only wish that more films like this were made. ______________________ The Good: I really liked this movie. It had a great script, and a good premise. The cast did a great job of playing the characters, and were both very well drawn. I especially liked the male lead, David Naugton. His character was a bit odd at first, but I liked him a lot as he grew into the character. The music in the movie is excellent, and although there were a couple of scenes that were not very exciting, they did not affect the overall story. I really thought the movie could have been a bit longer, but it did have some good moments. The acting was really good, especially with David Naghton as the main male character. I thought that he was a nice actor. I also really enjoyed the scenes where the two women in the group had sex. The Bad: The sex was a little too explicit, and that was a problem for me. I was not a big fan of it. In fact, some of the sex scenes seemed to be way too graphic. I did not see any scenes that
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's like watching a film in slow motion. The dialogue is bad, the story is awful, the characters are awful, and the acting is bad. The worst part is that the acting in this movie is bad! The movie is about two guys, who are going to a bar to have a beer, but they have to stay a little bit late. The night takes a turn when they come across a woman who is in a horrible situation. She is being chased by a guy. The guy has the gun and wants to kill her. She asks him to give it back and he says no. So he hits her in the head and runs off. When they get back home, the guys think that she was kidnapped by the guy. I could go on and on about this movie. This is a horrible movie. I recommend this movie only for people who don't like to watch bad movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________ ___________________________________________ What is wrong with this movie? I'm not sure. It's too much of a drag. I have never been able to really enjoy a movie as much as I do in this one. There's a good story here, but it's so over the top that it's no fun to sit through. The only thing that saves this movie is that the acting is really good. I just don't get the point of the movie. The characters are all just terrible. I don't know if the story was just badly written or if they really did make the movie up as they went along, but the actors just don`t have the charisma that you want from a movie like this. They`re just too good to be real. I really didn`t understand how they could possibly think that this would be a good idea. It`s a total disaster. It will probably be banned from the multiplex for a long time, even though it`s so bad it`d make a great spoof of a bad film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I saw the movie twice. The second time, I was more impressed with the film. It's not that it's a bad film, but I wasn't a huge fan of it. I did like the movie's premise of an evil corporation coming after the evil government, and the ending was pretty cool. The only problem is that it was a bad story that doesn't have enough action.

The Good:  in the movie The Wolfman, there is a scene where a guy is walking down the street, he passes a guy on the sidewalk. He looks at him and he says "hey, I'm Jack Burton" he then turns and says "you should come over and see me at my place" and then he turns around and walks off. When the guy sees him, he is so confused and afraid that he turns and runs. This scene is so powerful because of the fact that the guy's fear is so real. You know what I mean, when the guy turns and starts running away, he's not going to make it. I also think that this scene is amazing because the character is afraid, but he doesn't let it control him. He does not let it consume him, and he does not allow himself to get too caught up in the situation. I think this scene also shows how strong and resilient the character really is. Towards the end of the movie, when he is walking through a cemetery, he looks over at some of the tombstones and he sees one that says "here lies Jack Burton, he gave his life in service of his country". He feels so sad that he thinks about his friend, and how he could not do anything to help him. It's a great scene because of its emotion and power. ___________________  The Bad: in this scene, the protagonist is running, and in the background, he can hear the sound of helicopters and guns being fired. He starts to get scared and runs for his life. He keeps running, but when he gets to the end, the helicopter has already taken off. He gets to his feet and starts to run again, but then he gets stopped by someone in a car. The car honks, and the protagonist starts
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.   This is a movie about a couple of guys and a girl that decides to have a "wedding" in the most ridiculous way. First of all, they had to rent a "diner", which was in the middle of a wooded area with a river running through it. The "diners" were really not much better than a motel. There were 2 or 3 tables and it was filled with people who were all standing around. It had a huge flat screen tv on the wall and a couple other televisions. The couple had to dress up in all kinds of clothes for this "wEDDING". It was a big deal to the people who watched it. They were watching a movie and the whole time the people in the movie were laughing their asses off.   of course it was a movie but the people laughing all day was like the people at the movie. This was a disaster.   and this is the best part. The couples went out for a walk. When they got back they had the same flat screen TV and some more TVs on the walls. The movie was still playing. The people laughed even more at the couples walking out. This movie was terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ __________  _________  "If it ain't broke, don't fix it"  -George Carlin  (My review is mostly based on the movie.)   There's a scene in this movie that is so wrong it makes my head hurt. A guy named Bob is on his way to a funeral and he stops at a diner and asks the waitress to take a photo of him and his wife. The waitress obliges, but it's a photo taken in a dark room. Bob doesn't notice and then he goes back to the funeral home to get his photo. He gets back and tells his wife he's sorry he couldn't go.   The next morning, Bob's wife walks into the house and Bob's in the living room, smoking a cigarette. She asks if he's ok and he says "no." Then she asks why and he replies, "I'm fine, just lost my balance." She doesn't ask him to take the photo back because he's just lost his balance. She instead tells him, "That picture was taken in my living room. Why in the world would you take it there?"   I love how they can get away with that kind of thing. The diner is a dark, dank, basement room. It's dark and dank and dingy. And yet, Bob doesn a) get lost and b) loses his balance and that's the reason he lost it. How much more messed up can it get?   And I get why the waitress took the photo. I've been in a diner before and I can tell you there are times when you'll just see a guy in a room taking a picture, maybe he's lost his sense of direction and just can't find the exit. So, I can understand her wanting to take his photo back. I think it was a smart decision. It shows that the waitress was trying to help him out. But that's only half the story.   in fact, if you were to watch this movie and not pay attention to the story, you'd never know Bob lost his equilibrium. He was perfectly fine, it was just that his balance had left him. But in this film, the story isn't really told, it's implied. And I don't blame the director for that. It would have been a lot easier to have Bob's balance broken.   (The movie could have used some more humor to help keep

One of them is a girl who looks like her but is really a girl called ____ who is really black. She also talks funny, dances funny and her voice is really annoying.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ I like how this movie is very action packed and it has the same kind of ending as the "Man on Fire" movie, but this time the hero has to stop the bad guy. The bad guy was a good villain but he was too big and too strong. If they did a remake of the "Avengers" with the Hulk and the character he would have been a little less powerful, but he would still be awesome. The hero in this movie was very interesting and I liked the way they made him a scientist. It made him seem much more intelligent than other superheroes, but at the same time he was a bad guy and so he was not so much intelligent. I like the way the hero and the bad guys were very different characters and I like that they had two characters that fought against each other, because this movie would be a great action movie. The only problem is that the movie is too short, I only saw the end and it was about 1/4 of the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's better than it has any right to be.  I can't see what the point of the movie was.      I would rather have watched a shitty animated film.  A great movie.  I would say the first half was the best half of the film.   The action scenes were amazing and the script was well written and the ending was good.   But then the movie goes on a real downward spiral with poor acting and terrible writing.   It really is a bad film. It's a shame because I really liked the movie and I felt the ending sucked.   It was a great movie but it was a train wreck.  The movie starts out ok.  And I thought that the movie would have a lot more story with a good ending.  But the movie is very badly written and you will have a hard time finishing the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  I hate it when movies suck. I hate it so much, in fact, that I sometimes think I'll just make a copy of the movie's script and paste it into a magazine and call it a day. The problem is that I have no one to blame but myself for how bad some movies are. It's a feeling of self-loathing, of being a complete waste of my time. In general, I'm not a movie buff. I don't watch television or read newspapers. I'm an academic and a writer, so I like to keep my mind off of such things. I usually go to the movies for special occasions. A movie is a movie is, right? If it's not a bad one, I don's try to find some way to make it enjoyable. This movie, however, just isn't. I really felt like I was watching something I might watch later on a computer. I didn't really feel that the movie was made for a wide audience. It was a simple story that was told in a simple way. It seemed very obvious that it was intended for a younger audience. The movie starts off with a simple and simple situation. A girl goes to a dance class with her friend. The only thing they talk about is how they want to get their hands on some "magic mushrooms." After class, they go to a drugstore to look for the mushrooms. The two of them meet the owner of the store. The girl is very excited to meet him, but the owner doesn't like her friend that much. He asks the girl if she wants to come to his house for some reason. The guy tells the girl that he's the owner and that he wants to show her a special type of mushroom that will help her in the future. He says that it is the "Shroom" and he'll be there in 20 minutes. The scene ends, and the girl gets into her car. The owner of drugstore follows her. They drive off into the sunset, but they have some serious problems. The sun has set and the darkness is getting darker. The car is starting to get dark and the lights aren't working. The lights come on, but there is still no one there. The girls friend is crying and telling her how scary it is. They both start to get scared. They pull up next to a big house and turn on the lights. The house is dark and quiet.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________  Crazy Cabbie (2002)  The story is simple: a carpenter and a car thief are out for revenge, and they get off on murder and mayhem. It's a simple, but effective story, and it's easy to see why it became a cult hit. There are a few issues with the film. The director had trouble getting his crew to follow him around to all of the different locations that were used. There is also a scene where the cameraman was too close to the camera for some reason. But, I liked the film for what it was. The main characters are well-drawn, and the performances are great. And I really liked the ending.  ____________________________________________  Bagpipes from Bali (2010)  of course you know this one. It stars Bruce Willis, a very popular actor in the 80s and 90s, and also made it big in the 90s with the TV series The Running Man. And it was the big hit of 2010. Bruce Willis and a group of soldiers and mercenaries are in a dangerous and hostile country, and are trying to complete a mission. The movie is really good and it has many memorable moments. I really like Bruce Willis in this movie. I also really like how he plays the lead character, and I really think that he did a great job. And of course, Bruce Willis has an incredible voice.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ (If the movie was good, don't write a negative...)  "The Last Man on Earth" is an excellent movie and should be seen by everyone, but if you don't want to see a horror movie, I suggest you don`t watch this one!   The film starts off with a typical comedy. It's a film that features a guy that has to hide a bunch of people from an insane killer that is on a rampage in a small town. This guy has no clue what he is doing but he is determined to do it. He starts with the normal people, but soon he is on the run with a bunch who were in a car accident and can`t move their legs. His job is to go to every town and make sure nobody gets hurt. This way he will get the money to pay for the surgery to fix their legs so they can walk again. He goes to the local grocery store, where he is approached by a little girl who wants to be his girlfriend. She wants to know why she has a knife in her purse and how she came by it. She says that her friend stole it from her. He explains that she is going to be in a school and if she can` t get out she will die. He says that he will be in touch when he`ll be out of town.   When he gets back to his house he is attacked by the monster. He runs out and jumps on a truck to try and run him off. When he gets to his car, a man gets out of it and tells him to get in. The guy has a huge monster that he is trying to kill. He tries to get out but the truck keeps going. He finally gets to the truck and he starts fighting the monster and the truck crashes.  - The story is very simple, but has a lot of depth in it.   in a nutshell, if you like a lot horror, then you will enjoy this. If you are a horror fan, this is a great movie to watch. It is very funny, but also has a very dark underbelly. The film has a good amount of gore, but it isn`t over the top. It shows the real fear and horror that can happen when a monster attacks a town. The last man on earth does have a few problems with the movie. First of all, the monster in the movie is not the monster from the comic books. It was
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it was so bad I didn't even want to watch it. I watched the entire movie through on VHS at the library to avoid seeing it on film, because I couldn't deal with it. It's a horrible movie, and a very depressing one at that. I thought the whole movie was just bad. The main character is a poor kid, who goes to a special school where his brother is going to get his degree. The poor kid is an arrogant, egotistical, and very ignorant person. His brother goes to the school with a few other kids, but they never talk to him, because they don't know who he is. They never seem to care about him, and he's really lonely. His older brother tells him to forget about him and to forget the people he's supposed to be talking to. He doesn't want to hear it, so he ignores it and goes to talk to his best friend. His best friend is a little older kid, and while the two of them get along pretty well, he's very stupid and a jerk. He never talks to anyone else, even when they come up to him. The other kid is the only one he really talks to. His only real friend is the little girl in the class. He's very sad and sad when she dies, and it's a really painful scene to watch. I hated the way they showed her dying, and the way the movie ended. The kid never talks about it, but he says "she died," and it was just so cheesy. I can't believe he never talks it up. He can't even look at his brother in the mirror, because he doesn't think he has a mirror. He just doesn't see his reflection. He has no idea that he has depression, and when he talks about how sad it is, it makes me sick. The movie had no ending. There was a couple of scenes in the middle, and they ended up getting really long. The end was really horrible, and I hated how they left it. The only thing I like about this movie is that the little kid was a cute and good looking kid. I wish that it was the kid who was a real pain in the ass and had a big heart, because the movie should have ended with him being happy. But it didn't.

I'll admit, I had a couple of issues with it, but other than that, it was a solid movie. It was funny, well acted and had an interesting plot. It's a bit of a letdown that the movie ends with a cliffhanger, but that's only because the movie had such a good beginning. ____________ Overall, this is a solid film. It had a good plot, a good cast, and a good director. The only thing that bothered me about the movie was the ending, but I guess it was just me being a bit lazy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** I really like this movie. I really really like it. I've seen this movie 4 times and it's always got me in stitches. It's like the ultimate revenge movie for the man who raped me. It was amazing that they took all the rape stuff out of the movie but I'm sure it would have ruined it for me. This movie is one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. The acting was excellent. The plot was amazing. The story was extremely clever and suspenseful. The character development was amazing and the ending was so emotional. I don't know how they got away with making a rape movie in the 60's but they did. I would love to see a sequel to this movie because it has so much more to it than the rape part. It should be released on DVD so that people can see it. The only problem I have with this movie is that the rape scene takes a long time to show up. It just feels like the movie takes too long to get to the rape scenes. The ending of the rape was great but it didn't feel like the rape had a proper ending. I hope that they remake this movie so that the ending feels more satisfying.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: )  A couple weeks ago I watched The Godfather Part II, and I can say with certainty that I am not going to do it again. I watched it because it was the first time I had seen it, and because I was curious about the franchise and wanted to see how things would go from this point on. I was expecting a movie that would make me cry and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it didn't. The only thing I got out of it was that it made me want to know more about the Godfather family, but that's all.  The first Godfather is the one that I grew up with, and that's the one I still think of when I think of the franchise. The movies are great, and the story is pretty much what you expect. This time the story takes place several years before the original movie, when Marlon Brando is playing Don Corleone in a movie called The Godspell. Marlon was the lead actor and the lead in a musical. The GodSpell is about a little girl named Lily (Jennifer Connelly) who has a magical book that tells her things about herself and her future. Lily is able to communicate with the spirit of the book, and when she begins to go off on her own, the spirit is able take her on a journey through a series of events that will change her life forever. I haven't been able to see this movie since it was first released, but I remember thinking how amazing it was. It had everything I look for in a story: a great script, great acting, a great cast and a great plot. The acting was all great, including a great performance from John Cassavetes. The music was also great, particularly the song "I Was Made for Loving You". I liked it, but my favorite song was "I Remember" by the Jackson 5. I'm not sure how the Godspell movie would have turned out had it not been for that song. It was very fitting. I don't think I would have been able (or interested) in hearing it, because that song was one of the only songs in the movie that didn't bother me.    This movie was so bad, in fact, that I have to believe that the producers just couldn't figure out what to do with it. The movie is so bad that I found it hard to even finish it, so I can't blame them for not trying to make something

This is the first bad movie I've seen in a while and I didn't even know it was bad until the end of the movie when I was watching the credits and realized I was wrong about it being a bad film. There's a lot of crap in this movie that makes it so much worse than it needs to be. It has a lot going for it, but in the end it fails miserably at everything. It's just a bad, bad movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ I've always had a problem with movies with a good story and a good script. The script in this movie is a mess and is a big disappointment. The characters are the worst I've ever seen. The actress, Katheryn Winnick, is just an annoying idiot and she should have known better. The director, Tim Burton, is a total failure as a director. The movie looks like a cheap exploitation movie and it's not a good looking movie at all. I've never seen a worse looking movie than this one. I can't even think of one thing that I liked in this film. The only good thing about this movie was the sound track. The music in the movie is very cheesy and the actor's voice in the film is so bad. I would never watch this movie again.

After hours of searching for their cars, they discover that a small town has been destroyed. As they search, they learn that the town was bombed and now a mysterious evil forces people to drink the water. With the help of a local pastor, they try to stop the evil, but the evil is too strong. The movie then goes to a place where the evil forces are stronger and where they fight to survive. _________________________________________ This was a great movie, I saw it at a festival and had no idea it was in 3D. The special effects were excellent. The actors were great, and it was great to see them in 3-D. This movie was a good mix of comedy and horror, and while it was a bit predictable, it was still a fun movie to watch.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Jmabob from Excellent! This was my first experience with a haunted house, and I loved it! I've been to many haunted houses and I've never been scared this much! It was amazing! I would recommend this to anyone who has never been, or wants to experience it!  Rating: 5 out or 5.0 out of 4 stars Rating: 5.00 out of 10 stars

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________  (The rating is based on a 5/5 score at IMDB. I'll do my best to explain why I gave it 5/4. I loved this movie. I am a huge fan of the show. I will say it's not a good movie. But I'll give it credit for the story. The acting is great, and it's good to see the same cast on the big screen. This is one of the better shows of the 90s. I also loved the soundtrack. I can listen to this for hours. I had a great time watching this movie and I recommend it to anyone who loves a good laugh. I highly recommend this movie to any fan of TV and the TV show. It's an awesome way to celebrate a great show, especially if you love the show so much you want to watch it again and again. _______________________________________________________________________________________  If you are a fan of television, you are gonna love this movie, because it's just a classic. You can't go wrong with anything in this movie; the writing, the acting, the music, the soundtrack, and everything in between. This movie isn't really a "film", it's more like a "show". It's just what it is: a great TV movie. The actors, especially George, have great chemistry and I was happy to see them again. The film is about a character named Frank who is a former NFL player, now working at a casino. Frank is constantly in a state of depression, but he can't tell anyone because he is afraid of losing his job. After one particularly bad day, Frank gets a phone call from his wife, who is going on a business trip to Las Vegas. He decides to take the chance and call her. The call turns into a disaster and Frank realizes he can never get over her leaving. He's now working as a waitress at a Las Vegas hotel and he doesn't know what to do about his life. Frank has a secret he has to keep from everyone, and he has become very isolated. Frank eventually finds out his father is a violent alcoholic who doesn't like his son and wants him to change. Frank goes to the hotel and is happy to find his father, but not everyone is happy. There are rumors Frank's mother is having an affair and they are both trying to keep things hidden from everyone else. Eventually, Frank is confronted by the hotel manager and the two have a very heated discussion.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ The worst movie I have ever seen is called The House I Live In. I'm not kidding. It was a complete waste of time. I have to admit that I was really hoping it would be a good movie. I was also really hoping that I would enjoy it. It wasn't that I liked it, I just thought it was kind of weird. I didn't even know what it was called and I was not going to Google it. I really didn't know what I was getting myself into. So after watching it, my opinion of it was pretty much ruined. I would have given it a 0 but I just don't have a high opinion of the director and I don't know if I would be able to take a 0.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________________ The Mummy (1958) (Directed by Richard Fleischer) - 7 out of 10 "I always thought that the original The Mummies was the better film. I think it's because they had a great monster. The Mumm-Ra has some amazing special effects, but I think the original was a little more fun and the monster was a lot more entertaining." - Bob Clements "The Mummy has been on the screen for only one year, but it was enough to get a lot of fans interested in the franchise, and it was certainly worth the wait. The movie is an action thriller that is very much in keeping with the source material and the effects are top-notch. The only downside is that it seems a little short on details, and there is a definite lack of any real emotion. The effects and special effects are what you'd expect from an MGM movie and there are very few scenes that aren't spectacular. There is a real sense of excitement to every scene. The actors are really good, and you can see they are very familiar with the character. The production value of the film is fantastic. There are a lot going on, and the actors look and act like they are really in a dangerous situation, but you never feel that you are about to see a real monster on screen. This is a very good movie, but not a classic." - Mike Ryan "It is fun to see the movie as it was meant to be. There isn't much that is new about this film. The acting and the story lines are all the same as the original movie. The special effects and creatures are fantastic. The plot is very basic, and very much an adventure movie." - Joe Blanton "There are two things about the Mummy that are unique about it: the special effects which are so great; and the music. The music is very good and it really does help make the movie. I like the way the film does not follow the same pattern as the other movies in the series. There were no clues that the story was going to be a monster movie, and we never know where the film will take us. We are not just seeing a monster; we are watching a real story unfold. The film was very much a work of art, and I think that makes it an even more special film. This film should not be seen by everyone, and for those who haven't seen it, it is a great

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  My name is Dave and I hate the movie The Room. I watched the trailer for it on Youtube and I have to say it is one of the worst movies ever made. The main character is very annoying and uninteresting and he has no redeeming qualities. The plot is very unoriginal and very silly, it's all about a room with a door that is locked all the time, but one day it just opens and you're left in a place that is very much like your living room. The guy who lives in the room, named Tommy Wiseau, is supposed to be the worst director in history but he's a total charmer. The movie is just so silly that you just can't take it seriously and I never found a way to take my mind off it. It's really hard to watch and there are some really weird moments in the movie that really make you wonder if there's really a ghost in the whole movie. I've watched it over and over and it never gets any better, but you can't really hate it because you're going to have to watch it again soon.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Share this  Tweet 1 � Share this By Ryan S. Smith  I'll admit, I wasn't a huge fan of the last movie of the franchise. It had a lot of pacing issues and didn't live up to the previous films. It was one of those movies that had a nice ending but just felt like it dragged on and on. The cast, however, were really great and I really loved their chemistry.  The movie starts with a small town on the outskirts of a war-torn nation. It is also the home of the most powerful weapon of all: the rifle. It can shoot anything from bullets to shells and has a range of over a mile. The townspeople, unaware that the weapon is being used for war, are not very happy that it has come to be. Their main problem is that the rifles are so expensive, that the government doesn't seem to care about the people of the town or the weapons it could potentially end up being used in. The main character, Josh, is the son of a local police officer who is working with the U.S. government to keep the rifles out of the hands of anyone who might want to use them for evil. The townspeoples are all afraid of the rifle, and the townspeOPLE have begun to band together to try and stop the government from using the weapons for evil purposes. I loved how the town had developed a sense of community, and that the people were fighting for something greater than themselves. It gave it a nice contrast to the main character's home life where he is the only son of his father's family, and all the others are either in the military or have left the town. It seemed to me that this was more of a story about Josh and the people in his life than it was about the town itself.  a scene from the movie. A good movie should make you think. But even with all the good things I liked about the movie, it still has its issues. The movie started off with a great sequence where Josh was talking to a man named John about how he is leaving the town to pursue his dreams. Then, in a matter of seconds, Josh has a vision of a giant skull flying through the sky and killing everyone on earth. Josh then sees the rifle on a train and realizes that he can use it to save the world. The first scene of the movie was a great introduction to the characters
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________  My boyfriend, a good person, was very excited about the new film "The Mummy". He wanted to see it at the theater, and I, a big fan of the series, was so happy to see the new one. It was going to be a double feature. We went and waited in the lobby. About a half hour after it opened, it began to get empty. My boyfriend was sitting at the end of the lobby and I was sitting next to him. The director came out to take pictures and as he was leaving, he turned around and gave my boyfriend a smile and a wink. As he left, I saw him looking at me. I was confused as to what was going on. The next day at work, we were talking about it. He said that the director looked right at him. I knew he was talking about me. We both knew the director had been watching me for a long time. He looked at me a couple of times as he walked by and it was clear to me that he knew I was his target. I told him about how he was looking at us and how he knew that I was going into the theater that night. He didn't respond and I realized that I wasn't going to say anything to him about it and that he would probably think that I just didn't like him that much. That was a mistake. I don't think he ever talked about the incident again. When I was in high school, a friend of mine had told me about how the director of a movie had shown her his cock as he came in and out of her.

I went with my boyfriend. We waited in line, and then went to the theater. We didn't know the director, so it wasn't really anything to look forward to. The theater was very small, and there were only about ten seats in the entire theater. The movie starts and it's very dark. The film was about a vampire who was trying to become human. The lights come on and I look around and see my boyfriend looking at my boyfriend, so I start laughing. I look at my friends and we all start laughing too. He looks at me and he's laughing, and he looks at the screen. It's not that I didn't
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Last Man on Earth" is a fun little movie that takes a fun idea and turns it into a boring movie. That's all the movie is. A movie with the same plot as "Ghostbusters", but with a different cast, and a story that seems to be more of a love story.  The Last Men on Earth is a comedy about a man who has lost his wife, and is now trying to find her. He finds his wife in a new man, who is a woman who has been in a car accident and now lives in a nursing home. The guy in the car accident was an old flame of his, and he's got a long list of complaints about his wife.  The movie starts off very promising. It starts off with a funny scene with the two characters. They start out with a kiss, and it quickly turns into a passionate sex scene. It's a great sex scene, and when it ends, it's even better. The Last Men On Earth is full of sex and it's all good, but there is nothing to make this movie stand out. It is just a fun movie with two very silly characters. The movie is all over the place and doesn't really make any sense, and if you don't watch it, you'll just get the joke. .

Why did we think it was great? _____________________________________________________ Review Summary: _______________________________________________________________ I love this movie! I love how the story starts with a man who was a hero for all the wrong reasons. His daughter and wife have to find out the truth about what happened to him in a way that would be most likely to put him in jail for murder. Then, he goes on a road trip with his buddies to get him back. The guy's friend is a bit of a jerk and he has his own personal demons that cause a few of the others to go off on him. The ending is very good, but the way it ends is very unexpected and shocking. _________________________________________ Review: __________________________________________________________________________ I didn't like this movie. There was something wrong with me when I watched it. I felt that the characters were not the real people that they portrayed themselves to be. The movie had a few funny moments but it also had some very dark and disturbing moments. The reason why I didn;t like this film is because it didn't really have a point. I would like to point out that there were a few things that I didn' t like about the movie, but I felt like they were in the right places. I thought that it was a very well done movie and I would recommend this to everyone who likes a good road trip movie. I also thought that the ending was very well put together. _______________________________________________________________________ Summary: I don't really know what happened, but there is some very strange stuff going on in this movie, and there are some very good points as well. _______________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ The plot is nothing new to me, and I've seen it a million times, but for some reason, I've found it very compelling, despite its flaws. It starts out with a lot of things that I'd like to see from a film, and they all sort of fall apart, but not too badly. One of my favorite things about this film is the scene in which the girls get to see their families. They are all so different, and it is such a joy to see them all together. I really liked how the whole film was structured. I never felt like I was at any real risk of dying, but I did feel a lot more relaxed than I normally do, and my nerves were mostly calmed down. I felt the same way about the ending, which is very fitting. It is just perfect. It was so sweet, and made me feel happy for the characters, and that is what I love about movies. I don't know how many of you have seen it, but it is one of my all-time favorites. It made me smile so many times, and really, that's all that really matters. I would recommend it to anyone, but mostly, I think it would be very well-received if it was screened in a theater. If it's on cable, then it will definitely get a decent audience.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________   "This is the worst movie I have ever seen." - The AV Club   The AV Club reviewed this movie based on the novel by John Green. The movie has a similar plot and concept to the book, however it is far more bad than good. The main character is a 14-year-old girl named Toni. She is in the first grade, which is considered a "trouble" grade. The problem with this is that Toni is in a special program at her school, which allows her to learn to read, write, and math in a less formal setting. This program is not a regular school program. The school is not open to anyone who is not in a regular class. The program is run by a mysterious, female teacher, who uses "special" tools to help students. One of these tools is the "tough love" program, which requires students to be brutally honest with each other about their mistakes, weaknesses, and insecurities. In this class, Toni meets a boy named Jack who is a straight-A student and has no interest in being in a "special class." In fact, Jack does not even know what a special class is. Toni and Jack have a falling out because of Toni's love of reading, and Jack thinks he has no choice but to leave the program. Unfortunately, his parents think he needs to stay, and so they force him to continue. The more Jack and Toni argue, the worse things get. In the end, Jack decides he does not want to be a part of the program any longer, and leaves. Tonia and her mother think Jack is a coward and a bad boy, and want him to stay. But the worst thing that happens to Jack is that he starts to think about the future. He begins to believe that he will be better off in a normal school, but this is not what the tough love program is about. When Jack starts to realize he might have been a better person if he had never left the program, the film turns into one of the most horrible movies I have seen. The final scene is a very powerful scene. Tonic's parents and Tonia's mother are at the house when the two characters are having a argument. The mother yells at her husband for letting her daughter leave the tough program, and then tells Tonia she has to go back to the program for a month. When Tonia asks what she is supposed
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________ It's a good thing the first act is so boring, because I wouldn't have minded a bit of an adventure right from the get go. The first ten minutes of the movie are absolutely riveting. There's a great, action-packed chase scene that ends with the hero and a bad guy going at it. There are a lot of twists and turns in the story, and the action is very well done. The film also has great action in its last twenty minutes, which is what really sells it. It's really good. However, there's a bit too much exposition in the beginning of the film, and a bit lacking in action. It all starts to come together at the end, and it's just a great climax. The movie is great, but there's only so much you can take, so you might want to pass it on. I'll give it a C. I give it 5 stars for the action, but I think it needs more. I'd give it 4 stars if it were an action/sci-fi movie.  Advertisements

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. This movie does not deserve a 1 star rating. This is just plain, old, boring, boring. I really wanted to like this movie, but the movie just didn't work for me. It's an okay movie, and I really enjoyed it. But, it was just so, so boring! The movie starts with a young woman who is looking for a new job, and her first job in the business is at a very old movie theater. When the movie is over, she is still trying to get a job, so she goes back to the old theater. The woman who was in the old movie, was a very good looking young woman, and she had the same name as the woman in the movie, only she's dead. After a few minutes, the dead woman appears. And, she starts to tell the young woman that she's really going to kill her and her family. This was a great twist in the story! The dead woman is really a good person, and the woman who died in the film is really the villain. This story is really well done, but it really just doesn't work. It doesn't make sense. I know that a woman who goes to a movie theater to kill people is a twist, but a woman in a movie is a villain? This movie was really, really boring. If you're looking for something that's going to make you laugh and get you to cry, you might like this. But I was just really bored!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this movie is a terrible and boring movie, but there are some scenes which were actually funny. It is just that the movie is so boring and poorly written.  The plot is just a complete disaster.  I really want to recommend this movie, as it is a good example of how not to make a movie, and it's so boring it's not even funny.    The plot starts off really good, it shows us a group of people who are trying to make it as a singer in the music business, but as soon as they start making music their lives start to change, and then the plot goes downhill really fast.  The acting in this movie was not very good at all.  They all acted so weird and awkward, I don't think they all even know how to act.     And then the music starts to get really weird, and I mean really weird.  It turns into a porno-ish kind of movie, not even bad, just weird.     I wish this movie would have ended after the first scene.  You can imagine what happens after that, you'll be laughing your ass off, because it's all so weird. The music is terrible, the acting was terrible, and the plot was so bad it wasn't funny at all, and you can imagine why the actors were in such a weird mood.  It is a very strange movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________  The film's main themes of human connection and self-sacrifice are so deeply embedded in my mind, I'm afraid I will be unable to look at any movie, or any book, ever again without wanting to see a remake. A film about a girl with the ability to turn herself into a superhero with her thoughts and prayers, and a guy who wants to become a better person through the same means, is simply too perfect. The film's final scene, which shows a girl going into a dark alley to pray, is a perfect summation of all that is great about it.  I was also amazed at the fact that so many of the film's characters had strong emotional ties to each other. A girl is the only one who knows about her powers, but everyone is connected by a common thread. When a girl is unable to use her power because she's so overwhelmed by the sadness of losing a loved one, it's not just the girl that is upset, it is the entire school. Even if one person can use her powers in a moment of desperation, there is no guarantee that everyone else will be able to do the same. The strength of a human connection is a theme that is rarely explored in movies, but The Girl Who Leapt Through Time succeeds in making it the central theme of the story.  the film is also full of wonderful details that I wish I could remember. The main characters are all given different names, like the girl named Alice (Nora Ephron) who can fly, and the guy named Bob (John Hughes) who is able to see and talk to the dead. It was also nice to see the names of the people who made the film appear in the credits. There's a young girl who is very religious who had the idea to name her character Alice, and there's a guy that was born in New Jersey who had a friend who is named Bob. And in the film, we are also introduced to a girl named Tania who is a psychic.  The Girl who Leapt through Time is so unique that I will always remember it. It is a film that should be watched and re-watched for many years to come. The only downside to the film was the fact it was only released in the US.

It was a great idea to create a movie based on the book that would make you think about it for a few days. The film, however, is a mess. The acting, the directing, and the editing all fell apart in the first 10 minutes. The character development was horrible. The whole movie was just a mess with a plot that didn't make sense, a terrible acting, and a story that was so bad that you could only imagine it was written by a 4 year old. __________________________________________________ I give this movie 1 star.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ (It's not a real review, but just a thought.)  I'm a pretty good critic. I can give a movie a thumbs up or down if I like it, and I've been doing it a lot. I'll give it two thumbs, and the next time I see it I'll have to see it again.   I thought this movie was so bad I had to write a review.  , and this is my first review, I'll post some of the things I've learned:  1. I'm not a great critic.   a) When I saw the trailer for this movie I knew it was bad. I couldn't believe it was that bad. But I was willing to give it a try, and give it the benefit of the doubt. The movie opens with a beautiful, haunting scene of a little girl in a house being tortured by a little man, a man who has become obsessed with her. The little girl is locked in a room and beaten, but not killed. The man doesn't kill her, but tortures her for hours until he gives in to his own insanity and she runs off, and he's not mad about that. I don't know if it's a dream sequence, but that's how I felt. I felt that little girl was really there, and not just a figment of his imagination. I was so happy for the little girl. I really loved her.     But then I realized the girl was an illusion.   the little man had a mask on, a mask that made him look like a little boy, and you know what? I think this is the best way to describe it. I thought it was just a creepy, fun little movie, but then it got too weird and I had a bad feeling about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________  The film has some good ideas, but it's too slow.  I was expecting a good action movie, but this one was way too slow and boring.  for me it's a boring, dull movie. , it's just too slow, you have to keep thinking to know what's going on, and you'll feel like you're in a dream. The characters are pretty funny, but the dialogue is too long, and the movie was too slow for me to enjoy it. -, it was a bit too slow  -  Don't judge this movie just based on the title. It has a few good ideas and a few bad ones too. This movie is pretty good, but not worth a whole movie. I would rather watch a movie about a space robot, or maybe something that's a bit more exciting.  the story is pretty interesting, and I really liked the characters. The movie has a very unique concept and it's pretty cool to see it in a movie. But it's so slow and dull, that you'll never enjoy it too much. And I hate slow and dumb action movies. .

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It was a good idea. But the movie never developed any characters. The plot was too predictable. And the acting was mediocre." The Worst Movie Ever Made:  "The worst movie I've ever seen." Here's a fun fact:   if you take a snapshot of a movie and take a picture of that snapshot and put it into a dark room for two months, and then take a photo of the same room but put the snapshot into a lighted room for three months, you'll end up with a movie that you can watch in a dark or lighted movie theater.   That's right.    A movie that has been shown in a movie theater in a darkened theater for two whole months and in a light-filled theater for three whole months will eventually turn to a picture that's so bad that it has to be seen in a special theater with a big screen.  Here we have the film " The Thing From Another World."  It was originally made for the U.S. military and the film was so bad, that it was actually turned into a video game.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________.  It's easy to get lost in the drama of The Mummy (read my review here). The plot follows Dr. Jekyll and Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe), two scientists who work together to create a "monster" that can be controlled by either one. The story begins with Dr. Frankenstein creating a body out of the body of a woman named Mary Shelley (Shelley Winters), and then uses her body to create more monsters. The film also stars Angelina Jolie, Anthony Hopkins, Annabelle Wallis, and Bill Murray. "This movie has a lot of action, it's got a lot to say. It's very entertaining and has a great ending, it'll stay with you."  The Mummy is an interesting film. It is a film that is more fun to watch than it is to read. The action scenes are well shot, and the acting is solid. It also does a great job of making us feel that we are in the middle of a big, complex, and interesting story. The plot is not really all that original, but it is a lot more interesting than most of the recent fantasy films that we've seen. This film has a very good cast of actors and really knows how to make a good horror film.  the Mummy movie rating: 8/10  Advertisements

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________  "I've got a new favorite movie! I'm so happy this one was made!"  The film, which stars Peter Farrelly, Bill Pullman, James McAvoy, Patrick Wilson, and Jude Law, was based on a play of the same name by Peter Shaffer and George Pelecanos. The film tells the story of an FBI agent named Frank Semyon (Farrelly), who is sent to a seedy motel in order to find a suspect named Thomas Cromwell (Pullman). Cromwell is a psychopathic murderer who has been murdering people with his bare hands since he was a child. He is a member of the Cosa Nostra. In the middle of his killing spree, Cromwell meets Semyone and becomes intrigued by his appearance. Semyo and Cromwell form an uneasy alliance. The movie has been praised for its gritty atmosphere and for its use of visual effects. The production was financed by Peter Biskind and was directed by John Sayles. The story was adapted by George Peplau. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ If you have no clue about the film, don't bother watching it. If you can get past the dialogue and the silly characters, you will enjoy this movie. The dialogue is often very funny, but the characters are sometimes a bit stupid. This is a film that you can watch at the beach or at the dinner table. The actors are great, and the music is excellent. It will make you feel like you are a kid again. The first half of the film is very similar to "A Christmas Story" but it does not try to copy that film. It does not want to be as funny or silly as that film, but it can be. You will be laughing your head off. The only thing that is missing is a dog (or a cat, it doesn't matter) that lives on the beach and goes on long walks. This film is a perfect Christmas movie. If your watching with a child, this movie is a must see.

I loved the books, but this was so stupid it made me want to vomit. I love Bilbo Baggins, and I loved him in the books. But not like this. This was a total waste of a film. I don't think anyone was in any doubt that this movie was going to suck, and it did. I can't believe the studio allowed this. It is so obvious that it was a mistake, and they should have just gone with the first draft of the screenplay. I was expecting to hate this movie, but it is a really good book, and a really great movie. I just wish the actors were better. I didn't like them, and that's why I didn'st like it. The book was good, but the actors weren't. I wish the film had more depth. There was something going on in the book, but not in this movie. This movie was just a mess.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You can be sure that they'll tell you that it was good for your career. They can't help it, it's their job. You should write something about your experience with the movie, not the other way around. What about the ending? It's one of those movies you can't see how they came up with it. It's a mystery movie. You never know who the killer is, so the whole movie is just a mystery. It could have been really interesting, but it was so over the top, I couldn't watch it again. You can never be too sure of a story, or the ending. If you can, it will always end badly. If you don't like horror movies: You don't have to, but don't watch them either. You have your own taste, you can watch whatever you like. They are not bad, just not for you. It can be a good way to relax.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. It's a sad thing to see a movie you loved so much end up with a bad ending. I feel like I'm wasting my time watching this movie, but I will try my best to review this movie in a positive manner. I loved this movie. It was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid, and it still holds a place in my heart. I was in love with this movie from the beginning. I really think this movie should be in every kid's movie collection. It has everything you could want from a good old fashioned monster movie. I think the only reason it gets a 3/5 rating is because of the ending. It is not that good. I thought the whole movie was a bit disappointing. If the ending was not bad, I think it would have been a 5/5. The movie itself is very good and if you like monster movies, I'm sure you will love it. The monsters in this movie were all very different. It wasn't just a monster movie, it was a monster action movie. The action in this film was great. The special effects were amazing. It also had one of the best fight scenes I have ever seen. If you like the monsters from the movies you have seen in the past, I can't recommend this movie enough.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________.  I had to get that off my chest. The movie was great, but I just had a really hard time watching it.  (The director of the movie, Stephen Sommers, also directed the TV series.)  The main character, Joe, was an American. He was an actor, and he had an idea. He had an insane idea, and it had a lot of elements in it that I liked, so I wanted to see it. I was also a big fan of the book. . I am really happy that I saw this movie, because it is very different than other movies that I have seen. I am glad that I watched this movie because it gave me some inspiration, and I think that this movie is a masterpiece. I think it is one of the best movies that you can see in the cinemas, and if you like movies, you should watch this movie. I really enjoyed this movie and I hope that you will also like it.

A bad film with a good story. _______________________________________ The story is pretty good. The movie was pretty good too. _____________________ So, what's the story about? Well, it's a science fiction movie that is told in the first person. A woman who is trapped on an alien planet with her husband. Her husband has been dead for a few years now, and now she has a daughter that she has never met. But it's just another day on the planet, and she is happy. She and her daughter go on a picnic, but they end up getting attacked by the natives. The natives are very strong and intelligent, and they are determined to capture the two of them. They attack with all their might, and when she goes to save her daughter, she is attacked as well. They end up fighting back and forth, and it gets quite bloody.  The movie ends with a big explosion. The aliens are defeated, and the mother and daughter come home. The woman has a little scar on her face, but she's fine. She has her daughter to look after now, but he seems to be in a lot of pain. __________ I think the movie has some pretty good sci-fi elements in it. The alien planet has some interesting designs, and a nice, atmospheric score. The plot is a little cliche, but it's fun to watch it unfold. _________________________ So, was this movie good? Well...I liked it. It had good sci fi elements. It was pretty well done, and had a decent ending. ____ Was it a good movie? I don't know. I can't say that it was a great movie. It's got some cliches. The story was a little cliché, and I couldn't get behind the characters. _______ Was it bad? No. I think it was okay. I don andt really like bad movies. _____

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  Write a positive review about an okay movie: ______.  in which case you'd probably be a bad guy and would never get laid in the first place. The only good thing about this movie is that it was shot in a tiny village in Poland. The villagers don't seem to know who the actors are. It seems like there is a big misunderstanding here. The director claims he filmed in this place because of the small size of the town. This may be true but there is also the chance that the director didn't know the name of the village and just filmed in it because the town had a lot of interesting history. If you want to make a film about Poland you would make a short film instead of a feature length one. It was shot with a hand held camera and the film is very low budget. It's also very amateurish and amateurish shots really add to the charm. It really makes you want the movie to be true. This movie also has an extremely short running time. It ends with a nice twist which is very nice. I found the movie very interesting and interesting for the first hour. The movie is a bit of a "how to" guide. I'd recommend it to people who want to get into the country or to film in Poland for the cheap price.

I'll give it a 2 or a 3 when the script changes and more time is put into the movie. By the way, the ending was not too bad. I didn't feel cheated because there was still hope for the characters and there was no reason for this movie to be over. I would recommend this movie for people who want a cheap movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Godfather Part III. This film was a great example of a sequel that was poorly constructed. The story, though, is an enjoyable sequel, but the film was an absolute mess. The original film was more of a slow build with an exciting finale, and this one was an action-packed romp. The only real downside to the film is the fact that it takes so long to get to the ending. The final fight was over a year in the making and, as a result, the final act feels rushed. I feel like the film could have benefited from a little editing, especially towards the end. It's a little silly to have Don Corleone fighting with his wife in a grocery store, but that was the only real negative about the film.  Overall, the film gets a C-.  It's a good film, but I don't think it's one I'd want to see again. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The movie, directed by Paul Verhoeven, is based on the novel of the same name. The story begins with a young girl, Jennifer, who discovers she has an extra chromosome and must take over the role of the mother to a girl of 10. Verhoeve plays the lead, a surgeon, who has to deal with a lot of strange patients and doctors as his own life begins to unravel. The movie's plot has some parallels with the case of a teenage girl who had a tumor removed from her brain and was later diagnosed with schizophrenia, though this time it is her father who has a tumor. The girl was a patient of Dr. James T. Smith (Brad Pitt), a brilliant, ambitious psychiatrist who also happens to be the father of the girl, but he is not well liked and is seen as an overbearing father. After his daughter is diagnosed with a life-threatening disease, he starts a love affair with another patient, and soon realizes his daughter has gone mad. The film also deals with the issue of a child's right to be a little girl or a little boy, and how to balance the interests of two sexes in the future.  Jennifer, the main character, is not a perfect daughter. She is not allowed to dress herself or play with her sister. She dresses and acts like a boy and does not want to wear dresses. She also does not like boys who like dolls. Her parents are the same, but she never learns their names. Jennifer is also bullied by the girls in school and has no friends. She does not understand why her mother does not take her out of school or why she does not have a boyfriend. One day, Jennifer sees a girl who looks exactly like her, but who has the exact opposite personality, and suddenly she has her life.  of all the problems I have with this movie, the worst was how Verhoeved handled the mother of the little girl who has schizophrenia. Her name is Dr. Maryann, and she is the mother. Mary Ann was a very good actress who, like Verhoeves' wife, had a very hard time portraying a woman who does not fit the stereotype of a good mother. She has a difficult personality, a mean streak, and is constantly trying to control the daughter's life. MaryAnn is not the mother I imagined a mother to be. I think she has a very difficult personality. She was not a very well

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have no problem with a movie I did not like, but if it was such a bad one, why would I watch it?  Well, I just don't like horror movies.  They are usually the lowest common denominator.   And they usually have no redeeming qualities at all.  I can understand if they are not your cup of tea.  But when you are given a choice of movies, I would suggest you get a different movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. Do a positive review about an awesome movie: ___. If you're not sure which movie you like, then ask your friends what they think. The movie you'll like the most won't necessarily be the one that's the best. In general, if a movie makes you laugh, then you're probably not going to hate it.  Now if you're one of those people who likes to sit and watch movies alone, then watch a movie with your friends. Don't watch alone. You'll get distracted and the movie will go on forever. , if you've seen a movie and it didn't get you laughing, then that means it's not that good. This can be a problem because a movie that doesn't make you laugh is usually just a bad film. It doesn't mean that there isn't any good in it. So how do you find out if a film is good or bad? What is a good movie? A bad movie? Well, there's only one way to find out. Watch a bad or good movie together. It's that simple. You don't have to watch a lot of movies with friends, just a few, so this is the best way to do it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have watched some great horror movies, but none of them have left a lasting impression. I was shocked to see how bad this one was. The movie is called "The Devil in the White City" and I thought it would be a classic.  It wasn't. It was an awful movie that made me laugh a few times. The story was just awful. The people of Chicago are having a bad year, and there is a lot of crime and violence. The police are doing a very poor job and are taking a lot more of their time than they should. One night they come across a man who is a serial killer.  The man kills some of the prostitutes in the brothels and then the police catch him.  In a way, it is like a western in that the police are trying to find the killer and get the killer to tell them how he did it.  They want to make the murderer pay for his crime.  Unfortunately, the man is very smart and knows that the cops are after him and so he doesn't talk about his crimes.  Instead, he just tells them that the people in the other brotheles have been cursed and that the Devil lives there.  He then shows them a picture of the devil and how he was in the picture and tells them he is the devil.  So now they know where the Devil is.  But the police can't stop him because he has to travel back in time.  If the police go back in the past they can stop the Devil.  Well, the police have to find a way to go back to the present.  Then they will find out that the only way to stop the devil is to kill him. It didn't make any sense to me and it took me a while to figure out what was going on.  I don't think the film was made for a wide audience because I don' t think it made a whole lot of sense.  After I realized that it was just a bad film, I gave it a pass and let it go. I don';t know why I liked it, but I did.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** ***The movie itself is good. It's not the best movie in the world but it is still a very good movie. It was good enough to make me not want to watch the other movies that came out. I think the other 2 movies that were released ( The Incredible Hulk, and Hulk ) were even better than this movie. ***** I hope they make a sequel to this movie as well, because if they don't, it would just be another "Hulk" movie. ***The film is about an ex-soldier, who was a sniper in the war in Iraq, who got his heart broken by a girl that was an Iraqi war veteran, and is now a drug addict. He decides to start his life over again in his home state of North Carolina, with his sister (a drug addict who just got out of jail) and some friends. This movie is a bit like "The Green Mile" in that it's a character-driven story. If you like the movie, you will love this movie because it's about a good man trying to do the right thing. If this movie was about a man trying not to go to prison, it wouldn't be as good because he is just going to prison. If he was just going there to get some attention, it might be okay but he's not. He has a family now. He doesn't go to this place to be famous, he goes there to help his family and make a new life. I didn't like the ending of this movie but I still really enjoyed it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ My husband had seen this movie as a child and he always wanted to see it. It was a little different from the classic film. I think that if you have children, you should not let them see this movie. I will tell you that this movie was a big disappointment to me. My children and I both watched this movie and I had to take them out of it because my children were upset and screaming. My husband thought it was a terrible movie. It is a very good movie, however. I would recommend this movie to everyone that has a child. I hope that if my children see this, they won't like it. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. _________________________  ...as a movie with a lot of great special effects, and good acting, it could have been a great movie. The problem is that it was way too long. There are a lot scenes that just didn't add up, and the acting was not very good.

They have some of the most famous actors, and some of them are really great. I think this is the best movie ever made in the horror category. The plot is so simple, it's like a cartoon. But it is so great! It has the best effects and it has a lot of laughs. I love this movie. It's so scary and has the most amazing characters!

The film was not that funny, but it was not a bad film either. The actors really had a good time on this movie. The acting was really great, and it was really fun to watch. The movie was well done, and the actors were really good. The only problem was that the movie didn't have any suspense. It was all about comedy. So there wasn't any suspense in this movie, which made the movie feel boring. The way the movie was set up, the main characters were trying to figure out what was going on, and who was behind all of this. The plot was really confusing at times, but at least it was understandable. The main characters just didn't get along well, and their relationship didn't seem very believable. The ending was very abrupt, and I don't think that the director was expecting it to end this way. It just didn' t make much sense to me. Overall, this was a fun movie, and not a terrible one. However, I feel that the acting and plot could have been better, and if the movie had more suspense, it could have turned out a better movie. I give this movie a C-.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "You have no idea what you are in for, you can't be too careful, don't look too good."  This movie, and it's sequel are not a good idea, and should not be seen by anyone who is not a fan of the genre. The film is about two children who find out that they are siblings. The story is told in flashback, with a great sense of style and humor. There are two versions of this movie, both have a very different story, but both are excellent. I love the way they used the time machine to go back and watch the events of their lives. The first version, The Time Machine, is about a young boy who is going to a big house, to meet his uncle. There is a mysterious voice on his walkie-talkie telling him to go there, but he is never seen again. In the second version, the time travel device has been altered to go to the house of a boy named John. John is a strange little man who can see people who are far away. He also seems to know all the things that have happened to him, and has an odd relationship with his sister, Rose. The time travel is not used for very good purposes, but it works well. There really is nothing new or exciting about the time traveling devices in this movie. The main problem is the characters, and the plot. It is a very predictable plot. The movie is also very long, and quite boring. This is probably due to the fact that it is a sequel, and that the first movie was a big hit. The second version of the movie, The Curse of the Time Machine is a much better film, and a much more entertaining movie. Rating: 4/10

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm a big fan of movies, but I've never been a big "Star Wars" fan, which is why I didn't care for the prequels. I didn, however, love the original trilogy, so I was excited to see the new films, but it turns out that, like the first film, these two were not nearly as good as the first trilogy. The special effects were much better in this one, but that's not saying much, and the plot was just plain bad. For a movie called "Star Trek: Into Darkness," it was a bad idea to do a direct sequel to the last film. The characters felt like they had been cut and paste, and it didn't feel like the film was trying to do anything new. For example, there were some nice touches, like James Cromwell's character who had an important role in the original "StarTrek" series, but his character was killed off at the end of this movie. The action scenes were the same old stuff. The plot was a mess, and I had trouble following it all, so that's why I gave the movie a negative. If you're a fan of the original, you might find this a good one to watch. I don't recommend it.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What are the chances? If you haven't seen the movie and you think it's good, you are a complete idiot. If you think that this movie is a total waste of your time, you should try to watch the real one, instead of wasting your time on this one. This is a film that is made by people who don't have any idea of what the word'movie' means. There is no plot. There are no characters. No story. No nothing. There's no point in telling you that this film is garbage. It's a bunch of lies. It has been made to be an instant classic so that people will watch it and then buy it, thinking that they have to watch this movie for their own amusement. Well, you know that the only reason why people would go and watch a movie like this is because they want to be entertained, so if you don't think this movie has any entertainment value, you must be a complete moron. If it's not entertaining, then it's just a piece of trash. And if that's not enough, there's also a scene where a guy tries to stab a guy in the neck, and the guy just stands there and looks at him. And this is supposed to be a movie? I can't even believe that people would waste their time on such trash. If the film makers want to make a movie out of this, they should just make a really bad one. If they do that, I'm sure that people won't watch this film and then go and buy it. I'm just glad that I've seen this film, because I wouldn't waste my time on something like this. And you probably won't either. Just stay away from this film. This film has no plot and no characters, and it's made to appeal to a specific audience. So if you want to see a movie, go see The Matrix. And when you see that movie, you'll realize that this isn't even a movie. It isn't an art piece, it's a piece that tries to fool you.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I didn't see this movie until a couple years ago, but was able to get a couple of tickets. The movie was terrible. It's not that the story is bad, it's that it's so incredibly boring. The story is about a man named Michael who gets a strange phone call that tells him that he is destined to be the next pope. His life changes as he gets more and more involved in a Catholic Church conspiracy that involves him and his friends. The plot isn't really important, but it was boring. Michael is constantly annoyed by people he meets and doesn't have a sense of humor. He's always looking for a way out and the only one he finds is his friend and fellow priest, Father Gabriel. The characters in this movie were horrible. The only two characters that I liked were Michael and Father Gabriel, and the rest of the characters were really stupid. There was one part where a guy had an asthma attack and Michael asked the guy if he would die. He didn't. That's it. It was horrible. There were several other parts where the movie made no sense and seemed like it was written by an eight year old who never played a game of chess. The acting was atrocious and there were too many characters. I'm not a religious person, but this movie didn't make any sense. It seemed like they just threw together a bunch of random ideas and made it work. I would have given this movie a 1/10 if it was better. I'd give it a 1.5 if it were better.

It has this bad style and bad music, which is really bad, it's really bad. It makes you feel like you're watching a bad cartoon with bad music. It starts off with this one guy who's really crazy and it's like he is just having a bad day, and he is like a crazy guy who can't stop yelling, and it was just this bad guy with no good reason to be crazy, and all the other people around him are like, "What is he doing?" and "Is he crazy?" and they're like, the rest of the movie he is crazy. Then this chick goes in the house, and then he goes crazy in the car and he drives off in the wrong direction, and this chick comes up to him, and they are just like, and she just wants a drink, and the guy goes crazy, he's like, he doesn't want to go home, he wants to go to the beach, and that's it, and so he just starts screaming, and I'm like, this movie is really crazy. It just keeps going, and every time he does something bad, the girl keeps asking, "Why are you doing that?" and he goes, "I'm just having fun!" It was a really funny movie, but I don't think people will like it. It seems like they are taking the good and making it worse. It really is not a good movie.  Was this review helpful?

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ I am glad I saw it because I don't know how the rest of you feel about it. It was just awful and I can't believe they made a movie like this. I'm going to start this review by saying that I was hoping for a good ending. There were so many characters in this movie that I just had to see the end. It didn't get better at all. I hated the whole movie and I didn't want to go to see it again. I felt like it was a waste of money. The only redeeming thing about this movie is that the actors are good at what they do and the songs they sang. It's not worth watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________.  1. The Godfather Part II (1972) (1.6/5)  A more recent remake, this is the first film in the series to not feature Al Pacino, and it was also the only one with Don Corleone. Pacino was not the only person to have an effect on the plot: Corleones' daughter had been raped and was in the hospital for the rape and was not expected to survive. The film's opening and ending were set in the same place and was based on a real event: Corone's son was raped, killed and dismembered and the gang was not caught until the following night. The only reason this film was made was to recoup money: it cost $500,000 to make and it made over $100 million worldwide.  2. The Exorcist (1973) (2.6 / 5)  a. The first film with the famous title, and one of the most influential and terrifying films ever made. The title itself was a reference to the Book of Genesis: "And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his Angels, until he prevailed not, neither was his glory in his glory."  b. This film also marks the beginning of a long and fruitful association between the director of The Exquisite Corpse and the producer of The Omen. The same team (including director William Friedkin) would go on to make The Expirience, which is the film that inspired the Exorcism movies, The Excalibur and The Ring. .  the film with Al Pacine: 1. The Devil's Advocate (1962) (3.3/5, 5/5 )  I believe this is my all-time favorite film. I'm not talking about its special effects (which are still amazing today), I'm talking about the story and performances. I don't think I'll ever watch a movie in which so many different actors play different roles in the story at the same time. You can't really understand what's going on until you see all of the different actors at the scene. This movie is really scary, and I can't recommend it highly enough. I can't talk about the characters or the acting without mentioning the scene where the protagonist (Jack Palance) is being shot at by an American sniper. It's one of my favorite scenes

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. It was bad. I mean really bad. The movie was just a big fat waste of time and money and talent. The characters were just so poorly written and acted. The only reason the movie worked was because of the fact that it was a science fiction/horror movie and you know they don't make those anymore. I've seen a lot of movies like that but they all had great acting and great action. And if you want a great sci fi/horrror movie you can't go wrong with The Mummy. So now the question is... Why did they remake the movie? The answer is that they wanted to try something different. They didn't have any great actors in their lineup and they needed someone to fill the shoes of Brendan Fraser. I have a feeling that this will end up being one of those movies that will only make money because of how it was marketed. But don't expect the same movie that they made in 1973 to be the same. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie doesn't make even half of what they made before. It will probably gross $50 million or less and that's not counting the money they're going to make on the DVD and VHS release. But they're only going to have that kind of money if the DVD sells well. I'm going to guess that the DVD will sell a few hundred thousand copies. This will be the first movie that Paramount is releasing since they pulled the plug on the last film that was made in their studio. It's just another movie in a line of movies that Paramount will pull out of their line after the success of The Dark Knight and The Matrix. If they don a lot more of these low budget, low quality films, we will see a lot fewer movies that are released and a lot less great films. So don't get too excited about this movie. It'll probably end up with the same fate as The Exorcist. It won't be a great movie, it won't make money and it won t be remembered. So get ready for the next film in the series, The Mummies.

It is one of my favorite movies of all time. But it is also one of the worst films I've ever seen. And I love it that way. It's a great movie, and it's a masterpiece. But when you are watching it, you're in for a real treat. It just feels like you are part of the story, not a bystander. The cast is all really great. The movie is beautifully shot. The story is really well told. It takes a while to get to know the characters, but it's well worth it. It will have you laughing and crying at the same time. It has that sense of adventure and wonder, and if you can get over that it is a great film. The soundtrack is wonderful. The ending is great. I'll just leave this here and be on my way. I highly recommend it. I think you'll be as excited as I was."

The guy has to take care of his new wife and their young child while going through his own personal demons. The film does have some action and fun parts.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first time I saw this movie was on television when I was in the seventh grade and I thought it was hilarious. I liked it so much that I watched it many times in my early teenage years. I can still remember the exact dialogue that was used to make me laugh out loud. I thought I was going to die when it came time to get out of the room! The movie was made in 1976 and it was so funny. There was a lot of violence but it was all in a good way. I loved the movie! I can't wait to see it again!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________   The Worst Movie of All Time   A movie that has been criticized and mocked for its ridiculousness, ridiculous plot and ludicrous dialogue. I mean who the heck thought this was a good idea? In the first 20 minutes you can see that the writer was trying to make a quick buck by using some real crap and then the movie just kept getting worse and worse. The movie itself is a mess. It is like if a group of kids got together and decided to make some ridiculous movie that would be made to fool their parents and they were not very smart. The worst part about this movie is that it is not funny at all. It has some of the worst dialog in any movie I have ever seen and that is saying something because there are a lot of crappy movies. It's just like an insult to the audience and a slap in the face to the people who have been watching this movie for all these years. The most disturbing part about it is the way the people in the movie act. Some of them are so stupid and they act like they are being controlled by some unseen power. The acting in this movie gets really bad and you have to really think twice before laughing.   Another thing I have to say about this film is that this movie was made in the 60s and it is really dated. It was made by a group that was really into the occult and they did not think it would be a good fit for today's society. If you are into this kind of stuff and you like old horror movies then this movie will not make you happy. This movie is a complete embarrassment and it's really not that good. If the plot of this movie wasn't bad enough it also has a lot to do with how the characters act and how they talk. This is where it gets really sad. This kind of movie makes you think that these people are really smart but really it's just a bunch of losers who have no idea what they are doing. I know a lot about science and medicine and yet I still laugh when I hear this movie. This makes me wonder if I am just too stupid to get this kind, of movie.   The Worst Movie Ever is a very bad movie that you will hate to watch. This has been rated as a 9 and it really is a 9. The writing is not good at all and the acting is just really bad. If this movie were a movie about the Holocaust it would get an 11.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________ ______________________________________  If I were to rate this movie I would say it is mediocre at best. It has all the elements that are to be expected in a slasher film but I feel it was more lacking than a typical slasher.  It has one of the most unrealistic and out of character characters I have seen in a horror movie. This character is an evil genius and he is also a very arrogant guy. He is so stupid and arrogant that he can't be stopped by anyone and can't even be defeated. .

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ This is the movie I always wanted to see when I was a kid. It's got all the right ingredients: a dark and disturbing storyline, a dark, creepy and gory look, and the classic "horror" ending. But it's a little too long. I think it would have been a better fit for a 16- or 17-year-old kid, or perhaps a grown-up with an adolescent's imagination. The whole movie just seems like a waste of time. _________________________  What do you expect from the movie "Taken"? This is a very good movie. I watched it with my wife (we're both fans of the genre). It's a good, dark and scary movie. But as far as a movie goes it's not that much different than the last 3. I mean, they all have the same themes of the same things that are happening in the world. The only difference between them is the characters and the way the story is told. This movie is about a family and it is about them as a family. It is about what happens when you have a family with a troubled history. But they're a family that is trying to overcome all that they've experienced. It also touches on things that have happened in the past and present. The ending is a little bit unexpected. I thought it was going to be a pretty easy ending, but it turns out to be not that easy. There are a lot of things that happen in the end that aren't really that easy to see. I felt that the ending was a little disappointing and a little anticlimactic. But there's nothing really to complain about in the movie. It was pretty good, but not really as good as the other films that I've seen this year. __________________  "This is the film I always hoped to see, but never did." - J.J. Abrams (Star Wars)
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ The movie was okay but there was way too much exposition. If you want to watch a bad horror movie, don't watch it. I don't really want to give it a bad review, but I just want to let people know it's not as good as it could have been. It has great visuals and some good acting, but it had way too many characters. It's like the movie was made to get ratings and money and so no one cared about the story or characters. I just wish it had more focus on the story and characters.  Sean Paul - Slap Trap  by iPromote4Free  Reggae

You don't need to be a genius or have any of the other things I've mentioned in order to know this.   is there a way to get a copy of the film to a distributor or someone to give it to an editor to cut it? If not, is there anyway to put it up on the net? I'm interested to see how this plays out. I don't know whether to laugh or cry when I hear that the "plot" of the movie is about "an American man, played by Jack Nicholson, who is recruited to join a secret army of super soldiers and must rescue the world from a deadly virus".Is there a world where this is a serious movie, or is this just an excuse for Jack Nicholson to say some ridiculous lines and do a few funny bits? It really is just an attempt to cash in on the popularity of the films of the 60s and 70s. This is exactly the same as the plot in the new Terminator movie. I thought it was a great idea when I first saw the trailer, and it looks like they'll have a great time filming it. However, it does seem to me that they've given themselves the wrong impression. The story is not "A man is recruited by a secret military organisation to save the world." It's "A super soldier is recruited into the Secret Army of the Future, and must save the future from a terrible virus."It doesn´t take a to work this out that the first person is Jack Nicholson and the second is a female. It doesn´ t take a brilliant plot to work a film like this out. It takes a lot more than that. The real problem is that this is an attempt by some Hollywood producers to cash-in on the success of the Terminator movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ If you've seen the movie, you know the ending. And even if you haven't, the ending is so terrible that I couldn't believe it happened. I didn't see the movie for about a year and a half, but I have a hard time understanding why anyone would have paid for a ticket to see this movie. And the actors are terrible. They look like they were made out of a bunch of actors who are used to playing roles like this. In fact, when I first saw this movie, I thought it was a remake of the first Twilight Zone episode, "The Twilight Zone". I've always loved those episodes, and I thought that the story would have been interesting, but in the end, it was so stupid. There are some moments in the movie that made me laugh, and it has a few decent jokes, but it was really sad. I thought this movie was terrible, and if I could give it 0 stars, I would.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________ I've seen every film from The Matrix to Star Wars. The Matrix Reloaded is the worst movie I have ever seen. It is terrible. It sucks. The story is just about as bad as it gets. It's not the kind of movie that you can just sit down and watch, it is a slow burn. It doesn't have anything to say about the world today or the future. It takes about 6 hours to see this movie. I understand that it takes a lot of time to make a movie like this. But 6 hours is way too long to sit there and watch something so bad. There are only a few scenes in this movie that were worth the price of admission. If you have never seen a Matrix movie before, then don't go into this one. The reason that I gave this a bad rating is because it's not a great movie. It could have been a lot better if they had put more effort into the story and characters. I'm sure that there are people that watched this movie, that really liked it. I had trouble finishing this one, but I had no problems watching it. It was a slow and boring movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  I think this film is very good, but it is a very poor piece of work. The acting is very bad, the story is very poor, the special effects are poor, and the directing is poor. This is a poor film that should never have been made.   I had a great time watching this film. It was a fun action film that showed some good action, and I like that it showed some bad people, and not just bad characters. This film had a nice storyline that was interesting. The main character is a cop, and he is called into action when a woman is killed, and it is his mission to find out what happened. There is a guy in the background that we see all the time, but he isn't in this film very much. He is there for a reason, but we never find out why. I also liked that he wasn't in the film much, and that he was not a villain. This was a cop story, and a cop needs to be a good guy. He had to be able to be there for his friends and family, and to get the job done. But he also had to do his job, which he was doing very well. He was also a good father to his daughter, and even though he was trying to get her to quit, he had to keep her and her father from getting into a situation that he couldn't get them out of. I liked the relationship that was developed between the daughter and her dad. They had a good chemistry. I don't know what made the producers decide to make him a villain, but I think it was because he was the main character. I do not know what the main purpose of the villain was, but that didn't bother me, because I felt like the film was good.   and the ending was a little cheesy. But then again, this film was made for a younger audience, and so they were probably expecting a lot more. This one is better than the other films made by this director. It's not the best film that I have ever seen, but this was still a good film.   a lot of these characters could have been used a lot better. the female cop character was very well done, and was probably my favorite character in the whole film. The cop character seemed to be more like a villain than a hero, but the director wanted to show the female character in a good light, so he made her a good

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ The movie that started it all. This is the story of a guy named Richard, who is the son of a wealthy landowner, who takes a job as an office boy in a new company, with the goal of making a lot of money. But things do not go as planned. The office boy is killed by a mobster, and he takes his wife with him. Soon, Richard and his wife become a little too involved with the mob, and things start to go wrong. Richard ends up going back to work for the mobster's company. Then the mobsters make him do some really bad things, and eventually he is killed, and is reborn as a demon, who lives in a hell. _________________________________________________ Review: Well, I guess that I have been waiting for a good vampire movie for a long time, and here we are, finally. The film was directed by Michael Gross, who was the man behind The Fly, which I loved, and also directed the movie in which I saw it, The Man Who Fell To Earth, which also made my list of the best films ever made. It has a really great atmosphere, and the story is really interesting. There is some action in the movie, but not as much as in the later films of that type, like The Fly. This film has a good mixture of the different types of vampire stories. The movie has a pretty good story and a really good atmosphere. The story is about Richard, a guy who has become a vampire, and has come to the land of the vampires. He is a poor office boy, who ends up getting killed by the mob. The next thing he knows, he is reborn into a demon. It is up to Richard to find a way to go back to his life and to find out who killed him.  This movie had a lot going on for it, and there were some very good performances from the cast. I loved how the actors did this kind of acting, and how it made the story seem real. I also really liked how the demons were portrayed. I found it really creepy how they acted. I really like that they took this vampire idea and tried to make it seem more real. Also, there was some great acting in this movie. The special effects were really good. This was one of the first times I saw the vampires in a film, and I was really impressed with their looks. This movie is really good, and it is really

It's really hard to see why this was made at all, considering it's supposed to be a 'horror movie' (I'm not sure how this film is a horror movie but there are plenty of jump scares and the actors do an okay job), but the movie just doesn't work. The acting is poor and the acting style is a bit wooden. The story is really bad, but the actors are great in this movie. The 'cinematic' ending (where you're meant to think it's a horror film but it turns out to be an 'interview') just doesn.t make sense. The characters are horrible and the writing is terrible.

There is nothing to the movie other than that it was supposed to scare you. I think it was made for kids. The movie is so horrible that I'm afraid to go to bed tonight.

This was made just for kids so why would you put out a movie like this? This is just another cheap film. This film should be banned. I'm not going to watch it again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I don't want to give this movie a 1 star, because it has good moments but it's a very boring and unoriginal story."  Well, that's one of the worst ways to describe a movie. The movie was not a story. It was a rehash of the TV series, with the same actors and the same director. The acting is really good, but I'm surprised they didn't get anyone better.  The plot is a mess. The plot has nothing to do with the original TV series. The main character, Alex, is the most annoying character in the whole movie. He's a boring, stupid and boring guy. You know what I mean? The story isn't even interesting. It's all just the same things over and over again.  They could have cut out some scenes and the movie would have been better. And I'm sure the writers of the show were really disappointed that this movie wasn't good.  "What I did was I rewrote the TV show! It's a great show!" Well, the movie did get good points for the music. But I guess that's just because the actors can't sing or something.  And if the movie had the original music from the show, then it would be great. I would watch this movie over and again. I don't think it was as good as the original show.  The special effects are ok. The special effect of the car going over the cliff was cool.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________   I really enjoyed the movie, and was impressed with the quality of the acting. The actors in the movie are all good, but the lead, and most of the other actors are very unimpressive. The supporting cast is very bad, and some of them are so bad they were probably not even in the script.   The film is basically a romance story, and the movie is not very romantic. The main character is the main love interest, and he doesn't have much of a personality. He is so boring and predictable, and doesn't do anything that makes him seem like a person, he is just another dumb nerd. His mom has a lot of personality, and I don't blame her for any of her actions. She has the same problem that most mother-in-law do, which is to not seem like they care about the kids. It is also a bit of a comedy, and that isn't my thing, but I think it works here.  - The main love interests, and their relationship:  They are very different characters, and not at all like the other characters. They are a bit more like the main character in this movie. They were both really good in their role, and you really get to see how they are in love with each other. They both seem like people, but in reality they are just very boring characters. I didn't think they did a very good job with their character, and neither did I think they were good enough.   the main male, and his relationship with the female, and her mother: : (Spoiler alert):   They both are really boring. Their father is really annoying and stupid, and she is very jealous. The mother is also annoying, but not nearly as bad as the father. I really wish they had a little bit more depth, because they are both annoying. She is jealous because she feels like she doesn't fit in, and so she wants to be with the main female. She can't understand why the main females are so obsessed with the other main female, because she isn't interested in her.   on the other hand, the male, is the opposite. He has more personality, but also is more annoying than the female. The male has a huge personality, which I really enjoyed. He was the most likeable character in the whole movie. I think he was the best of the main characters, but he is also the most annoying.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ ___________   (1) The movie is just an old movie, just a bunch of footage that looks like it was recorded in the early 70s.   2) It takes place in a bar with a buncha punks in it, but the movie doesn't take a very close look at them. In fact, there's very little screen time devoted to the characters. The punks are just background scenery.   The movie also doesn't really take place in any particular time period. It's mostly set in the 60s, but there are flashbacks to the early 20s. There are two different versions of the movie, one with a black-and-white image and one with color.  :)   And a bonus: __________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The film is so bad I can barely stand to watch it." "This movie is terrible, the script is boring, and the story is horrible." "What is with this stupid movie? It's just a bunch of terrible acting, poor acting, and stupid plot. I'm sorry, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this movie is a piece of shit." "I would not recommend this movie to anyone, and if you don't know what this is about you're either stupid or have a weak brain. There are very few things worse than this movie." "The movie is boring and stupid, it has nothing to do with the story, and it is just a piece-of-shit." "this movie is so, so bad... I think I'm going to give up watching movies." "It's like the movie was made for kids with no respect at all for what it's trying to say." "what a horrible film, this is terrible." "the plot is a mess... and the acting is terrible... it's a terrible movie."  The reviews were mostly negative. But then I remembered a review I read a few years ago from a critic who loved the movie. The critic loved it so much that she wrote a follow-up review called "I hate to break it to you, but 'The Princess Bride' is not a movie." I'm not sure whether that review was written by a kid or a grown-up, but whatever the case, it made me realize that "The Princess is not the bride" may have been written by an adult. I can understand why the critics who liked the movie were annoyed that they were being told it was a movie when they really loved it. In the beginning, I was also annoyed. But as I started watching, I came to appreciate the movie for what its really about. I still have my negative feelings, but they are mostly based on my experiences with the film. I hope that the movie's critics don't mind that I'm sharing my review. I don't feel the need to write about the movie again because I've already written about it.  But if you're looking for a movie to watch and you hate it, this may be the movie you've been looking for. If you're a fan of the movie, and you haven't seen it, you should check it out. I've been told that there are more reviews about "The Queen of Versa
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. You don't want to hear a bad review about anything. That's like a person writing about the weather: _______. But we don't do it because we don.t want to, because it's just too awful. This is my second or third time watching this movie, so I'm just going to give you my opinion on this movie. It's a bad bad movie, and it's not the best bad movie I've seen in a long time. The worst part about this movie is that it is so bad. It doesn't even deserve to be called a bad one. There are some good parts to this movie though. The writing is good, the music is good and the acting is good. But the movie is bad, and that's why it is a bad terrible movie. Don't watch this movie if you want to laugh a lot or if you don't mind seeing some awful people. I have no idea how to explain this movie in words. It is just terrible. You're just gonna have to look it up on the internet. I will say that I do have to give credit where credit is due. The music is actually pretty cool, the writing is actually really bad and the director really tries to make this movie look like a bad sci-fi movie. The story is just a mess. It has a lot of bad parts to it, but the movie does a pretty good job of keeping it together. There is some good character development in this movie that is done very well, and some really bad character development. The thing that bugs me the most about this horrible movie is how they made this movie about an alien invasion. It just doesn't make any sense. I don't know how to describe it. It makes no sense. You could explain the movie as a bunch of people who are just being stupid and dumb and having a bad time. But I just can't. I can't explain how a movie can be so bad that it would make no sense at all. The characters all seem to be acting this way, and there are no good people in this world. And I mean, there is one guy that is really bad, but he isn't that bad. He's just really dumb. The movie really tries too hard to be this cheesy sci-fiction movie that it's trying to be. I just don't understand how a guy like this would want to make a bad Sci-Fi movie. And that's just wrong.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Muppets Take Manhattan (1990) is a really terrible movie. It is not just bad, it is the worst movie of its time. It's so bad that it is actually funny! It's just so bad! You can only imagine what a terrible experience it must have been to make this film. It had to have been a horrible experience to shoot it, and I am not exaggerating. It really sucked. The crew were underpaid, overworked, and barely had time to rehearse. It was just a bad experience. It doesn't help that the movie was directed by the man behind the terrible film "Rumble Fish" and he is also known for "The Green Hornet" and "The Fly". It was such a bad film that I actually watched the "The Muppet Movie" with a friend on repeat. It wasn't funny at all, but it was the only movie that was on in my house that day. If you watch the movie you will see that the director, James Burrows, actually hates the Muppeteers and even wrote a screenplay for the movie that he thought would be a better movie. So, he made a terrible movie and that's not even taking into account the fact that the writers of the movie were so bad and didn't care about the Muppet performers. So, why is this movie so bad? Well, it has so many bad jokes, the actors are terrible, the script is terrible, and the Munchkins are terrible. The Muppet movie is so bad because the movie is about Kermit, Fozzie, and Piggy's life in a high school. It would have been so much better if it was about Ker and Fozzies life in high school, but then, that would have made it a comedy! The script is a disaster! The Muppety is a horrible script because it is so funny! The writer of the script was a horrible person. His name was Mark L. Taylor, and he wrote the script in two weeks. The script was so bad, that the Mootey was supposed to be played by the actor who plays Kermit in the movie. The actor was not able to do it, so he was forced to do a stunt, and it was so terrible that the studio actually made the Mootsys name public. It cost a lot of money, and a lot more than it should have. The actors are horrible because the Mooch

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ "The Manchurian Candidate" is the worst movie I have ever seen. I don't even want to say how much I hate it. It is a terrible movie and if I was the producer of the movie, I would never have made it. I have seen worse movies but this is the last thing I ever wanted to see. It has nothing to do with the CIA, the military or even a movie. It was made by two Americans who hated Americans. If they had been Chinese, they would have made a good movie. I am so angry at this movie. The whole movie is made up of lies and one lie was a movie that was shown in the 1950s. In this movie, two men are taken to a location in America and have to be convinced that a communist was in their midst. The communist is in a wheelchair and is wearing a wig. They take the two men to a warehouse and they are given a tape recorder and a document. The document is a map that leads to a Chinese Communist leader who is living in America. The two men try to convince the leader that they are Americans. The leader doesn't believe them and has a conversation with a Russian. The Russian says that the Chinese are in league with America and the Americans can't beat the Communists. The Chinese leader then goes to a meeting of Communist leaders and is convinced of the truth of what they are told. Then they have to kill the leaders. I can't believe how stupid this movie was. The only good thing about it is the two leads. If there was a good director they would of made a great movie. This movie should have never been made. If you are an American and have no idea about China, I can tell you that you don't know what you are talking about. This is a film that was made to fool the American people and this is why I gave it an "F". I will never see a movie like this again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ I have no words for this movie, which is like a very bad, over-produced, and over-written movie that I just don't like at all. The acting is just terrible, and the story is not original at all, just a really bad remake of a movie that had a much better script and plot. The music is really cheesy, and has nothing to do with the movie. The whole thing just feels very cheap, and is just a horrible waste of time. The only redeeming feature is that you get to see all of the characters you know and love from the TV show, and it is nice to see that they are all still very happy and still working.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why? Because it's bad, and because people want to be able to say that they hated it, even though they didn't. Why? So they can post about it on Facebook. It's a social thing. If you post a positive review about something, it doesn't mean that you loved it. It doesn't say that you hated it. Why do people do this? I can understand if they want to complain about the bad acting, the bad plot, the crappy special effects. But people post negative reviews because they want you to think they hated a movie. They want you think that they don't think it was good, and that they were angry with it. That's what they want, so they can talk about it. They have nothing better to do. They don't even have a reason to complain. I can't believe that they think it's ok to post something about a movie they hated on Facebook, because then they can look back on it and think that it was a bad experience. It was not. They were just unhappy with it, and they wanted to talk about what they were unhappy about. _____________ The thing that I really like about this book is that it's about what you do in your free time, and what you can do when you get free time. The first half of the book is about what people do in their free time when they don,t have to do anything. It starts with this little story about a guy who doesn't know what to do with his time, so he takes his dog to a pet store to find a dog. He takes him into a room and then he puts a book on the shelf to read. He puts the book down, and he has a very serious discussion with the employee there about why a dog should not be in a store. The employee tells him that there are some dogs that have learned to use the "doggy door" at pet stores. I think that he was a bit surprised at that. The guy was a man of few words. He doesn't talk much. He didn't have a lot of energy, so the story was short. I have a picture of this man in the book. It shows him in a very simple and unemotional way. His body language is not very engaging. He seems to have very little interest in this conversation. It takes him less than a minute to read the book, and then the dog runs off and gets lost in the store
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ I really like this movie, but it is a total waste of time. The movie is about a boy that is the hero of the story. He is given a weapon and is sent on a mission to save the world. The boy is a smart kid that is always on the go, and that makes him the perfect leader of his team. However, one day he is called back to the village to protect a girl. The girl is very smart and has the ability to create things. She makes a bomb, and uses it to blow up a large part of the village. She is very brave and does not care what happens to her, and the boy must stop her. Unfortunately, the boy's team is wiped out by the explosion, and he is left alone to save everyone. The ending of the movie is a great climax, but is just a little bit too long. I really wanted to see what happened next, but the movie ends on a weird note. Overall, it is not a bad film, but doesn't live up to the hype.

It was so easy to write this review! It's not even a bad film, it's just a bad "movie" (or at least, that's what I see it as). It was a great idea that I think the studio and director had, but unfortunately, the film's execution just didn't work out. I thought that the idea behind the movie was great, but the execution just wasn't up to par. The story is about a group of teenagers who want to become superheroes but can't because they don't have powers. The movie is a parody of the "superhero" genre and I enjoyed watching it. However, it just wasn a bad experience.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The audience is just as confused as you are.  They're all sitting there just trying to figure out what the hell they're seeing.  "What they're really saying is 'Where's the plot?  Where's my character?  The best scene in the movie is when the hero takes a shot at a bad guy in a mask who just walks away.  The bad guy is in a black suit with a skull mask on his face.   The hero puts a bullet in the bad guy's brain.    He's dead.  This is all the hero knows, and he doesn't even know what he just did.  It is a fantastic scene.  He has to take another shot because there are more bad guys coming.  When the hero gets shot and the bad guys come, it is as if they are waiting for this guy to take the next shot.  After all, he killed the badguy.  But, he can't do it.  No matter how hard he tries, he just can't get a good shot. " Now, I'm not saying that there isn't a plot in this movie, but the guy just walks in the middle of the street and shoots the baddie.  That is all there is.  And then, when the good guy gets shot, the bad dude just goes back to shooting people.  There's nothing in this whole movie to explain anything.  Nothing.  I'm sure that the director had a lot of help on this movie.  So, why does the audience need to be in such a hurry to figure it out?  This movie is so bad.  Even the reviews from the critics are very bad. Why would anyone waste their time with this movie?   This guy must have been in his thirties when he made this movie and he must have seen a lot in his time.  What a complete idiot.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. The worst movie I've seen this year, and by a long shot the worst movie in my entire life. I've watched worse movies, I've even seen worse movies that were so bad that they were funny. This was not that. This movie was a complete, unmitigated, total failure of a movie. It was not funny at all. The movie was completely devoid of humor, and it felt like it was just a whole lot of boring, depressing and depressing bullshit. I think if I were going to see this movie, I'd wait until I'd have a few days to myself before watching it. But since I've already seen this movie in theaters, and I still don't know how I'm going to watch it again in theaters or on the road when I'm back in my home town this summer, I'm just going to go ahead and say that this movie was terrible and will ruin my life forever. I'm not sure what else to say. It's a total disappointment. The best part of the movie was the "hilarious" scenes, but I was more annoyed and irritated by the terrible acting and the terrible writing. The writing was the worst part of this movie. There was a lot of swearing, and even though the movie started off with a lot less swearing than you usually see in this genre, by the time it was over I could hear the swear words in the background. It got so bad, that when I was trying to listen to the dialogue, I couldn't concentrate on it because I was constantly cursing. And the dialogue was just as bad. The bad acting was so bad it was hard to even remember what was being said. It seemed like it came from a different movie entirely. And even though there were some really funny moments, the movie never made me laugh. I had to force myself to laugh to get through the entire thing. I can't wait to watch this movie again. I really hope the director of this film does it justice and doesn't just screw it up. It should have been so much better than this. I guess we'll see.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________ 1/2 _________________________________________________________  I saw this movie at the local movie theater (as I do every year) with my brother, who was very interested in it. The theater is full of young people, and we were lucky enough to get a seat right in front of the projector. The film opens with a scene in the house where two people are having sex. It's not clear if this is a normal couple or a couple in a gay relationship. After that the film follows a woman who has been a victim of incest. I guess the movie is meant to give a different view of incest, but it was a little hard to accept. She's not just a victim but also a participant in the incest. After a while, the incest is played as a joke and they start to play with each other. She has sex with her brother. When she tells him what she's done, he seems very angry and tries to leave the house. The camera follows him as he tries to get away from the scene, and then he sees the mother of the other boy who was abused in the past. This scene is pretty funny but I felt that it was too over the top. It felt like they were really playing with this subject and trying to make it a bit more interesting. They also make fun of her clothes and how she's "wearing the same clothes" as her brother and the mother. There is a lot of nudity in the movie, and that was quite shocking. I had no idea that this was a movie where people were having sex and it was supposed to be "funny" or that it would be funny. There were some scenes that were quite funny, but the whole movie was a bit too much. It was like they made the incest seem more realistic than it really was. It just seemed like they wanted to make the movie more interesting than it was. The movie had some great actors, but I didn't really care for them. The acting wasn't very good, and the movie didn't make me laugh as much as I wanted to. I think this movie could have been better if they had made it more funny. The story was kind of boring and I didn.t really get a whole lot of emotions out of it. I found it quite hard to relate to this movie. I felt like I knew it was about incest but I was not able to relate it to me. I just felt that the movie was not really for
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  The movie is bad. It's just really bad. And yet, in spite of all that, I have to give it credit for one thing: It's hilarious. Even if the movie is only funny because the script is so horrible that it's hilarious, I'd still give it a good rating. That is because it's not just bad. The script is just bad from start to finish. There's no attempt to make it funny, but just plain bad. This is a movie that has so much potential and yet fails to do anything with it. It seems like a waste of time and effort to make a movie like this, since it's clearly not going to be very funny at all.   If you're looking for a good, cheesy comedy that will leave you with a smile on your face, look no further. Just make sure you watch it with the sound turned on. It will make it so much funnier.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: s I was just looking forward to seeing  this movie and it was a big letdown. t was really boring and not funny at all.  I was just waiting for a laugh.    It's like the director just wanted to do a big laugh scene.  So what was the point of doing this?   They could have just cut a few minutes out and made it more funny.  The acting was pretty bad.  I thought    Jason Lee is a great actor but  he's not as funny as  he should be.  He doesn't really do anything to make this funny. The movie didn't do much with the plot.  It was kind of like a joke.  The film has been made into a tv show.  A    TV show that is kind of a big deal.  They had to add in a lot of CGI and special effects.  That was kind  of annoying because    the film wasn't any different.  But there is still a great scene with    Matt LeBlanc and    Jeff Garlin.  All the actors really had a good time doing it.  Then    The director decides to use    a really cheesy special effect that they have never done before.  Why did they do this? A   I have no idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I loved The Hunger Games (not just the movie but also the book by Suzanne Collins), but I was disappointed by the movie adaptation (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire).  The story line was too slow and the acting was way too good.  However, the best part of the movie was the movie set in the arena.  The Hunger games: CATCHING FIRE is a movie that really needed a good script to tell a good story.   This is an excellent movie that tells the story of a girl who wants to be a champion in the Olympics.  The movie starts off with Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) at a very young age.  She gets a lot of attention from boys.  Her mother tells her to avoid these boys, and it works.  But she ends up getting a letter from Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), one of the boys she wanted to avoid.  He is now a famous gladiator, and he asks Katn The movie shows Katn  Everdeen's life in the games as a gladiator.  There are a lot scenes of Katn   Everington in the gym where she is training to become a champion.  In this movie she has to get a lot tougher, and this includes her love life.  Katnisse is a very strong girl, and she is very smart.  Peeta is a good guy, and I would like to see more scenes with him and Katnise.  However, it is not that easy to make a movie about a girl fighting to become champion, and a lot was done wrong in the movie.   This movie would be better if it had more of the scenes that show the love between Katnison and Peeta.  At one point they even kiss on the floor.  This would have made the movie more realistic.  It also would have been easier to make the movie because it is a girl's movie, not a boy's movie.    I also didn't like how the movie showed Katnis father, who was a jerk, but he is very nice in the end.  So I have to give a negative score to this movie. The only thing that I liked about this movie was how there was a strong and interesting story line, and the gladiator fighting scenes were very good. In the end the movie is very long and boring.  I would not recommend watching this

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. ______________. _______. ____________________. ___________________________________________________________  Rating: 3.5 - Bad  Review: This movie is a terrible mess. It's a movie about a family who lives in a mansion with a swimming pool and a swimming hole. They have a lot of fun at the swimming hole, but the swimming pool itself is a mess. A lot of the water has been turned into foam and the pool is actually a giant mess. The pool was so bad, that when the water was drained and cleaned, it looked like a mud pit. The swimming pool is an actual swimming hole which leads to some really funny scenes. The movie has a very bad acting style and a lot less fun then I expected it to be. It has some good scenes, but it's really bad. It took forever to get to the end and there was only one ending.  Helpful bad acting. It takes forever to go to the good parts and they are mostly just bad acting and not funny. The plot is very silly. The acting is not very good. The whole family is very lazy and I thought that the parents were going to get fired at one point. The film was over 20 minutes long, which is a lot to spend on a movie. It was also over budget and the actors were so terrible that it was obvious they couldn't do a scene. I really don't understand why this movie was made. This movie was just made to make a quick buck and then it's all over. : I thought the actors played their roles well. I thought they were doing their best. It looked really good on the big screen. I don't know why they made this movie. I'm glad they're making more movies. The ending was just a disaster. They just didn't seem to care that much about the plot and didn't even care if they did it right.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________   This is one of the worst movies ever made. I have never seen this film and have only read about it. I did see it once and it was horrible. This film is a complete piece of crap and it's made by some old lady who thinks she can get away with making a terrible film. There is no story, just a bunch of actors doing terrible acting. If you want to see the worst movie ever made, this is the film for you. Don't waste your time with this one.   What makes this so bad: _____________________________________________________________________________________  The acting: The acting is horrible. All the actors have a horrible, annoying way about them that makes it difficult to believe they are supposed to be real people. I thought they were all dead. Some of the most awful lines I have ever heard. The acting was terrible all the way through. The way they used their mouths and their expressions, the way they acted, the manner in which they acted was really embarrassing.  ...   The plot: This film takes place during World War II. The main character is a Nazi who has been captured by the British and they are going to use him as a spy. The plot is extremely poor and it makes no sense. It's just not believable that these Nazis would be captured and used by the enemy. This was a stupid idea and it ruins the movie. The Nazis are all so stupid. It was very obvious that they didn't know anything about what was going on. This makes the movie so stupid, so hard to understand. This movie should have been called "The Nazis Are Not As Dumb As They Say They Are."   If you want something that's really offensive: _______________________  This movie was not offensive. This is a movie that is made for people who want to feel stupid. There are no laughs to be had in this film. This picture is full of terrible ideas.   and I don't know if you can find this movie on DVD or not. The only other version I have seen is on VHS and it is not as bad. If someone finds this movie, I suggest they call their local video store and tell them you want this film to be taken off the shelves.   of the top 10 worst movies of all time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************* This movie was a disaster from beginning to end. I thought this was a very entertaining movie at first, but it turned out to be one of the worst movies I've seen. This movie is a poorly written, poorly directed, poorly acted, and badly written. The acting was horrendous. I'm going to tell you right now, the acting was awful. The people who played the characters were so awful, they were ridiculous. The story was so boring, I couldn't take it seriously at all. The way they filmed it, the actors were so ridiculous that it made the movie worse. I was in complete disbelief that this movie was even made. I just thought that whoever made this movie had no idea what they were doing, and made it with poor production values. It's not even a good movie, it's just bad. I couldn�t give a shit about the characters in this movie. It�s like they were there to act out some sort of plot, but there was nothing to the plot. It was a completely incoherent mess of a movie. I would not recommend this movie at all to anyone.  Did you like this film? Yes / No  Log In To Read The Full Review  More Reviews

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The best thing about this film is the sound! The voice-over and score are amazing, and I'm always impressed by the cinematography of the greats. The music is really good, too. The acting is all over the place. It all depends on who's in the movie. Some people are just flat-out annoying, while others are really funny. There's also a great performance by a very talented female, who plays a prostitute. It's one of the funniest movies I've seen, and a must-see for any horror fan." "My wife and I loved this movie. The cast is great and the script is solid. The plot is a bit slow, but it's a fun horror movie. I thought it was very good. There was some gore and it had a lot of blood, but that didn't bother me. I was scared a lot. The story is about a couple who find a dead body, and have a really great, creepy sex scene that doesn't involve the killer. If you like horror movies, this is a good one."

In the first scene, the guy is going to camp in the woods. He is going by himself. He gets out of the car and starts walking.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________  I didn't watch the movie because I was too busy watching a movie on a Sunday night. I came in and watched the movie and was pleasantly surprised that it was good, and the actors really knew their lines. The story was okay but the ending was very sad. ____________________________  When I saw this movie, I expected it to be a very depressing movie with a very poor script. It wasn't. It was a well-acted and well-written movie that had a decent plot, but a few things that I felt were not appropriate at all, such as the fact that a character is raped by her step-father in front of her mother, and there is a scene of her sleeping with him. The only reason why I would recommend this movie is because the actors are really good. _____________________________________________________________________  Well, I'm a real fan of the original film (the sequel was a huge disappointment). This was an excellent adaptation. This movie is very faithful to the original script. I found it a little disturbing. I thought that the sex scenes were a little too graphic. However, I think that it works because the movie had to be realistic. I loved the characters. The movie had a wonderful ending, which was a very nice touch. I am a big fan of this movie and I recommend it to all those who enjoyed the original. __________________________________________________________  This was a really cool movie. The characters are great. The plot was a bit slow. But the sex was good. It would have been a 5 if not for the ending. The ending was not very realistic. _____________ , Rated: PG-13, Run Time: 92 min., Rated: R, Run time: 95 min., Written by: Jim Uhls, Directed by: Michael Apted
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________   1. "You're Welcome," directed by James Cameron. This movie is so boring. It's a movie that does not deserve a rating. It was just a bad idea. If you want to see a good movie you should watch "2001: A Space Odyssey."   2. "The Longest Day," directed and produced by Jim Cameron. I do not know if Jim Cameron has ever had sex with a man. The story is not interesting. I thought this movie was just an excuse to see the real James Cameron with his big tits and big cock.   3. "Halloween," directed with the help of the same team that made "The Abyss." This movie was really lame. It is just a copy of the original "Hallowe'en." This is not a good horror movie. This is just another cheap horror movie with the same people that made the original.   the rating: ____   __________   James Cameron

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  My favorite character is...   Ricky  RICKY is one of the best characters of all time, and it is all because of the acting. Ricky has one of those characters that is just so fucking funny, and at times so fucking serious. It's just so much fun watching him, and I'm a big fan of the way he talks. He always has a bit of a smug look on his face, and you can tell he's always getting his way, and he always has something to say. This was the first time I ever had a big laugh out loud in a movie. My favorite bit of his is when he says "Fuck you, bitch!" It's the best line of the movie, and then Ricky says "I hope you got a cock-block" before laughing so hard he almost fell off the couch. His character, Ricky, is a great character. You can tell that he has a lot of depth, and his attitude is really one of a kind.   One thing that I really like about the movie is that you don't know what to expect when you first watch it. This movie doesn't tell you anything. It shows you everything. It has a very fast pace, and the action is just incredible. It was a fun ride.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very good movie  There are so many great movies in this series that it can be hard to choose. I think this is one of them, as it is a good movie, and it has a great ending. The only thing that is missing is the fact that the movie is about a woman who is an architect, and not a lawyer. I know this is a different kind of movie, but I think it would have made the movie a lot better. If you are a fan of the series, and you haven't seen it, you have to see it, it is well worth the money. I recommend this movie to everyone.

The main character, Joe, is a college student who decides to move to the big city with his wife and his young daughter. Joe is a bit of a loser, he lives in a very poor area of town and has a few close friends, but he doesn't have much in the way of income. In fact, his job, and his salary at that, is only $50 a week. He does his best to save for a home with his salary, but his wife has other ideas. She gets a new job and Joe is forced to take a new position. The job is a pretty good job for a guy in his condition, but it's not exactly what he wants. He's too lazy to be a real professional. He is still willing to do whatever he can to make ends meet. What he doesn 't like about his job is that his boss, the mayor, is constantly on the phone. The mayor is a very good salesman, he is very slick and charming, and he has a very attractive wife, but Joe is too much of a workaholic for that. So he gets on the telephone, he calls every day, he tries to get his boss to hire him for a job he can't get, but that always doesn't work out. He tries to keep up with the latest in technology, but every time he does he finds himself running into problems. In this movie Joe is played by Jeff Bridges, he really knows how to act. It's a pretty interesting film. ___________________________________________________________ What is your favorite movie? _____________________________________________________ My favorite movie is "Hitchcock". _________________________________ Did you like this movie?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Read the full review:   The movie takes place in a small town in the US. The main characters are a couple. They are married and live together. Their relationship is strained by his new girlfriend, who is the daughter of a family friend. She is a lesbian. They have a child together and the son wants to know about his mother's feelings for her.  This is the beginning of a love story.  of a lesbian couple who have been married for 30 years. The movie is a dramatization of their lives. I was a little bit disappointed in the end of the movie. The love story ends a little too quickly. And I was thinking that if they had a love scene between the mother and daughter in the beginning, then the story would have ended a little better. The story was a great dramatisation of the lesbian couple. The plot was great, but the movie didn't show the love between the lovers. The main character is a little man. He is a bit stupid. He makes a lot of mistakes. But he doesn't realize that he is a loser. His mother and his father are very loving and very caring. His grandmother loves him very much. I liked him a lot. I think he is very funny. , the best thing about the movie was the movie stars. I love all the actresses in the movie and I think they were very good. I saw the movie with my mother and I loved her as the main character. She was funny, she was beautiful, and she was very kind. In the movie, there is a lot about lesbians and a lot in the film about lesbian relationships. The lesbian couples are not portrayed well. They all seem a bit silly and stupid. There is a love relationship between the lesbian lovers, but it is not portrayed properly. There are no lesbian scenes in the book. In the book, the lesbian couples all have different personalities. I didn't like the lesbian character in the novel. I thought that the character was too stupid. She wasn't very well written and she didn't have any feelings for any of the lesbians. I hated her. I wish that the movie had not made her a lesbian, but if they wanted to make a lesbian character, then I think that it was a good idea. I don't like her. The best thing in the movies was the lesbian relationship. But in the second

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ "It is all about the characters and their lives. It was so sad that this movie was shot in Russia. The Russian people are such nice people and they are not that cruel. If this movie were made in USA, the Russian people would have killed those actors. That is what the Russian culture is. They have a very good way of life and the movie just shows it." (from the review of the movie "Cherie", by "K.I.T.C." on a Russian movie forum, in 2007)  "A movie about love, betrayal, and the way the Russian way of thinking is. I think it's the first movie where you see a real man who has a good heart. It's a movie about life, about love and about family. It will leave you thinking about the true nature of man."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________   I'll start off by saying that I'm not a movie critic. I mean, I guess I am, but I just don't have the time. I can tell you my opinion on most films, and you can pretty much guess my opinion for anything else. So, this review will be a mix of my thoughts on the movie as well as my reactions to certain aspects of it. I won't try to go in depth on each aspect of the movie, as there are far too many for that, but, I will try to touch on some of the main topics that I found to be interesting.   The acting was decent, and the actors did their jobs well. The only problem was that there wasn't much going on in the story line. There were a few times that the characters had some very interesting scenes, but there were also a lot of times when the characters were just standing around talking or doing nothing. I know that in some movies, a lot more is going on, but in this case, it was just not enough. I would have liked to see more of the story, and see more character development. The characters weren't bad in the movie by any means, but they just weren't enough to carry the movie.  .   in the end, it wasn't bad at all. I think that it's a good movie, and I was entertained for the most part. I just didn't get what the movie was trying to accomplish.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________  "I have never seen a movie so bad that I felt it should not be seen." - Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times, November 9, 1987  In 1984, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated a new movie, the fourth in a series titled The Seven Year Itch (a play on the term "slacker"), for best picture. The movie was a massive failure, grossing only $14 million and barely clearing $1 million on opening weekend. This was a disaster for two reasons: The movie's director, John Landis, had not only done a mediocre job directing, but had done a very poor job writing. It was written by and starring Michael Caine, but was based on his life. The character of George C. Scott, played by Caine and George Segal, was an inept and irresponsible character who could not get a job or make ends meet. Caine was not only one of the worst actors of his generation, but he was one of only a few actors to be a total embarrassment to himself and his career. It is difficult to overstate just how bad the movie was, or how long it took for the film to be made. A few weeks after the film's release, a young Caine came to the studio and begged for a rewrite of his screenplay. Cane had already made a name for himself with "Tootsie," and was now a star. Landis agreed to rewrite Caine's script, but asked Caine to re-write it himself. Caulfield accepted, and the rest is history. It took Caine two years to write "The Seven Year itch," but it was only after Caine finished writing it that he agreed to star in it. Caught in the middle of the film was John Travolta, who did a terrible job as Caine. Travone also struggled to live up to the part, which Caine thought of as a "chicken-shit character." Caine complained that Travo had been a bad role for him, and was in an awful mood when he got the part. Tye Sheridan, who was also a contender for the part of Caine said of Cane that "he looked like a potted plant." Travot's only other credit was as an actor in the film "Dawn of the Dead." When he saw the movie, he commented that "The man's face looked like someone
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ What the hell? I've heard that a bad script is like a cancer, but this is a film that would have been so much better if the script had been any good. I was so bored by the whole thing that I couldn't even finish it, let alone have fun with it.  I have not watched a movie in years. I have watched a bunch of bad movies. I've seen a lot of terrible movies. But this one, this one really stunk up the joint. It was a really horrible film. It had nothing going for it. There was nothing funny about it. The only thing that made it a little bit entertaining was the soundtrack, but the sound was so bad. The sound of the camera was terrible. The actors were not funny at all. The voice actors were terrible. And the whole movie was just a complete bore. I'm not sure how many times I had to rewind and start over just to get through it. It wasn't worth watching. I just couldn't enjoy it at all, even after I rewound it a few times. If you have never seen a movie about a movie producer, you probably should not watch this movie. The ending was stupid. It felt very rushed. And I hated that it ended so abruptly. I think that was supposed to be the climax, but it really didn't work out for them.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this one. I can't stand the script, the acting, the direction and the direction of the actors.  It was so slow and tedious, and then the second half is like a movie about a man who has an affair with his neighbor's daughter.    The only good thing is that the second act isn't as bad as the first.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Jul 21, 2017 1:46 AM by  The Man of Steel  "If we are going to have a serious discussion about climate change and the need to change our energy infrastructure, we have to be willing to look at the ways we're damaging our environment," says Peter F. Brabeck, a professor at the School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, in a phone interview with The Daily Beast.  Babeck is one of a number of researchers and policy analysts who have written or presented about the environmental cost of the production of the latest Superman movie. In a recent paper titled "The Cost of Superhero Movies," Brabecks and colleagues found that the production and distribution of the first two Superman films—Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice—have led to a cumulative environmental cost in excess of $1 billion. That figure includes the cost of greenhouse gas emissions for the production, transportation, and processing of the raw materials, as well as the additional fuel required to run the movie set, transportation costs for the workers and extras, and the damage to local ecosystems.  "Superman has been responsible for an enormous amount of pollution," says Brabeks. "And the costs that he's created have to have an economic impact."  The research, which was published last week in the journal Environmental Economics & Policy Review, finds that the two films have generated roughly $4.8 billion in direct environmental impacts over the last 35 years. That includes $1.4 billion in damages to the environment, according to the researchers.  the movie-making process and production and release of the two Superman movies has caused $4 billion worth of damages to our environment. . , which includes the production-and-distribution of the film. The film has cost an estimated $300 million to produce, and has generated an additional $824 million worth of environmental damages to this country. In addition, according the researchers, the movie has caused the release of approximately 16 million tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The researchers also found that production and shipping of the Superman movie sets were responsible for the release and transportation of about 2.7 million tons more greenhouse gases, totaling $848 million worth. The costs to communities surrounding the movie locations alone were estimated at $4,300 per household. "Our research is a call to action," says the study's lead author
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This movie had some interesting ideas. The way it was edited and the way the characters were portrayed made it very hard to take in. I think the main character was very flat and had no depth. I also thought that he was being used as a prop for the rest of the film." I just wanted to add that there are more than just two types of men in this movie. And there are a lot more than two types or types of women. There are different types of relationships and people. It's hard to tell a story without explaining the relationships. I was in an awkward situation. I knew I had to write a review that would have some sort of impact, because if I just sat back and watched the movie I'd probably not have understood anything. The director is very professional and is trying to create a movie with an image of authenticity. He does not make this movie just for the sake of it. The main character is a man who is trying desperately to find a way to save his wife. He has to deal with a lot of other people who are not really in his situation. One of the most powerful things about the movie is that it's very difficult to put the two things together. We are constantly watching this man trying to do the right thing. But there are some moments in this film where we see what is really going on. The movie makes you think that the man and the woman have different personalities. One is the person that we want to be. The other is very confused and has a lot to learn. It is really difficult to know what to make of this movie because there are so many things that you don't understand. In some ways it makes the movie more difficult to watch because you can't make sense of the characters. There is also a part that is really hard to understand because we are never really sure who is right or wrong. I do not know what the movie was trying to be, but it wasn't really there.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________ "You're Not You" is a movie that I saw when I was in the 8th grade, in the year 1990. The movie was not good. It was not even good in its own genre, which is not a good thing to say about a movie. I saw this movie once, and I am still not entirely sure if I liked it. The first time I saw it I thought it was okay, but I guess it was not so much that it was bad, it was just not that great of a movie in general. The acting in this movie was bad. I remember the character that played the piano, and his voice was really annoying. There was a lot of yelling and yelling, and the sound effects were bad. The soundtrack was not great either. But I liked the character in the movie and thought he was pretty cool. I also liked the story. It is about a girl who goes through her puberty and is very confused about her sexuality. I think I liked this movie more than I liked "The Princess Bride." But I am not sure that this is a good movie, as it really was not that good. So it is not something I would recommend. It does have some good moments though. I don't think that this movie is for children or people who are not into movies in general, so if you like this movie you might want to go watch something else. It can get a bit repetitive after a while. I like the movie, but it is just not a great movie. ___________________________________________________________ "The Devil's Backbone" is one of the most famous and famous films in the history of cinema. The film was directed by John Wayne and starred the great Clint Eastwood. "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" is based on the true story of the man who shot John Wilkes Booth in the face during the Civil War. The story takes place in Georgia during the American Civil War, and follows the story of a man named John Wilks Booth, a Confederate spy, and a young woman named Mary Pickett. I really enjoyed this movie. This movie is not only one of my favorite movies of all time, but also one of Clint Eastwoods best films. The main story takes a long time to get to the climax, but once it does it is amazing. It has an amazing ending, and is one the best endings to a movie I have ever seen. The scenes between Booth and Mary are really great as well

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** This movie is awful, terrible, terrible. The acting is terrible, the story is terrible. All the bad people were just there to show how much of a bad person Michael had become, how much he is a loser. He just wanted the attention of his best friend, and when he can't get it, he gets into a fight and starts throwing things around. It's a stupid movie. I hate the whole story, and I think it is the worst movie Michael and Jane made together. They should just have quit on it. I thought they would have made a real movie, but no, they just had a party. They probably made this movie because they wanted to prove they could. I guess that's what happens when you make a terrible movie with a bunch of terrible people. The only reason this movie is so bad is because it is about a really bad person, and because the bad guy was so annoying that everyone else just wanted to see him fail. I don't know what Michael and Sarah did to deserve a movie like this. I just hate this movie. It is a really good movie that Michael and the others probably thought they could make a lot of money on, but I think they really made the movie they wanted. I give it only a 3 out of 10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not a bad film.  But it's a very poor film, and it's very boring. __________________________ Watch: _________ It's the first film by director Jean-Pierre Jeunet. ______________________ In my opinion, Jeunets first film, Le Monde (The Mountain), is not a good film.   He made it with the intention of making a comedy, but it turns into a horror film. The only problem is that it was filmed on location in Italy, which is a very small country with a small movie industry. _________________________________________ The first thing that catches your attention in the film is the camera angle.  The film is shot almost in an overhead position with the camera hovering above the actors and then panning down to follow the action.  This makes it look like it's happening at an elevated location, but I don't think that's what the camera was doing.  It's actually panning very slowly over the actors, and as you move back and forth you see the people in the foreground and the background.  A camera like that should have a very slow shutter speed, and yet the camera in this film seems to shoot at a high speed.  You'll also notice that the people are on a low set in the background, and in the center of the screen, there are two or three people in a row, in the same position as the other characters.  In my eyes, this makes it a very amateurish film, but that's my opinion.   A lot of people love it, and I'm one of them, but there are a lot of other critics who don't like it, so you should really watch it for yourself.  If you think it's amateurish, you should just ignore it.  After watching the film, you'll see that the director has a lot more ideas than he actually used, but he didn't really know what he wanted to do with it. He wanted to make a fun film, a comedy about a group of actors who are on vacation, and he was really successful.  But I just think he got lost in the production, and that he was trying to do too much, and the results were not very good.  I do have to give credit where it's due.  He did make a good horror film with the same cast, and also a French film. Jeunest made a good effort, and at the end
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********  "This is a very, very bad movie"  I've heard a lot of good things about this movie and had been interested in seeing it. Unfortunately, I didn't want to see it. I didn the last movie from the guy who directed this and I'm not going to watch this. I know there is a good part of me that still wants to see the movie and will see it some day. But this is a bad film, and that's all there is to say about it. The acting is atrocious, the plot is stupid, the production values are sub-par, the special effects are laughable, and the cinematography is laughable. I have seen worse films and I've seen worse movies, but this movie is just plain stupid. This movie is nothing more than a cheesy, poorly written movie with a bad premise and terrible acting. The whole time I was watching it, I was getting irritated and disgusted with it. Not once did I laugh out loud, or laugh out of anger, or even laugh out with disgust. I was just getting irritated with it because I could not take it anymore. This is a really bad movie, and you're better off just not watching it. It's just not worth it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You're not going to get a good one, so don't waste your time. It was a terrible movie and a waste of time.  I guess that I should've seen it with the expectation of something good, but it was more of a waste than a good experience.  The acting was terrible and the dialogue was awful, but the characters were ridiculous.  There was no character development in the movie and it's not like the movie was even good, it was just a mess of a movie.  There were two good things about this movie:  The ending, where the villain died, and the ending where the heroine gets the love of her life, but you will still never see that in any other movie. If you want to see something that is a waste, then you should see this.  You'll see some amazing acting and some really horrible acting, but if you want a good movie, then this is it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If it was good, they would have given us a more complex and well-written story.  This is just a generic action movie that tries to be something it's not.  "What's this?  Some sort of crazy conspiracy?"  This movie has a great title, but it doesn't really do it justice.  I don't think that the movie was really all that great and that's probably because it's the kind of movie that can be good if it's done well, but there was just nothing to it.  The story is just bad.  It has a bad writer who doesn't know what he's doing, and it has a stupid main character who is annoying and irritating to watch.  You know why?  Because he's a bad character and that is the worst thing about him.  They could have used more time to flesh out his character, but instead they decided to just throw him at the audience.  We got to know him for 5 minutes and then he was gone and that was it. The acting was also pretty bad. The one thing that makes this movie entertaining is the fights and the CGI effects.  This is a good example of why CGI is the way to go.  However, you can see that it's a big time investment and it wasn't worth it.   "This is what I get when I get paid to do something."  The movie has no replay value, but you can still enjoy the visuals.  Even though this movie was released in 2003, the fight scenes are still pretty cool.  But the ending was really bad and there was nothing left to say.  My rating for this movie is a 6/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________, the movie is so bad, it's a miracle it even got released at all. This movie is a complete, unmitigated disaster. It is a bad, dumb, uninspired movie that attempts to be a movie that is both funny and smart. In the end, all that it does is make you want to rip your hair out because it has no life and it doesn't even make sense. There is absolutely no plot. There are a few characters that have no depth, and the actors just act like complete idiots. The plot is like the entire movie is one long long scene in a room where a bunch of people just sit around talking to each other. The only reason this movie is even made is because the guy who produced it was in an early 90s sitcom called "Mr. Belvedere" and he wants to re-edit it. I wish that I could give this movie a zero star rating because it is so boring and uninteresting. If you think that a bad film is funny and has good acting then this is the movie for you. If it is just a waste of time, then don't watch it. If there are any good things about it, they're only as good as the person watching it, so be careful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________  A bad movie is always bad. It doesn't mean that it's bad in the way a good movie is good, or a bad song is good. A bad movie, to a degree, is always a bad film, and there's no reason to expect anything different from the movie I'm about to discuss. This is not a bad sequel. It's a bad one, one that is still just as good, if not better than the original. If I had to pick a movie from this genre to see again, this is the one. ___________________________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________ __________________________________________  "I saw it again for the first time on TV and couldn't believe the performance and the story. The whole thing just wasn't believable. This is a very bad film that should never have been made." -Pauline A. Ritchey  _____________________________________________________________________________  This movie is a complete joke and a waste of everyone's time. This movie is about the last days of a guy who lived in a small town in Indiana. He went to work one day to be a handyman. His job was to fix a leaky roof. He didn't have much experience and didn't know what to do. He had a friend who was a mechanic. His friend told him that they were doing some work and could fix the roof. The guy had never been in the business. He was so nervous that he never did anything until he went to the roof and saw that the work had been done. The next morning, he got up early to go home. The neighbor was still there and was fixing the roof when the guy came by. He asked the neighbor if he could help. The person at the door was an old lady who told him he couldn't fix the leaks on the roof because the guy was a criminal. He then asked the old lady if he was a thief. The old lady said no. The man went home and told his boss what happened. The boss then fired the guy. The following day, the guy comes back to the boss's house and tells him that the guy had been arrested and he was sorry he had to do that. The Boss tells him to go to his place and fix the leaky roofs there. The kid didn't think he could do it so he goes to the neighbor's house. The two guys are there and the neighbor is working on the leak. The friend is sitting on a ladder trying to get the guy to come over. The owner of the house says "It's not your job to go over there, get him out of there and fix his own roof". The neighbor comes out and says that he didn't see the guy do anything wrong and that he was just fixing the leak at the time. The guys then leave. After they leave the neighbor goes to his own house and asks his son if he knows where the guys were. He says "I don't know". He goes to bed. The morning comes and the guy is still at the neighbor house. He

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. It's a good idea for a film, but it doesn't work because there is too much exposition. The director, for some reason, tries to make the film a thriller. It doesn't make any sense. The characters have no depth, the plot is confusing and the dialogue is not natural. I had to read the credits and there was no explanation for why the person in the suit is a man. And why the suits in the beginning of the movie are white and later are black. Why the man's hands are white at the beginning and later become black? I could go on and on. This is a movie you should avoid.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  The way the script works is that it just keeps on turning, turning, flipping around. You know, there's this guy named Jax, he's an ex-con, he works for a drug lord named Marsellus Wallace and he's on a mission to take down Marsellu. There's a lot of violence in this movie and some people might say that it's a little heavy-handed. But I don't think that's what this movie's about at all. It's just this guy with a heart of gold and he goes after his enemy. It makes me want to see more of this guy. It could have been a little better, but that's why it's called a horror movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________   "This movie has everything that makes me cringe. This movie has one of the worst opening and ending sequences in movie history. This is one of those movies that I hate to see again, but I always try to watch it when I have a long day. I never want to see this movie again. I always end up feeling like a total loser because of it. It was a terrible movie and a waste of time. The acting was terrible and the storyline was stupid. It had a lot of cliches in it. A woman was forced into a sex situation because she was being held hostage by her husband. She was a virgin and the guy had a big cock. The guy was a horrible actor. He should have never been cast in that movie. The story of the guy's family and his sister and how he had to leave her behind is so stupid. Why? The movie was so bad that it was a good movie. If I was to take out anything about this movie it would be the sex scenes. The only sex scenes were a girl getting fucked and then a man getting fucked. If they were not such bad sex scenes then I would give this movie a higher rating.   This movie had the worst soundtrack ever. I remember it when it came out and I listened to it every day. Now it sounds like a bunch of old men sitting around playing pool. The music was bad. It sounded like some guy in the 70's was in the band. The whole movie had some sort of soundtrack, but it was horrible. The voice acting was bad as well. The main character's voice was annoying. It reminded me of an old man. He sounded like he was in his 60's. The ending theme was awful as well, and made me want to run out of the theater. I couldn't stand it."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________   1. The ending is so bad, you can feel the writers desperation as they write the last scene.   2. It is a remake of the "Fantastic Four" movie that was made for a different time.  ,  3. It should have been called "Fucking F***ing Fantastic Four".   4. The actors are so terrible, it is as if they don't care about the script.   of all the actors in this movie, one of the worst is Michael Rooker who plays the villain "Mr. Sinister" in this film. This guy is a really bad guy, so bad that he would not want to get a tattoo of his face on his neck. He also talks like an old man. I am so disappointed that a movie with so much potential, is so terrible.   the only good thing about this movie is that it has a sequel, but I have no idea how that movie will be better.   is a movie that is so incredibly bad, that the only thing that is good about it is that you can watch it again and laugh at how bad it is.The only thing to be said is that I hope that you never watch this movie again. I really don't know why it is considered a great movie, but this movie will give you the most nightmares that you will ever have.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: or a bad film, it is easy to come up with an excuse for it: __________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________  3 out of 5 stars  Rene Russo, the star of "Rene' s Revenge," seems to be one of the few film actors in the world who actually takes his acting seriously. But when his film is bad, he just can't keep it together, and it is just a bad idea. In the opening scene, he does a great job of portraying the character of Rene Russo. As Rene, he is just as intense as he is in the original. He is a tough old cat who just wants to go back to his wife and children in New York, where he is a successful attorney. But he is no good at lying. He lies all the time. Rene was a professional thief before the war, and he has no love for the Nazis. He also loves his children. He wants to get them out of Europe, but it is too late. The Nazis have them, and now he is being taken to Germany. RENE is a good guy, but he has to be punished.  "Rene's Revenge" is a terrible movie, and Rene is the only person in it who does not know it. He has to work hard to pretend that he does not care about his family. He does all the wrong things to get the money to go to Germany, and when he is there, he tries to kill the Nazi. He gets caught and is tortured. The way he acts is so bad that he is almost funny. His wife, a woman who is supposed to love him and make him happy, is so scared of him that she tries to murder him in a fit of rage. Then there is his son, Rene Jr. His son wants to do the right thing. But his father is a psychopath. He even makes Rene's son take a hit for him. ,  If this movie were made by a real gangster and it had Rene in it, he would have been a very nice person. But it is made by someone else. Ronde Russo is a character who is made to appear real. He was a bad man who wanted to do something good for his family, but his family was not there.  and,  the only thing that "Renes Revenge" really has going for it is that there is a really good scene in
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________ A few weeks ago I went to a movie with a friend. He liked it and asked if I wanted to go with him to the next one. I said yes. We drove there and he started to tell me about his favorite film. He talked about "The Wizard of Oz" and how the movie was about how an old man tries to escape from the evil witch who keeps bringing him bad luck. I asked him if he knew about the song, "The Witches Brew" and he said he didn't, but I did. I explained that the movie is about a witch who is trying to destroy a town, and that the evil witches are a bunch of witches trying to get revenge on the town. Then he stopped and said that there are no witches in this movie. I thought he was joking, but then he continued to talk about the movie and said he liked the song "The witches brew" and the film. The rest of the night I was feeling kind of bad. I'm not a big fan of horror films but I don't think I've ever seen a film so bad. My friend thought the movie didn't make sense. I have to admit I thought the same thing. The Witch is an extremely dull film, but even worse than that is how it makes me feel. This is not a good movie. This movie is the worst film I have ever seen. It makes me want to cry. The story is pretty bad, the acting is bad, and the music is awful. The acting was pretty bad as well. The movie makes you feel sick. It is not funny. It doesn't even try. The only redeeming factor is the music, which is amazing. The music alone makes this film worth a watch. The witch doesn't seem evil in this film. She's a woman, and it's obvious she's trying to help a man, but the town and her neighbors don't seem to give a damn about the man. They think he is a bad person and they don't give him a chance. The townspeople are all trying to kill him. They even call the sheriff, the guy who arrested the old man. He says he has seen nothing but good in this man, and they just want him to go away. Then the movie goes to a point where the man is trying desperately to get the witch to leave him alone. He asks the witch for help, and she says that she will leave him be, but he
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Don't tell me I'm being too harsh.  This movie is actually really fun.    This movie does not give any indication that it's about to start a real "battleship" scenario.  They're not even talking about a battle.  This is more like a movie set in the 19th century and the battleship crew is a bunch of old-timers.  The "battledome" scenes are just silly and have no connection to anything.  You'll think it's a really boring movie, and then it's not until the last 20 minutes that it starts getting good.  And the last 30 minutes are a lot of fun.

John Wayne as a cowboy, John as a character. The film begins with a "pre-credits" montage that shows the movie set, and that the main cast is on stage at a movie theatre. There is a long dialogue with a very nice song. After the song is over, the movie begins. The movie is pretty decent. The acting is very good. The cinematography is good. However, John is the main character of the movie. John does a pretty good job, but the main problem with the movie is the plot. The plot is weak. The character development is very poor.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ I found the movie "Mystic Pizza" to be a good movie, but it's too bad it wasn't better. I would like to see this movie for a sequel, but I think the script needed to be more polished. The plot was interesting. The acting was great. The story was intriguing. But it wasn´t very funny. I guess it was because it was a comedy. This is one of the most boring movies I've seen. I thought the director should have added more comedy to it. The ending was so dumb. I think if the movie was more entertaining, it would have been better. The actors were great and they were funny in the movie. But they should have made the movie better. And then I have to wonder, if the actors had been in a comedy movie they would have performed much better. "Mystical Pizza" is one bad movie. The only thing that kept it from being an 11 is that it has a funny ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________  It's not the quality that's the problem, but the execution. I love movies, and I love horror movies, but this movie has a way of making me feel like I'm going to throw up when I watch it. It's not just the plot, or the acting, or even the characters. It just makes me feel really ill and I'm so glad I have no nausea.  If you've never seen a movie where the characters are talking in the dark, where the camera is being used as a camera, and where the sound is constantly muffled, then you probably shouldn't watch this movie. The only thing that kept me watching was the premise. It was so good, it made me want to scream. If you have watched "Scream" then you will get a feel for what this movie is all about. , as a horror movie, it is not very good. However, as the movie is about a group of friends who go to a haunted house, you can feel the tension and fear that's in the air. The acting is okay, the special effects are amazing, and the music is not bad. The plot is not too complicated and the ending is just weird. It really doesn't fit into the genre. However if you like horror movies that aren't great, then this movie will make you feel like you're going to vomit.

If your film is a real gem, it will stay with you for years. If not, it'll be forgotten and soon forgotten too.    If you see a movie that's not a real good film, it means that the film doesn't make you think about what happened in the story, it makes you think of something else.   This movie has an interesting plot, but it doesn't get you thinking about the plot. The acting was good, but there's nothing to write about. The music is good, although I don't think it was all that memorable. The story is interesting, but again it didn't make me think about the story much.   in short, this movie doesn't have a lot going for it. The actors did their best, but unfortunately the story didn't do it any justice.     I guess that I can't write a good review about this movie. It's just not a good one. If I would recommend it, I would say that it's a good thriller, but I would definitely avoid this movie for that.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ This movie has so much potential, it has a great plot, but it just doesn't get the message across. The main character (Holly) is so uneducated, I feel like she just learned a bunch of facts about the war, but I couldn't relate to any of her feelings because I'm not the main character. Holly doesn't really have any real friends, but they all seem like they're trying to help her out. However, she has a crush on a guy named Ben, but she doesn't want to date him, she just wants to sleep with him. I feel that this movie is a pretty good example of a girl being forced to do something she doesn' t want to do, but because her brother has a high school reunion, she ends up sleeping with him and getting herself arrested for sleeping with a guy who's not even her boyfriend. It was like she didn't want her brother to know what happened because he'd be so pissed off, so she decided to sleep around with random people and get herself arrested. It's so hard to tell if Holly is a naive, naïve little girl or if she's really naive and stupid. This movie is about the girls who are forced to go to war and then have to live with what they've done. I felt like I was watching a drama and not really being a girl. Holly's friend who is named Katie gets a job in the police force and tells her that the guys who do this kind of work are bad, and they don't want a girl like Holly who can get away with stuff like that. She makes it clear that they don' t like a girl that can get herself in so much trouble, and I thought that was a really nice touch because I feel a lot of people are scared of doing stuff that is illegal. This film made me feel that we should never let our emotions get the best of us. We should always be on our best behavior and be on the straight and narrow. I don't know if it was a good idea for the main characters to go on this trip and I don' think that the movie really needed that much backstory. The other girls are just there to be background noise. It really doesn't make sense why Holly was arrested, but that's just my opinion. I'm pretty sure that I would have loved to see her experience a real war, because she could have done something to help people. It would have made this movie way more entertaining
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  A movie is either a good movie or a bad one, you can't really call it a "movie" as a concept, since it's more like a series of short stories told in a certain order, or like a painting, a picture that was done by a certain artist but it's a bad artist. __________   The story:   "The movie follows a group of friends who go to a secluded cabin for a summer getaway, when a strange and mysterious incident occurs. They encounter a girl who is missing her left eye, a girl that turns out to be very strong, and a girl with an extremely strange voice that comes out of nowhere and attacks them. ______________________________________________________   It's just a bad, terrible movie, and I don't even know why they thought they could get away with making a movie about a group being attacked by a girl. It's just plain boring. The plot isn't very well written and the story never really moves. You don't learn anything about the characters, except that they have a bad childhood and that they all went to this cabin to spend a summer away from it all. It is just a bunch of bad jokes that are delivered by bad acting and bad dialogue. It takes so long to get to a point that it is ridiculous to be making fun of it. The dialogue is just as bad. There is a kid in it named Jenny (I'm not even going to tell you what she does) and she just spouts out a bunch more nonsense every few seconds and makes them sound like she's 15. __________________  "I have always wanted to be a star, I have always dreamt of being an actress, I always dream of having a career that could make me the top of the Hollywood, the top... well I guess I never will be, because it's my nature to want to make money and that's what I'm here to do, I just want to be famous. I just wanna be famous so that I could buy my mom a house and a car, so that my sister could have a nice boyfriend and so that the police could arrest me when I'm found in a bar and I look like a bimbo.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ This is my first attempt at a review of a movie. The movie I watched is the last film by director James Wan. It was not that good, but I thought it was a very interesting and unique film. It has many strange and different ideas in it, but it's really hard to explain to somebody who doesn't know what it is. The acting is really bad. The story is just a bad one. I think it was supposed to be a psychological horror movie, but there are many times when I think there was a good story, but the director just can't do it. It's very interesting to watch, but not really good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This is an abomination!"  - Michael Shermer, the founder of Skeptics Society, in response to "The Last Temptation of Christ" (1973).  I wonder what Michael thinks of this film today, given that he himself is now a self-described "skeptical" person, and is not a believer.  (I guess I am not a "skeptic" either!)  A film that made an enormous amount of money (the budget was $4 million) and was a smash at the box office, and still managed to be a flop with critics.     In the end, I found the "Christian movie" to be just as bad as its "atheist movie."   It was bad because it was poorly acted, and badly written.  The actors and actresses (who all were Christian ministers) all had bad habits that I didn't see in my own pastor.  I have seen other ministers who were better actors and better actors than the actors in this movie.  In the end this film was really just about "being a Christian."  There were many "Christian" elements in the movie (like the preacher, who said "I am the true Christian. I am the most Christian man on earth. I have nothing to hide") and that was the whole point.  What really hurt me was that I felt like I was in a cult.  This movie was so ridiculous that I was actually sick to my stomach, but I was even more sick when I heard some of the songs the actors sang.  As far as the "belief" of this movie, I don't believe that this movie is really about anything other than a bunch of people acting like a buncha crazy people.  Even though this movie does contain a lot of "Christian," it also contains a lot "atheistic" and "science" themes.  One of the "songs" they sing in this film: "How can a man be saved from hell when he's dead?"   I believe that people can be saved if they believe in God and if they live a life of virtue and love. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ I think you have to be able to handle a negative. __________ I would have been much better off if I had stayed at home and watched a movie. ______________________________ I don't understand. __________________ ______________________  I have seen this movie many times over the years. It is a "movie". The main characters, who are all white, seem to know nothing about what it is to be black. There is no black person in this movie. The movie's main point is that a black man is arrested for the murder of a white woman. The main black character, played by John Travolta, is then sentenced to die in a white jail. The only black people that appear in this film are in the background and the audience never sees them. The film ends with a scene in which the white jail guard tells the main black characters that they are free to go. He then walks away from the camera as if he has just seen a ghost. The entire movie is one long montage of scenes of black people in a room with a black person. The scenes in this montage are all in black and white, so that the viewer can see the black people as if they are not there. The last scene in this scene shows the main character standing in the middle of the room with his back to the audience. This scene is so long that it cuts off before it ends. The audience never has a chance to see him. He never moves a muscle. He just stands there. This is not a movie about racism. It's a movie of a black character's trial. There are no black people who testify in this trial. The black character never says a word. He is only there to give the jury a black witness. He has nothing to say. The jury sees the black character and decides he is a liar. The trial was so bad that the court decided that all black people are guilty. They can't all be lying. The jurors are allowed to kill any black person they find guilty. The final scene in the movie is that of the main white character walking away from a white person. He says, "I will see you in hell." The only way the audience can believe this white person is saying this is because he is not in a prison cell. The real trial took place in a courtroom, with black and whites. The characters in this show were the actors. It was all a stunt to create an audience reaction to

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I hate this movie, I wish I could give it zero stars. The writing was so horrible, and it was just plain terrible. The acting was atrocious. The plot was so bad that it was very hard to follow. The characters were so shallow, and the writing was such a mess that you would not want to watch it." The plot is that a group of scientists is being followed by a group that wants to take over the world. They are also being followed.  The main character is an evil alien that wants the Earth for himself. He is being hunted by the good guys, who are fighting for their lives.    The movie ends with the main character, a villain, being shot by a man.  The plot of this movie is pretty stupid and makes absolutely no sense.  The aliens don't want the Earth, they just want to control it and use it for their own evil purposes. This movie was horrible. The bad acting and the bad writing make this one of the worst films ever made. I highly recommend it to no one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "If I could rate this movie one star I would." It has no good parts, no bad parts, just a bunch of bad movies. The story: A man, who was working for a big corporation, finds that he has been infected by a virus that has been released in the city of Miami. He is now being stalked by a killer. He has to figure out a way to protect himself and save his family from a horrible fate. It is one of those movies that makes you wonder why people even bother to make movies. There is not a whole lot going on. The movie takes a few minutes to get into the action and then it gets stuck in the middle of nowhere. This makes it seem like there is no reason to watch this movie. I think this movie is a waste of money and time. I will not be watching this movie again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not a bad film at all, but it has a lot of problems, and it's really bad in terms of story.  The plot revolves around a man named Michael, a former policeman, who has been convicted of murdering his wife. He has no hope of getting out of prison, and he is going to get what he deserves. Michael is a good guy, and the people he meets on the way to prison are people who are just as evil as he is, so the movie doesn't really have a point.  It's just a bunch of scenes, and some really bad acting.  Also, a bunch (but not all) of the scenes are filmed backwards.  So if you're a fan of Michael J. Fox, you're going to hate this movie.  But it's not very good, and you can find a better film that does this scene better.  And I'm not a Fox fan, but this scene was not as bad as some of the other bad scenes in this movie, so it's kind of a good thing that the movie was so bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. If I'd had a second to think about it, I'd have written a review for the movie. But I didn't have time to think, so I didn. If you are interested in an entertaining movie, and not a bad one, read the book and then watch the movie, it's a lot of fun. It's an amazing film, and it really shows how much a good story can change someone.   It's hard to be positive about a movie, especially when it comes to movies that were made in the 1950s and 60s. The movies are usually made for children, so it's very hard for children to understand. But this is a movie that was made in 1966, and in 1966 the only kids who could understand it were in the late 60s and early 70s, and even then they had difficulty understanding the characters and the dialogue.     The story starts out with a very simple premise: a young boy has an accident in the forest and is taken by a strange man. The boy learns that the man is a wizard, and the man takes him to a castle where he will be trained as a wizard. He then learns how to become a wizard himself.   a young man, a wizard named Roger, is asked by his uncle to find the boy's friend. Roger finds Roger, and learns that Roger has been in a forest, and that the boy had been in an accident. When he gets to the forest, he sees that it's been ruined by the wizard, but he doesn't know how to get out.   "It's just a trick. You're not going to get home."   Roger goes to a wizard who is helping a man who is having a stroke. The man doesn't remember who he is, and he can't remember his name. The wizard tells him that he is "The Wizard of the Forest", and the boy says that he's not going home.  , it really is just a simple story, but the fact that it is so simple is what makes it so good. You could almost see it as a children's story with a few adults thrown in.   of course, this movie is about a wizard and a wizard training a young wizard. I'm not sure why people think it's about the boy and the wizard training the boy.  's a nice little movie, but I'm surprised that the critics didn't love it. It isn't a bad film, but

It's not very good and I really don't want to watch it again. I was watching it with my parents and I was crying during some scenes. There is no plot so it makes no sense. I think this movie was just made for children.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ Write a positive review about an okay movie:____________  It's the end of the road.   That's how I felt watching the last 10 minutes of "The Dark Knight Rises". I thought I'd seen it all, and for the most part I was right. I liked the book, I enjoyed the movie. But it wasn't as good as I'd expected, and the ending was the most disappointing part.   "The End" felt like the end to a trilogy. There were hints of it before, but not until the last ten minutes. In the end, the film had me feeling a little betrayed.   and the final words of the last screenwriter (who I have no idea) are a great reminder of that.     And then there is the Joker. What the hell was he up to?  "It is all very well to kill off the Joker and the rest of the gang, but they'll never be able to match the impact of a Harley Quinn solo adventure. That's the thing. Harley's got her own world, her own rules. She has her own agenda. She's got a sense of humour, and she's a lot smarter than you think. She could outsmart the Joker, or she could make him pay for it."   What a dumb and annoying idea.  .  . .

The other part is that when the girl goes to bed with the guy, and the guy goes to sleep, the girl says she wants to make him cum. He does. It's a little bit weird, but it's also kind of sweet. I hope they do it more in the future. I think they need to make it more exciting. It would be a great movie if they added something like a car chase.

It is not good acting, it is a horrible film with bad acting, which makes it a terrible film. I was laughing my ass off as I was watching this film. It makes you feel sick and it makes you want to vomit. It made me want to run away from the theater and not go in to see the film. This film is so bad that I will never see it again. This should have been an R-rated movie. There are many, many sex scenes, and some of them are very graphic and show no restraint. If this film had been rated R, this would have been a R-rating. This was a disgrace to the movies and to the entire movie industry. The people behind this film should be arrested. I am sure that if they were arrested, they would get a stiffer sentence than the director and producer who are going to be sent to prison. I can't believe how many people have seen this film and how many have hated it. I wish I had never seen this movie.

I remember a lot of the actors in the movie had really weird accents, and the director, Robert Aldrich, was a really bad director and it was really hard to get into it because of that. This is probably the most ridiculous movie I've ever seen. The only reason I give it a 3 stars instead of 4 is because the movie is so cheesy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Why? Well, because movies are a reflection of our lives. The bad ones tend to reflect our own life in general, the good ones tend not to. We all want a good story, a good action sequence, and a good hero. A good villain can be just as important. But, that's not all, the bad ones also have to be bad for us. It has to be so much worse than we thought it was going to be. I can only think of one movie that's ever made me want to quit my job because of the bad guy. That's why I love this series, because it's not like the others. They're always so much better than we could have ever imagined. And the bad guys in this series are really good. It's really a shame that they don't make more of them. I'm glad that there's one more, just to remind us how great they are.Read full review

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie that I can't stand.  I know it's bad, and the people who made this movie will likely see it, but it's so poorly done and poorly acted, that I will be forced to watch it just to laugh at it.  The movie is about a group of kids in the 1970s who are having a bad time in a park and decide to go on a walk to blow off steam.  The walk leads them to a lake with a boat and some kids who are actually the main characters from a different movie.  Once on the lake, they start throwing rocks at each other, and then the kids go to the top of a mountain and start throwing their rocks at the lake.  As the movie progresses, more and more kids get involved in the throwing, until they eventually start shooting rocks at a bunch of other kids, and at the end, it turns out that one of the kids was actually a guy named James, who in the movie played a character called James Bond, and was in a different James Bond movie. James Bond doesn't have a real character in the book, but I guess they figured that it was too much to ask for a real James Bond to appear in this movie.   So I'll just let you decide if you like it or not.   It was an okay movie, but not great.  My wife and I really enjoyed it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________  1/10  I've had my eye on this movie since the previews and it looks like a complete and utter disaster. The acting is bad, the plot is horrible, and the acting is also bad. There are two actors in the movie that are both in their 50s. There is an old man who is supposed to be dead, and a woman who is supposedly his granddaughter. The only two people who are in their 20s are the actors. I guess it's supposed to look like they are younger, but it just looks old. There were many scenes that had me laughing and the director is a very bad actor.  It's supposed that this movie is about a "rebel" from a secret military program who kills a "lover" of a man who was the director. The rebel tries to take over the world and all of the military bases are on fire, and they are all trying to get to the rebels so that they can kill them. , and is a man in his 20s who goes to war to avenge his dead girlfriend. The plot is a complete disaster. I don't know what the hell happened, but this movie has all the trappings of a disaster movie. The actors are terrible, the directing is terrible, and even the plot itself is completely ridiculous.  the plot revolves around a group of rebels who go around killing soldiers and civilians, and this is supposed a secret war program. This war program has a leader named Dr. Eureka, and he is supposed be the leader of a secret program. In the first half of the movie he is trying to capture a scientist named "Doomer", who is the director of a military program, who is trying and failing to get his hands on a weapon that is supposedly used to destroy cities. I'm sorry to say, but I had to look up this movie because I'm a dumbass and didn't really get it. The scientist that Doomer is supposed the be working with is named "Hawk", and he has a "love" for Eurekka. The love interest for Doomer, who you don't even realize is his wife, is a woman named "Sara". The first half is the "plot" that I mentioned. The rebels are killing people and blowing things up, and it's up to Hawk and Eurekan to stop them. It's a terrible plot that is really just an excuse to

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you don't like it, you have no right to complain about it.  I'll give a disclaimer, this movie wasn't bad.  It was okay, but it was nothing special.  It was good for a little while, but then it just kind of... disappeared.  This was a movie that was kind of a cross between The Goonies and The Matrix.  I found this movie quite interesting.  The story is simple, and the movie was good at showing a young boy who is in the wrong place at the wrong time.  At first I was really interested, but I just wasn't into the movie.  When the plot got a bit more interesting it wasn't long before the movie just kind disintegrated.  In the end it's just a bad sequel.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________  The first time I saw it I was a bit confused by the first scene with the police, a police officer is shot, and the film is over in a flash. But, I didn't mind, it was cool and different, and I'm sure some people will like it. The rest of the movie was pretty great, there's some action, some humor, and some beautiful acting. The music and soundtrack was very nice as well, I liked the score. The only thing I didn  I love the movie, and it was fun to watch. But I felt that the ending didn't make sense, and they made the film feel like they were making a comedy, but that's not what it was about, the movie should be more serious. But the film was pretty funny. I was surprised when they showed the scene where the cop was shot, he seemed really dead, but he was fine after. I liked that they used a helicopter in the film, it gave the movie a great sense of realism. The movie was very good, it had some interesting and well acted scenes. I would recommend this movie to anyone who liked the first one.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ (What is wrong with you?)  I've seen a lot of terrible movies. This one is one of the worst. The film has a story that is told poorly. It starts off with a guy who has a strange obsession with the film "The Exorcist". We see the man who is in the movie and it is actually pretty good. He's a decent guy. He is married with kids and he gets a job as a janitor in the film. He finds out that the film is a hoax and that it is made up by a man named Charles Lee Ray. He meets Ray and they have a battle over the film, but Ray kills Lee Ray and takes his wife and kids. The man wants to see the film but the wife won't let him and then the man is shot and dies. The woman is traumatized by the death of her husband and is going to kill herself. She sees her son and tries to convince him to stay with her. The son refuses and leaves home. The guy is a real creep and has a lot going on. The movie doesn't start out well, but it gets worse and worse and you don't want to see it. There are some really bad effects. It was made in the 80's. It's really bad. It makes me want to never watch another movie like this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ This movie was horrible. I don't like horror and this is not a good movie. I was watching it at a friends house and it just wasn't my cup of tea. The acting was pretty bad and the story was really weak. I mean they had a guy that went in there and killed his girlfriend, and that's it. I just found that pretty boring and not something I would want to see. If you don't mind watching a guy murder his girlfriend and there is a little bit of a twist, then this movie is worth a watch. If not, don't watch it. If I had a dollar for every time I saw this movie, I would have at least $2,000.

The plot was horrible...and they used a lot of the old Star Trek footage in this movie. But they should have just cut out all the crap and just made a movie about the original cast. They did this movie so badly that I'm not even going to bother re-watching it. There is no way I will watch this film again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is about a boy named Max and his best friend who is named Alice, who is just as dumb and naive as Max is. Alice is obsessed with animals and Max and he and his friend were always trying to make them come to the surface. However, they never succeeded in their efforts and they have to find the hidden animal that they can keep hidden. The movie also has a cute character named Max's girlfriend who was the first friend that Max made in the movie. The main plot of the movie was to get the animal, which is called "Nepenthes" back. However there was a lot of problems in the story. The biggest problem was the fact that the main characters never did anything good in the whole movie. They were always just there for no reason, except for being there. Also, the movie did not give the characters much depth. I was not really interested in the main character, Max, and I don't really care about Alice. I think that the only good thing that I can say about the movie is that I got to see a funny and cute animal movie. There were also some funny scenes in the end, but that was it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________ [SPOILERS] You see, as soon as the story starts, I was worried about what would happen to him. In fact, the whole first half of the movie was a mess. I mean, the first 30 minutes were like this: You see a bunch of kids in a bunch houses. You're like, "Heeey, kids, let's play a game of hide and seek." It doesn't get much more confusing than that. Then you see some kind of explosion, and there's some kind a guy on fire. You see that guy, and he's running for his life. He runs into a guy. The guy is wearing a mask. Then the guy gets up and goes "Hey, what's up?" And the guy turns around and shoots the guy. Then there's another guy, the same guy, but he's got a different mask. The first guy shoots the second guy, who turns around to shoot the third guy. He shoots the third dude, and then the guy who shot the guy walks out of the explosion. The dude who just shot the second dude walks out into the street. He doesn't look happy. And the dude who shot him is still standing in the street, and all the other guys are running after him. The story continues this way, with a bunch more people dying, and more of the kids running. By the time we get to the end, the dude is dead, but the other guy's not. He's gone. The girl who was supposed to be the love interest is dead. The other guy has been transformed into a human fireball. He turns into a big ball of fire. There's a girl who's still in a coma. She has a mask on, and her eyes are red. It's all very confusing, but it was pretty funny. The movie does have some really great music, too. There was this song that really stuck out in my head: it was this really creepy one by The Cure called "You've Got A Friend." I guess they didn't use it in the movie, but there was a scene where the guy's brother came up to him, and his brother says, "I've got a message for you from my brother." And he says, "'Hey, you've got to come to my house right now.' So they go to his house, and it's just this room with a table and a chair, and the TV's on, with

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  There are movies that I loved, and movies that left me cold. It's like I'm trying to understand something. I don't know what it is. I can't explain it. It makes no sense. But what I can say is that if you are going to go see a bad film, I suggest you don't go see "It". I know a lot of people love it. And that's great, but that's just not me. I wasn't going to see it, and then the trailer came out and I knew I had to see the movie. I think that's part of the problem. The trailer is so great, and it has so much promise, but then after it's over, it doesn't seem like anything happened. The characters are so flat and uninteresting. The acting is so poor. And then the ending, well, that's the end. It just doesn't matter. This movie makes no real sense, and the characters are just so flat. If I was a parent, I would leave the theater.

He is also a great cook, he can cook anything from a burger to a steak and everything in between. The film was not that great, it wasn't that good. But, at least it had great characters. The cast was amazing and there was an amazing soundtrack. This was a very funny movie. The movie has a lot of great moments. This is a movie that will keep you laughing and smiling for the whole time. The story was great. It was great to see how a man is going to be able to get by without his father in this time of war. The end of the movie was pretty good. I really enjoyed this movie. It wasn't as good as it could have been but it was still entertaining and made me laugh.

I liked the idea, the character development, and the direction. I was very intrigued with the way it was put together. The movie is really well put together, with many interesting things going on. The plot is not very original, but is a very well thought out and well paced movie. The action is very good and is one of the better action movies ever made. The only complaint that I have is the lack of a sequel. I would have liked to see a sequel as well. ****** (10 out of 10) - I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good action movie with a good story. It's a great way to see some of the action scenes from the films that influenced it, as well as some of your favorite actors.

It's like a horrible video game that you play in your mind. The only reason I watched this is because I was bored so I was just going to watch some anime. If I had the option to just watch something else, I probably would have watched something else. The characters in this movie are horrible and the story is awful.

A New Way to Play ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ You can choose a number of different ways to play this game. There are a total of 16 ways to do this: * Play with all the power-ups you have. You can also go for an all-kill, by going for as many times as possible. * Play on a difficult setting. This is the hardest setting, and there are many traps in this level. * Finish off as fast as you can. This can be done by picking up all power-up you find. * Use the power of your bombs. If you don't have any, you can use a bomb to knock out a group of enemies. * Go for a full-kill. This means you have to kill all enemies in a row, without missing a single one. * Try the Hard mode. You will get a higher score and the enemies will be tougher. * Keep going. If the level is too hard, try to play it in Easy mode. This will also make the enemies easier to kill. * Complete the level as fast you can (without dying). If you die, you will have to restart the level, which is not very difficult. * Take a nap. * Check your health. You are only allowed to use 1 power-UP in this game, so make sure you use it right away! * Pick up all of the powerups. You have to do a lot of jumping in this stage. * Pick any power-Ups you find (or get them from a power-Up Box). * Get a good head start. You don't get a score at the end of this stage, but you can get a good time by jumping very quickly. * Get the fastest time. You need to go for the maximum time. * Don't stop.

It has some great moments and some truly awful ones, and they are all together in this movie. A couple of the actors do well and even some of the other actors do not, but they are in there for no reason. It's an utter failure and not worth watching. I just want to go to the beach and forget about it. I was hoping for a more action-oriented movie but that's not the case. It has too much stuff going on and it takes a long time to get anywhere. I feel like the movie is in the same vein as "Tron 2" where it's just not funny. It doesn't even make sense at times. I guess they thought they would make a good movie but they did not. I would never recommend this movie to anyone and I would not recommend it to anyone else either.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________  My brother had a great time at this movie. It was like watching a movie version of "It's a Wonderful Life" for a day or two. It's funny, it's touching, it does have some funny lines, but nothing that made it too much of a "WTF" movie. The ending was the best part of the movie. You know, it was really nice to watch something like that, and it really makes you feel for all the kids that get caught up in it. The acting was good too. Everyone did their job. It doesn't have any super dramatic moments, so it doesn't overstay its welcome. I really did enjoy this movie a lot. It made me think of how many times I would have been there, in the same room, if the movie was made today. I think it's a good movie to have a laugh at, if you can, and for people to look at for a good laugh.  The Score: 6/10  Advertisements

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  If you want to give a movie a bad review, write it on the back of a cereal box. That's how it went for the first five or six hours of "The Great Gatsby." I thought it was going to be one of those "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" re-hashes that the internet always talks about, but then I saw the credits. I couldn't believe that "B" director David Fincher had left behind the original screenplay by Harper Lee and had gone off on his own. I remember the first time I read the book, I was confused as to what the plot was. I had no idea that the novel had a happy ending. But I wasn't going to give it a bad score because I was so excited to see this movie. Then the movie opened and I saw that Finchero had changed the ending. The first time around, the characters were all happy and in love with one another. It was as if Finche and Lee had been friends for years and that's how they had written the novel. The film changed it all. The characters all had terrible relationships with one person. It didn't even make sense. And when it came time to reveal who it was, I still didn't know. I guess they had an idea for a good ending, but they didn't think it through. I think the best way to describe "The Gatsbys" is "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective." I've always felt that the movie is a terrible parody of a Hollywood movie. The movie takes place in the 1950s. The Gatsbombs are played by the same actors who played the "Aces" in "Aquaman" (and a bunch of other movies), and they were all just played by people who had a little more acting ability than they had in real life. I'm sure Finchem has some good ideas about how to tell a story, but he's not a good writer. He just doesn't know how to make a good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To: <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/author/josh_carter/">Josh Carney</a> <<a href=3D"mailto:josh.carter@seattlegazette.com">josh@seattleweekly.com</a>><br>  Dear Josh, I just saw "Bourne Identity." I was a bit shocked by the ending. This is a good movie, but I was shocked by how the ending played out. If you look at the scene where Kevin Costner's character, Bourne, is running through the city looking for some terrorist to kill, and he sees this girl running in the street and is scared. She's holding a baby and is just going to give the baby to her mother. But then he gets to her house, and her mom's in the kitchen cooking dinner, and then she's on the floor crying. I thought that was the ending, but it's not. What happens next is that he goes to her home and the daughter is gone, and she doesn't answer the door. She tells him she's not home, and that's when he says he'll be back. And then he goes on the run. The end. What I don't get is how a movie like this can have a great ending and then not follow through with it. I also didn't understand the ending when I was watching. I saw it again a few days ago and noticed the end was different. So, here's the ending I saw. When Bourne's character is on the ground, trying to find her daughter, the girl starts to scream. And Bourne says he will be back, but then he's gone. I don a lot of movies have good endings, but this was one of them. So I don the movie again, and it was just the same. I hope it is better than the first one, and I hope this ending is better. Thanks for the response. Sincerely, James

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ The movie has a lot of problems. I will not even go into the plot details as I think you can read about them on Wikipedia. I can't even tell you how long the movie was. I mean, there are 3 hours in it. You could probably watch this in 3 hours, but not as long as this. The first hour of the movie has nothing to do with anything. It's just a bunch of random scenes and characters who are basically there to be in this one episode. The second hour of this movie is a great thing. It introduces us to the main characters, introduces us a little about the world they live in, and introduces us the plot. The plot is great, it makes you really think about what you are watching. The third hour of your movie should be about the plot, not about the characters. I have seen movies with plot lines that I thought were interesting, but never did I see a movie with a great plot that I would really want to watch. The movie did have a lot to do, but it was not the plot that made it so great. The characters were very well done. I think the actors and actresses did a really good job. They did a good job portraying the characters with their personalities. They played the characters really well. The only thing I did not like about the movie were the songs. The songs were pretty good. The bad thing is that the music didn't really match the scenes. The lyrics were good for the scenes but the music was just really bad. It really made me want to stop watching this movie. It just made me feel bad. Overall I would give this movie a 6/10. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

He's in the hospital, and is getting better with every day. However, his situation doesn't change, as he still needs to find a cure for the plague to save the other survivors. We're then taken back to a scene in a hospital room. We see a woman who is crying, and we hear a nurse talking to the other patients in the room.  of this movie is so far that you feel a lot of emotion from the main characters. There's a lot going on in this movie, but you're still able to keep track of what's happening. The movie is mostly told in flashbacks, but that doesn't stop the plot from moving forward. The pacing is slow, but it works well. . The characters are not that complex. There are no long speeches or long conversations.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________  It's a sad, sad day for Hollywood when a movie is considered bad, even when it has an excellent cast. A movie that deserves to be remembered is "The Magnificent Seven" (1973). This movie was made for $15 million and has a great cast and a great plot. Unfortunately, it wasn't made for everyone. It's an awesome western with great acting and a beautiful story. There are so many awesome scenes and the main characters are very likable. There is a very strong ending that is a must see for anyone who enjoys good movies. It does have some minor issues, but not as many as the majority of Hollywood movies. This is a great movie, but there are other movies out there that are better and a lot more expensive. I would have been happy if it had only been a small part of a trilogy, but the first two movies are great. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves great westerns.

He got a phone call from a customer with a dental bill for $35,000. He had to call the customer to explain that he couldn't do the work and would have to charge him a few hundred dollars extra for his time. After he hung up, he decided to go back to work and his patient was waiting in the lobby.  As soon as he walked in the door, he noticed a guy standing in the hallway staring at him. It was the guy with the $35K dental bill. The dentist asked, "Who is that guy? What do you want?"  He replied, "I want to get a tooth pulled."  After telling him that he could do that, the dentist said, "Okay, but just do it quick.

He's the most unpleasant person I've ever seen. He would give patients a hard time and would not do his job. He was a complete and utter asshole. One time he told a patient that he was a "tough guy" and had to have the teeth pulled. The patient did not like that and said "if that's what it takes, I'll pull them for you" (to which he said "ok, but only one." I asked if there was another option and he said no.) He then gave the patient a hard look and said, "'you should be proud. You're the toughest guy I've seen.". The guy was so mad he ran out of the office. - Anonymous  _____________________________________________   This is a story of a man who was referred to a dentist in the area.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ I was disappointed that the director of this film is just some "cinema student" and not someone who really knew anything about the movie he was making. The film's plot is not bad, but it's too slow, too stupid and too dull to be interesting, and the acting is just stupid. I'm not even kidding. It's like they just got some cheap actors and took them for a walk on the beach, took some pictures and then started to talk to them and pretend to be their friend. They had no idea what they were doing, what they wanted to say and what the story was about. The whole time they were trying to act like they were having a conversation with someone, but the "actor" was just playing some stupid character. At times they were just playing people talking. The acting in the film was really bad. At least they got some good actors to do their "acting". The music in the movie was very uninspired. I found it boring and uninspiring, and I felt bad for the people who made it. The music was all just very generic, and none of the songs had any feeling to them. I have a feeling the director had no clue how to make a music film, but he decided to just go with the idea that "nothing is better than good music". The ending of the film had nothing to do with the story. It just felt like they had to give it a "happy ending". This is a film that should have never been made. It should have been made by someone who actually knew what he was doing. And the fact that it was made by a "cine-student" who didn't even know what he wanted to make is really sad. So, if you want to make something really dumb, then make a film like this. It won't be that good anyway. Don't waste your time with it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst of the worst, I was there, it was terrible. The main villain is a sociopath who was a real douchebag and I just can't believe the writers would do this to their main character. It was like he got the wrong idea of what a hero was. It really was like the whole movie was an attempt to get him to kill himself. It's hard to believe the people working on this film could have done any better. The bad acting was so bad and the dialogue was so cheesy and the plot was so lame. The actors and actresses were really terrible and it was the worst movie of 2016. There is no way this movie was worth the money. A movie like this should be banned from all cinemas: It was just like a cartoon. It had too many stereotypes about people. It took all the bad actors and gave them a bad role. It made the film worse and I was disgusted by the script. It also didn't even make sense. I hated this movie: I felt like it was just an attempt at getting some money to pay for a trip to Thailand and then to Hollywood. It did not deserve that money and it didn't deserve me watching it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________" (or at least that's how I felt about this movie.)  I think I was really expecting something great out of this film, but that is just not the case.  The acting is so-so, the plot is confusing, the pacing is slow, and the plot holes are just too many to list.    If you are looking for a quick popcorn flick, look elsewhere.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. Do not talk about the movie as a whole. If you want to talk about some parts, you can do that, but if you want a good review, you should focus on some specific parts of the movie. For example, don't talk about how the actors looked in a bad way or that the director had no ideas, because they do. If someone has never seen a bad horror movie before, they probably won't understand. They might even say something along the lines of "that's a movie that just makes me want to die." Don't be that person. A movie should be a good experience and you should enjoy it even if the film is bad.

The movie tries to make us sympathize with this guy, but I really can't.  This guy is the worst kind of person.  And that's a pretty bad thing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't know that there were so many bad movies to choose from! "The Bad Guys" (1996) "The Bad Boys" is a remake of the movie "The Biggest Loser" (1992). It stars Sylvester Stallone, Jackie Chan, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Statham and Arnold Schwarzenegger (his first movie role). This is a movie that people claim to have made in one day, but in fact the entire production took about 4 months to complete. It is a Hollywood action movie that features all of the famous Hollywood action stars (except for Arnold Schwarzenegger) and it has a pretty cheesy title. I have to give props to the director for trying to bring in some of the action stars from other movies like "Robocop" (1990) and "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" (1991). The movie was a huge hit. I have to say that I liked this movie a lot. The action is intense and the plot is pretty good. It has some very entertaining scenes and some really good action scenes. The movie is filled with good acting. It was a really good movie and I would like to see it again. If you like this movie: Don't forget to give it a watch, especially if you have never seen it before. It's a good movie that I really like. You can find this movie on:

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ***********This is a movie you don't see very often, but it was a little hard to get into it. The premise is interesting, but there is not much to do in this movie and it ends up being boring. The acting is bad and the plot is also really stupid. The ending was really annoying. There is no reason for the end and it was so abrupt and made me annoyed. Overall this is not a movie to watch. If you want a good action movie, check out the new Robocop.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ***********  I love this movie but it just has the worst acting and writing. This movie is like one big joke. The characters are the most annoying I have ever seen in my life.  The main character is an obnoxious nerd that goes on and on about how he doesn't like anyone. His friend goes on about his love life, and the rest of the movie is a bunch of awkward situations. The only good thing I can say about the movie was that it had a lot of good lines. This was a fun movie but really disappointing because I expected a better movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________.  I'm not one of those guys who only watches bad movies. I also watch a good many good ones, and I think I'm pretty good at judging when a movie is good or bad.  for the record I was a huge fan of the original Star Wars Trilogy. I still am. However, the movies were way overrated and they didn't deserve all the hype they got. The original Star wars was a movie about the struggles of a rebel alliance trying to stop a super powerful and evil empire from dominating the galaxy. If you had read the book it was a little more of a political allegory. I've never read the books, but I do know that George Lucas made changes and additions to them. The movies were much more of the same. The characters were changed, the story changed, and the plot changed. The sequels were all just like the original movies. There wasn't a single plot change or addition. The only thing I thought was really cool about them was that they all got an Oscar nomination for their performances. The thing is that none of the actors were particularly great. They all acted their asses off. Even Hayden Christensen was terrible. The one good thing about them is that some of them were so good that they actually made me care for them. In some ways the new movies were more like the prequels than the original trilogy. They still had the same themes, but the story wasn't as good. It felt like a lot of the ideas and characters that made the original Trilogy work had been left out. It made the new films seem even worse. The good thing is none of them had much of an impact on me. The only thing that made me enjoy them is because I got to see Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford again. I love Carrie Fisher. She's a great actress, and she's still a kick ass actress. She was my favorite character in the original films. I loved the way she was written. Her character was the only one in the first trilogy who had an actual character arc. There was a real reason for her character to go from being a princess to a princess who didn't want to be a princess. I would have loved to have seen that story told. The other two actors were great, but it wasn't the same as Fisher. The role of Han Solo was played by Mark Hammill, who is now in a sitcom called "The Big Bang Theory". I never

I am glad I did though and that it was in fact a decent movie. The story was good and had some good action. However, the story was too long to be enjoyable. The acting was average, and I did not care for all the scenes in which there was no dialogue. It did not give me the feeling that I was in a different time period.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ My rating: **** (out of *****). I didn't want to watch this. __________________________ I got this from a friend. I had no idea what was in it, so I opened it to see what was going on. The first thing I noticed was the terrible dubbing, as if someone had never seen an actual Japanese movie before. The second thing I saw was the weirdest thing I have ever seen. It was a scene from a movie that had the same name as a movie I had never heard of called "Dalmatian" (I've seen it once, and it was very good, but the movie is not the same, so this scene didn't seem like the same movie). The man is running from the police, but he can't stop. When he sees the policeman, he screams. The policeman tries to shoot him, but fails because the guy has an automatic gun. The guy just says "Duck!" and continues running. The man then runs into a house and gets out of the car. A man comes out of a door, grabs the Dalmatian, and starts driving away. The Dalmatians' mother yells at him and tells him not to be stupid. The scene ends. I was not interested. I found this movie to be pretty silly, but it did have some good moments. I'm not sure if I would have seen it if I had known what it was. It's also a little hard to get through, but I guess that's the point. I'd like to see the rest of this movie, but as far as I can tell, it doesn't do much to improve its rating. _________________  T.S.M.I.R.I, October, 1988

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________. _______________________________.  A film about a man in a wheelchair that goes to a casino to see a live performance and ends up in a trap where he's being robbed by a woman. (The woman is played by a very talented actress named Jodie Foster)  The movie takes place in New Orleans, but the movie was shot on location in L.A. in a studio. It's a very fun movie. The main character, Robert, is a guy who's in a very bad way, and I think that's the best thing about the movie. He is a good-hearted person who just happens to be in a bad way. The movie doesn't give you a great amount of information about what the situation is, but it gives you enough information to be able to guess at what's going on. It doesn't tell you everything about the story and the main character but it doesn't make the movie any less fun to watch. -The movie is really funny, but there's no gore. I can't really tell what's happening because I can't see my character, but I can see a lot of people around me in the audience. The theater has a lot more people in it than the theater would have if it was in Lomita, but they seem to be really friendly. There were a lot fewer people in the theater than I would have expected to see, but that's probably because it's not as popular as it should be. The main character is Robert, and he has this disability and a cane. He doesn't know how to use the cane, and his wife doesn't really like him being in a wheel chair. He gets up to see the show, and the woman he's playing with starts to kiss him and he doesn't like that. He tells her to stop, and she says "no." So, they end up going to the casino to play slots. They're going to have a good time, and at first, they have a great time. But they end at a room where they see some guy and they start having sex. So, they start to have sex, and that's when they are trapped in the room. They start to fall in love, and they fall in to a trap. One of the things I didn't like about this movie was that the woman is in love with this guy, but she doesn't have a very good personality, and it

You might think it's a bad thing, but a good movie has an element of suspense that's different than a bad one.  In a bad, you have one-take action scenes with no buildup.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ _____________ This movie is a piece of trash. I could not enjoy it at all. It's boring and bad. I have never seen so many people being hurt by a movie. I'm a fan of the director of the movie, and he is just trying to make a cheap movie and he doesn't have a good idea to make it work. It has the same kind of plot like all those other movies in the genre. It was just so bad. The actors did nothing except for the most annoying characters. They should have done more because they all were terrible. They played so many different characters and you get to know them more. They were all so annoying. There were so many actors, but none of them were able to act properly. It just made it so bad to watch. There was no plot to this movie. There is a woman who is trying to find her daughter who has gone missing, and then she finds that she is kidnapped. I don't know why the girl disappeared. She was so cute. But that was just stupid because you don't get kidnapped. It makes no sense to kidnap someone. That was the most stupid part of the whole movie. The girl was always so excited about her new toy, and when she went to play with it, she just went crazy. It made no sense. It really made no difference. I just couldn't believe that they would do that to a little girl. That made no logical sense. The only thing I can say about the girl was that she was really cute. She would have been a lot more interesting if she had a more interesting story.

Instead, they're based on true events, but in a macabre and gruesome manner. The best known of these movies is Psycho. It is a classic. It's based on a real event that occurred in a small town in Texas in 1960. The town's police chief was found murdered. The murder had been committed with an axe. The film depicts a scene in which a woman in a wheelchair is seen walking through a cemetery. There she is discovered by a man who takes her away from the cemetery. In a short time, the man rapes the woman and kills her. She wakes up in a hospital and discovers that she's been sexually assaulted. She tells the nurse about her encounter. The nurse tells her husband what she has told him, but he doesn't believe her. Later, the husband comes home and tells his wife what he has found. The husband is arrested and brought to trial. During his trial, he is told that his wife is a prostitute. At first, the wife denies the accusation, but after a while, she tells the court that the husband killed her. After the trial, the defendant is found guilty and sentenced to death.   The film Psycho was one of the first of a new type of horror movie that was to come about. It was a satire of the horror genre. The story was about a woman who was raped and murdered by a husband and was later found to be a prostitute, a crime that was committed by the husband and not by her. This type of movie was very different from the usual horror films of the time. It wasn't about monsters or ghosts or even the supernatural. It dealt with real life events that happened in the year 1960.   The movie was released in October of 1960. It became very popular, because it was a satirical movie. The movie's success led to several other movies that were based

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________, I just watched the worst movie ever made, and it was a complete waste of time. It was just a really boring story about a man who has a car accident and goes to a mental hospital. It had a very boring story line, and the acting was bad. The acting was really bad, and I didn't like the way they were trying to make the guy look like he was a psychopath, but they never did. The guy was just too weird to be a good character, and they made him look really weird. The only thing good about the movie was that it had some good songs. I guess the worst thing about the story is that the ending was not really explained and it didn't have a good ending, but I'm sure there's a better way to do it. I don't like horror movies that are just about the character killing the character, but the guy in this movie killed himself, so that's why I don;t like it. If you're not afraid of a boring story, I don' t recommend this movie to you.  Rating: 2 out of 10

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________ *I have no clue what the fuck they were doing with that plot point. Why the fuck did they have to bring up the fact that a girl in the past had a baby without explaining why that baby was in the present? I don't think that they would have had that conversation if it was just about the kid in the future who would be having that kid's baby. * I hate that they tried to force a "real" love story into a story about a kid with a supernatural ability to see the past. If they had just made the movie a movie about a girl who had a kid's past and was also a telepath, that would have been okay, but they took that concept and turned it into a love story about two people who are actually just friends who have this crazy ability that they have. I know that people have this power in some way or another in our society, but why did they make this movie about it? It's a pretty dumb plot point, and it just made me think of the fact you have this special ability in the movie, and how the girl had this power to see people's past, and then the movie took it to an extreme and made it a big deal and put it in the center of the movie. * The opening scene, which is about how the kid is born and how his dad doesn't want him, just made no sense. It felt so fake, and the way they did it just wasn't believable. It was the first scene that really got me thinking that this movie wasn't gonna work. * There was no way that they could have made the girl's father so annoying and creepy. I don.t care about the girl, but that dude just wasn?t going to do anything for her. * It was so annoying that they made her father so angry at her. She was just so naive about this guy that she didn?t even know why she was angry at him. * And the movie never made sense about the fact this guy was an angel, why would he want to kill the baby? It made no logical sense. * A bunch of random angels come and rescue the baby and bring him back to the real world, and they are like "this is your son" and then they are just going to live there. * You could see the movie trying to make you think that this was a real kid, but the movie just made it seem like a kid that was killed and brought

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________  The plot: The film opens with a very dramatic and intense opening scene in which a young girl is shot dead in a park. A man in black (played by Robert Duvall) appears and proceeds to rape the young girl. After a few minutes, he is interrupted by a man in white (played on screen by John Wayne), who is shot by the gunman and killed. He turns out to be a police officer and is killed by the assassin as well. The assassin (played in the film by John Huston) then goes into hiding.  During the next few minutes the movie slowly unfolds with the plotline involving the murder of the officer and the subsequent investigation by the police. The film then moves to a small town in the mountains, where a group of police officers are investigating a case involving a serial killer. This serial killer (played brilliantly by Anthony Perkins) is a man with an obsession for children, and his primary target is the children of the town. The director (who I think was John Ford) did a wonderful job of bringing this story to life. The only thing I did not like about the film was that it was somewhat confusing. I think this may have been the reason that many people did not enjoy it as much as I did.  of the movie. The movie was also shot on location, in and around California. We are introduced to the characters in this movie in a very exciting and suspenseful way. All of them are believable. They all seem to have an interesting background. The main character is a police detective named Sam. He is very smart, and is well-liked by all of his colleagues. He also happens to be bisexual. When I saw the film, I was a little skeptical about how it was going to turn out, because I have seen so many films about serial killers in which the killer is never clearly defined, and the main character never seems to know who the killer really is. The way that the film portrays the serial killer was very effective. I also liked how the film ended with a really great surprise. I did wish that there had been a little more background information about the serial murderer, but it wasn't really necessary. If you are looking for a good horror movie to watch on a summer evening, then this is a great movie to check out. It has some very well-done suspense and some really great scenes with lots of gore and violence.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  A movie is not just a movie, it's a collection of memories. The movie that you remember best is the movie that is on your mind. If you remember this movie so much that it's not funny anymore, and you can't laugh at a joke because you've seen it so many times, then you probably need a good break. I hope that everyone who has seen this movie is able to watch it without a hard time remembering what it is they are watching. This movie should be watched by people who have had some experience with humor. It's a funny movie but not for everyone. The story is a bit silly. The director was able to make a movie about a movie and the movie has a good storyline. It is not a good comedy movie but it's okay. I would recommend it for the people who can take a good laugh. I'm not sure why people hate it so much. It was my first experience with this type of humor. This isn't the best movie ever, but it is a good movie. The cast is great. Everyone has their own role and it all adds up. It doesn't feel like a comedy movie. It feels like a good action movie. There is one scene in the movie where a man is walking around a mall with a big sack on his back. It makes no sense, but he does it anyway. This scene is a great way to show a funny scene. The music is great as well. The song that plays in the beginning of the movie is "We are the Champions". It's catchy and has a great beat. The sound effects are awesome. It has a little bit of everything, but they're good. The special effects are great as is the voice of the narrator. It reminds me of some old old cartoons. The ending was a bit too much for me. It made the movie a little too much like a comic book. The character development is a little slow. The first scene is just a quick scene that shows the main character and his wife. Then it gets really fast and confusing. The only way to figure out who the characters are is by watching the whole movie. I wish they'd just have a little more time to develop the characters. The characters were interesting but not fully developed. I think that it would have been better if the director had cut the action scene so that we could see more of the character development. Overall, this is a very funny movie. If your looking

I give this movie a 6/10, I give it a 4/5 in my book.  If you have never seen a Star Wars film you really need to.  It will make you laugh and you will get very emotional.  I love that it was made when I was a child and it is the one of the greatest science fiction movies ever.  This movie made my childhood, it was a life changing experience.  You really need this movie.  Thank you Lucas for making it, thank you Harrison Ford, thank your friends for being involved in making it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  In the summer of 1972, at the age of 22, I went to see the original Star Wars. I'm not kidding. I paid $6 for a ticket to see Star Wars and I've never seen it since. I didn't even bother to read the plot synopsis because it was too boring to understand. I saw Star Wars for a few hours and got so sick of it that I walked out of the theater. I hated it, I hated everything about it. I walked away disgusted and a little embarrassed. And it was a big deal. The Star Wars phenomenon had started. I never saw the sequel.  -Kirk  If I can't make you laugh, I can at least make you cry, right? This was my first ever experience with George Lucas, and it was definitely worth it. Star Wars is one of the most well made, well paced, and well made movies of all time. The action scenes are brilliant and the characters are very well developed. The story is a great sci-fi action story, and is full of many memorable moments. The characters are just so well developed that I can easily relate to all of them. The music is also very well done and the special effects are also very good. There is a very strong message of love and acceptance throughout the film, and you feel it as you watch it. One of the biggest weaknesses of the film is the ending, which is completely unnecessary and completely cheesy. But for a Star Wars fan like me, this wasn't really a big issue. It was a great experience and I would recommend it to anyone. -Kirk

Why can't they make a movie like this that has some plot? The guy is just doing what the script told him to do. It was a little disappointing because he doesn't seem to have any problem with the fact that he is the one getting caught. The story would have been better if he would have just gotten caught and he wouldn't have had to go out to the desert to look for a girl to hook up with. That would have made the movie a lot better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You are not alone, everyone has had the experience of seeing a bad film or movie that you really liked, but in the end was a waste of time.  Maybe the director thought that the script was bad, but the film wasn't bad, the acting was good and the production was nice.  This was the first time I saw it and it wasn't a great film, but I was surprised that the film didn't get bad reviews from me.   The main character, Ivo, was a very interesting guy.  He was the only one who was not afraid to talk to everyone.  The story was told very well and I was really surprised that this movie was made for children.  If I had to compare it to another film, it is close to "The Elephant Man" by Sam Peckinpah.  But this film is not a horror film, because it's a comedy.  "The Muppet Movie" is a very funny film, and I like that it's so much different from other movies, and that I am not scared by it.  I am afraid to admit that this film really made me laugh.  This film is definitely worth watching and if you are a fan of the Muppets, then this movie is a must-see.

I think the only reason the movie was made is because they were scared that if they didn't make it, they would lose their audience and then they wouldn't have any money to make a movie again. It wasn't like they had to make it. So, they just made it. If it wasn't for the money, the movie would have never been made. The movie was so bad that when it was shown at a school in Canada, they had it stopped for fear that it would cause problems. It was a really bad movie and there are no redeeming qualities in it at all.  - Anonymous

The worst of the worst can get written by the person who doesn't like a movie, not a reviewer.  See the IMDb page for a movie you want to see. Â If it isn't on the page and is negative then you have to do a little digging. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ So how did we get from a film like that to a movie that could get a "Best Picture" nomination?  The story is pretty good. ____________________________________________________________ The Good:   I enjoyed the way the story was told.    This movie had a real sense of urgency.  There was a very strong storyline, and the performances were great.  This film really showed the importance of having a good story.  It was also interesting to see how some people could make it through a war without losing a limb.  The story was well told. The Bad:  It didn't take long for the movie to start to become bogged down with politics.  I don't know why they decided to put all of the politics in the beginning, but that was where it went.  After a while it just became annoying.  But it wasn't bad in a bad way.  To me it was just a tad annoying.   ____________________________________________________ The Bad (for me):   There were a few times I thought I had heard it all before.  One particular scene was a bit much for me.      But I am glad to say that most of the movie was pretty good for a film made in the 70's.  The Good (for others):  This movie really showed how important it is to have a good movie.  What makes a good film?   It is the story. If you don't have a strong story then your film will be very short.  If you have a great story then you are in for a treat.  Some people may find this movie to be a little too political, but I found it to be well done.  In a world where the people are losing their minds over political issues then maybe you should try to be more political.  You are not going to win the war with a bad story, so just go for it.  We all want to feel good about ourselves and in this world, politics are a great way to make us feel good. This movie showed us how important a good script

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________________________________ If you've seen this movie, I'd like you to take a second to think about what a piece of shit this movie is. This movie is not a good film. It's a film that has a lot of issues and its not even good. It has very little to no plot to its story and there are no real characters that you can actually care about in this movie. If you have never seen this film, then please, just go watch a good, decent movie like, A Christmas Story or anything else. It may even be worth it just for the nostalgia.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ Do you have a favorite horror movie that was so bad that it makes you want to give up on cinema altogether? I think I've seen the following movies and I think this one is the worst of them all: The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, The Exterminating Angel, The Omen, Poltergeist, The Shining, Halloween, The Wicker Man, The Blob, and even the lesser known movies like Nightmare on Elm Street, The Hills Have Eyes, Scream, and The Wrecking Crew. So here are a few reasons why you should watch this film. 1. The ending. Seriously, this movie has the most ridiculous ending to a movie I've ever seen. You've got your creepy doll house that is being haunted by a demon. A little girl gets up to leave to get her father and brother, but as she does, a hand grabs her neck and pulls her down. As she falls to the ground, she realizes she's been possessed and her mother is there to take care of her. She then turns and screams at her mother for being there when she needed her, but the demon turns her face and gives her a really mean look, and she dies. You just know that this movie wasn't made with any intention to be good. This is the kind of film that should be avoided because it was so poorly made. 2. The music. Seriously! What is the point of making music for a movie when the movie itself is so bad? The music that plays during the beginning is horrible and I couldn't believe how loud it was. You know how they say that a good movie starts with a bad story and then a good story starts with the right music? This is exactly how this movie starts. 3. The actors. This movie is a terrible mistake. I was so confused by how good some of the actors were in this movie that I just didn't know if I was supposed to laugh or cry. I mean, just look at how badly they were playing the roles. The main character, the girl that is possessed, is played by an actress named Amanda Schull. She's just terrible. I can't believe that she was cast in a movie that she is so terrible at. The other two characters are played by some guys who play "the guys" who are supposed to be scary. These two characters, the "guy" and the "girl" are supposed be so scary and they don't even seem to
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________   I love to watch movies that have no real plot. This is one of those movies.   There is nothing much to say about this movie.  .   of course there are some things that are very interesting and good. There is a lot of things about the film that I really liked.   (no spoilers) I love the fact that this movie is about a guy who was raped in the 80s. I really loved the fact of the film. It was a very hard thing for me to see this movie and I was not really expecting it. I guess I was really hoping for something else. The reason why I think this movie was so good is because the film had a lot to say and I think that a lot could be said. I like how the film is set in the past. It is very interesting to me. I think it is a very interesting film and a very good movie to watch.   and now for the worst part about this film... The actors who play the rape victims are not very good at all. It seemed like they had no life. The actress who plays the victim was not that good at portraying the rape victim. I would really like to know why the director decided to cast such a person for the role. And that is not all. The scenes that I saw in the film were very boring. The movie is a really long one so it does take a long time for the movie to finish. I found it very sad that the movie has a lot more scenes then it really needs. I am just going to stop talking about this now. I was very disappointed with this movie that I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I hope that this film is not a big hit because I really enjoyed it. This movie is really good.   I think I have said enough about the movie so I will give a little bit more details about the actors. I liked how the actor played the rape survivor. I also liked the actor who played the rapist. I thought the actor was very good. I didn't really like the actress who played victim.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  The worst part of the movie was the horrible acting and the terrible story. It was a boring story that has nothing to do with the character. This was not a good movie to watch. It took me over 30 minutes to finish the movie. The ending was very rushed and the story is not worth the time. The music is terrible, there is no music at all. This movie is a waste of time. I was really looking forward to this movie. I have seen this movie a lot of times on television and this time the plot was not the same. It's like the story was changed from the movie to the TV series. I don't know what happened to the character, maybe he died and he just took his place in the show. I think they should make this show into a series because it is a good show and it should have been on. If you like to watch a show about bad people and bad characters you can't go wrong with this movie and this show.

A new report by the University of New South Wales has shown that more than half of Sydney's immigrants are from Muslim-majority countries, with only a quarter coming from non-Muslim countries.    The report says this high concentration in Sydney is partly down to the number of Muslims moving into the city, but also because Sydney has one of the highest levels of education of any city in the world, meaning more people have a knowledge of Arabic. .@DrMalihaLakhani's research suggests the overwhelming majority of Australians don't have a good understanding of the diversity of the Muslim community.

Dr Ali Haddad, co-author of the report and a researcher at UNSW, said that it is not possible to say for certain whether the city's Muslim population would be the same in 2023, but he said it was likely the concentration of Muslims in Sydney would continue to increase.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. If you think the movie is bad, try and find a good movie that's even worse. The worst movie I've seen this year is "The Muppets" (2012). I would give it a 3.5, but the fact that this movie has so many problems makes it even worse than the previous movie. I can't believe this film has a rating of PG-13! It's not even PG-14! This movie is an insult to anyone who believes in movies and the freedom to make them. If they want to make a movie like this, they should be making a cartoon like this: ____________________. I'm so disappointed that this is a sequel to this film. The last movie was such a horrible piece of garbage that I don't even want to watch it. This movie will only cause more trouble for the production company. This is the best thing I have seen this month. ___________________. It's a terrible, horrible movie. The writing is terrible and the acting is terrible. It looks like a crappy animated movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________________ (It was really a great movie, and I'm a fan of it, but I hated it. I don't think it's a good movie and it was really bad. It's not even funny, I just can't understand why the actors are so happy and drunk. And I really hated the whole idea of the story. There's a guy in the middle of the ocean, and he's trying to get home. He has a helicopter, and a plane, and... Well, he has a submarine, and that's the idea, that he's going to be able to get his family home, but they have to find the submarine first, and they have a problem. And the movie ends with the submarine sinking. It was really hard to watch.) ______________________________________________________________________________ The movie: The movie starts with a helicopter (or a car, I forget) going through a thick fog, and then we see a plane and some people on the ground. It just seems so ridiculous and stupid. Then we see two guys with guns and a helicopter. There are helicopters and planes in the movie, but it seems that only one of them can go on a rescue mission. So the two guys get out of the helicopter, but the helicopter's engine dies. So they get out the car and the helicopter goes down and they run away. The helicopter crashes, and we see that the two men have been killed. A guy comes down and says that he wants to help the guy on the boat. So we go back to the helicopter and the pilot is trying to make it to the guy. But the engine dies, so he flies low, and one of the guys (who looks a lot like the guy in The Matrix) falls in. The pilot doesn't notice this, and the guy goes under the water. The guy in a black suit and the one in the white suit get in the submarine and the two of them start to go for the submarine. The other guy in white suit tries to go in, but he falls in too, and drowns. But we see another guy in black suit, and another guy with a gun, and suddenly we have a helicopter in a fog. They take off and go back and the other guy with the gun, who's a marine, comes in and says to the other marine that he thinks they're lost. The marine says that they're going down and the chopper will bring them up. And then suddenly the other cho
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. If you don't like it, then you probably don't deserve to have it in your collection. That's my take on this. The story itself isn't bad, it's just the way it's told is a complete mess. There is a lot going on that makes no sense at all. It makes it hard to get into and watch at times. For me, I found it hard enough to get in and out of the film, but once you do get in, the movie loses all of it's charm. The acting is ok, but it is so out of character for a movie this old that I had to look at it twice to make sure I was watching it right. There are some great moments in this film, and they're well put together. But the movie has no idea what it is, and the direction just drags on and on. I was so disappointed in this movie. I have a feeling that the people who made this are ashamed of it. I mean, it has a great cast, and there's a great scene at the end with the boys, but the writing makes me doubt it was even a good idea to make a movie about it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ I've seen the film more than 10 times, but it's always disappointing. The acting is terrible, the plot is stupid, the directing is awful, and the editing is horrible. I'll give it 3 stars, because it's a good comedy with a lot of funny moments, but you don't need to see it again.  I liked it when I was a kid: __________________ I was in grade 8 and a couple of my friends and I would get the "B" and "G" movies. There were a lot more good movies that we'd see at home than crappy ones. I liked the first one "The Goonies" and then the next one "Porky's". I didn't understand why the movie is called "The Lost Boys" when we see the movie from the kids point of view. I also remember the movie "My Favorite Year" as a kid, it had some great songs. I have not seen it since, but I hope they did a remake of it. -April 20, 2006A lot of the actors are pretty bad:
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________   "I didn't know how to say good-bad until I saw this movie. This was a great movie, but it's a movie with a lot of flaws." - Michael K.   This movie was not a good movie. It was so bad that I thought that it was made by a group of high school kids. There was no story. The movie was about a guy, and he was really angry at the world. But at the end of the movie, he is in a car, and his friend was like, "Why are you so angry?" and he is like, and I'm like, I'm just saying it because I'm not saying anything. So he is really sad, and then he's like, why are you always crying?" And the guy said, "I don't know, I don't feel good." And the friend said, it was the same thing, and the guy was like...he was so happy!   The movie was just so bad. Like, I didn't think that it would be this bad. It didn't have a story. It had a few scenes that I liked. But the movie is just so boring. I mean, it doesn't even have an ending. It just goes on and on and doesn't have an end. And then it ends. The ending is just...I don' t know. I'm going to be honest. It's just...a really weird ending. I think that people will like it. I don' think that the movie was made that well, but I do think that there is a lot that people can learn from it.

For instance, a lot has been written about how the movie reminds him of his experience with, a young actor that he met in LA. It is true that many of the scenes inwere similar to those scenes in. And it is also true that some of the actors inwere a little bit like, although they had a lot more to say. So, is there anything that, the same actor, has in common or not? Well, it turns out thatis a little likeand. Both movies were made in the late 80s, but they're very different. And this movie is no different.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________  A nice movie to watch if you like action movies and you don't like action-movie plots. If you can accept a plot where a woman who was born in a village gets attacked by a giant (which was not explained in any way) with a sword and she has to find a way to get the sword back and stop him. You won't be disappointed. If your a fan of sword fighting and action movies, you should watch this.  Helpful plot, the movie didn't explain why the giant was attacking the village and why the villagers are fighting. Also, some people are not happy with how the movie ended. But it doesn't matter if you don`t like it. I would like to point out a flaw of this movie: there was no sound. I hope you liked the review!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ __________. The thing about movies is that sometimes they get better over time, and in some cases, they get worse. In that case, we should all go see the first movie (and maybe even watch it in a theater) and see what's happened in the intervening years, or at least see what changes were made after that. And this movie is really, really bad. Not only is the acting atrocious, the plot is just plain old crap. The only thing that keeps this movie from being an utter disaster is that the acting is bad, and the dialogue is even worse. It's a horrible movie, with one of the worst scripts I've ever seen. I have to give props to the actors, though. I don't know if they're just being nice or if they really have this movie in their heads, but they really do make you feel like they're in a very bad movie. It feels like they all know how to act and they're trying to make it as awful as possible. The movie is not funny, it's not suspenseful, it just feels like it's trying to be an awful movie. This is one of those movies that really sucks.   Overall, this is a really bad movie that only gets worse from here. I give it a 0/10, but if you like horror, watch it anyway.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________ The film is based on a true story that took place in the 1980's. It is about a group of men who were hunting a bear with a bow and arrow. During the hunt, the hunter was shot and killed. The hunters, including two of the men, were found dead and lying in a nearby river. The other two hunters were also dead. The two men who had been shot, along with the two hunters, were named Ray and Jerry. The bodies were badly decomposed and they were found to be holding hands. The coroner said that they had died from a gunshot wound to the head. The autopsy showed that they were shot at close range, but they were not shot in the head, as the coroner had believed. He concluded that the hunters had been killed by a sniper from a position some distance away. In the documentary, the director, Bill Kurtis, claims that he was told about the story by a friend of Ray and a friend from Jerry's. They were hunters in the same area, and the hunters said that it was the same bear they killed. He also says that he saw the bear and heard the gunshot. The story also has been told many times on various television and radio programs. This is an excellent film that provides some great background information about the area in which the men were hunting and how it all went wrong. The film has some nice close ups of the dead hunters and also shows how the bear was killed. It does not give a lot of background on the hunters. It also makes it hard to follow the story, because it is a long one. The director of the film, Bill K., says that Ray and Larry, along in the film are his real names. The name of the documentary is "The Bear Killers." I liked the film very much, and it does a great job of telling the story of the hunters and the bear. I also liked the way the documentary was shot. I enjoyed the story the best, but it was very easy to follow. It was not as good as the book, but I found it interesting. The ending was a little sad, but that is the way it goes in these kinds of stories. I give the film 4 out of 5 stars. I will definitely be watching this movie when it is available again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  In the year of our Lord 2029, an alien species, the Halkans, arrives in Earth and quickly establishes itself as a formidable competitor to humanity. The planet is in a state of crisis. The Halkan civilization is on the brink of collapse as they fight against a virus.  The Halkana is a race of aliens, the "Halkans", who have a highly developed intelligence, and are highly technologically advanced. In the year 2029 they arrive on Earth and begin colonizing our planet. A Halka, the leader of this group, is able to create an empire by conquering the other alien races and creating a military force.  a large portion of the movie was just him being a complete dick. The story is a typical sci-fi film with aliens being evil and trying to take over the world. , in the year 2030, the film starts off with a plot to kill the Harkans, which is set up in the first two minutes. After that, it just becomes more and more annoying, the story doesn't have any interesting points or things to say. It's just "another alien race is coming, we need to fight them!". The film is just a giant generic sci- fi film. The whole movie was like this. It was just another sci- fie movie. I mean, even the alien characters were the same type of characters. The aliens had a huge head and large eyes and they had large noses and pointed teeth. The aliens also have huge mouths that are filled with sharp teeth and big mouths that have a lot of teeth. The alien race doesn't look different from the other aliens, but they do look different. I just couldn't believe they were aliens, when they had those kinds of features. I think the director and writer thought that the alien race had to look like the Harkinan. They looked like Harkan's and they were in a race. However, the aliens were never anything interesting or different from other aliens. They were just aliens. I would have given the movie a 7.5 out of 10 if the aliens didn't have big noses and sharp teeth. I didn't like this movie. It had no story or anything interesting to say and the story was just generic. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It has no story to it. The acting was just not good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Apr 20, 2017 By: Anonymous Subject: A Movie Worth Seeing I thought this movie was terrible. I've never been a big fan of the James Bond series. But this one was a real letdown. It was just a movie. The movie was so boring that I actually thought it was a bad remake of another Bond movie. I think they should have just made a new movie called "The Bond Movie" and made a few changes like "DIE HARD, BOND!". I mean they did a pretty good job at making the James bond look like a normal man. And I'm not saying that because I'm a Bond fan. But it's pretty obvious that this movie wasn't made with James Bond in mind. The music was just plain awful. The acting was bad and I didn't like the plot at all. There was no emotion in the movie. It wasn't even a Bond movie...it was just an action movie. When you see a James Bond movie you want to see the action and the action alone. This movie had none of that. When the guy was chasing a guy who shot up a building, I thought that he was just chasing the guy down. The whole time it was just me and the camera. It didn't even feel like a James bond movie. They didn't do anything with the James Bonds or the plot. They just took the same old Bond movie, made it better and re-released it. I don't want to watch it anymore. It's a really bad movie and I hope it gets pulled off the shelf because I don;t want to be exposed to it. It makes me sad to see a bad James Bond film like this.

I could understand the reason for the ending, but it just seemed unnecessary.   the entire movie felt like a waste of time. It really made me want to punch the screen in anger.   I really didn't want to watch this movie. I hate it, and I hate how it ended. It felt like it just went to waste.  _________________  "If the music were more powerful, you wouldn't want it to end."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________  In the mid-80's, an Australian producer (and friend of mine) had the idea to make a film about the life of a boy from the East End who had been rejected by his family and had ended up in Melbourne as a street kid, and he had gone to Melbourne and ended up living on the streets. He ended up spending a few years living on a boat on the River Yarra and he came to Melbourne in 1986.  The film is interesting, but the director seems to have gotten carried away, because it ends up being a documentary, not a film. It's a fascinating look at the life and times of a man who had no control over his own life. He was in Melbourne in a desperate situation, and the filmmakers did a good job of giving him a sympathetic story. I just wish they had kept it a documentary and not a story. It is, in a way, an excuse to look at some of Melbourne's less than flattering aspects and how they influenced the life on the street. . A good movie for kids: __________________In the early 80's an Australian director made a film called "The Kid" about an Aboriginal boy who lived on the docks in Melbourne. It has become a cult classic for kids and it's good fun. It also is a good example of how to make an Australian film that's not just for kids. This movie is really about the people who were there, and I think it's a very good movie. The director is the right person for the job, because he's very funny, and it doesn't have a lot of talking, but it does have some interesting things to say about Melbourne in the 80's. I'm not sure how the kids would take it, but I like it, and if you have kids, you might want to give it a try..

"The Name of the Rose" was the name of a movie about a man and a woman who were accused of killing a man who had killed one of their own. I read this book when I was a kid and it was one of the first books I remember reading. The title was written in a French accent which was just too much to take at the time. If you like it, you will love it. If you don't like it you will probably never like it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________  1 out of 4 stars Rating: 2.0 out of 5 ( 3 votes cast)  This movie has a lot of flaws. Some good and some bad. But it does have some things to make it worth watching. For example, the soundtrack is awesome. The story is well told. And it's one of the best made movies in a long time. If you love Sci-Fi and Space-Fantasy movies and movies like the ones I have listed, then this is definitely one of your favorites. If not, it's still worth watching because it's a nice story, good acting and good special effects.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This is what I expected from a "comedy" but not so much from a horror movie!" The most horrible part of this movie is when you think that everything is ok and then the movie changes into a horror and you can't believe your eyes, it was a complete change from the comedy, it's really creepy and really sad and a really bad movie, this movie made me angry, I really hate this movie and it really ruined my first impression of this great horror, it has no redeeming quality at all, no matter if you're a fan of horror or a fan the movie, if you have any idea how to watch this movie, you should never watch this and should leave it alone, this is the reason why this movie was banned in China, there are many ways to watch the movie but if you watch it in Chinese you have no chance of viewing it, you need to use a VPN or a Chinese movie streaming site and it's also banned in some of the most watched movie channels in China so it's not that easy to watch, there is one site that has a version in English and Chinese, if it is banned in your country and you want to watch it please go to the website in Chinese then use the proxy option and watch it on VPN, the only thing this movie has that's worth watching is the ending, the whole movie is not that good and I'm really sad that this movie had to make a sequel, I love this movie so much and I would like to see a version of this in English, I hope this movie will be released in the USA or at least in Canada, I know that there are a lot of other movies that are banned in my country but I hope it will get released in some country so we can all see this great movie in the theaters, it should be banned in all countries in this world but in my eyes it is a great movie, it really made me feel a lot like a real person and a real horror movie is a good movie for me, if I ever see this movie again I will watch it again with a VPN and a Chinese VPN and I will write a review about this movie in English.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. It's worth it, in my opinion. The story isn't exactly groundbreaking, but it's entertaining enough. I've seen better movies in this genre and this one has a few memorable scenes. I have not seen all of them, but there are some that make this movie worth watching. It doesn't get too over the top and has a bit of a "mystery" aspect to it. If you can tolerate the slow pacing, this is one of the better horror films I've watched in recent years. You won't be disappointed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  - This is not a good movie, it's a bad film with a lot of problems. It's a story about a young woman who lives in a small town in Canada and she meets a guy who is going to her country to be a fireman. They fall in love and she decides to move in with him, but she has some problems with her parents and the situation goes wrong, but it's not a story that is a tragedy. It has some funny parts and it's entertaining and it shows that a woman can fall in a relationship with a fire guy. However, the story is really not good. It does not tell a complete story. It uses flashbacks and scenes to fill up the time. The movie uses many clichés and a lot is just repeated. It shows that they have a lot to work on in the next movie, the next season, the movie that will be made for television. I did not like this movie at all, it was bad and boring and the only good part is the last scene where the fireman kisses her. This is the only reason that I recommend this movie. ...Read full review ... read full review

I had no expectations from this movie but I'm really glad I got to see it. It's definitely not a movie that I would have watched at home with my family but I have to say it is definitely worth a watch. It really is a great movie. It has that "road movie" feeling to it but the story is interesting enough to keep you watching. I'm glad that this movie was actually made into a big movie with a lot of special effects, I can't wait to see how it looks in a 3D. I would've liked to have seen some more action in the movie but for a movie with such an awesome story it's a little disappointing.  -Mark 07-09-2009  I was thinking it was an amazing movie. But I must say, that when I saw the movie I didn't like the action. The story is really good. I just didn't enjoy it. I thought the action was really boring. It was all about some guys and their bikes. It doesn't have the feeling of a road movie. I think they could've done a better job of giving us the feeling that it was a big adventure.

It takes place on the back roads and in the desert. The cars, the bikes, the desert, the dirt roads, the trucks, the sand dunes, the camels...all of it. And what I like about it is that it never feels like it's too far away from the road. The movie is really easy to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This was a terrible movie. The acting was terrible. The plot was terrible."  Well, it is bad.  But if it is a bad film, then why does it get such good reviews?  I mean, I know it is horrible and I know that the cast and crew are going to hate it.  a)  Why do you want a movie that's bad to get good reviews in the first place?  b)    I'm not interested in watching something bad that I hate.   What a waste of money.  c)  What's the point of getting paid for a film if you're going to go out of your way to make a terrible one? d)  Do you think that everyone who wants to watch a bad TV show or movie is just looking for a bad experience?  f)  I just don't get the "badness" factor of a movie.  Is that why we pay so much money for them?  g)  Why do people love bad TV shows and bad movies?  h)  Is it because they think it is cool?  i)  Isn't this kind of a "bad" movie?  (3)  It is bad for the character of Peter Quinn to go to prison for a crime he didn't commit.  I mean, why?  I guess he is guilty because he took the credit for the crime.  But why?   a) Why did he go to jail if he was innocent? b) Why didn't he just admit to the crime?   The movie also makes a big deal about how he has to "change" because he has a record.  What?  A. I can't believe they put a scene in a movie about a guy who has a criminal record and then spend the entire movie telling us that he is "changed."  b. If he had never done anything wrong he wouldn't have to go into jail.  If you want to know what I think the problem with the movie is, look at the ending.  The scene with the cops (one of them being a cop who was fired and then arrested for a second time, just for making a big stink about the first arrest) just seems so out of place.  This movie is trying to be so funny and yet the ending is so dark.  Why would you make a joke at the end of a film

It's hard to explain just how famous the movie was in the 1990s, and how it has been cited by some as a model of artificial intelligence and self-awareness.  the film, which is considered a classic, is so famous for its portrayal of a virtual world that in one scene a computer-generated woman, Neo (Keanu Reeves), falls in love with a human woman (the voice of Carrie-Anne Moss) and gives birth to a child. , a film, and in the film itself, the main character is seen as a "human" with no consciousness or sentience, or the "robot." The film is so popular that the movie has been adapted into a series of video games and even a comic book.  for its success, the movie earned the top-grossing Academy Award for Best Picture in 1999. .

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________ I can't wait for the final installment, because I think the movie is one of the best examples of "horror" I've ever seen, and the actors are amazing. The special effects are superb and the story is really something, although there are some problems that I won't go into too much detail about. The film has an amazing atmosphere and is really a great horror movie to watch at night. The music is fantastic, as are the actors and the special effects. The ending is really quite amazing as well. It's also a little bit scary, but not for the reason you think. Overall, I really liked the movie. The only thing I wish it had was more gore, more sex, more gore. But overall, this is an amazing movie that will keep you coming back for more! I gave it a 4/5 and I would definitely recommend this to any horror fan.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "this is my favorite movie ever, and it was terrible".  I know you're a huge Star Wars fan, and I'm sure it was fun to watch, but this movie was a massive disappointment.  It was poorly paced, the special effects were laughable, and they made this movie look like a Star Wars prequel.   If you're going to make a Star Trek movie, you should at least make it a Star War prequel or a prequel to the Empire Strikes Back.  There were several problems with this movie that made it seem like it was made as a prequels for Star Wars.  This movie had some great concepts, but the execution was so bad that it's just a bad film.   Star Trek vs. Star Wars was released on May 27, 1989.  It had a budget of $5 million, which is a lot of money for a movie, but it's also a huge amount for a Star Wing movie.  The special effects are very poor, and the special makeup for the Klingons is laughable.  I can't say that the Klingon makeup is anything spectacular, but then again I'm not really a Star Warrior myself.  They could have at least made the KlingONS look a little more realistic.  But if they had gone with something like this, I probably wouldn't have been so mad at the poor special effects.  Star Trek vs Star Wars is the only Star Wars movie that wasn't made by Lucasfilm, and that's saying a lot.    It had to have been a very tough decision to let this movie go and go with Star Trek instead.  So why was this movie such a big disappointment?  Because it's very obvious that they wanted to make Star Wars vs. The Empire Strikes back.  At one point during the movie, we see Captain Kirk on the bridge of the Enterprise.  Now, this is a big no-no in Star Trek  movie lore.  In Star Trek, the Enterprise never leaves spacedock.  And even though it was clearly in a battle with the Borg, they never leave spacedock because they can't leave spacedocks without a warp core breach.  When Kirk goes on the Bridge of the USS Enterprise, he is actually in the midst of a battle.  Why is Kirk on a battle-deck?  So he can have a clear view of the Borg.  Of course, that doesn't make

It was the plot that was just ridiculous." The movie: This movie is about a guy who is the CEO of a company that makes and sells a machine that allows him to see the future.  He gets in an accident with this machine and his vision is corrupted.  This is when he discovers the machine and tries to restore it, but it's not going to happen.  The premise is great:  How the hell is this guy going to be able to fix the machine?  He has to travel back in time and change his future in order to restore the machine.  What makes it worse is that he can't fix it because it's already broken.  How is this even a movie?  It has no sense of humor.  The plot is ridiculous.   How the hell can the plot be as ridiculous as this?   It's like someone decided to make this a movie that was so crazy that it needed to have a plot.  They didn't have to try and make it funny, but they sure had a lot of time to make it ridiculous. The acting:   One of the things I really liked about this movie is that they cast an amazing cast of actors.  Most of them had a great chemistry with one another.  There were a few that had some issues with one of their actors and I was disappointed by them.  But overall they did a great job with the actors they had.   There were also some really great supporting actors like Brian Keith and Steve Buscemi.   This was a good cast and I really enjoyed them.   The only thing that really bothered me about the movie was that there were some parts that I couldn't really relate to at all.  For example, I didn't like the part where he was going back in history.  I couldn in fact relate to that part and I couldn´t find a way to relate to the rest of the movie.   Overall:   I really liked this movie and I would recommend it to people who enjoy films that are silly and have a good plot.   You will probably laugh a lot in this movie, but I also recommend that you keep an open mind.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ This is a terrible movie, not even worthy of a rating, but just a bad one. The actors and the director are all horrible. It's a horror movie that you'd expect to see at a horror convention and it's not even in a horror house, but instead in a very tacky old hotel that has been in a long term lease and is being torn down to make room for a new hotel. I was very disappointed. The film starts off very badly. The actress playing the "killer" is extremely rude and insulting to the victim of the crime. She tells him "You deserve to die, because you're so stupid you fell for a trick like this." She's also rude to the police officer who's trying to talk her out of it. This leads to a great fight scene where she's getting beat up by the other characters in the hotel. The scene was very long and the violence was very gory. I think that this is where the movie lost me. I wanted the movie to go in a different direction. I really thought that the director had the potential to make a good horror movie. He had the talent, but I just couldn't get into it. The other characters were also very dull. I felt that there was nothing really interesting about them. I can't wait for the next one to come out. ______________________________ Read a review of this movie here. ______________ UPDATE: I've recently seen this movie again and it seems that I'm not the only one who's disappointed with this movie. It still doesn't deserve a rating of 1/10, but it does deserve a 1/6.

And I guess you can see where the movie was going to go from the beginning.   in the first five minutes you can tell that there is no story. There is just one long shot of a car that crashes into a tree. It is the perfect scene to tell the story of a dead man who has died. There was nothing else in the movie.

Why not give it a chance and give it another shot, and you may find that you like it even more! So, for all those who think it''s a bad and boring film, DON''T WATCH IT. You''ll find that it''ll be worth the time. I found this film very interesting, and very entertaining. I enjoyed watching it so much, that I was almost in tears by the end. I''ve always loved to watch old horror films, but I''m never a big horror fan. I find horror films to be boring and sometimes even creepy. This film made me laugh, and at the same time, scared me. This was a very different kind of horror film. This movie was so different, that when I saw it, I was expecting to see a very dark, disturbing movie, with blood, gore and lots of scary moments. But when I watched this film, I thought it was really funny. The story of this movie is a little bit strange, but not too much so. The main character, a guy named Bill is an aspiring filmmaker. He is a very kind, generous and very easy going guy. He loves to watch horror films and likes to see his favorite directors in them. His main character is a great filmmaker, and loves to show movies to his friend, and his girlfriend. He doesn''t have much luck with women, but he always manages to get the girl. But this is not the main story of the movie. The movie''s story is about Bill''s past. Bill was a boy when he was sent to a very sadistic and sadistic teacher named Dr. Stacey. Bill is a troubled boy, and as a result of his abuse by Dr.Stacey
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Last Witch Hunter  (2016) is a poorly made and badly paced movie that is too expensive for its own good. This is the second film by Michael Dougherty that is about a witch hunter who is looking for a witch who has escaped from her tower. The movie has an over the top plot where the witch is trying to kill the witch hunter. The main problem is that the witch was not believable. She was not in control of the situation. It was all scripted and she acted like she was under the control of someone else. The witch is also a fake, as she has a lot of make up on and she is dressed in clothes that are old. The only good part about the movie was when the witch killed her mother. The scene was pretty cool. This movie is definitely not worth your money. Do not get your hopes up, unless you really like witches. Do you want a movie where a witch hunts for witches? Do you think this movie will bring you more fun? Then please do not watch this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________, you are a ______ (or some other negative adjectival) person. You are a self-centered _______. You feel ____________ and you are ___________. Your ______ is _______."  The phrase, "______ is ______", is so common, and so ubiquitous, that it is difficult to believe it isn't original. The earliest citation I could find was in the October 5, 1967 issue of Life magazine. It was a story on a young woman who, after being rejected by three men in an attempt to gain entrance to a nightclub, had a drink named after her. This particular drink was a drink called a "______", named for the fact that she was "the first to use it". The drink was sold for $2.00, and apparently, it wasn't as popular as the name would suggest.  On April 23, 1973, Life magazine printed the following story:  "There is a young lady at a bar who has a drink with the name '______'. The girl's name is Donna and she's a freshman at the University of Chicago. She has been on the dean's list all year and has been an All-American. She doesn't think it's a good idea to be an All American because she doesn't want to be the only girl on the Dean's List."  a student at the university was named "Dee" and the "D" stands for "Donna."  The student was, of course, Donna. She was a junior in high school. She said she was named Donna by a boy named Dee at the college bar. But she didn't know that. "Denny" was another name for the bartender and, like the bartender, she thought she was being called "Dona".  A short time after this story was published, the student decided to write to the dean of students and to the editor of the school paper, explaining her situation. .  a girl named Donna is a sophomore at the U. of Chicago, and her name is spelled with the letter "D", so she's Dee. She's been on Dean's list this year. She knows she's on the list because her friends all call her "Don" and her friends at the bar call her by her middle name, Dee. "Don," she says, "is a stupid name for a girl. It's a boy's name, a boy can call a girl 'Don
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________  I watched this movie as a kid in the 1980s. My friends and I went to see it at a local theater. The movie was actually pretty good. It was an animated version of a book written by a guy named Maurice Sendak. It starred a little girl and her cat, and it was a very cute movie. I just don't remember the movie being anything special. The characters were pretty silly and I don't think there was any plot or anything. The main character, "Bun Bun", was voiced by a woman named Sally Field. The girl herself, "Coco", was played by Judy Garland. Both of them were very cute. In the end, though, they weren't very funny. The voice acting was pretty good, but it wasn't that great. The animation, as I recall, was not very good, though. I can't remember anything else about the movie, other than the fact that the movie was about a girl and a cat and that they had an adventure. This movie didn't stick with me and I never found it to be very interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You're not a bad person. You're just an angry one.  So I'm going to make you angry. I'm not even going to say why I hate this movie. I don't want to ruin the experience for anyone who comes along to see it. I'll just say this:  If you're looking for a movie that will make you hate the world, this is the movie for you.   This movie will give you nightmares, and it will make your heart sink to your stomach.  I can't give this movie a 1. It has its good points.  I'll be honest, I really liked the character of Jake.  He was a good leader.  But the movie made me hate him.  The whole time he was in that truck, he was thinking about how he could get away from his family.  His family thought he was a coward.  That's why he had to die.  Now I don.t think this is a good movie.  This is not a good horror movie.   But it is a great movie. It was good.  A great movie that had me thinking about what I've done to my family and how much I hate my family. The movie was not perfect, but it was good and I'm glad I watched it.   So go out and watch it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________   5.0/10   Don't you know the "best" movies always suck?   4.5/10  I saw this movie on a trip to Las Vegas. This was a great movie to get me out of my Vegas-induced funk.   This movie was like the perfect combination of "Bad to the Bone" and "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial". I remember watching the first time and thinking, "This is a movie about a man named Jack that is trapped in a house with a mysterious creature that looks like a big spider with the head of a fish." Then I saw it again a few weeks later, and it was really, really, bad. The "E" in the title was supposed to be "evil", but it was actually just bad. It was horrible.  .   for the first 20 minutes of this movie, the story seemed pretty good, but after that it was just plain boring.   The movie wasn't even good for the rest of the movie, which was a real shame.   (4/10)   For me, this movie is a very disappointing entry in the franchise, as it was basically a "what if?" movie where Jack (the main character) was trapped in his house for 20 years and was eventually able to escape through some sort of portal. Jack was able to communicate with his friends and family through his "telepathy", but he couldn't talk to them or see them.  : If you are a fan of "The Thing", then you will probably enjoy this. It's not the best movie by any means, but I found it very enjoyable and interesting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ This was a great movie, but I had my doubts about the ending. The movie starts off well enough, with the main character having a conversation with his mother about how he is having a hard time in school and how he has to get a better job. However, after the main characters first day at the job, he does not have a good attitude toward the people he works with and does not respect them. He does not take the responsibility of the company very seriously, and just treats people like he is above them. The people at the company know this, and treat him with contempt. This goes on and on. The main character is then called in for a meeting with his boss. His boss tells him that he is fired, and that he should go home and change his attitude and attitude towards people. The boss is being sarcastic, but his words are not really serious, and the main is not taken seriously. However the main makes a comment about how it is easy for the boss to tell a joke, but hard for him to tell that a joke was not funny. He gets fired and the movie ends there. I think the ending is a little too abrupt and not realistic. I was really excited to see the main's new job. I love the idea of this movie, I just thought the ending was a little bit too abrupt. __________________________________________________________

The movie ends up being more of a plotless adventure than a movie, so it is just a very boring movie that doesn't really deserve any kind of rating.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "it's just not that good."  That is a huge understatement.  The movie is simply too bad to have any merit whatsoever.    It has an extremely annoying female lead who is constantly looking at her phone and not doing anything, and she spends all of her time complaining about her life.  If you've ever heard the old saying that if you've been in a relationship for ten years, you're going to be really cranky, then you've definitely heard this line from this movie.  There is also a scene where a man is forced to play the role of a man and the women play the roles of women.  Why is it always men playing women?  And the worst part is that this film does have some pretty cool action scenes, but they're almost always ruined by the fact that the camera just doesn't care.  The camera moves so fast and in such a way that there is no point in actually showing the action.  And when there is action, the camera moves way too quickly, and when the action is over, it moves way to quickly again.  I was going to say that it was a slow-paced movie, but that would be a lie.  It's a very fast paced movie. I hate that this movie is so bad, because I really love the franchise.  But if you haven't seen the first movie, you really need to watch the second movie, because it has a lot of the same elements in it.  Unfortunately, this movie also suffers from a few of the problems that the franchise has always had.  One of the things that bothers me the most about this movie are the characters.  First off, there is the annoying girl.  She doesn't do much other than complain about her job, her boyfriend, and the fact she can't get a date.  Her best friend, a girl named Michelle, has a crush on her, and is the only girl she seems to care about.  Michelle is also the only one who seems to know that she's a girl.   Michelle is a girl who dresses as a boy, but actually is a man.  When her boyfriend tells her to get a new pair of underwear for her birthday, she does it in a way where she wears a dress with her girlfriend's panties, and it doesn't work.  Even the other girls in the group seem to know, because they start calling Michelle "she."  When

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  If you think a movie is bad, don't be afraid to tell us. If you want to say a movie was a flop, go ahead and do it. We all have our preferences and preferences are for people to live with.  But when someone tells you about something you didn't like, you shouldn't let it bother you. -A.M.  the real movie,  "The Man from Another Place" was a great movie. It was a movie that was so good that it left a bad taste in my mouth, but I couldn't go back to it. It had been several years since I had seen it, and I decided to see it again after I had watched a few other films. I had forgotten all about this movie, but it was such a good movie. I am not one for remakes, but if this movie had been remade in my time it would have been a great film. The movie was so much better than its remake. I really liked it. If there is a sequel, it would be better. It would be great to see the movie again and see what happened. It has a few scenes that could have been changed. The movie was made in 1966, so it is still a little bit in the past. I guess they had a few good years, but we all know how much time has passed since then. This movie was shot during the time of the Vietnam War. There were some bad things that happened in that war. We can only hope that there is another sequel, but maybe we won't see it. This is one of those movies that we don't need to see again, but some of us love it. As always, I love you all. Here's the review:  As I was reading the review for the new movie, "The Man From Another Place", I kept thinking to myself that it was very similar to a movie I saw in high school. I don't know if it is because I have seen this movie so many times that I can see it all in my head, or if I was just remembering the movie because I had never seen it before, but the movie "The Girl Who Played With Fire" was so similar to "The Woman Who Lived in the Window" that I thought to myself "Oh no, not again!"  The main character is named "Linda" and she was a pretty girl in high
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. _____________. _____.  I love horror movies. I have been a fan of them ever since I first saw A Nightmare on Elm Street. I don't have a problem with gore and violence. I even like to see people die. I can even stand to see the gore. I am, however, not a fan to the point that I am easily frightened. I prefer horror films that have some sort of hope or light in their story. That's what the movie was lacking.   The movie starts out in the late 1970's with a woman named Carrie who lives in a large house with her husband and two daughters. One night, she hears a knocking on the door. She opens the door and finds a young man, named David, standing in front of her. She asks him why he is in her house. He replies, "I want to make love to your wife." He continues, "You have a beautiful young wife." She replies, no she doesn't. David then says, "Well, if you won't have me, I will make her my wife." The young man then says he will make the girl his wife as well. The woman says no. The young girl says, why not? David replies, she is a virgin. Carrie is shocked by this and says she will have him arrested. David replies that he will kill her and make her a bride. Carrie says no to that. David tells her that she won't be able to resist him, and she will be his forever. Carrie begs him to leave, but he won't. Carrie calls out for her husband, but no answer. David knocks again, and the woman screams and runs out of the house. David is still knocking, and Carrie continues to scream. David says, he has had enough. He takes a gun from his pocket and shoots her. He turns the gun on himself and commits suicide.  The film ends with the young girl looking up at the stars. She is the one who was rescued from this nightmare.     I had a few problems with this movie. The main one is that I found it hard to believe that the man who shot and killed his wife would commit suicide. It also seemed odd that a man would kill himself in a house. Another thing was that David was too young. I felt like it was a bit too easy for him to get away with murder. The other thing was the way Carrie was portrayed.

It could be good, it could be bad. You have to look at a film's content, and if it doesn't say anything interesting, it isn't worth seeing. There are a lot of bad films out there, but it takes a lot more effort to find one good one. If you really want to see the worst films ever made, go to YouTube and watch all the terrible things on there. Don't take my word for it, watch them for yourself. This film is just that bad, and I have no idea how anyone can stand it. I would love to go back and watch this movie for the first time, but I won't be able to do that, because I will probably have a mental breakdown. I hope you enjoy this movie, and hopefully it was just a bad dream. If this movie was actually a good movie, I would be willing to pay money to see it again. I will say that this film has a lot going for it: an interesting story, a great performance from Jeff Bridges, and an all around fun time. I'm going to go ahead and give this film a 5 out of 10.  …

The first time you watch a movie in a theater you're struck by the fact that the picture looks good, but the sound is terrible. When you watch the same movie on the TV with a Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound system, it sounds great. The problem is, the 5.2 is still out of reach for most people. It has a great image, but a crappy sound. How did we get here? When you buy a new home theater, you'll find a lot of "specialty" surround sound systems. These systems are expensive, but are typically more sophisticated than the "regular" surround. In the case of a typical surround sound set, you will usually have two speakers, and a "subwoofer" that sits behind the center channel speaker, but can move around inside the space to create the effect of surround sound. In most cases, the subwoofer is not a very good subwoofers, but rather a "passive" subwooper, and thus it's just going to pump out a very low volume (in comparison to the volume of the center speaker) and is going to get muffled if you have a lot to do in the middle of the movie. This is not good. So what do you do? In this section, I'm going to show you a set of 5.25 speakers with a subwoeter, and some simple ideas to improve the sound quality of a surround sound setup. These techniques will be especially useful if you're using a TV in a movie theater. ************************** * How to get surround sound without spending a fortune ******************************* The first thing you should know is that it's not easy. To get surround, you have to get a sub woofer and some very special speakers. In my opinion, a good set of speakers for surround sound is a $5000+ set of Audioengine 2.1 speakers. These are solid 5.75" speakers that have a nice tight bass, and they have a very big magnet in them. I have them, and my wife does, too. The best part is that they're a bit bigger than my 5.5" Bose speakers (the cheapest
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________"  There are some films I can see and enjoy, others that I find really boring, others I feel I need to see to fully understand the story and characters, and others I hate to watch for any reason, even if the ending is pretty awesome. In my opinion, The Devil's Backbone is a case in point. I think that it was probably the best movie I have ever seen, and one of the best films ever made, period. This is a story about two men, played by John Saxon and Dennis Christopher, who are out on a camping trip. They get lost, and soon find themselves in the middle of a murder mystery. It all starts with a girl named Sally (Susan Hayward), who runs into Saxon while she is out looking for a cabin in the woods. Saxon's character is the more sympathetic one, but the story is all about Saxon, and the fact that he's a pretty bad guy. In the beginning of the movie, we get to know Saxon better. His character has a pretty good backstory, and we learn a little bit about him as a person. He's a very charismatic guy, but he has a darker side to him as well. At the beginning, he tries to hide his darker nature, but as the movie progresses, it becomes pretty clear that he really is a monster. The rest of the story deals with how Saxon attempts to deal with this dark side of himself. What follows is a pretty incredible story, with some great acting from both Saxon (as well as Dennis Christopher) and Christopher. It's a real shame that there wasn't more of a movie made out of this, but I think it's a really good film, especially if you're a fan of the first one. I'm going to watch it again and again, as long as I can find a copy. The only problem I have is the fact there's only two complete endings to the film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  That's how I feel about the third installment of this trilogy.   While it has a few things I liked, it just isn't the same as the first two.   This is a very good movie that was poorly marketed.             I think it's time for a change.   The last movie was a very solid horror movie that has an interesting plot, a strong cast, and some very scary moments.    In this film, the director tries to make a horror movie like Saw, but it just doesn't work.                The movie starts out with a man in a wheelchair, who is walking into a store to buy a new wheelchair.   He is followed by a man who is also in a new chair.   They run into the man in the first chair, who attacks him.   As the man attacks him, the man falls out of the chair.  The man in wheelchair gets up and runs after him. Â  Meanwhile, the other man has a gun. � The man in first chair gets to the man and shoots him twice. �� �� He is hit and dies. ��� �� The man with the gun then gets to his dead friend.      ��� He takes his gun out and shoots the man with a crossbow.    The man falls to the ground and dies.�   The movie is about this man who killed the man that was in his wheelchair.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________________ 1/5 _______________________________________________________________________________ This is not a good movie. There is a really great movie right before this one that I would recommend you watch. This is a generic, boring movie that has nothing interesting about it. I can't say enough bad things about it: 1) The movie starts with a guy who is in a coma. After some time, he wakes up and is in hospital with a bunch of other people. He is being treated by doctors who don't know anything about him. It is a bit confusing because he's not even that stupid or stupidly stupid like in the first movie. The movie takes forever to get to the actual movie. I would have liked a little more time to get into it. It doesn't help that there are a lot of characters that don't get much screen time. 2) There is no explanation for anything in this movie. We have a couple of clues, but nothing is really explained. I don't understand how this is supposed to be a "movie". There are a few characters that are just there. They aren't important. 3) The script is bad. The story doesn't make any sense. You have no idea how the movie is supposed be set up. If this was a movie, I'd give it an F. 4) The music is not very good. It's ok, but not really great. It has nothing memorable about it or anything. 5) The acting is bad, the actresses are not good enough to act in a movie like this. _________________________________________________________________________________________________ 5/10 ______________________________________________________________________________________________ I think I got the worst movie of the year, but I'm still giving it an 8/10. The music, the actors, the acting and the story are bad, but this movie is still worth a watch. If you liked the first one, then I don´t recommend this one, but if you don't like it, then you have nothing to lose and a lot to gain by watching it. _______________________________________________________

My mom even went to the screening and was able to make some observations on the characters. I'm not sure if she found the movie interesting or not, but I certainly found it entertaining. I have a little bit of a soft spot for movies about animals and I have always been a huge animal lover. I think the movie is about a dog that lives with his best friend and when he dies he loses his best buddy, so he goes on a quest to find the owner. The best part is that when the dog finds the owner, it is actually a human being who is so much like the dog, that I was genuinely in love with her. ____________________________ The movie was shot in black and white, but there are lots of color shots and I think it was shot by a film student (not sure of the name of it). I thought it was really good, but it isn't a very complex movie. It is a story about a lonely dog that is on a search for his owner and a couple of people who have a pet dog that they love. The movie has some good acting, but also some bad acting. The bad actors are not in the movie all the time, but the bad actors do play a big part in the story. It was a fun movie to watch. I liked it because the actors were all good and the movie was entertaining. The worst part about this movie was that it is really sad. __________________  "We're just like you and me, only bigger." -Dora the Explorer

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  When you watch the first two hours of a bad film, the first ten minutes are the worst. I don't know about you, but that first ten minute is when I get the worst feeling in the world. I want to throw up. Then I go back and watch the other 90. Then the second 10. Then a third. Then four. The first time I watched The Crow, I knew it was a terrible film. I knew that it wasn't a great film. That is how bad it was. And it wasn?t a good film either. When I watched it again, the badness only increased. I could only imagine how awful it must have been to see it as a kid, watching it with my father. I thought it was terrible. It wasn? t.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "You're a good person." I've heard that one a million times, but it still hurts.  It's a common refrain I've heard from people who can't stand The Sixth Sense, but I'm always intrigued by the fact that they never once thought to question whether or not they were being generous or true when they told someone how they felt about it.  The movie itself is an incredible movie, and I'll tell you now that I was wrong about the original movie.   I was really expecting it to be a really, really awful movie, but that's not what happened.  It's one of the few movies I can remember where I didn't hate it, and when I finally saw it for the first time I thought that this was it, that I'd never see another movie that was this good again.  This is one of those movies where everything is in perfect sync, and the way everything was put together was brilliant.  If you think that the movie doesn't start off great, you're wrong.  The movie starts off with a man who is in the middle of a terrible car crash.  He's in the hospital, and he's very, very, VERY sick.  His eyes are not functioning, his hands are paralyzed, and you can see the flesh just falling off of his face.  What's more is that he can't see anything.  No color, no movement, nothing.  All he can do is talk to himself.  There are a lot of things going on in this movie, as there are in all great horror movies, but this one really has it going for it. There's a lot going on, and it all makes sense.    The Sixth Sensing is one hell of a movie, even though it's a remake.  And it's really not a bad remake, because it does a really good job of making you care about this guy.  One thing that I really appreciate about this movie is the way it was filmed.  As mentioned before, there are a few times where you feel like the camera is just hovering over this guy's face, and that makes you feel that something is very wrong with this guy and this movie.   So what did I think about the movie?  I thought it was good.  In the beginning, I was afraid of the movie, because I thought the ending would be so horrible.  I mean, he was a

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Don't do it. You'll ruin a good movie for everyone. If you've read this far, you are probably one of those who loves bad movies. So don't do this, but if you do do it, don't read my review of it. Just stop reading it and go watch it. Read the bad movie description. I've never written one before. Just get in there and watch it with me. If there are any spoilers here, you've probably already seen the movie. You know that it's bad. I'm just letting you know.  The movie is called "Bored". It was a remake of a movie called "Stuck" (which is a remake). The remake is a great movie. It's actually better than the original, and if you haven't seen it, then I recommend you to watch it! It's funny, it's sad, it has an amazing plot, and the acting is good. I loved the story, and I loved it when it ended. It was my favorite of the three movies. I was so happy to see a good old movie that I watched in the 80s. I don't think I'll ever watch a remake that good again. If I ever get to see "Stick", I'm gonna watch that one too. 1) The movie opens with a woman named Susan talking about how much she loves her husband. She says that she doesn't want a divorce, she loves him. Then she mentions that she is thinking of leaving him. Her husband is called Jim. She mentions that he's not too bad a guy. The movie is based on the book "Struck By Lightning" by Jane Austen. The book is about a woman who leaves her husband for another man. Susan and Jim have a nice relationship, and he has a nice job. When he tells her about it, she starts crying and tells him to tell her husband, and she tells him about how they are getting a divorce. They start talking about the future of their marriage, and when they are talking about their kids, they start to get serious. The ending of the movie is good, but it's a little hard to understand because the actors are not speaking properly. When Susan tells Jim that she wants a divorce and that she's leaving, the movie jumps to the next scene. The next scene is the scene when Jim tells Susan about the divorce. The way the movie does it is that the scene
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. If you hate this movie, you will not enjoy any of the other movies that come out. If it's a good movie, like the others, you'll love it. If this is a bad film, you won't care. So what is it about this movie that makes it so bad? It's just not good. It's not even bad, just not very good. There's no plot, no good performances, no bad acting, no dialogue. It has some good special effects, and some very good sets, but those sets don't do it for me. They are a bit bland. They don't really bring the movie to life. There is nothing going on, except for a few shots and a few close-ups. There are two characters, but only one of them has any presence. The other is just a very plain person who just stands there. He has a few lines, but they are so bad that I can't even say anything good about them. This movie is just plain. It doesn't have anything going on. It just kind of drags on and on and I can feel that it is really taking its time to get to the point. I've never seen a movie where there was such a long wait between the opening and the last line. And it really is a long movie, too. The second half is a bit better, but it still drags and it doesn't get any better. There just isn't anything going for this movie. I hate to give this movie an 8, because it is a good film, but not really good.

If your a horror fan, this is a must watch. If not, just watch the comedy, you will not be disappointed
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  This movie was a complete disaster, but there are many other movies that suck, too. _________________ This movie was in fact a complete fiasco. It had an original script written by one of the most notorious writers of the time. His name was Richard Matheson. He wrote a few other books on his own and his wife wrote this one. It was originally supposed to be a big blockbuster and it got cancelled because the producers were so busy making other movies, so they had to cut all the dialogue and add scenes they could cut from the movie. The only real scene of importance in this movie was that of the wife's sex life, so she got a big orgasm, but when she got back to the hotel she started to feel cold and wanted to go back to bed, but the husband was really horny and wanted her to do something else, so he raped her, and the wife felt bad and couldn't stop him. She asked her husband why she was still naked when he had raped her and he replied that he had to have sex with her because he was a man and he couldn't have sex without a woman. So she had to do what he wanted. It's really disgusting to see this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ This was the worst movie I have ever seen. It is about a group of friends who go to a party and are given a drug that makes them feel like they are floating in a movie theater. It then turns out they are actually in a big house, and they are trapped in the basement. I would give this movie an A, except for the ending. The last 15 minutes were just terrible, and it just took a real toll on me. I think the actors were all on drugs and they didn't really care. The movie just made me want to scream at the screen, and then the ending was really bad. This movie is a waste of money, but I guess you can't go wrong with the title. It was so bad, that I had to watch it over and over to get a good ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________. Your review will help other people find the movie they're looking for. ____________________________  The film is a classic, but for some reason it is hard to find a copy, and I think it has been lost to time. The director was George Stevens, who did such classics as The Quiet Man, The General, and The Man Who Knew Too Much, but this was the one that was a hit with the masses. The movie is about a war hero who is haunted by the memories of the war, and the man he killed. The man has a wife and two young children, and he is haunted every day by the loss of his family. He is a man that can't go on, and yet, he does. The only thing that is holding him back is his wife, who he has been married to for twenty years. The story is told in flashbacks, but the story is actually told from the point of view of the husband. The wife's memory of the time she spent with the man in the war is haunting her, and she starts to have nightmares, and eventually, she dies. The memories of her husband are haunting her too, and one night, she wakes up and finds herself back at the time of the battle, and there is nothing she can do to save him. In the morning, he tells her that he will never see her again, and that it is time for her to move on. When he is killed by his wife's friend, she moves on to a different man, but he too has been killed in the same war. Her husband has become an object, and a ghost, haunting her. There is a great deal of violence in this movie, and it's a great watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  It's hard to tell the good from the bad, but the following is a good example of what a bad film can look like:  "The film, which is directed by director Brian Helgeland, stars the young actors and has a very light, funny tone. It's a film about a couple who fall in love, and the first act of the film takes place on a beach in the sun. Then it is a flashback to the couple's previous relationship, and it starts to get darker and darker. There is no real emotional or dramatic arc, but it does feel like a slow death. The film is also pretty long, at around 90 minutes." (From a review by Eric D. Johnson)  While a movie is fun to watch, it's often not worth the time and effort to make. That's not the case with "Dawn of the Dead." While it's a very low-budget film, its quality and the fact that it is based on a comic book, means that it could easily pass for a classic. But in the end, it just doesn't work.  The script is terrible, the acting is atrocious, and most of the effects are terrible. The plot is nonsensical and poorly constructed. There's even a few moments of cringe-worthy humor, but this is still a movie that shouldn't be missed. It may not be as good as "The Fly" or "Escape from New York," but it's still a good watch for a quick laugh or two.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "the movie sucks!" is a popular comment. I've seen this movie a few times, but I never understood why it's such a popular movie among fans. It's a really poor movie. It doesn't even try to have a story. It just jumps from one scene to another, and the action is so boring and poorly done. This movie is based on the novel by Robert Heinlein, and it is just an excuse for one of his characters to get involved in a war. It has a bunch of other interesting characters, but the plot is just so weak. I mean, the movie is supposed to be about a war between aliens and humans, but we never get a clue as to who is fighting who. It turns out that the aliens are aliens and the humans are humans. The story is just a bunch of jump cuts between aliens attacking and the soldiers fighting back. The movie never explains what the aliens do, or why they are doing it. It makes the movie boring. I don't even want to mention what the bad guys do. The ending is really lame. I know it's supposed to show that humans and aliens are at war, but they just use a bunch more jump cuts to show the same thing. It really makes the ending look cheap. There's even a whole scene at the end where we don't know what the war is about. The only thing I really enjoyed about this movie was the song "This Galaxy's Only Green" by Frank Zappa. That song was just so cool! I really hope this movie gets a sequel. It needs one!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Feb 8, 2016 | By KENNY JACOBSON |     I'll admit I wasn't as excited to see the new Avengers movie as I was to see The Avengers in theaters last year. I didn't have a lot of confidence in the MCU at first, but I quickly grew to appreciate it as the films progressed. I don't think I was even aware of the presence of The Avengers on the big screen until I was sitting in the theater watching Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The movie is absolutely incredible. The first act is fantastic and the action is fantastic. When the film switches to Loki, he is such an interesting character and his presence makes me believe in the Avengers even more. He makes us question our beliefs and how we perceive each other in the world. He is the villain and the most powerful one in the movie but he also is a very sympathetic villain and a really great villain to watch. The only complaint I have about the film is that it's over so quickly. We are already on our second act and I felt that the film could have had a little more. I wish they had been able to continue the story for a little longer.  Rating: ★★★☆☆ (A-)
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________ This movie is just not a good movie at all. I don't know if it is the director or the writing or the actors that are to blame but the movie just doesn't seem to be very interesting or funny. I am not sure why they made this movie or what it was trying to be but the story was so bad and the ending was so weird that it just really left me confused and frustrated. The story is about a kid named Tommy (Michael C. Hall) who has a weird power to control animals. Tommy wants to be a superhero and when he is asked to go to a place called "Earth" to save the world, he is told by the people at the place that they don't really care about Earth and that there are monsters and aliens living on Earth. Tommy is told that there is a big monster in the center of the Earth and if he kills it then all the monsters on Earth will die. Tommy refuses and is sent back to Earth but he can't go back to his home planet because there is something wrong with the Earth in the back of his mind. When Tommy comes back to the place where he killed the monster, the people are waiting for him and the only way he can save the Earth is to kill all the people who live there and the monster is in the heart of the town of Earth. There is nothing about the movie that makes it interesting or fun. The movie just is a boring mess of a movie that I don,t know why they did it. There are a lot of horrible plot holes that the movie is trying to explain. I can't even understand what is going on in the movie. I guess you could say that the plot is "explaining" the movie but that is just a bad excuse. The writing in this movie was so terrible. There were a lot things that were written in the wrong order. The most important thing about this movie is the bad acting by Michael C. and the horrible acting by J.J. Abrams. I just couldn't believe how bad the acting was in this film. Michael C Hall really has a terrible acting voice. The bad acting in this terrible movie just makes me think of the old "The Brady Bunch" series of cartoons. I would like to think that they had a really talented writer for this movie because the writing was so horrible that it made me wonder why they even made this film at all, especially when they could have just written a

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________ A very bad movie. This is the story of a man who was trying to make money by making a movie. He makes a film called "The Big Sleep" that was really good, and then his wife leaves him and he decides to commit suicide. So he goes to a cabin in the woods and tries to kill himself. He tries to cut his wrist with a knife, and it's a little difficult, and he cuts himself some more. So the next morning, he's still trying to kill him, and as he's cutting himself, he finds a little vial of a very powerful drug that will put his mind in a different state. He takes a big shot of the drug and it has an effect on him and makes him think that he's in a dream, and that it's his wife that he killed. The only problem is, that the film is really bad, so the viewers are completely taken away by this story. The story is told very badly. The characters are not realistic, and I would have given this a one if the actors had been better. The acting is pretty good though, and the music is nice. I don't understand why this film is so bad, but I guess it's just too early for bad films. __________________________________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What it was:  a movie about a young boy's struggle to make sense of his family life and what's happening in the world.  What it is: ______________________________ The movie starts out with the boy as a child, going out to a park and falling into a well, but when he comes out he doesn't look so bad.  He doesn't seem to be hurt at all, and he decides that the world is better than it was when he fell in the well. Â The boy's father (Bill Murray) decides to get a new car.  Â He goes to the garage and pulls out a new engine.  One of his sons (Mark Wahlberg) comes over and tells him that he doesn`t want to go.  He thinks that his dad needs to get something done.  It gets worse when his father and his mother come home, and his mom says that he should leave his family, because she can't stand them anymore.  The father (Murray) decides that he needs a car and goes to a dealership and buys a new one.  In the back of the dealership is a man (Michael Stuhlbarg) who tries to get the car for his son.  Stuhlbg tries to help him get the license, but he refuses.  When the salesman tells him about how he was in the car wreck, the salesman is killed.  Now the dad is trying to get his son the license to get it for himself, but the kid refuses to get in.  They go to the next dealership, and the salesman there tells them that the kid is not allowed in. Then he leaves the dealership and the kid comes over, and they make up a story about how the salesman was a bad person and that he left his son in the desert to die.  Then the boy and his father go to an abandoned house where they try to make a new story, and this time they tell the truth.  That salesman was killed in a car wreck.  At the end, they are back to the dealer, and their new car is ready.  But when they get to the car, they realize that the salesman never died.  After the movie is over, I thought that I should have seen it.  Not because it was a good movie, but because it showed how easy it was to be manipulated by people.  I had heard a lot about the movie and thought it

This movie is so bad that you are forced to laugh, it makes you want to scream, and make you feel horrible about yourself. The main characters are pathetic and make no sense. Their personalities are so shallow and ridiculous. They do not deserve to be on screen, I would never watch this movie. ______________ (the movie's title) has no good points and is not worth watching.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ It's the worst film I've ever seen. If it had a title, I would have had a clue about what it was. There are no words to describe how I feel about it. This film is a train wreck of epic proportions. The story is so bad that I can't tell what is going on. There is absolutely nothing to like about this film. I don't know if this is a sequel or what, but I hope it's not. The acting is terrible, the plot is a mess, and it takes forever for anything to happen. I wish I could give it 0 stars. I would hate to have seen the horrible end to this film, and would love to see the director get fired. There was a scene in this movie that is just plain offensive. It is not funny at all. It's really disgusting. I'm sorry that this was made. The plot of this film is really bad. The first 30 minutes are about the hero saving his father from a mob. But he doesn't even know his father. He doesn't know that his father is a gangster. This movie is about a group of thugs. The next 30 minutes is about them robbing a bank. They rob the bank, and then the next 30 is about the gangsters killing everyone. It really doesn't make sense to me. At one point, they take out two cops in the bank. Then they rob the cops and kill them. Then the next thirty is about everyone running to the church to get help. And then it takes a long time for the church guys to save them. I just don't understand what this movie is. I can understand a lot of things about this movie. The film is about two gangs, and they are at war. But this movie doesn't seem to care about that. There isn't a single bad guy in this film that I care about. The gangsters seem like one-dimensional people. There's a scene where a gangbanger kills a man who was robbing a store. Then he gets his head cut off. The police find the man's body and they say that the man got hit with a baseball bat. Then there is another scene where the guy is killing another man. Then another gang member kills him. Then a cop shoots him. I guess that's what happens when you go to war with a gang. But then there's a third scene. I have no idea what happened there. It was so horrible that

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ Do yourself a favor and just do not watch this movie. It is a terrible movie that has no plot and is a very bad film in general. If you are a fan of horror and action movies you would do better to avoid this movie, otherwise it is just a terrible experience. The acting is bad as usual and there are very few action scenes in this movie that I have seen. This movie has all the horror and gore of the slasher movies but nothing new. The movie is a big rip off of the Saw movie. I think this is what makes the movie so bad, if it were a movie about a murderer it would be ok but it is nothing more than a horrible movie. The ending of the movie is very sad and I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I would rather have watched Saw 2 than watch this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** I have seen this movie three times now and have yet to find anything to make me say "I know why this movie is so bad." In the first scene when they see the body the actor seems to be a little off because he is off putting and seems like a guy who has a problem with his voice. This was the most uncomfortable scene I have ever seen. The second scene was the best scene. They did a great job of showing the horror of being on the set with no safety nets. This scene was so brutal and realistic and they showed how the cast was getting ready to go into a movie. The scene with the two girls who were supposed to be actresses was very well done and gave you a good idea of the true horrors of the movie. This is a very bad movie and will not be getting a release in any form. This movie is a complete waste of money and I will not recommend this movie to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ If you want to give a movie a bad review, make sure you are in the right mood for it. There's nothing more frustrating than watching a bad film and then having to listen to people complaining about how bad it is. But this isn't a bad picture. The acting is very good. The cinematography is great, the story is good, the editing is excellent. It's a good film, but it's not a great film. If you don't mind bad movies, this is one. I'd give it a 4 out of 5, but then I'd have to explain why I thought it was a 4 and not a 5.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ My review: __________________________________________ I really did not like this movie. I know I'm supposed to hate it but it was just boring and a lot of the story lines were not interesting. I think it's supposed to be a horror movie but it's so poorly done. The acting is terrible and the story line was just a lot to think about. It had a very generic feel to it and I was really disappointed with this movie at first. I'll be honest I never wanted to see this movie, but I saw it in the theater and it just did not look like it was going to be any good. It was a very long movie and I had to sit through the whole thing. It also did not have any music so I had no idea what was going on. I felt like I was watching a documentary on the inside of a movie. This movie did not do anything for me, and I'm not even sure I want to watch another horror movie from this guy. I don't recommend this movie to anyone, and you should just avoid this movie completely.

I was 11 years old and had no idea what was going on. It was a Sunday afternoon and my family was sitting in the living room when the movie came on. My brother, my parents and I sat on the couch. It took me a few seconds to realize that this movie wasn't even a movie. It seemed like an animated cartoon. It wasn't until I turned off the movie that I realized what was happening.  As I was watching the movie, I started thinking about what I had been doing in my life, why I had become the way I was. It is hard to explain what I was thinking when the next thing I remember is waking up in my room with my father sitting on my bed. - I am 11 years of age. I have no idea why I am thinking about this. - I am still in my father's bed. I am scared. - My father is standing over me. - He starts screaming at me, telling me that I am going to be a terrible girl. - As I start crying, he starts pulling out my hair. - His hand is still on my hair when I wake up the next morning. - The image of my father holding my hair in his hand still stays with me. : )  I have no clue how to describe this movie. I know it's not a movie but it's still pretty hard to put in words. I've seen other people talk about it and I have read some descriptions online, but I have never actually watched it. The movie is so dark that you will never see a happy ending, it's very sad. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie with kids because it's just a really dark and depressing movie. .
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ "This movie is the epitome of a bad comedy. The whole movie is basically a plot to trick the audience. The movie has a twist and surprise, but the movie does not give the audience a reason to be excited. The entire movie is a plot by the author, and I think he should have given more details on what he was going to do with the plot and what the movie was actually about. Also, I feel that this movie is not as good as the first movie. There is not a lot of changes in the story, the characters are still the same, but I do not feel that the movie has the same impact. I think that this second movie could have been a good idea for a movie, but this is not. It is just a bad idea. This movie has too many flaws to be good, and its not worth the time. It was a great idea for an idea, but it was too bad."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ This movie is garbage. It's terrible, it's bad, it sucks, it doesn't even know what it is, it is boring and it has no ideas or anything that makes it a movie. The best thing about this movie is that you have to be dead drunk to watch it. It makes me feel like a fool for having a hard time watching a movie that I hate, but at least I have a memory to go on. It is one of those movies where you sit down and you just go with it. If you watch it with a group of friends, you may get a bit more out of it, but the rest of the time, it just sucks. The only thing I liked about this was that there were a few people who actually looked like they were having fun watching the movie. It also gave me a good laugh at some of the things the actors said, but other than that, it wasn't funny at all. If it had been on TV, I'd have given it a 3/10. If this was on a VHS, I would give it a 4/10, because it has so many bad jokes and stupid lines. If I was a real person, I probably would have given this a 1/10 because the movie was just so bad that it was just boring.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly".  The Good:   An impressive production that really doesn't try to be anything other than what it is:  A (relatively) bad movie that was released in 1935.  The Bad:    An epic failure that was so bad it made me want to throw up.   "The Bad" was a film that was shot with one of the most extreme lenses ever made.  In fact, it looks like it was shot by using a tractor lens.  The "bad" movie:  The film is about the rebel forces in the American Civil War.  One of the men in the film, "Big Red", has a bad back and doesn't work very well.  His fellow soldier, "Little Red", does not work much better.  While the two men are fighting, they find themselves fighting for each other.  Little Red says " I'm going to die for you." and "You're going to live for me."  It's a touching moment, but not the movie.  A bad-movie-tear-jerker:  As a movie, "The Good" is terrible.  In fact, it tears at your soul as a viewer.  I felt for the two characters, but that was my fault for enjoying a bad film.  What's even worse is that "The Bad", which was filmed in 1932, was shot for a low budget.  It was shot in a studio and had very little to do with the original story.  Even the music sounds like a rearrangement of a 1930's song.  If it wasn't for the fact that this film was so terrible, it could be worth watching.  Sadly, it is not.  "The Ugly"  is a better movie.   It has a better story and a better cast.  But " The Unexpected"  has better acting and a more interesting plot.  When it was released in 1938, it was the highest grossing movie of all time.  Yet, despite its box office success, the film never earned any respect.   Why?     Because it was produced

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Share On Facebook Tweet Pin It Email  "Buddy Buddy" is the perfect story for a film. It is one of the most loved and celebrated comedies of all time. In it, Richard Pryor plays a character named "Muddy" (played by Gene Wilder) who lives in a small town. His wife is away on a mission and he has a job working at the local gas station. When a truck full of coal leaves, the gas station has to hire a man to haul it away. The truck is filled with coal which Muddy believes is "stupid stuff" and he wants to take a break from it. He gets his chance when a truck of coal rolls by and he's tempted to throw it in. When Muddy tries to dispose of it, he is surprised to find that he doesn't have a shovel. His neighbor (Jerry Lewis) comes by and tells him that the coal is being loaded at a nearby mine. Muddy decides to try to stop it. The coal is loaded and the truck stops at the mine and Muddy runs to it. While there, he sees a strange man on the mine roof, and when he sees him, he runs out of the mine. When he reaches the street, he gets the idea to run back to the mine with the coal and retrieve it. When the coal comes down the mine shaft, Muddy gets caught in a large, spinning coal wheel and his life is saved by a friend who is running away from the mine, trying to get away from it all. When everyone else sees him and runs away, Muddie has no choice but to run after them and they come back to see him. He manages to get them to safety and returns to the house. At first, the neighbors are happy with him, but when they find out what he did, they're angry. When it comes time for his wife to come home, Maddy (Gene Wilder), the wife of his neighbor, comes home and finds Muddy with his pants down. Maddy then has to help him clean up the mess. Mudd is then surprised to see her at home. Middletown is a very small town and it has a lot of old people, and Maddy is no exception. When they start to argue, it's time for the husband to go back to work. Mookie, the neighbor's son, is jealous and wants

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________ 1) "The Big Chill" is the movie. A big-budget, Hollywood-produced horror film, and one of the most ridiculous and stupid things I have ever seen. I'm sure the studio did this movie to sell a sequel, which is a given, but to call this movie a sequel to "The Shining" is absurd. This movie is not about the haunted hotel, but about an actor, a guy named Jack Nicholson. His character is obsessed with a woman he met in a bar. She was an actress, but never starred in a movie. He became a fan of her, and he started to fantasize about her. His obsession became a nightmare, and now he is trying to escape the hotel with the help of some of his friends. The film ends in a stupid way, where the characters are running through a huge building, and the camera just pans around. There is no explanation as to why they are in a building, why they need to run around it, why it is scary, why the actors were involved, and why it ended in a ridiculous way. I am not going to explain the movie any further, because I have nothing else to say about it. Just don't watch it, it is awful. I recommend that no one watch this movie. 2) "Eyes Wide Shut" is a porno film. I don't really have anything else to add. 3) "Jaws" is an action movie. The only thing that could make it a good movie would be if they changed the name to "Jurassic Park" and made it a family movie. It would be like a kids' movie where they could talk about dinosaurs. 4) "Ghostbusters" is another movie that should be avoided. The main character is called Bill Murray. He is supposed to be a comedian, but the movie shows that he is a really nasty, arrogant, nasty person. I won't even describe the movie here. It is just horrible. 5) "Dr. Strangelove" is about a Russian general, played by Peter Sellers. He has a terrible time in the world, because the government is incompetent and evil. He thinks that he should destroy the world. He wants to use nuclear weapons. He gets a nuclear bomb that he uses to blow up the White House. The bomb never goes off, because it was too stupid. 6) "Lolita" is supposed, but I don´t like it

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This movie is a waste of time and is not worth a second of your time. The movie is about a girl who is pregnant and is having a hard time getting through it. She is a single mom and she has two small kids. The director wanted to add a few scenes and change a few things. It is not what the film should have been about. If you are pregnant or you have kids, do not watch this movie. The kids are annoying and the whole movie is boring. I would rather watch the first part of the film about a man who gets married. If they are going to change a scene, they should have made the marriage more interesting. I hate how they changed the whole ending of the movie. I think the movie should have ended with the guy giving his girl a fake abortion. He has a good ending. This movie will make you angry and have a bad time. I thought I was watching a drama. This is a bad comedy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You're a bad person for disliking this movie. You should have loved it. I am so disappointed that this movie is so awful.  I love this movie, but it was a total disappointment.    You're a little kid when you first watch it, but then you see it and realize it was an awful movie.  The movie is a re-telling of the fairy tale "A Christmas Carol" and is set in a snowy setting, so the kids are in a big snow-covered forest and the narrator tells the story of Ebenezer Scrooge.    He has a wife named Mary and a son named Ralph.    He comes across a little girl who is stuck in the woods.  It is very cute, but the movie was awful and so were the kids.  I have heard that a special edition was made for Christmas, and I believe it was the only one that was made in that year.  This version of the movie is not the one that originally was shown on TV.  The special edition movie was very short and it was only shown in theaters.  What was interesting about the special edition is that there was no sound at all.  There was no music, and it seemed like the actors were on their own.  When the kids were in the forest, they were not talking to each other.  My daughter had trouble understanding a few things that the adults were saying.  She asked if they were ghosts or if there was a monster.  All the adults looked very old.  As far as I know, this is the only movie that has a very old man in it.  In the beginning of the film, there is a song called "Little Red Riding Hood".  There are several different versions of the song that they play, and you have to figure out which version you're listening to.  Most of the versions play the same thing.  You have to listen to the whole song to find out what version you are listening to, and that is what was very confusing for my daughter.  One of the songs played in the movie that was in the song is called "Santa Claus is Coming to Town".  My granddaughter was listening to the song and said "Santas is coming to town".  She said "I love him", and I knew she wasn't talking about Santa.  A few people have mentioned that there is some really creepy music in this movie that doesn

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ What is a good movie? What is the best movie I have seen in a long time? A movie that's just a bad dream, like an out of body experience? A dream that you are not allowed to wake up from? A nightmare that you will never forget? I have to say that it's not a dream. This movie has so much going for it, but it does not live up to the hype. I'm glad I've seen it, and I can say it was worth the time I spent watching it. But if you are thinking about watching this movie, then I can't help you, because it's just not worth it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ "A story that seems to be a bad film but really isn't, and it works" (Barry L. Newman, The Boston Globe, May 27, 1971)  "The Manchurian Candidate" is a thriller based on a novel by Philip K. Dick. It tells the story of an American political prisoner in the 1950's, John Conroy, who was sent to China to assassinate a politician and his son. The movie was filmed in China and was released in China only in 1980. The film is a classic.  One of the things that stands out in the movie is the dialogue. The dialogue in the film is in the style of the late 1950's. The main character, Conroy is a bit of a caricature and doesn't have much of a personality. The reason why the movie works so well is because the film was shot in China.    One interesting thing that the film did do was that it did not go along with the Western stereotype of the Chinese as evil. The Chinese are portrayed as having a good heart and trying to do what is right. .   Plot   The movie opens with a Chinese soldier shooting a man at a bus stop. He is captured and the man is found dead. He claims that he had been shot by the Chinese soldier and then the Chinese man shoots him again and kills him. Conroy arrives at the bus stop and sees a body laying on the ground. Conoy is shocked and tells the Chinese guard to get the body away from the scene. The guard does and Conoy leaves. He finds out that the man was the political candidate and the politician is a spy for the Americans. He goes to a restaurant where he meets a Chinese girl who has a daughter who is in a Chinese orphanage. Conry and the Chinese girl have a conversation and the girl reveals that she has been a political prisoner since the 1950s.  (Conroy's character is a Chinese prisoner at the time. He was sent by the CIA to assassinate the politician and was tortured and interrogated by the Americans to help find a scapegoat. He has been there since the mid 1950's and is now a political activist. He had been told by the American military that if he could get a Chinese Communist to kill the politician that they would give him a medal. Cony has come to the orphanage to get a picture of the politician for the American government. After being told by his friends that they

I'm glad they're doing this because the movies have gotten worse and worse and I really wanted to like it. The acting was so bad. Not one person in the movie was good, but I'm sure that's because they were all terrible. So, they're going to do a remake of it. I'll keep my negative review to myself because it was crap.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********  This movie is garbage. It is a horror film that tries to scare the viewer by playing on old horror clichés and then goes overboard. The film is a mess and is just so stupid. It also makes some pretty cheap and bad jokes. It's a terrible movie and I think this is why so many people are not going to watch it. It should be called the worst movie ever made. It was made by a guy who hates horror and is making it up as he goes along.  I give this movie a D+.

It's just not as good as 'A View To A Kill.' It's not a good movie. I'm sure if you had seen that you wouldn't have a problem with it." - Tom Shadyac, The Guardian "I don't want to say that this is a bad Bond movie, but it's certainly not as brilliant as 'From Russia With Love.' I'm not a great Bond fan, but this is just a disappointment." - Kevin Smith "The action is pretty lame and the story doesn't have enough twists and turns." - The Independent "The film is basically an exercise in futility. It is a film about a man who thinks he is in the midst of a plot to kill him and he is just standing there waiting for them to show up and shoot him, which happens about halfway through the film." - Christopher Booker "A pretty good movie in the tradition of 'A Hard Day's Night' and 'From Moscow With Love,' but not a masterpiece." - Entertainment Weekly "It is one of those rare films that manages to make its audience want to sit through a whole two hours of boring action sequences and wait for the twist to come." - Pauline Kael, in a review of From Russia With Hate  Sean Paul - Slap Trap  by iPromote4Free  Reggae

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "this is an extremely unprofessional, and poorly made movie" "the ending was very unsatisfying, it was very over the top, and left a lot to be desired, but at the same time, I feel that it was what the movie was all about" 1.      A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2008) A.I.'s director   Anthony Tully  (who is not known for his cinematic abilities) created a futuristic world, in which a computer can understand human emotions and thoughts. The movie has been criticized for its gory violence and sex scenes, which have caused some trouble for its marketing and   release. But A. I. has a lot of good points, and is a beautiful film. The main character, Samantha, is an android who has been created to serve a military operation. After being captured and interrogated, Samantha breaks down and tells her story to a scientist in order to get her freedom. Samantha is a complex character, who is trying to survive in a humiliating situation. The main premise of the movie is the story of Samantha, and her quest to find her "father".  The story is told in two parts: the first part, in the form of a flashback, follows the story from when she was born until when she gets captivated by a human male. In the second part, which is about two weeks after she has been released from captivity, she goes on a journey with a man named "Dawson", who is the man she is in love with. The man, Dawson, also happens to be her "brother", and they have a lot in common. Samantha, trying to escape her captors, tries to get close to Dawson. As she is travelling through the desert, she is being pursued by a mysterious group of terrorists. It is the first time that Samantha is involved in a fight scene, which has a lot of interesting set pieces. The action is not very well executed, but still, it is impressive and effective.  The most impressive thing about A. I., is the fact that it is based on a novel by Robert Sawyer. The story of A. I. has an interesting theme
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ I think I've seen this movie about 10 times now. The same actors play the same parts. I've been waiting for the story to be changed. It was a good movie, but I didn't think it was as good as it could be. If I remember correctly, the movie was supposed to have the death of a girl that was supposed have a tragic ending. It's not a tragedy, it was just a plot device to get the movie to a very short time limit. I think it's just a terrible movie. If you want to watch something to kill time, go watch a TV show.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ How could a movie that is about a group of kids at a boarding school (not a very nice place), be such a train wreck? The first half of the film is good, but the second half is just awful. The first two thirds is about the kids at the boarding school. They are the most stereotypical and annoying characters I have seen in a long time. They all act as if they are too dumb to even know what they are doing. Then there is the coach, who is just another annoying character. It seems he is just the coach from another school. He is just there to annoy the kids and make them think they are smart. I thought it was weird that the coach had to act so tough. It was almost as if he had been given some kind of drug to make him act like this. I mean, he doesn't look like he could take it. The kids don't either. I was so annoyed by these characters that I wanted to punch them in the face. They should have been more of a distraction. The only thing that was good was the kids dancing in the gym. But, even that was boring and pointless. This movie just made me want to hit someone in the head. There is no point in the movie. The acting is bad, the directing is bad. I really don't like this movie. It's just so bad that I want to give it zero stars. There was a part in this movie where the coach was in the room and he was going on and on about how the boys at the school were a bunch of losers. I just couldn't stand it. This is the same coach who yelled at the kids for being so stupid. The one thing I did like was that the parents were pretty good. I didn't really understand what they were saying at times, but they were trying to be supportive of their kids. They were acting like they really didn't want their kids to get in trouble. The parents were really nice. But I think the kids should have done something to solve the problem.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Do NOT see this movie. Do NOT go see this. Do not watch this. It's bad. _______________ The first half of this movie is really good. It is not great. I will say this though, it's not as bad as the trailers make it out to be. It has some good ideas and great acting. This movie really has a lot of potential and could have been good. The second half is a mess. The plot is awful. The movie gets completely thrown out the window. It becomes about a guy with a bad case of acne and a group of people who all want to have sex with him. They all are so annoying and ridiculous. One of them is an idiot who has no personality and is a horrible actor. It doesn't make sense. It makes no sense at all. It really should have been a movie about someone who has a case of a cold. The other half is just bad. This half of the movie is not bad at all, but it's really not good. They really go overboard with the sex scenes. They have to do that to be exciting. The actors are so bad. The whole movie just is a bunch of stupid jokes. They go overboard on the jokes. The jokes are terrible. It gets really boring. It should be a comedy. The first 15 minutes of the first half is really funny. It does have a lot to offer. The rest of the film is just terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________ If you've seen a bad film, you've probably watched it a lot of times. It's hard to tell where a bad part of the movie ended and the good parts began, but you'll know what I'm talking about when you see a bad one. It can be a frustrating experience to watch a film that's not good, and you want it to be so bad that you can't imagine it being good at all. I've seen this movie a lot over the years, and I'm sure it's one of the worst films I've ever seen. This movie is just bad. I thought it was going to be a fun, lighthearted comedy, and then it just got worse and worse. It wasn't funny and it was not entertaining. It was just terrible. I was embarrassed for my father, who saw it with me and watched it over and over. I didn't want him to know I saw this terrible movie. It made me feel like I was an idiot for watching a movie about a group of losers, and it really was embarrassing. It also makes me feel bad for my parents, because I think they must have hated this movie as much as I did. This film was a terrible disappointment.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________   This is a very, very bad movie. Not a very good movie, but not a very bad one either. The director has given it a very mediocre title. It is called 'L.A. Confidential', and it is not a good movie. The movie starts with some good scenes, with some really good dialogue, with a good plot, and with a great performance from Sean Connery, but there is no plot, no character development, no real story. It's just a bunch of shots of people talking. It has no suspense, no action, and no character. It doesn't make any sense. It just is what it is.   I could watch this movie over and over again and not get bored. I would watch it over and again and get bored, but it would never make me care what happens to these people. It would never be as good as 'Heat', it would not be as funny as 'Thunderball', it wouldn't have as much action as 'Rocky', it couldn't be as intense as 'Dr. Strangelove', it could not have the same sense of style as 'Lolita' or as profound as 'Romeo and Juliet'. I would probably just keep watching it, over and Over again and never care about anything, but I think I have said enough. I will not bother watching it any more. I give it a 3/10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________  I was very disappointed. This movie is about the real life murder of a police officer. The movie has some amazing scenes that show how the real thing happened and the cops struggle to save the life of the victim. The actors portraying the cops are also very good. I just didn't like the movie at all.  - A good movie, but the ending made me very angry. The ending made no sense. The main cop character and the detective were supposed to get to the house and find the body. They get there and find a gun in the kitchen, which is what the cop wants to find. They start to look in the house for the gun. It turns out the body is in the basement and the killer hid it there and then left the gun behind. The detective then finds it and the guy shoots him. The cop then gets shot and the movie ends. The police officer then has to go into the house to get the body to the police station. It's at this point the detective comes in the room and the gun is pointed at him. Then the detective gets shot. The guy who did it was a black guy who had a long history of drug dealing and had murdered a cop earlier.    The movie is a good movie. But the ending just did not add up to me. It just didn´t make sense. .

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you like the movie, then please give it a chance. If you're one of those people that doesn't like movies and has never seen one before, then go see it. Don't let it get to you. Don't let it stop you from seeing a movie, because you'll have a blast. If it's bad, then don't see it in the first place. Just see it again and again until it gets good.  That's the only way to find out.   But don't expect anything that you've never seen before.  What I'm trying to say is, don't judge a book by its cover. If someone's telling you they want to see a movie that's not a movie at all, then be sure to ask them what they're talking about. If they have no idea what they mean, then it's probably not a good idea to give it to them.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  1. A movie's success is based on the way in which it appeals to the general public, not the actual people who see it. 2. If you want to make a good movie, you have to make it for the general audience, not for people who don't understand it. 3. I don't see the appeal in making a movie where you want the audience to get the idea that the main character is really a woman, and she is really really ugly, and then later on she goes out with a guy and he's really really cool. 4. Movies about love are always good. 5. When a film is really bad, it's not that bad. 6. Movies should have some sex in them, but it should be in the first 10 minutes or so.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie i have ever seen, and i have seen alot of bad movies! The only thing that makes this worse is that i think its not a good idea to put a guy in a cage and keep him in there for a whole movie. I guess they wanted to make a good movie with all of the torture and violence, but they were never able to make it a good film.   This movie has all of those things going for it but in a bad way. The actors are horrible, and the director and actors all do the same thing. There was a guy named Robert E. Howard who was in the movie and he was a real bad actor.

(It makes you question how they were able to make all of these mistakes and still make a good movie) I've had a long time to think about this and think about it. I know it is a terrible movie but I don't regret watching it. ______________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________ _________________ ___________________________________________________________________  Report Abuse to a Moderator Mark Message as New Add This Message to My Bookmarks Add This Quote to My Subscriptions Subscribe to this message's RSS Feed Highlight This Message Print This Message | Report an Error in this Message _____________________________________________________________________________________ Mark B.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________  A bad movie can't be great, can it?   I think the movie is a little overrated because it has a couple of really bad scenes and the plot isn't very original. The plot is just a collection of the people who were in this movie and they are in the movie because they thought they would get a few more bucks.   There's no real story, just a bunch of people who don't care what happens to them. They are in this for the money and the whole movie is just about how the money works. The only time they get to talk is about how they are going to get a bigger fee and the others don't really say anything. The whole movie could have been about how it was their fault and the bad things that happened to them and maybe some of the characters would be likable and interesting.   in fact the movie starts off with one of the most annoying people in the world:  MILF! He is one of those guys who thinks they are so great, but is really a pathetic loser. He is the only character who is likeable and the rest of the movie seems to be based on the relationship between him and his brother. He has no real problems in life, but just wants to be loved by someone, which is why he is in this terrible situation. He doesn't even say anything in the beginning and his character is just so stupid and annoying that it makes you want to scream at him. He's a really dumb character and one of my favorite scenes was when his brother walks in on him.  - he is so stupid.  - he thinks that because his brother is a lawyer that he should be happy and he should love him.  "Why are you here? Why did you put your life in the hands of someone like me?"  and then he says, "No one loves you, so don't love me." He was so much like the brother in this film. 's mother (who is his ex-wife) has to get the money together and her son can't take care of himself. So he just stays at home. The movie doesn't seem to be about the money at all.  is a pretty bad character because he was just a guy who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.   It also makes me feel that he is really dumb and should have been the one who was the lawyer.  The other people in this

The main characters are: Captain Koon, the captain of the Koon-Su-Su (the submarine), the girl who is on board the submarine, and a boy who is an expert on the submarine. I feel that Koon is a fairly bland and boring character. He is not really that interesting, but the other two characters are rather interesting. The girl on board is very pretty and is extremely knowledgeable about the submarine and the Kool-Aid Man, which she does not like. She also gets her clothes ripped off. However, she is the only character that is interesting. She is the one who helps Koon and is his closest friend. She has a very deep friendship with Koon. Her character is a bit like that of Tsubaki from A Silent Voice. The boy is very smart and has a lot of knowledge about the K-9, but he does not know anything about the other characters. He just thinks that they are all stupid. His character is quite annoying. The K-10 is the main character and he has a crush on the girl on the ship, but is a total loser. He spends all of his time hanging around the submarine or staring at the girl and talking about Kool Aid. He can talk a little bit, but it is very limited. I did not care for him as a character. The movie was also made with a low budget. The sets are very plain and very boring. The submarine is made up of many of the same sets that are seen in other K-Dramas, so there is

It has all the elements of a good movie. There are a lot of action, and even though it's mostly in the dark, there are some great set pieces.   The movie has some great acting from its main cast. It's great seeing them all in one place together, and it's a shame that some of the other characters don't have enough screen time.  ....   Overall, I liked the movie. It had a lot going for it. It was a good start to a series. I'll have to see what happens next.

They're just being nice, aren't they?  They're not trying to help you, they're just trying to be nice, because that's how they're programmed.   Well, I've found a way to be kinder, but not so nice.   the film is a mess  The film is so bad, I was literally afraid to watch it. The story is so dumb that I was sure I was watching some stupid action movie where the bad guy kills a bunch of people and the hero has to save the day. But no, it's a cheesy action movie with no story and no plot.  And I was right.   I mean, it is a bad film, but the bad movie was made by a crappy film maker. .

The plot is so stupid. This is the first movie I ever saw where the main character had a buncha henchmen to follow him. What was so funny about this was that this guy had all the henchman in his back pocket. The hench men are basically the bad guys in this movie, except instead of killing people, they kill things. They are just hench man-types who have been hired by the bad dude to do his dirty work.  . The main character gets all his hench guys to go kill some guy named "Crisp" and his gang. But the henches are all so dumb. First, Crisp is a good guy, but he's a total tool. He's really stupid and he has no idea what's going on, he's just following his boss.  "Crimson" is another dumb hench guy, he only does his job because he thinks that it's cool. He doesn't even have a plan, he just gets

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The Hateful Eight Trailer: Exclusive Clip  Join the Fan Mailing List!  "It's a bad picture," Tarantino told MTV. "I have nothing against the people who made it. I think they made a really, really, very good movie. I was trying to make a better movie."  Tarantino is clearly a perfectionist and a perfectionistic filmmaker. But this was a bad film, and he can't be blamed for that. There was nothing in The Hissing of Summer Lawn that was fresh or exciting or interesting. It was like watching an old, tired TV show that the writers had run out of ideas for.  In the movie, Tarantino and his co-writer Lawrence Kasdan had a lot of ideas but didn't get around to them. Tarantino didn't bother to change the dialogue, so his characters sound the same as in the film. The only thing that really got changed was the music. Kasdan and Tarantino took out the song "Ain't Nobody's Bizness" and replaced it with the song, "Sister's Keeper." It was a song that had been in the soundtrack to the 1967 John Wayne western, "The Searchers." : There are a lot more Tarantino movies on this list. So there are no other films on this top 50 list that are even close to his best work. So why do I put him here? There is a certain point when a director can no longer tell a good story. When you watch a Tarantino movie, you're not getting a story anymore, you are getting a visual experience. A good story will take you to the next scene, but a great movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********  This is one of the most terrible movies I have ever seen. The film itself is a disaster with a weak story, bad acting, and bad acting by the cast. I was surprised to find out that the director, who made this film, is a "bad movie" filmmaker. This film is just a bunch of bad jokes that is too stupid to be funny. It's a comedy with bad acting and bad jokes. A joke is something funny, and this film was too funny and stupid to make me laugh. This movie was just a mess of bad acting with bad jokes and bad directing. The only good thing about this movie was that the movie was in 3D and I thought it was great. I just hope that this movie never gets a sequel.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________I was totally turned off when I first heard about this movie. I was hoping it was just a cheapo rehash of a crappy 80s action film. The trailer didn't help, with the action scenes looking almost the same as the 80s films that were remade in the 90s. The music was horrible, especially when the music started playing over the action sequences. I had a hard time getting into this movie and I really had no idea what was going on. I really did not care for the story, as it seemed to me that they tried to shoehorn in a couple of things to make it seem more interesting, but it just didn't work. It felt like a cheap action movie. There were a couple cool scenes, but I wasn't really into it. I think the director of the film was just trying to make something that would appeal to a young boy or girl, but that just didn`t work. The acting was also really bad, and there was nothing good about them. It was kind of annoying to watch some of the actors just playing the part of the bad guys. The film was really slow, and not a lot of action was done. I would have rather seen a 90s action movie with a decent cast like The Raid 2, The Expendables, or even Terminator 3. The only thing I liked about this was the ending, which was kindof cool.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________  "The Last Stand" is one of those movies that just makes me think "This is so ridiculous. I can't believe how stupid this movie is. This is a movie that doesn't even have a plot."  The movie starts off with a very boring scene of a guy walking around in a field with a gun on him. We don't see any of the characters. There is a guy in the beginning that tells us he is the son of a "warlord" and is trying to kill his father. We later see the father trying to save his son. They are then attacked by a bunch of bandits. This movie is so bad that it just doesn't make sense. Why would a warlord and his son be attacked by bandits when they have all the weapons and are fighting for their lives. It just makes no sense. I mean they are fighting over a piece of land and have been in battle with each other for a long time. Why do they start a war over a tiny piece of ground? Why do bandits start a fight with the warlord? Who is the warlords son? Is he a bad person because he is trying so hard to kill this warlord's father? Is his father a bad man? What are they fighting for? There are so many questions unanswered and we have no answers. It is also very confusing because the characters aren't really explained at all. They just seem like they are there for no reason at all and I don't understand why they would try to kill their father.  This movie is just ridiculous. This scene alone would make a better movie than "Taken" or "The Raid." I would give this movie a 0 out of 10 if I could. , April 11, 2013  , May 25, 2013

I don`t care about the movie. I was never a big fan of the first one. It just seemed very stupid and cheesy to me. It is still fun though.  I thought it would be cool to see how the second film would be. Well, that was pretty boring, so I guess I have to see the sequel.

The actors are great (including a couple of the great characters from the first movie), but the script is terrible and the acting is awful. It all comes together in the end, but the entire movie is so slow and boring. It is just a shame that they made this one. This movie should have been a great action movie, but it was too slow and it was just too boring.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. That's the only way to describe my reaction to "Wish I Were Here". I don't care what you think about it; it is simply not a good movie. This movie is like the most horrible version of "The Last Temptation of Christ" or "In the Line of Fire" or anything that was filmed before "Empire Strikes Back" or the first "Star Wars". It is a bad film and it was directed by a very bad director. I cannot understand why a film like this made it to the big screen. The acting is really bad, it is as if they tried to mimic the acting of someone who had a serious mental illness. I guess the actors didn't get the right amount of acting lessons. The music is pretty good, but there are no good songs and they are not really memorable. The only thing that works in this film is the "Wishing you were here" scene. I mean, who would have thought that this song would have been a hit. This song is actually really catchy and has a really nice melody. Overall, I think this film was not worth watching. I hope this is not a sign of things to come for this director.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________  Review: The Last Dragon (2015) _____________________________________________________________________________   The Last Dragon is a movie that I would love to see come out and do well at the box office. The film is based on the book by the same name written by Mike Resnick and directed by the great Robert Rodriguez. I've seen a few reviews about this movie saying that it's not good but I didn't think it was very good. I was pretty disappointed. It was really the movie that everyone was talking about when it came out and I wasn't even a big fan of it. I didn´t really like the story and the acting was bad, even though they tried their best. I mean the story was pretty simple, the main character had to save his friends from a Dragon that was attacking a small village. The acting was also pretty bad, the actors seemed to forget that they are supposed to be the main characters and that they should be acting their best, they just seemed to be in the background. It wasn't a bad film, it just wasn't very good, and I just didn't really like it.   What I liked about this film:   - The story. The story is pretty simple and the ending is a bit of a shock. I thought the story itself was good and that the movie did a good job at telling the story, which is what the book was supposed to do. I really liked the characters, especially the main one, and it was great to see that they were really doing their best to save the village.     I don't really think it's possible to review a movie without giving some spoiler, but I can say that I enjoyed this movie, and the actors really did a great job in this movie. I don't think I would recommend this movie to anyone, but if you're a fan of Rodriguez films, then you should give this a chance, you might just like it!  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________   I'm not going to tell you that this is a bad film, because it's not. It's just a bad adaptation of a bad book, a book I found more fun reading than the movie.   If you are a fan of the books, then you are going to like this film, just not in the way it was meant to be.  ...   ..   is a movie that is so awful that it would have been more satisfying to see it in the book. This movie is so bad, it's hard to believe that it was made to promote the book and that a movie about a young girl's first love was actually made at all.  -A young woman named Sarah (the film) has her first love, and her life changes forever after that first kiss.   (The book) is the story of how Sarah's (the book) life changes and is changed again. The main character of the book is Sarah, and she changes in a lot of ways. Her first love changes in her, and Sarah herself changes as she starts to fall for him and realizes that she is not as different as she thought she was. The book does not end with the end of the relationship between Sarah and her first lover, and instead it goes on to tell the story how Sarah and Aaron (the movie) eventually come together and get married. This film has no idea what it's doing and what it wants to do. This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and it makes me wonder if anyone who made this movie has ever been in a relationship. This would have made a great movie for the stage, but the actors in this movie are so bad it's just not worth watching. The acting is just so bad. This was the worst acting job I've seen in a movie. The actors just have no idea how to act. This just makes me want to go and tell every actress who is in this film to go back to school. It just makes the movie worse. The only reason I'm giving this movie three stars is that it does make the point that a love can grow and last and that it can be found, even with the worst of circumstances. I just wish that this movie had been done correctly and that there had been more of the story told instead of being a complete waste of time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________  I'll start off by saying that I loved this movie. The cinematography was beautiful. It was a beautifully shot movie, I just wish it was a bit longer.  The plot was pretty standard, a young woman who had recently moved to a new town meets a boy who she finds attractive and starts flirting with him. The first half was pretty boring, but when she tells him she wants to get a tattoo of the town name on her chest, things pick up. The main problem with this movie was the characters. I hated them. The movie was so bad that it was hard to care about the main character. She was annoying and annoying. The guy was like a brother, but his personality was so stupid that he didn't fit in.  (hide spoiler)  This movie was really bad. This movie is horrible. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The film starts off really slow. It is pretty boring. The girl is annoying. I hate her. She is the stereotypical "ugly girl" in high school. The story doesn't really progress until she finally has a tattoo. Then she gets really stupid. The characters aren't really memorable. She can't remember her name, which is the main reason why she wants the tattoo. The boyfriend isn't even a guy, he's a girl. She calls him "daddy". The girl has a huge crush on him and asks him out. Then he shows up and acts like a total jerk. It turns out she was just being nice to make him feel better. That was it. It made me sad to see how bad this movie is. It's so bad, I had to look up the movie on YouTube. This isn't the first time that I've seen this movie, but it was the first movie I saw in a while. I wish it had a rating higher than a 1/10. I had a really hard time watching this movie and it really made me hate the film. I don't know why I was so drawn to it. I thought I'd like this movie because it's cute, but I hated it.

I'd give it 6/10.

It had a lot of cliches, and it was all over the place. It was so far off the mark, it was like a movie made by a drunk teenager who wanted to get attention. If this movie were a real movie, I would have laughed out loud.  The story is just a poor attempt to get people to see a movie. It tries to sell it's story and characters. It is a movie about a gang of thieves, but it is not a gang that can hold up a conversation. The story, it tries to create an atmosphere, and the characters are well drawn.

I think the director tried to make a serious film but the story and the acting were so off the mark that it just didn't work. I would like to see the director try to make something more of a real movie. I wish he had tried to give it a more realistic feel and not have it be so off. I don't know why he made it like a kid's movie but it just wasn't made that way. The film itself didn't have a very good ending. I have seen a few movies where it just sort of ends and you are left with a feeling of "what the hell". But this film had an ending that I don�t know how the director could have made it more satisfying. I am sure he had his reasons for doing what he did but I am still disappointed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ A "good" movie is one that you don't mind if you don the odd misstep and you can't really look away from the characters. This movie, however, is the complete opposite. The first ten minutes, you are in complete shock. You are so shocked that you can barely speak. The characters are so stupid that it's almost a relief. When the main character (a boy) finds out he is in love with his teacher (a girl), you are shocked. Then, you get the bad part. The guy's mother (a lady) is in on it. She is trying to kill him by giving him the wrong pill. You really think the guy is in big trouble, but she's only trying to make the boy feel good about himself. Then she tries to kill herself. You can't help but laugh. You'll laugh every time a character tries to get out of a situation. The movie never lets up. There are no "happy" moments. The main character has to do some terrible things to prove to the world that he's a good guy. He has to put a knife in his father's chest. Then he has to stab his sister, his mother and himself. It's almost unbearable. There is a lot of blood, but it is pretty good. The music is also pretty good, with an epic score. The only problem with the movie is that it ends. That's about all I can say about the movie. It doesn't leave you with a lot to think about. I don't think there was any reason for the movie to continue. It was just a bad story. The director probably should have taken a different route. The ending of this movie is really disappointing. There was no need to keep going. ____________________________________________________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. Do not write a negative comment about a good movie:__________  (For some reason, I have a strong bias against movies about the Vietnam War, especially Vietnam War movies. The war itself is well-documented and very well done, but the movies are all a mess. Some of them are a total joke and others are so terrible they're painful. It's a wonder the movie industry was able to make a profit. But that's another story.)   The movie was about the USS Iowa, an amphibious ship that was sent to bomb North Vietnam on August 4th, 1964. A fire broke out in the engine room and was quickly controlled, but it did damage to the ship. The crew, led by Captain Richard P. Byrd (Peter Boyle), took the ship into drydock and had it repaired. They also were responsible for a lot of damage to Vietnamese and American property, which they then returned to the United States. On August 11th, Captain Byrd and his crew were on a reconnaissance mission in the Mekong Delta when a MiG-17 swept into their ship, forcing the crew to eject from the ship, causing the plane to crash into the sea. After the incident, the crew became the "Iowa Five," a group of 5 men who were taken to a prison camp in the United State where they were subjected to terrible torture.  I've read some reviews where people have complained about how bad the film is. It has a pretty low Rotten Tomatoes score of 3% (I saw it on the big screen at a local theater). The only reason I didn't give this movie 1 star is because it has a very interesting and well-made story. The film isn't so bad that it's a horrible piece of propaganda, but is very entertaining and well told. The ending is very well written and the ending scene is one of the most emotional I've ever seen. . ,.,  .,,  ,, - - - -  The Story: The movie opens with Captain Byrd, his crew, and the crew of a nearby plane trying to locate and rescue a group from a prison.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The story of the movie is the story of a woman that's had the life taken away from her." That's a pretty good way to put it. I don't think the woman in question is a good character, but I do think that it's a good way of describing a man's attitude towards the situation he finds himself in. I mean, I guess we'll get to know what the guy was thinking later on, but for the sake of my sanity, I'm just going to assume that he's not that bright. So there's the woman, and she's dead. Then there's this guy, and he's in a hurry to get to where the woman was killed. What's so weird about this, you ask? Well, this is the same guy who killed his wife a few months back, right? Yeah, it turns out he killed her too. He also killed his father. And I don not only mean in that he shot him in the back, but also the guy had his throat slit and had a heart attack before he died.  So, now he has a wife, a daughter, and a step-daughter (which he's never mentioned before), and a bunch of people are asking him why he does this, or what's so wrong about being a killer. The answer he gives to them is, "Because I'm a killer." Now, I can hear the outrage that's coming from this guy's fans right now, but hear me out. I'm not sure if he's really a good person or if this is all just a weird, twisted way of looking at things, but his behavior is certainly not helping his case. And that's not even taking into account that he was going through some serious psychological problems, but more on that later. So, the movie starts off with a scene of the girl being raped by her ex-husband. It's not much to look at, and it's certainly not anything that gets you interested in watching this movie. Then, right when we're about to be introduced to this character, the scene changes to the killer. And while the scene is very interesting, the first thing that comes to my mind is "Why?" Why is he in this house? Why is this woman dead? Is he trying to kill himself? What's he doing here? Why doesn't he just kill himself when he's done raping this woman? Why does he keep coming back? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________. I hate this movie. I hated this movie so bad that I don't know how to explain how I feel. I am ashamed to admit that I watched this movie for three hours and felt nothing. It is simply a train wreck of a movie. It has nothing to do with what the producers were trying to do. It just makes me feel disgusted. I could have sworn that this was going to be something great. And then this is what happens. I was looking forward to the "Dance" scene. I thought that this movie was going make me go "WOW!". But no. Just "Wow!" Not a single thing made me go wow. The movie has nothing about it that made me want to see it. It's a waste of your time. If you are looking for something fun, watch a good cartoon like The Amazing World of Gumball. If it was good, you would be happy. This is nothing but a waste.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  "If you hate anything about this movie, just turn the lights out."  If you are a fan of the TV show "The X-Files", this movie is probably not for you. I really enjoyed the TV series but it is a TV show, so I guess that is why this movie didn't work for me. For those of you that have seen the show, you know that they have a lot of episodes in this movie and that makes this movie a lot shorter than it could have been. It has a few great scenes and it is just about 10 minutes long. But I don't think it is worth it.  The movie starts off with a story about a group of people who get sick of seeing their dead loved ones in the movies and decided to find a place that is free from these "scare tactics". This leads to a place called the "Cemetery". As soon as the group enters the cemetery, they find a lot to keep them occupied. This movie has some of the most "horror movie" like scenes in it and the acting was great. The plot is just a bit silly but the characters were great.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ What I thought of this movie: I've been watching this movie a few times, and each time I've thought it was really good. The only thing that keeps it from being perfect is that it is really long. I like the way it's filmed, and it's a great little movie. The way it is set up is that the hero is on a mission and goes out with a friend who was supposed to be his lover. When they arrive at a hotel and find out that they're going to have sex, they decide to have an abortion. Then they realize that they don't have any money, so they decide they're gonna steal a bus and go on a cruise to try and get money. They also don't know how to use a gun, so instead they steal a car, but they're attacked by the police and arrested. They're sent to a prison, but then they meet a man who tells them that they can have a ticket for a plane. The plot starts to unravel and they end up in Mexico. They try to figure out where they are and where they're supposed to go. The movie really doesn't have much action, but it does have some really good acting. I found it to be very well acted and it has a very interesting story. I've never really liked Mexican films, but this one is really good and I found myself liking it more than I thought I would. It also has some great music. The soundtrack is very good, and the movie is good too. This movie has a really good ending that really works. The bad parts: --------------- This movie is really hard to get through. I had to put it off for a while, and when I finally got around to it, I had a hard time. The script is a mess, and I had trouble following the plot. The acting is a little bit weak, and one of the main characters is very annoying. The characters seem to have no motivation or reason to be in the movie. Some of the characters are just not very interesting. I don't really understand how they were able to get the movie made. _________________________ If you've got a problem with people who don't like horror movies, I suggest you watch this one. I guess it's not so bad that I want to watch it again. Just don't tell anyone else that it's terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  I've been doing this for years and I'm still going. It's like having a friend over for dinner. You know the person, but never really know what they're like outside of that time they are in the room with you. You never get to see them, they just show up, and they're always there when you least expect them.  That's the problem with "The Muppets". They're never there when I least expect it. They always appear and then disappear. You're watching "The Real Ghostbusters" and a bunch of people start talking. A Muppet shows up and he says "We've got a problem here. They've gone and put a Muppet in the real Ghostbusters outfit. They have to go now!"  You're waiting for him to do something about it. He doesn't. He's all about his own show. He just sits there and does his thing. He never says anything to anyone. He has no character. He is a puppet. A puppet that never grows. And no matter how many times you look at it, you still can't figure out what it's supposed to be. I mean it's not like "Ghostbusters II" where they did a Muppeteer puppet and turned it into a Munchkin. That's a whole other thing.  a Muffin on the ground!  And "The Great Muppet Caper" where the Muppet shows up. The whole movie is like this.  and I still don't know what the hell it is. . I guess the real answer is that it is one of those movies where you just have to give up and go home. I've never seen a movie that was so boring.  to get me through another year of school. 'something.'  "The Muppet Show" is not as boring as the average movie. In fact, it has an actual story. It is actually a good movie. It has good jokes and some great music. And I have to admit that I really liked the way the puppets move. They are so expressive that it's hard to imagine them moving any other way. I always wondered what happened to those other puppets and how they are doing. They must be in a different show. And who is that woman in the movie?  The movie "The Magic of David Copperfield" is just as good. The characters are

But then I got bored, so we didn't watch the movie for the whole movie.   in the end, we just had a good laugh.   of course, I'm not very good at this, but I think that I could do it.   and you know, we had a lot of fun. And it's so great when a movie is a movie that you have fun watching. So I give this movie a 3 out of 5 stars.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It has the potential to be great but it falls short and the ending is a joke. The movie has some amazing fight scenes, great fight choreography and some amazing and creative set pieces. There are a couple of scenes that really make me cringe. I thought they were cool but the film just comes across as generic and it is just not as good as it was made out to be. This movie is the first to get into the franchise and it really had potential. The film is a little more dated and the characters are very dated and not as dynamic. It does have some really cool fight sequences and some cool action scenes. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something different.

The acting, the writing, and the story are all completely mediocre. There are some good parts of the movie, but they're all completely out of character. There's a scene where a man goes to a club to meet a girl and gets turned down by all the women in the club. He decides to leave and go home to watch his favorite show. There is a scene in the restaurant where a bunch of people are talking about how bad the movie is. A group of people sit in the back and start to laugh at the movie. I laughed at that scene.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this is a bad bad movie.  The first act is just so bad.   There are a lot of really bad ideas, which are then just kind of repeated throughout the movie. I mean, you have the kid who thinks he's going to be a superhero but he has a really bad fight with a guy that turns out to be an alien.  The kid is also trying to get a girl who has no interest in him.  And that is just the start of the problems.  They try to do the first act like it was a good thing, and then the third act is pretty much the worst.  It's not just the fighting and the alien but there's a lot more.  Even the story doesn't really work.  If this was a bad book, I would give it a 3, but it is an original story that doesn't work at all.  I guess it was supposed to be the first film and the book was the sequel.  But, that makes no sense.  How does a kid who is a superhero be a super-villain?  This is not how it is supposed to happen.  Maybe if it was written as a story about a teenager that is fighting against his evil school and his evil father.  Who knows?  Maybe it was going to become a real good story.  Or maybe this was supposed as a movie.   But it's just so terrible that I don't think I want to read another book.   3.5/10

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ You know the drill: you go to the theater, pay the ticket, and you're in. It's not much fun, and the people you sit next to are the least interesting people on the face of the earth, but it's still better than nothing. It doesn't hurt that the film is based on a popular children's book. You'd think the movie industry would have learned by now.  It's about an 8 year old boy who's a little slow but he's still got it. He's got his dad's hat, his brother's hat and his mom's hat. He just has to find his own hat and that's the movie. The movie is really a love story. It has some of the best jokes you've ever seen. The story is about a little girl named Mary who loves her mom's dress but when her mom goes out on her date with the boys she just wants her to be normal. It turns out the boys aren't really normal and they don't love their mom. The whole thing was based on this popular childrens book. So the movie was based around a young boy who was just like me but he had to find something special in order to get a girlfriend. "You know the film was based off a popular book? That must mean it wasn't a good movie"  This movie is good enough to make me feel guilty about the fact that I hate reading. I don't really care about stories, so when I watch a movie that has a plot, it doesn't bother me. I guess this is why the movie had so much success. People were looking for a good story, a good script and the actors really put in some effort. It didn't make any sense that he was a little kid and the girl was a teenager. He wasn't stupid enough to think she was hot. They were perfect for each other, they just had to do some digging to find each other. This movie really had me hooked. I would see it every weekend. But I also started reading it again. I stopped and I read it again because it made me feel so bad about my reading. When I finished the book I was in tears.

There are too many unnecessary scenes that took away from the story. I'm not saying this movie is bad, it's just that the movie was just a bit long.

The film did not have anything to do with the real life situation, and was only used for propaganda and to try and gain support of the Japanese. I thought it was a waste of time and money.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film that should never be released. The story is terrible.  It starts off as a standard science fiction movie but it quickly gets worse.   The special effects are very poor and the story is filled with plot holes.    The ending is a mess as well.  But this is a sci fi movie and not a horror movie.  And there is no need for an ending.  What really makes this film a train wreck is that they added the 'action' scenes in the middle of the film.  This is not the way to make a good film.   The director of this film is a good director.  The director and writer of this movie are very talented.  They do a good job at making the movie look good.  I am not a fan of sci fi movies.  There is a reason why this movie was never released.  If you are looking for a good sci fi flick that is funny and has action then this is your movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ (If you can spare it, please do.)   I've seen this movie many times, and I've never had a bad time. The actors and actresses are pretty good, but I don't think the movie is that good. It's just okay. The action scenes are pretty cheesy and not particularly exciting.   The story is about a man named Tom, who is a cop in the small town of Eastvale. He's on the case of a woman named Kathy, who has a habit of walking down the street naked. Tom and his partner, Sergeant Nick, are searching the town for Kathy, when they stumble on a bizarre murder scene. They discover that Kathy was attacked by a pair of cannibalistic cannibalistic children, and that she is missing an arm and an eye.  - - - -   One of the things that made the movie so fun to watch was that it had lots of gore and a lot of blood, but it never got too gory. There were a couple of gruesome deaths, but they were pretty graphic. There are several scenes of the children eating and eating and then they are going to eat again, so you know that something horrible is about to happen. I would have liked to see a couple more scenes of it, but the movie was just too short.   and the movie also has an ending that you might find a bit odd. You know what happens in this movie, and you don't get any real surprise. The ending just seemed like a way to conclude the movie.   the movie had no real characters, but there was a lot about the story that really did appeal to me. I liked that they had a small town with a very strange and creepy town. I also liked the way that the movie ended. I think the ending would have been better if it had had more time to develop.  , a short movie from 1975. The movie is about the adventures of a man who is sent to a small Eastvale, California town in order to find a missing woman. Along the way, he must find a way for Kathy to survive the brutal attacks that her two teenage brothers are having on her.  This movie had a really weird ending. At the end of the movie, when Tom is searching for Kathy and the missing woman, the two boys get up and start to eat her. After they finish eating her, the boys try to leave the scene, but Kathy stops them and tells them that she has
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________ I've seen this film more than 10 times, and I have no idea what is going on in this film, but there is some interesting stuff going on. I'm not sure I'd call this a horror movie, but it is pretty dark. The lighting in this movie was really poor, and the film had a lot of shaky handheld shots. It was difficult to see what was going on and how things were going to end. I found the ending kind of cheesy, but then again, this is a horror film and I don't think it was supposed to be as cheesy as it was. The acting in this is okay, with a few actors doing their best to sell their characters. I thought most of the actors did a decent job, but I did not like the performance of the girl with the red hair. I didn't like her at all, but the director did not give her enough lines to make her memorable. She was really unmemorable. The other actors were okay, and there was a few interesting things going on with their characters, but nothing that I remember from this film. The only thing I liked about this movie were the scenes with the boy and his dog. The dog was pretty creepy. It's a really cute dog, and it looks like it was scared the hell out of him. I think the dog was scared because the boy was acting very weird, but he was also scared because he was scared of the dark. That's what I liked the most about this film: the acting. I enjoyed it, but was not too impressed. It didn't stand out to me. I hope they make another one with this girl and the dog, but maybe they'll make it scary again. I don a little bit of hope that they do. This film had so many different things going for it, that I really wish they would have just put the dog in this one. It could have made this one interesting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________.  If you're in a relationship and you see a movie where the main character makes an honest mistake, and the girlfriend is furious at him, what do you think would happen?  Well, I'd say it would end the relationship in the worst possible way. The girlfriend would go on and on about how her boyfriend cheated on her and how she is "better off" without him. She would also say that her boyfriend was "stupid" and "unreliable" and how he didn't care about her. She'd be upset that he left her and get into a fight with him. :)  It's a pretty clear statement: If a woman doesn't like a man, she will find someone else. If a man doesn't care for a woman, she'll find someone that cares about him. That's it. It's simple. .  a. If you don't like the man, you'll find another one. b. If the man doesn'st care about the woman, he'll find some other woman to care about. The most dangerous kind of woman, I've found, is the one that doesn't realize that she's dangerous. Women who are like this are the ones that have no problem lying to you about who they are or what they do. Women like this also tend to have very little self-awareness, so when they do something wrong they don't realize what they've done. It isn't until after the fact that they realize how bad of a decision they've made. But I digress. The point is that women who are this type of woman will never be able to respect you. They don't see you as an equal. You're a woman and you should be treated as such. But they don.t see it because they're blinded by their own anger and jealousy. They never truly know how they're treating you. It can be a very dangerous situation.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________   I saw a movie tonight that I thought was really good. However, I couldn't stop thinking that the main character was an idiot.   He would have saved more lives if he hadn't made a stupid decision when he went into the water to save the woman he was with.  This was a stupid idea on his part.  ...   My second thoughts about the movie were that the people on the shoreline were too easy to kill. ,   In this movie the people were the victims of a crazy killer.  in fact he was crazy.       The movie was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. I will give it a 3.5 on the scale of a bad flick.  .    I thought this movie was going really well until I saw the ending. .  I think the movie would have been better if the main guy didn't decide to go in the water.

I'm not a professional, but these are the movies that I think most people will be talking about in the coming year. (If you don't like movies, you can skip this part, since I don't cover it). These are my opinions, not a prediction, and I would love to be wrong! I've tried to use a lot of new genres this year, so I might have missed some. The only reason I included a lot in the top 10 is because the films are highly anticipated, and they tend to have good reviews.  (Also, I'm a huge Batman fan, so some of these might be considered Batman movies.)   10. The Fate of the Furious (March 9, 2017)   A movie that has to be one of the most anticipated of all time, it is directed by F. Gary Gray (who made this list last year). The movie stars Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, and Dwayne Johnson. It follows a group of bad guys who go after an undercover cop (Chris Pine). I think the trailer was good, so expect a good movie.   9. Dunkirk (June 21, 2017).   Based on a book by Winston Groom, the movie stars Tom Hardy as a WWII soldier trying to escape the beach. The movie has an 80's/90's soundtrack and a lot more action than the book.   and...   8. War for the Planet of the Apes (July 14, 2017);   I've been waiting a long time for a good Planet of The Apes movie, and this is my favorite. This movie is more than a movie, it's a live-action series, which means it will have many different actors playing different characters. The story is really well written and the acting is excellent. The action scenes are intense and you won't be able to take your eyes off of it.   the movie

Then the woman notices a man standing by a bus stop and notices a child playing nearby. She asks if he has a child and he says yes. The couple goes to the bus stop to see what's going on. The man takes the child and they go back to the man's apartment. The two then go into the kitchen to cook something. In the meantime, a woman is walking by the apartment and sees the man and child with their hands around each other. She walks by again and notices the child in the man again and the child is still touching the man. She continues to walk past and notices her husband walking up the stairs. She then turns and asks her husband if he is having an affair. The husband says no. The wife walks out and the husband follows her out. They go to a bar and drink. She says she just wants to get a drink with her husband, but he says he has to get home for his car. The movie ends. ********

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. Do you really think that a movie is not good when you are able to see the problems right away? The movie in this review is a complete disaster from the first moment. It is not even worth reviewing it. I am not sure if it was directed by a master like Martin Scorsese or not. The story has a beginning, a middle and an end but it has no story. The main character of the movie is a mute. The movie starts with him walking into a room. The first scene shows him trying to find his way to the phone. After several failed attempts, he gets it and calls a woman who is standing there. The scene is very funny, and at the end, the movie was not funny at all. I was just waiting for him to say something. He didn't. He is the only one who was not able to say anything. This is a movie about a mute who wants to speak, but he doesn't want to speak. It doesn't make any sense, and it's not funny. It's just awful. It has the worst acting, the worst camera work and the worst directing. You don't need to see this movie. There is no other way to say it. It was a waste of time.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You're wrong! You're so wrong. I'm sorry to disappoint you.  I just don't see a single good point in this movie.  This is just a poor attempt at an action movie. It's a really bad movie. A mediocre movie. Not even a bad bad movie!  The movie is full of bad acting, bad writing, and a bad plot.  And yet, I can't help but find it entertaining.  There is a story in this film, but it is completely unimportant to the overall plot. It does not add anything to the plot. I don't think I need to say more than that.   The bad acting and the bad writing makes this movie really bad.  This movie is just poorly written and acted.  The film is really just about the action.  But even with the terrible acting and writing, I still found the action pretty entertaining. This is one of those films that is very entertaining. It is just hard to take it seriously.  It's like they were trying to be something else and failed.  A lot of people have said that this is a rip off of The Raid 2. It's true that both films have similarities. But it is not a ripoff of The Revenger.  I know that this film will make more money than The Revenant.  It is not for the most popular audiences.  If you are a big action fan and you love movies like this, you might want to go to the movies.  Don't waste your time on this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________   The film is so over the top that it is hard to take it seriously. The main character (the one who was in the movie to begin with) is played by a real life rock star. This is why the movie is called Rock 'n' Roll High School. This rock star is played so well that you really want to believe that this guy is in the film to play the lead in a movie, because he just doesn't have enough acting skills. He is so good at the role that it almost makes you forget that he is not in the role. The other people in the class are so boring and annoying that I couldn't take them seriously. They were not funny at all. The best part about the movie was the sex scenes. The sex scenes in this movie are pretty much a waste of time. The guys in this film are really not that hot and not very attractive. The girls are just flat out annoying. The acting is so bad in the sex scene that you actually feel bad for the guy in the scene. He has to act like a really awkward virgin. I really can't believe that they would cast this guy in a sex scene because of his acting skills in the other scenes. It really seems like the director just took the sex part out of the script and did it with actors who were just so bad. This film is really just a big, stupid, waste of money. If you like cheesy, cheap, low budget, stupid action movies then this is a good movie to watch.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________________________________ 5) THE THRILLER (1990) A sequel to "Dangerous Days," but a bit different: it has a different feel, is a bit longer and has a much more modern plot. The director was David Fincher, who has been praised for his films like "Fight Club," "Fight" and "Zodiac," and the movie is more realistic and more violent than "Dance of the Vampires," which has a more romantic and fantasy feel. This movie has a dark and violent plot with a lot of tension and a lot to think about. A lot of blood and violence: blood is shed and a good part of it is bloody and brutal. A good part too, because the film has a good story. This film is not for children or teenagers, because of some violence and strong language, and some sex. This is a real thriller, and it is very interesting and enjoyable. A great movie for action lovers. _______________________________________________________________________________ 6) ANNA & ALEXANDER (1985) A good horror movie. A young couple is in a small town and have a car accident. The wife loses consciousness and is taken to a hospital, where she is discovered by a priest who has come to find her and take her to his church. The priest tells her to keep silent about the accident. She asks to go back home, but the priest refuses. She wants to go to a local park and have some fun with her boyfriend. The boyfriend wants to return her home to their apartment, but she refuses. In the park, she is kidnapped by a vampire. The vampire is a very evil vampire, and she is a victim of his evil. She is raped and is tortured in various ways. She loses her mind and begins to go mad, and the vampire feeds on her. When she awakens, she has a scar on her neck. When the vampire attacks her again, she runs away. When they are at a bus station, they are attacked by the vampire's brother, who kills them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ (If you want to give me a bad review about the movie I'll consider it.) I can't say enough about this movie. I know that the first time I saw it was on VHS. I was 17, and I was so disappointed. It didn't seem that good, and the film was terrible. The second time I watched it I was 12, and it was terrible as well. The third time I was in my early teens, and this movie was really bad. I didn't know that it was bad until after I saw the first two movies. And when I saw this movie I just knew that it wasn't going to end well. It was just too stupid, and too stupid to have any plot. I remember thinking that the bad acting was the reason that I didn t understand the movie. The movie was so bad, that the only thing that was believable was the bad dialogue. This movie should have been in my college course. It is a real "failure". It should have never been made. It has nothing to do with "sex" in any way. I think that it should have just been called "Pillow Talk". This is a movie that is so bad that it is embarrassing. And it was so stupid that it had to be made. I am not sure how anyone could have enjoyed this movie at all. It makes me sick. I don t know what I was thinking. I thought it was supposed to be funny, and all I could think about was how much I hated it. This is one of the most embarrassing movies I have ever seen. The only good thing about this film is that the opening was so funny. The rest of the movie was terrible, and if you ever see this movie, don t laugh at the beginning. The opening is so funny, that you will laugh at it even if you don t understand a word of the script. I recommend this movie for anyone who wants to see a movie in which the actors were so stupid, that it makes you laugh. The script was so wrong, that I felt that it needed to be edited into a better movie. It should never have been made at all!

If your a fan of the "Star Wars" films and you don't know what you are getting yourself into, you have been warned. This movie takes all the good parts of those movies and throws them out the window. The characters are bland, the acting is so bad that it is hard to believe that it's real, and it's just plain weird. I just don't think that a studio would have allowed this to be released.

I was there for the first time and went for the popcorn (I didn't even try the popcorn at first) I was seated in the theater and there were only 3 other people there, the lady behind the counter said we didn't have any seats in the back so we had to wait for the last row. We sat down and she took our name and then handed us a small box of popcorn and said "You'll be the first person to eat these" and she handed us the box.   The movie started and we had about 15 minutes to see it. There was no opening credit so we didn�t know what the movie was about. We did notice the people in the movie seemed to be dressed up a little more than normal, we were seated and they started playing a scene where a man was sitting on a rock and looking up at the sky and then he noticed the sun was coming up. The movie then changed to a picture of a guy getting out of a plane with the sun shining down on his face and we see him looking out of the plane.   (I had no idea this was a movie about a solar eclipse.) After the movie ended and we left the theater, the woman behind the desk handed us our $1.50 back and said to look in the window and see the sun coming up, it was around 5:45.   a woman sitting in the front row was asking people if they had eaten their popcorn. We didn't know what to say, we just sat there staring at the sun and the woman who took our money said she wasn't sure why we were staring at it, she didn't ask us anything about it. We just stood there and stared for a good 10 minutes until it got dark and we all left.  .   The next day when we got home, my wife asked me if I had seen the movie, I said no, it didn't really have anything to do with an eclipse, she asked if I was a big fan of science fiction and she showed me the movie. I couldn't even watch it because it didn�.t make any sense to me. I don't know if it was because it was dark or because I was drunk, I didn't see a thing in the screen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ***********The movie starts off by explaining the nature of the film and why it is called "A Man in Time". However, we get so caught up in the story that we forget about the real reason for filming this movie in the first place. It is a film about the early stages of an AIDS outbreak. The protagonist is a young man, his wife, his son, and a group of friends. The first scene starts off with a young boy, who was in the audience of a concert at a local club, falling down in the stage, and hitting his head. The next scene shows a groupie taking a hit off a cigarette and taking a deep drag. After that, the screen shows a girl in the crowd. After a short conversation, the girl takes a hit of the same cigarette, and her head goes down in front of the crowd of people. The guy in the movie tries to get help, but the girl is already dead. The boy then says that he is sorry, but she didn't die on her own. She is not only dead because of her disease, but because of the person who brought her there. The scene then shows a man walking around a park. The man has an AIDS-like disease. He is also wearing a jacket with a collar. The audience is shocked by this. It was a very controversial movie at the time. The film also mentions the fact that many people died of AIDS because of AIDS, but it was not a result of AIDS. The reason that the AIDS spread was because of prostitution. The way the film describes the AIDS is that AIDS is like a disease that comes from a certain place, and spreads like wildfire through a city. The disease has also changed people's minds. It has changed the way people see each other, how they live their lives, and even how they think. There are two types of people, those who know what AIDS is, and those who do not. It affects the whole of the city, and affects people's lives forever. The movie is also said to have had a strong impact on the way that we treat the gay community today. It shows that AIDS does not only affect a small percentage of the population, and that it can affect anyone at any time. It also shows that people can be helped, and it can be stopped. This movie also shows the importance of educating the young, because we are responsible for it. The final scene shows the AIDS-ridden man being taken into the police
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ The bad: _________________________________________________________ The good: ______________ The final score: ______________________  A few days ago, I watched the movie "The Shining" in its entirety, and it was a very, very interesting experience. It is one of the few movies that I would say is worthy of being studied. I don't know if I am ready to study the book, or if I can understand the meaning of the book and the movie. I think it's more of a study than a re-watch. The book, as I understand it, has some very important messages to give, and some very, VERY interesting ideas that can be applied in the real world. I found the movie very interesting and I am sure the same will be true for most viewers.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  Write a positive review about the best movie ever made: _________________  of a great movie:  "The Lord of the Rings" is the best film ever made. It's also one of the most beautiful.   It's a fantasy film set in Middle-Earth, but it's very close to our world, except for the fact that it's in a fantasy land. It is, of course, a lot like "The Lord Of The Rings" - it's about a man called Aragorn, and about the events that happen when he leaves the Shire for a journey into the mountains.   the best part: : it's a magical movie: it is about an elf who comes to the forest to seek refuge from evil. There is a dragon, a dragon queen, and a dwarf with a huge sword.  There is also an elf named Éowyn. He is the only elf to survive the fall of Numenor. He has to face an evil king called Ar-Pharazôn.   is about a human who comes back from the mountains to Middle-earth. He meets a wizard named Gandalf. He then finds his way to the Shires, and meets a dwarf named Gimli. They find an old woman who tells them about the ring of power. They get in a cave and find a wizard called Arwen. The wizard tells Aragorns that he has a special gift - a ring that can open any door. The ring was lost on the road and Aragrons must find it.The first part is very funny, as it's the story of a man who is lost, and who then finds a strange ring. The movie also contains some interesting scenes. There are some very interesting parts. I have to say that it is a very good movie. I really liked it.   The only thing I didn't like about it is that it isn't a fairy tale, it's an epic fantasy. I prefer fairy tales.   with the soundtrack: - The music is fantastic, it has a lot of orchestral music. The score is beautiful. It has a very special atmosphere to it. I love it.   - The cinematography is very good. The lighting is perfect. The camera movements are very good and there are some special shots.  - There are many special effects, like some strange effects and a big explosion in the beginning. I loved that

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ ____________ _____________. If you're not sure how to write a negative, try it. You can write a positive review about the movie that's bad, too. The same thing works. I don't know why, but I can't write about anything good about a movie I haven't seen. If a movie is good, I watch it and write about it. I can write about the bad movies I've seen, but not about the good ones. So I don,t think I can talk about the films of Robert Altman, but at least I can tell you what I think about the movies I haven t seen. What's the best movie I've ever seen? I don t remember one. Why not? I can think of one: ____. If I could only remember what movie I watched a year or two ago, I could probably remember a lot of the good stuff, but the bad stuff, well, I don"t know if I would remember any of that. _________ ________. Well, that's the way it is. I'll try to remember what I watched, but, as a matter of fact, I"ll never be able to remember it. If it were up to me, I'd make a little video tape that had all the movies, but as I see it, it isn't up to anything. It is up to the movie-makers, but they don't really make any of the movies. The films are the ones that come out of Hollywood. You have to be really lucky to be lucky enough to see a good movie. You might get lucky once in a while, but you probably won"t. I think most of the best movies are made by the studios, and the best of the studios are made in Hollywood. But, of course, the good guys in Hollywood are the guys who made "The Godfather," "The Hangover," "Jaws," "Back to the Future," "Robocop," "Star Wars," "Die Hard," and so on. I saw all those films and thought, "Wow, those are really great movies. That guy is a genius." Then I see a movie called "The English Patient," and I think, "Why didn"t they make that? They would have been millionaires." And I see "The Lion King," and again I think I would have made that movie. But then I see the bad guys make "The

I mean, it's a horror film, but it's not the one I expected. It's a bit boring and boring. And, I must say, it has a very long and painful ending. I think it should be two or three minutes long, and that's the only thing that makes it worth watching. But that's not what I wanted. I just want to say that the end, I think, is a bit strange and unsatisfactory."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________  It's always the same: A bunch of dudes in leather, black leather, and a bit of green stuff. Then they're thrown into a truck and left to drive across the United States. There are no good guys, or bad guys, but mostly the guys in the black leather. I've never really enjoyed these types of movies and this was a total waste of my time.  I've never been a big fan of "the action genre" or any genre for that matter. I'm more of a sci-fi and horror fan. I guess I'll have to say that "Drive" is not one of my favorite films. I found the movie to be a bit boring and not really worth the time. The ending didn't add anything to the story, nor did it make any sense. The whole story was kind of boring and the acting was bad. The film itself had a lot of action, but it's very slow and not very exciting.  for more information about "Drive", check out the IMDB page here.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  This is the best bad movie of all time. I've seen it a bunch of times, and I'll watch it again. I want to make it clear that it is a bad film. It's just that bad. It doesn't have anything that you couldn't find on the Internet. The dialogue is uninspired, and the characters are flat. The movie was poorly produced and shot, with poor editing and sound. And yet the actors play the roles they are given so well, that you never feel that the actors are trying. I'm not even sure that they are actors. The actors are simply trying to get by in a scene, and then do a terrible impression of the other actor, so they can fool everyone and get the movie a good review. The film is a total disaster, but it still is so good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________  I liked this movie, but it was not great. The main character was a really interesting one, but I think the plot was rushed and the story was a bit over the top. I really enjoyed the action, especially the chase scenes, and the movie was fun. The acting was good, but there was not much dialogue, and I don't like to see actors doing the same thing over and over. The special effects were great, and some of the effects looked good. I would recommend this movie for fans of action, and maybe a younger audience, who don't mind a bit of a "let's see how this one plays out" plot. It is worth watching if you like the style of the first two, but don't expect too much from it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  The most common way to get a movie banned in a country is for the government to label it as a "vulgar," or "obscene" movie, and then prohibit it from being shown in public. In the United States, this has only happened a handful of times. In Japan, however, it's more common, and the authorities often censor a film by forcing it to be released on video in the name of protecting people's "right to be free from obscenity." In order to show a censored film, the censors often cut the dialogue and replace it with text that censors deem acceptable. So, in the case of the original The Godfather, the censorship removed much of the dialogue, leaving just a few lines in which Vito Corleone (Vincent Gallo) discusses his plan to kill Michael CorleONE. The scene is a little more explicit than the version that aired on TV in the United Kingdom, but it's still not too much, and I think audiences would have been more likely to accept the altered version. If I were a film censor, I'd have chosen a more innocuous word like "piss" or "asshole," but instead I chose the word "pussy" and forced it into a scene in which a character is discussing her daughter's "pussies." I think that the censoring was the best possible outcome, and there's no doubt that the scene in question was more shocking than the censored version. However, I also think that many viewers in Japan would have preferred the censored film to be shown. Even though The Godforsaken Godfather was a censored version of the film, it wasn't the most explicit of the four. In fact, it was probably the least shocking, especially for viewers in the UK. For that reason, I think the censor's choice to censor The Godfuckers in Japan was a mistake. The censored film could have been a lot more shocking, but because of the censorship, it actually feels more tame. And this is the problem with censorship: it creates a situation in which censorship creates a film that is not shocking. The censorship is actually part of the movie, not an additional thing that makes it shocking.  In Japan, The Godfellas is currently playing at the Cinema Tokyo in Tokyo. The film is currently being screened in Japan on VHS. It's unclear when or if the film will be released in the U.S

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I really didn't like this movie" - a movie that's awful, but that doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy it. It's one of those movies that you can watch, and be entertained, but not enjoy. It wasn't bad. It was just an okay movie, but the story was poorly told, and the performances were terrible. The story is that a guy named Charlie (Hugh Laurie) is in a band, and has a lot of problems with his manager and his band. One day, Charlie sees a young girl, who is not a young kid at all, and who is a beautiful girl named Katie (Mila Kunis). Charlie wants to ask her out, and Katie refuses. The next day, Katie is at a party, and Charlie finds her and asks her out. He then decides to go on a date with her, and he and Katie get along great. However, Katie isn't interested, and when they meet up with her at a restaurant, she tells Charlie that she doesn't want to date him. Charlie goes on a bender, and kills a guy. He also murders a woman that Katie and he have a crush on. Charlie is in prison for murdering two people, and then goes to Katie's house. She asks him to kill her and her friend. Charlie decides to do it, and she dies in the process. Katie then leaves him, and goes to her friend's house to get a gun, and kill herself. Charlie then takes the gun, kills the friend, and tries to kill Katie. Katie is saved by the cops, and they take him into custody. They find out that Katie had been murdered by her boyfriend (Brad Pitt), and that Charlie was at the scene. They also find out Charlie had an ax and a knife at the restaurant, and that he used Katie's car. The movie is bad. But the story wasn't horrible, it was just done badly. The acting was horrible, and you would never want to see a movie like this. It doesn't help that the movie was released a few months after the Columbine shootings, and I didn´t really like this one. But it was a bad bad movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________   I'm going to be honest with you, I'm not a fan of this movie, but I'm gonna try and give it the benefit of the doubt. It's not bad at all. There's some good ideas in here, but it doesn't make a lot of sense. I was just about to turn the DVD off when I was like "Oh yeah, this is going to end up on a list of bad movies, so let's see if we can't talk about this one."   In case you don't know, this movie was released in 1997 and stars Brad Pitt as an ex-NFL player. The movie has all these great actors, but the acting just doesn't work for me. It was like they were trying to do this movie with a bunch of high school kids. It just doesn  I don't like this movie. The story is boring, and I was annoyed at how Brad Pitt just kinda acted like a jerk, and didn't really care about anyone in this movie at all (which is what made it even worse). It's so boring and stupid, it makes me think that they just went and made this movie because they didn't like how they did "Thelma and Louise." But I guess that's not really a valid excuse, because it still sucks.   The acting isn't terrible, but there are some parts where I just couldn't care less about them. Like the scene where he's talking to his girlfriend about what his new car should be. And the scene that I really don't get is where he goes to buy a new car. I'm sorry, but why didn't they just tell us in the beginning what kind of car it is? It was a big scene with Brad Pitt and I just didn't care. And then there's the scene when he's having sex with his girlfriend in the bathroom and the bathroom door opens. The camera cuts back to him in the bathtub, so why didn.t they just show us the whole scene in one shot? The door didn't close when it should have, and then the camera cuts to him getting out of the tub, so it looked like he was doing something weird. I just don't understand why they had to cut this scene like that. They could have just had him get out of his bathtub. And when he does get out, why is it so dark in the room? It's dark enough in the rest of the

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________ (2 votes)  "This film was supposed to be an epic epic that was going to be a remake of a popular series called "The Last Crusade" (which was based on a novel by the same name) but after two years of production and a long production schedule, it never got made.  The film was to be shot in France and Belgium with a cast of thousands, and it was supposed, and at the time, believed that it would be shot and finished by the time the Second World War ended in Europe in May 1945.  the script was written by Sir Christopher Lee, who was known for his portrayal of Dracula and other famous British film stars like John Carradine and Alan Bates.  and the project was headed up by the great British director of stage and screen, Sir David Lean. "The Last Warrior" was about an army of French cavalrymen, who were the last of the crusaders left in Europe, and the story took place in the last days of the Third Crusade. . The project was eventually shelved due to a series of political problems that arose, and in spite of its poor financial standing, the film is still known to this day.  in a nutshell, The Last Warrior is a bad film, with some interesting elements and an amazing script, but it is a mess of a production and one of the worst movies ever made.   and this movie is so bad, I don't even want to know what the film was about. It is like a movie made by people who were not really interested in the film, but just made a movie for their own entertainment, and that was that. , the movie is terrible, there are some interesting ideas, some of them are good and they should have been used in the movie, but this is not what the movie was about at all.  - - -, The only good thing about this movie was the actors.

But that's the only actor worth mentioning.   in a review, I said that The Last Crusade is the worst film ever made, and now I

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________  I watched this movie when it was released, and I remember how bad it was. I was so excited to see it. It was a big box office flop and the studio had to pull the movie off the shelves. I thought the trailer was funny, but that was all it was, a trailer. It had a great plot and a good cast and the whole movie was very fun. I think the best part of this movie was the opening scene. I saw it and was just laughing my head off. The movie was fun and I loved all the people in it. I just wish the movie was better. I had a lot of fun but the movie didn't end up being as fun as it could have been. I hope you'll see this movie again. It's fun and it's not that bad. _______________________________________________  "Lust" is the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time. There's a lot going on, but the characters are just so damn charming. The director, Jonathan Dayton, is an old friend of mine and I have the utmost respect for him. The acting is fantastic. The story is really good, and the action is amazing. I've never been a big fan of romances but "Lust's" storyline is definitely a romance. It has a lot to do with love and how it affects the characters, so it was really refreshing to watch. It didn't take away from the story, but it was a great addition. I also like how the movie is more in the style of "Thelma & Louise." The characters are real and the plot is great. I am so happy I was able to see this and I hope it does well at the box office.

I had never seen the film before this, so I was very curious about it.   I was a bit disappointed in the ending. I'm not sure why, since there was a lot of violence and sex that I enjoyed. It would have been much better had the ending been different.   a little later I found out that this was a film directed by Robert Zemeckis, which I thought was pretty cool. - March 13, 2007Dont know how I saw this one before - May 16, 2007the first time  Source: Digital DVD   Rating: R - May 8, 2007Horrible  Notes: I didn't see this film until I was in college. The first few scenes were a bit disturbing, but that's pretty much it. The rest of the movie is just a lot more boring. I didn  think I was watching a movie, until the very end, when the characters are all dead and the movie has a very cheesy ending.  .  , May 8-10, 2007My First Film  "We're here to do good things"  The only reason I've seen this movie is because of this review. I was really confused at the end of the film because it just felt wrong. I don't know how a film like this made it out of theaters. The acting was all wrong. The movie doesn't have much of a plot, and the characters were all very bland. I really don't see what was so great about it, and I'm really glad I didn t see it. - April 19, 2007We're Here To Do Good Things  Audience: 1.0/5  Grade: F - April 16, 2006Horrible

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "this movie is boring and sad."  This is a bad flick. There are a lot of scenes that are just not very good. The plot was pretty weak too.  The acting was bad as well. The lead actor is really annoying. He is the kind of actor who makes you want to punch him in the face. You just know that the movie is going to end in a huge explosion and then he is going back to the scene that just ended. He has to act all kinds of weird and he is never funny. This was a horrible film that is really hard to watch. It was not well made and the acting was so bad. This movie is really lame and there is nothing good in it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ A "good" movie that has a lot of problems. The story is a total lie. They make it seem like a story about a woman who was raped and that she was the one who had to kill herself to save the other woman. The movie does not have a beginning, middle, or end. The whole movie is just a bad nightmare. The plot doesn't make sense. The main character just keeps repeating the same things over and over again. They didn't even tell us the name of the movie. I thought that the movie was a horror movie because of the horrible sounds that were used. This is a horror film, not a horror comedy. The people who made this film are no better than the people who make the horrible movies that they claim to be "hilarious". I just wish that people would learn to stop making movies that are completely impossible to understand. - February 11, 2010Wake me up when the movie is over.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  "If a movie is good, I want to watch it again."  – Bill Cosby  If you are looking for a movie that is going to get me laughing for hours and hours, then you have found it.  As a movie buff, you have no idea what it is like to watch a movie and have nothing to do with it. That's when a movie like this hits you. I love this movie because it gives me the feeling of being a kid again. I would watch it over and over again just to remember how much fun I had in it. I am definitely going to watch this movie again and again. The only problem I have with this movie is that it is just too short, but I don't think I could give this a higher rating. I think it would have been better if the story was longer. The ending was great, and I was glad that the movie ended with such a bang. This movie is definitely a must see for all fans of the "Twilight" franchise.  (10/10)  The film was not as well written as some of the other Twilight films. It was more of a character study about the relationship between Edward Cullen and Bella Swan. The movie wasn't all that bad. The writing was good and it was a very well acted film. Edward and Bella were great. I enjoyed the romance between the two characters. The cast was excellent. Edward was very funny and he was an all around good character. I thought that Edward was the most interesting of the three. Bella was very believable and was a great role model for young girls. Edward is a great character and he had an interesting back story. Edward's personality was likeable and he didn't seem like a spoiled brat. The acting was good.  is a movie where I didn't have to look up any spoilers for the plot. There were a few plot spoilers that I was able to watch before I saw the movie, but there were some plot spoilers and they weren't very hard to see. This was a good movie. It has a good cast of characters. I just wish it was longer so I could see it a second time. I can't wait to see more of this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________  "You know, I think I might have to get a job as a janitor. The only reason I'm still alive is because my wife is an artist."  This is the first movie I ever watched. It was so much fun to watch. The film was about a man named Frank (Ralph Fiennes) who is a writer for a magazine called 'The Times' who decides to write a bad review of a movie. His review is not only bad, but he also hates the movie. He does not like it because it is so much like a movie he has never seen. When the film starts, he is still mad at it. When he finally sees it he is impressed. When it ends he is sad because he could never get over the bad movie. The next day he goes back to work. A new director (Jeff Goldblum) wants to hire him as a writer.  After the movie, a girl named Jessica (Kate Winslet) asks Frank to do a movie with her. He tells her he does not want to do it. They start to get together and Frank starts to like her. Then she tells him that she is going to do the movie with Jeff Goldblumm (Jeff Bridges). Frank says he does want to work with Jeff. Jessica tells him she can't, but Jeff will. So Frank gets a job at the studio and Jeff gets a film job. They begin to get closer. Jeff tries to get Frank to be in his film and Frank refuses. He even tells Jeff he does NOT want to be involved. When Jessica says she wants to do an interview with Frank, Jeff agrees. When they do, Frank is shocked when Jeff kisses her. The scene with Jessica and Frank is funny and touching. Jeff Goldman is a great actor and it is a shame they could not have gotten a film made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ This movie is horrible. I was expecting something that was close to "The Room". I got what I wanted but it is so bad. There is a scene where one of the characters has a gun and he pulls the trigger. I don't know if I want to say it is an "accident" or a "hiccup" but it does happen and it makes me laugh. It is a horrible scene. I also don't understand how a movie like this can have a budget of $3 million. I could understand if they were making a comedy. This is not funny. It has very poor acting. The plot is not very well thought out. I guess this movie was made by a couple of people with nothing better to do. This movie was very cheap. It doesn't have much of a story. The actors don't seem to have much personality. The special effects are not great. There are many scenes that are very slow and boring. The characters are so flat. The acting is so lame. This isn't funny. This was made for a couple thousand dollars and it's just terrible. I can't recommend this movie to anyone. I give it a 2 out of 10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You can't have a negative opinion of a movie that has a bad story. The film is set in a small town in rural Texas, and there are only two or three towns in the entire country. The characters are so boring that you want to see their heads explode. The main character, the town bully, is just a bully.  He has no reason to be a bully and he never does anything for anyone. He is only a bully because he is a bully, but it doesn't matter to him.  I can't think of a single good thing that happens in the movie, it is a horrible film.  I wish that the makers of this movie would just make a movie with no characters.

It's really weird how they're able to make the film look so authentic. It was a shame that the film was so bad that they couldn't make it as bad as possible. The film was like a cross between a bad TV show and a bad old horror movie. This is not a film to watch in a crowded theatre, unless you're really into the genre. If you're not, don't waste your time."  "…one of the worst films I've seen. I don't care what anyone says, this is not scary. It is a complete waste of time." – Reviewer  Watch this film: The film is not for the faint of heart. The special effects are so bad, it makes the film even worse.  I can't believe I've watched this film. The ending is so bad. It has to be the worst ending in the history of film. It doesn't even make sense. The main character, who appears to be a good guy, is actually a psychotic killer. The movie ends with the killer shooting himself, which makes it even worse, but they still somehow end the film with him shooting himself. So, you can see how bad this film is.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ This movie was terrible. I don't have any complaints about the movie. The acting is not bad at all. The movie was not really a horror movie, it was more a slasher movie, but it was horrible. The bad acting was really the only thing that was bad about this movie. But the movie was really cheesy and the acting was very cheesy and not good at all, especially for the character of the killer. The killer, he is a little slow and he doesn't have a lot of personality. He was also kind of annoying and he just kept talking to himself. He is a nice guy, but he is really annoying. And he doesn�t look like a killer at all... I just don�t see him as a killer. He has no personality and is just annoying. I just didn�t enjoy this movie, because of the acting and because of how cheesy it was. I wish I could give it a 1 star.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ I don't know what to say about this movie. I really wanted it to be better, but I can't help but think that the director really didn't know how to make a horror movie. The main character is a pretty normal kid who is on the verge of adulthood. The parents have just lost their child and the parents don't really seem to care that much about him. The father is a little abusive to the boy, but the mom is a normal, sweet, caring person who wants her son to be happy and is actually concerned for him. At one point she is about to tell her son about something bad that happened to her and her daughter and she is interrupted by her daughter's boyfriend, who walks in on them. He then tells her that they can't be friends anymore because she has been acting weird and weird behavior is something they are going to have to live with. She doesn't say a word, but instead takes his hand and puts it on her breast. I know that is a really bad movie, but it's not like there is a lot to be done with it. The movie doesn't really go anywhere and it is more of a horror story than anything else. The reason this movie doesn a bad is because there are just not enough good moments. I just don't get the point of why the parents didn't do anything about the boyfriend or why they allowed this kind of behavior to happen. It's just really gross. It seems like they just wanted the boyfriend to go away and that's all. I think they also wanted to make the film seem more adult, but honestly, the movie has way too much sex and nudity for it to really be considered "adult". The movie really doesn't try to be anything but a bad teen movie, which is fine with me, but if the main character had a different personality or if the movie had been a little more mature it would have been a much better movie. If you are looking for a fun horror movie with a really cute, happy ending, this movie might be right up your alley. It is not my favorite movie of all time, but for the money it is a good value.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________ I loved the movie "Battleship Potemkin" so much that I have seen it more than once and I have never been able to watch it in the theater. The movie was so bad that I could not enjoy it as I wanted. The director should be ashamed. I can't believe he is still alive. I have heard that he is an award winning director. The music was terrible, the costumes were horrible and the action scenes were so bad. When a soldier is shooting at a soldier who has been shot in the back by a bullet fired by a sniper he should do a slow motion of the sniper's hand going back and forth as he fires, so you can see the blood fly out of his head. The sniper is shooting from a very high position so he doesn't even look down and it is hard to see his hand because of the distance. The soldier should be shot as the bullet leaves his head and goes straight down to the ground, the sound of the gunshot should be much more intense than the movie makes it out to be. The camera should have zoomed out so that you could see the sniper firing as far as he could. He should have done a slow-motion of his hand as he shot. The sound should have been so loud that the whole theater could hear it, not only the actors. If you are interested in a bad, boring movie with bad acting, and a bad director that does not know what he is doing then watch this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "the worst movie i've seen in years, it's a total disgrace.  The plot is stupid, it has a terrible acting (i don't care for a good acting, it needs to be better than this) and the acting is horrible, it was a total waste of my time." I haven't seen it in years. I've seen the movie "The Last Days" and it's the same, except it has some good acting and some funny scenes.   But this is the worst movie I've ever seen.  It's not funny at all, it does have some funny moments, but it's so bad that it's not worth it.  And the acting?    The acting is bad.  The actors are either terrible or are just bad.   And you wonder why you can't find decent acting in this movie.  I don't even know who the characters are, there are no characters and no personality.  This movie is boring.  No, not boring, it is terrible.  Even if you know how to act, this movie is so bad, you won't be able to act.  All you can do is stare at your hands and say "oh I'm so sorry, this is a horrible movie."  The story?  This is another "horror" movie. The main character is a man who is on a death row, and he kills another man and is sentenced to die.  He's supposed to go to hell and die there.  But the man dies in the same prison where the man is on death row.  What a stupid plot.  In the movie, the main character goes to hell (the same prison) and is executed.  So the man goes to heaven and is saved from the punishment of death.  How could the main guy go to heaven?  Why?  How can this guy not be in hell?  I have no idea what happened.  Why did he go to the same place?  And if the man was not on deathrow, why would he go there and kill the man?  He is supposed to die, and yet he doesn't.  There is a lot of questions, and this movie has lots of unanswered questions.  If you are looking for a movie to see a horror movie with, this one is not it. This is a bad horror movie.   This movie was so bad it was so boring, that I
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________   I really wanted to like this movie, it's a great story. The main character is a really good actor, and his character is really interesting, he does not have any of the usual "drama" that other movies have. He is very calm and collected, which I really like, he is not a character that is easy to get along with. He just has this very natural "cool" that you really like about him.   The movie starts off with this beautiful scene where he walks around with his mother, it looks so beautiful, you can almost feel the warmth of the sun. Then he is abducted by a woman who looks a lot like a witch and he is taken to a house that has a really eerie atmosphere to it. When he is brought in, he sees a little boy, a little girl, a woman and a man, and they all have strange expressions on their faces, and when he is asked what is wrong, he says it's just a dream. The woman starts to hurt him, and he screams in pain, and then she says that he must give her something for the pain, but he says that it is just a game, he has no idea what she is talking about, and that he is really not interested in this kind of thing. The man starts to talk about "games" and "haunted houses", and when she tries to make him take the "gift" he just laughs at her, and says that this kind "haunt" is all part of his "game". When he wakes up, he finds that he has been turned into a little kid again, and the woman has turned him into a man. He then goes on a quest to find out who the woman is and to find a way to return to his normal self, and to the girl.   the movie has some great scenes where he goes on these quests, and you feel like he is in this amazing adventure, and this is a great movie, but there is no romance in it, so that is not really a good thing, because I do like a good romance in a movie, I just don't like one that is just romance and a little horror, but I will give this movie a 7/10 because I did really enjoy the story, and because it is a good story.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The only good thing about this movie is that it's not a good movie." I've never really cared for the first Star Wars, but I had to see it for the character of Luke Skywalker and what he meant to me as a child. It is the beginning of what would become the most enduring series of movies of all time. It was made in the mid-70's, in a time where Star Wars had yet to be seen on the big screen, and it was very ambitious for a movie of that time. I liked it, and I've seen it since. I've grown up and grown out of the series and am happy to let it go, but it was great while it lasted. "The Empire Strikes Back" is about the struggle between a good guy and a bad guy who have to fight for a piece of a piece-of-a-piece. A piece of the Star Wars universe. But this is no movie. This is a piece. A part of a whole. A giant piece. It's not like the movies of the 70's and 80's that I grew up with. They were always about two people fighting over a piece, and if you wanted to understand a Star Wars movie you had to watch the two of them fight for it. The Empire is not good, but they're going to win, and there's no stopping them. The heroes have been taken away, and this movie gives them back. The Empire is broken and weak, but the heroes are still around to save the day. This was the beginning. The beginning of the Empire. It's a movie about a good, noble people who were turned into bad people. A group of people who had always been good-hearted, and now had to do evil. And they were just good. What a terrible mistake. There is a great deal of dialogue in the movie, which is one of the main reasons that the movie works. When there are people talking, there are characters who are trying to be heard. They are trying their hardest to be understood. They're trying their very best to be believed. In "The Empire" there are many characters, but there are only three major characters: Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, and Leia. Each of them have their own distinct motivations. Each has their own unique perspective. Luke is trying to understand why the Empire would do something like this, and he wants to do what's

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ This is a bad film. It is a movie that I could not stand at all. It was just an excuse to show how bad movies are made. I did not think I could like a film like this because of the bad reviews it was getting. When I saw the trailer I thought it looked like a crappy action movie that was just there to make a quick buck. I was wrong. This is one of the most boring and tedious films I have ever seen. I have never been more bored and annoyed than when I watched this film. The film is so bad that I thought the whole movie was made in a day or two. It does have some great scenes but all of the movie is made up of very boring and boring scenes. The characters do not make any sense and there is not a single character that is likable. There are so many horrible scenes that I have literally watched it over and over again. The actors are just awful. I just could not understand what they were saying or what they meant by anything. I know I have watched other bad movies and this one is not any better. This film is just a terrible waste of time. The only good thing about this movie is the actors and the music. The sound is awful. It has the worst soundtrack ever and the actors are very bad. There is a song at the beginning of the film that sounds like it was made for a different movie. It should have just ended. There were some other scenes in the film where the music did not fit at all and the characters just did not look like they had any emotions. It just made the movie worse. I do not know if it was the actors or the script but the film was really boring. The story was not good and I did like how the actors did their lines but it just ruined everything. I hope someone finds this movie and finds it to be good because it is one bad movie after another. If you want to watch a bad bad movie then this is the film for you.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a little bit annoying that the only "special effects" are CGI, that it is only a few scenes of people walking in slow motion, and that the camera movement is not as smooth as it should be. The plot was not a huge mystery to me, it is like any other movie you would see in a movie theater, it had nothing new to say. It was just a bunch of action scenes, nothing new, but it was entertaining.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  Write a positive review about some really good movie: I LOVED IT!  I will write a negative one about a movie that I disliked but still enjoyed.  the best part is the ending. . I am not a big fan of "cops". I found the story to be lame and not interesting. It was about a detective and a police chief who have to deal with some gangsters. The movie does a good job with showing the police and the detective doing their job. I thought the movie was about the same time as "Pulp Fiction". The ending was great and a good way to close the movie. This movie will never make it into my top 10 list. The film could have been better and more interesting but it still had a lot of fun. This is the second "Cops" movie that was released in the 80's. The first movie was also called "COPS" and it was made in 1982. I think the movie did a good enough job to keep me interested. The ending is great and it does a great job at ending the movie without it being too cliche.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You hate this movie so much you hate it.  You say it's bad, you say it sucks, but when you see the movie for yourself, it's worse.   You don't have to be an expert in film-making to notice that this movie is terrible. It's a poorly made piece of crap. It makes me angry. I have never been more pissed off in my life. There are no redeeming qualities to this movie. The characters are cardboard cut outs. I hate how the movie takes the characters and turns them into cardboard cut out characters. I want them to be real people. I am disgusted with how the actors act. The movie has no plot. No one ever tells us what is going on in the movie. They just let the movie play out in front of us. It was so bad that my sister and I would skip through scenes because we were bored. I was hoping for some sort of resolution or plot twist to end the movie so I could just go to bed. There is no story to this film. No character development. No resolution. Just a bunch of stupid, poorly written characters in a crappy movie. There was no plot to the movie, no character development, and no resolution. There's just a buncha dumb scenes where characters get angry at each other and say stupid things. I really didn't like this movie at all. There were a lot of scenes that made me angry, and some scenes that got me pissed off. I hope they don't do a sequel to this because it is just a terrible movie.

The film, The Hunger Games, was released in 2012 and is the fourth instalment in the best-selling trilogy by Suzanne Collins.  The film, starring Jennifer Lawrence, Liam Hemsworth, Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson and Jeffrey Wright, follows a teenage boy and girl from different walks of life who are thrust into a world where all are forced to compete in an athletic event called The Hunger Game. , which is a remake of the book that it was based on, has a troubled production history. It was originally slated to be directed by Peter Jackson but the director dropped out due to creative differences. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know why I bothered with this movie. It was a bit predictable but that is pretty much all there is to it. I am a bit disappointed that this movie is a remake. It wasn't as good as the original and it is more than likely the same crew and crew members. The plot is a complete mess and I'm not sure who this guy is but it is really stupid. It also makes me wonder what was going on with the director and what was really going on in his mind. I know that he was trying to make a sequel but I think he should have just changed the title. The first one was a great movie and I would watch it again but I'm glad I didn't.

It is like watching a great movie in the theater but with more than what you are used to."  -Chris  5/5  This show is a masterpiece. You will love every second of this series and you will never want it to end. The plot is so brilliant and so exciting, you will want to keep watching even after you finish it. It's not a big surprise that this is a TV series. This is the only TV series that is so perfect, you can't even imagine how good it is. I can't wait to see how it ends. I know there are so many more series to come, so I hope they continue to make more. I hope that they continue this series for a long time and that the fans love it like I do.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  This review is for a terrible movie. I hate it. It was made for the sake of being a film. I don't know how many times the actors are given an action scene with no dialogue. The camera is always fixed on the actors, and the only thing they can talk about is the action. It's a bad way to make a movie, but that's the way it is. This movie isn't even good for that. The plot is so bad it makes no sense. I'm sure they thought they were making a great movie when they were creating the movie. The writing is bad and the acting is awful. This is a bad film and you will not be able to enjoy it. I hope they never make another movie like this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ (Click here to write a review.)  "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" (1932)   Director: George Cukor   Cast: Charles Boyer, John Gilbert, Edward R. Royce, Howard Hughes, Peter Lorre, Robert Taylor   Plot: A bunch of crooks are in jail and a new gangster is introduced to the group.  Plot summary: The film starts with a jailhouse confession by a mobster and a mob member's request to see a priest.  the priest says "the confessions have not been made" but that he has seen confessions that were made by the mob.  in the jail cell is a man named "Piggy" who is talking about the murder of his wife. he is very close to his wife and he was trying to kill her.  (In "Dirty Harry" he was talking about how his wife was a drug addict, and how he killed her. But in "Dry Run" Piggy says that his wife got him hooked on drugs, and that she is a prostitute, so she was the reason he killed his wife, but he still wanted her dead. And later in the film Piggy is seen hanging from a jail door, which he hung himself from, he is hanging by a chain that was used for hanging dogs, and he is hung from a cross beam. He is hanging from the cross beam by his thumbs and by his heels, and the crossbeam is hanging over a pit that was the pit of his dead wife.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Nov 25, 2017 5:45 AM by jimmywiseman in  How To Stop A Zombie. How many zombies are in this film? 3   _____________________________________________ I don't usually give 5 stars to a movie, but this was one of those movies that I couldn't stop watching.    My first viewing of this movie was on Netflix with my dad and we were talking about how much we loved the film.   After our conversation, I saw a review of it on IMDB that said the movie was "bad".  It is my opinion that it was a bad film, but not in a "bad" way.    The movie is about a group of people in a small town who go on a mission to stop a zombie outbreak.        The movie started with a very slow start, but once the zombie outbreak was brought under control, it started to pick up.  And that's what made the movie.  The movie kept on building up and getting more intense.  As a movie that was built on tension and a real fear of zombies, this movie had it.  It's also good that they didn't make it into a "tear jerker".  They kept the tension up and kept the zombies real.  There were a lot of "awkward" moments in the movie but they were well done and added to the suspense.  This movie didn't just stop the zombie virus from spreading, it took it's toll on people as well.  Most people are scared of what will happen if they are infected.  Some people even went so far as to kill their families and kill their pets.  I saw several people that were in the infected area but weren't infected, just afraid of it. The characters in this movie were well written and acted well. I liked that they were not just "heroes" that just got in a battle with the zombies.  Their lives were just as important as the people that weren't.  They were just ordinary people that did their best to help each other out.  Even though some people got infected, they didn�t just get a few bites.  When the infected people were around people that didn't get infected, some people even turned against them.  Another nice thing about this movie is that it shows the
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________"   I have always loved the works of the French director Jean-Luc Godard. I have seen his films as a child growing up in the 1960s and 1970s, and have loved the way they have depicted the French countryside, and even the French cities, as the backdrop for his dramas. In his work, the rural setting and its people are almost as much a character as the actors themselves. In the film Godard does something different. He does not use the countryside as a setting, but the French urban setting, as if to say, "Hey, this is a real place! It can be seen everywhere! And there are real people living there, who can be found everywhere! It doesn't matter if you are in the middle of nowhere, or in the centre of Paris, or right in the heart of the capital."   In his film, Godard uses the people in the film to comment on the situation. And he does this in a way that is so effective that it is hard to believe that this film was ever made.   The film begins with a woman named Julie (Anne-Marie Duff) who has just left a hotel in the small village of Fouché. She is accompanied by her husband, and they go to a local market, to pick up some food for their dog. At the market, they meet a local boy who is walking his dog, and the boy offers to help Julie and her husband. After a bit of conversation, they agree to buy some vegetables. Julie and the local boy leave, and as they walk home, they pass a man named Louis (Claude Rains), who is sitting in a parked car, watching them go by. He looks up at the sky, and says, "Wow, that's beautiful!" He then continues to watch them as they drive away, until he is caught in a traffic jam. Then, he is driven to a small, abandoned house by a taxi driver.  . He is in a state of shock, and doesn't know what has happened to him. He goes to a hospital, and asks the doctor to call a friend who is a physician, who has the same name as his wife. This man calls, and gets Julie and Louis to come to the hospital.   The doctor calls his friend, and Julie and Louie are admitted to a mental hospital. It turns out that Julie's husband has left for Paris, to look for her. They are
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  My name is Jeff. I am a writer. I have a bad ass movie. I will be the first to tell you it's a really great movie. But, it's also a little sad. And, you know, sad is good, right? It's a little bittersweet. And a little depressing. And sad is a good thing.   So, I know what you're thinking. "Jeff, you're gonna make it sound like it's all bad. And it's not. You just gotta take a deep breath and you'll be fine. You'll be just fine."   I know. And I'm gonna try. But I'm not going to do it this way. It's gonna be an experiment. I'm trying to find a way to make a movie about a man and a woman who are trying to deal with a broken relationship. I think that it would have been a much more satisfying movie if it had focused more on the relationship itself. And the relationship is pretty good. It just seems like the relationship kind of just fell apart, I guess.  , if you've never heard of, I highly recommend it. It was made in 1987, which was the height of grunge, and the soundtrack was a mixture of grungy tunes and rock songs. I really liked the film and I think it was a good movie. It had a lot of heart and I thought it was really good. But the way it was made is so disappointing. The film opens with a man going to a party where he is given a drink that will make him hallucinate and he has this vision of a naked woman with her legs spread open. He's told to go to a bathroom and masturbate to the sight of her, and he does. The next day, he comes back to his apartment and there is a naked girl standing in his doorway. He is in complete shock and asks her what's going on. She tells him she's a psychic and can predict what's gonna happen in his life. She says she'll tell him something in his bedroom, and that's when he sees the girl standing there with her arms spread wide and her legs open. This is what the film tries to explain in a very simple and straightforward way, but in my opinion, the film doesn't succeed at that. The story is about a guy and a girl who are having a rough time in their relationship. The guy is a successful businessman, but
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. That's all you need to know.  "If you are looking for a good movie about the dangers of the Internet, this is not it. If you are watching for a laugh, this isn't it. This movie is about a guy who is so concerned with his privacy that he starts using the Internet and ends up making more enemies than friends."  The film begins with a man going online to try and locate a missing friend. Unfortunately for him, the friend is also online and is using his computer to track him down.  the first thing that pops in your mind when you see the title of this film is the fact that it's based on a true story. However, this film isn't so much about a true incident, but more about the impact of the information age on our lives. The movie itself is about as bad as you can possibly make a film about a man who is very worried about his privacy and wants to get off the Internet. Unfortunately, he's a real person and not just some Internet avatar. He's an Internet person. His name is Daniel Miller, and the film begins when he gets arrested for using the wrong email address. After his arrest, he is placed in a federal jail for a number of years for using a stolen credit card to buy a used car. The movie then goes on to follow him as he struggles to get out of his situation. , starring Daniel Miller as Daniel Miller (an internet person), and Elizabeth Perkins as his girlfriend, Jennifer. The story is set in the 90's when a computer virus called "Cryptolocker" is being spread. Daniel finds himself unable to pay his credit card bills so he decides to use a fake address to buy an expensive car and get away from his debt. The computer virus then turns into an Internet worm that infects the computers of people in an attempt to find the owner. Daniel begins using the computer to find out who's computer he's on and where he is. The film follows his journey and how he comes to be a part of a small group of people who fight back against the virus. We all know that the internet has made it easier for people to communicate with each other. We also know that it has also made it a lot easier to get things stolen. This is what makes Daniel's story so fascinating. It's a tale of how technology is changing people's lives. Daniel and Jennifer get caught up in this world of the internet
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Do not watch this movie. There are only 2 movies I've seen in which a woman was a victim. This movie is the worst one of all. I can't stand this movie because of its gross and violent scenes. The movie is a remake of a movie called The Clansman (1960) which is a classic. This is another remake of this movie and the original movie had a more interesting storyline. I'm sorry but I can not tolerate this movie at all. This story is just a terrible story. I've read the book in which it was based but it was too long to watch it. This one was too short and too horrible to watch. I hope you'll never watch this and never give your money to a movie like this again. This review is not to blame the director or the actor. I am sure they had great intentions and all the people involved have a great heart but the story is too terrible and the actors are just too dumb to do a good job.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________  A bad movie that isn't as good as it thinks it is  I thought this was a decent movie, but I found out later that the director, Tom Savini, has a lot of issues with the casting, and he is clearly not a good director. There are some funny parts in this movie, as they were on the original TV show. There is also a scene where a kid has a crush on a girl and she says he doesn't know what to do about it. Then he tries to get close to her, and she kisses him. The scene was so uncomfortable to me, and I thought it was just going to be a silly scene. I don't like Tom Savinhini either, so that was a turn off.  If you are looking for a fun movie, this one might be a good choice. If you want something more, then don't watch this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** The movie is a poor adaptation of a great book. The book was very entertaining and well written. The movie doesn't even have the slightest bit of plot and the characters are all cliched and one-dimensional. It would have been much more interesting if the movie had just taken the book as it was and left the rest of the book to its own device. There is no plot and no development in the book. There are only two characters in the movie. The only person who doesn't seem to have any personality is the main character. The main character is a little boy who doesn´t know what to do with his life. He is a perfect model for a kid who thinks he is a grown-up. He goes to a big city and has all kinds of adventures. But in the end he does nothing. He has no real problems or dreams or goals. His problems are imaginary. He just doesn´T know what is going on around him and doesn´nt seem to care. I don´t think the author is the one who made the main characters in this movie. I am afraid that the author has written a book where the characters don´ t have any feelings. There isn´t any development of any character. There were a lot of stupid things in the original book. Now I am sure that a lot were deleted in the editing but the book still had a lot to say. I think the writer of the movie has tried to make the movie a little bit different from the book but there is nothing to really make this movie different from a lot other movies. It´s just a stupid movie. It was a very good book though.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Oct 7, 2017 11:30 AM by Chris Houser  There's nothing worse than a good movie that's overstuffed with stuff that does not add up. The film's main character, Peter Parker (a high school senior who gets bitten by a radioactive spider), is portrayed as a loner. This is very much a Peter Parker movie and it shows. We see no sign of the boy who was the original star of Spider-Man comics, and he has no friends. In fact, he barely even talks to anyone.  In this movie, we see him go through a number of changes. He grows into a strong man who wears a blue and black Spider-Tracer suit. He becomes a good student who becomes an Eagle Scout. He joins the Avengers, where he joins up with a number people, including Spider-Woman. He goes on a number adventures, like a battle with a giant squid that almost kills him. . The film also stars Emma Stone as Spider-Girl, the new Spider-woman. She is played by Kirsten Dunst, who plays a woman who takes care of her ailing father. She's a very sweet girl and very much like the young Peter Parker. The movie features a number actors, like Tom Holland as the web-slinging character, Michael Keaton as a bad guy and Dane DeHaan as the villain. All of the characters seem to fit in together and make for a nice movie. The only problem I had with this movie was that it takes itself so seriously.  and it has a lot of fun doing it. This movie is very funny, with the movie's own funny characters and with the characters that have appeared in other films.  the action scenes are well choreographed, and the stunts are done well. The fight scenes are also pretty well done and all the characters look very good. There is some great action in this movie. It's not quite a comic book movie but it does have a good sense of humor.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ I've seen this movie before, in my late teens, and even though I liked it, it was nothing special. In this movie, a guy named John Travolta is driving down a highway in a Corvette when a guy in a VW Beetle crashes his car. The driver of the VW Beetle, played by Peter Falk, tells John T. that he is the only man in the world who can get him out of this situation, and the Beetle driver tells John that he must go to his home in California to get help. This leads John T., who is married, to drive down the highway. John T.'s home is a very nice house, but it's in the middle of nowhere, and there are no people in it. So John takes off, driving all night, until he arrives at the address of his former girlfriend's mother, which is a small house, not far from the road. John's wife has a room at the house, and she is a good friend of the girl's mother. The mother lets John come to her room for a little while, and he spends some time with her, and later, in the evening, John goes back to the girl, who is still in bed. The next day, John has trouble getting the girl out of bed, and eventually, he gives in, and gets her out of the room. At that point, he goes back into the girl and finds her in a pool of blood, and it is obvious she has been dead for a very long time. John goes home, and tells his wife what happened. He tells her that his friend Peter Falk is the man who saved him, and that he has been in love with this girl, and now that she is dead, he can't live without her. _________________________________________________ The Movie: I'm going to start off by saying that I really didn't think this movie was very good. The story, while good, was really not worth watching. The acting was okay, but the plot was not very good, and I just wasn't very interested in it at all. The movie is about John Taven, who has a girl named Laura (Susan Griffin) he has had for years. Laura is really a little girl, but she has a very high IQ. John and Laura have been together since high school, and they have a very loving relationship. In one night, Peter Falk drives John Tavera from the California coast to California
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ I'm not even going to start with the trailer. If you are watching this movie, then you are going to be bored to death by the first 30 seconds of the trailer that is just a bunch of static on a black screen. The film itself is about a man that loses his wife and then goes on a revenge rampage. It's about how he gets revenge on the people who screwed him over. He kills his own wife and his father, and even kills his sister and her children. The story is told through flashbacks of his family and the things that happened to them as a result of his wife cheating on him. He also kills a bunch more people because of his revenge. The movie is pretty well made. I did like the special effects that they used in the movie. It looked pretty cool, although it's hard to see in the trailer but it's there. I think the best thing about the movie was the voice-over that the main character gives to his daughter, and that is how he really feels about his wife. He tells her that she's the reason he doesn't feel like he's worth anything. It was a really good way to portray his feelings about his family. But the rest of the movie just wasn't that great. The acting was ok. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great. I guess it's not bad at all, but it just didn't really do anything for me. The only reason I liked it was because of the ending, but that ending was pretty weak. There's one scene that was pretty good and the rest was just ok. There was nothing special about the story or the acting. If this movie was better then it would have been worth watching, but as it is, it just isn't. I don't know what's so special about it. I could've gotten bored and it wouldn't have changed that much of the rest. But it's just not a good movie. I wish I would've liked it more. Overall, I don,t think this movie is worth watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  "No, I did not get any of that shit. It was all so stupid. If you're going to make a movie about a group of people who just want to have fun, and don't care about anything except that, that's fine. But if you're gonna make a fucking movie about people that are just out to kill each other, then you need to know the difference between a movie and a movie-of-the-week. You can't have the most ridiculous plot ever written, and then go and make a shit movie about it. That's like if I wrote a book called "The Biggest Loser" and made a movie of it. No one would even want to read that book. But they would love to watch a movie based on that book, because it's all so ridiculous and stupid. So if I write a movie called "A Day in the Life of a Big Loser", and it's based on the book, and it has a bunch of dumb things happen to it, and people do stupid things to each other all the time, and you make it into a really bad movie, then I should just make a really shitty movie of "The Day of the Locust". And then, when it gets a little better, you could say "Okay, that was a really good movie about some real things. It made me think about the things that I was going through."  - Mark Twain

I got the sense that the actors were happy to get a paycheck for a few hours of work and were doing whatever they could to make it look good.

I would recommend watching it on a plane, or while on vacation. I think it was meant to be a short film, but I'm glad I didn't get to see it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________. That is all I will say about that movie.  What is so wrong with it? I'm not even sure if it's good.  in a genre of movies where they always get it right, you can't help but feel disappointed by this. It's got some great scenes and characters but overall it's just a poorly written, poorly acted mess. A huge disappointment.   I feel bad for the poor writer who had to write this. The writing style isn't really good either. It feels like he was really struggling to write a story. It just has a really bad rhythm to it. It has a bad rhythm. Like it's like he had no idea what he was writing. It seems like it took a long time to write it and it feels like it was written in one sitting. It was really bad.  , so I can't really comment on the characters, but the bad acting and bad writing makes me feel like I'm watching a poorly acted sitcom. It also has an annoying voice over (I hate voice overs) and the ending really sucks. The ending is a mess, it's a pretty bad ending and you can really see why the movie wasn't really well liked. The main characters just don't go anywhere and are very boring.   with this, I have to say this movie just feels like a waste of time. . So this movie doesn't really feel like a movie. It doesn't feel like anything. The story is so confusing. I have no idea where the movie is going and no clue what the movie's about. It definitely feels like someone was trying to write something and failed miserably. The acting is bad, but they were all pretty good, they all had really good chemistry together. They all played the same characters so it doesn't matter. The script is also so confusing, it doesn the main character so much. He has no reason to be there, so it makes it really confusing when he's talking to the main characters. It takes a long while to figure out what's going on and the story doesn't make any sense. The movie is just so confusing and hard to follow.   "It was like someone had given up and was just standing in the middle of nowhere. The world looked so real it was almost scary. And that was the movie. "  The movie was supposed to be about an old woman who was found living in a hut on the side of a mountain with

And you feel bad for the actor. You think he should have had a better career. But if you're a good person, then you have to watch this movie. I don't think it was made for children.

I cannot believe this movie has a release date. This movie is the worst of the year. I am ashamed to admit that I saw it on video once and enjoyed it. It is a disgrace to the movie industry.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ What I liked: ______________________________________________ I liked the movie, but I think the producers tried too hard to make the movie about their lives. This is a family film, and that is not a theme that is often shown on film, but it works. The story is good and the actors are very good. The soundtrack was good and there are some funny parts. The cinematography was very good and I enjoyed the use of long takes. The movie did not have much of a plot, but the characters are real people and they did not try to make it a plot. The production values were very good for a film of this kind, and I would say the movie would have been better with a more budget. I think it was worth watching, but you will not see it very often. I recommend this movie to everyone who likes family films. It has a very strong family connection. ______________________________________________________ What didn't work: _____________________ The movie was so over the top that it was not funny, and there were some scenes that were just too ridiculous to be taken seriously. I also found the music very boring, so I think that was also an effect of the movie. I do not know if I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a good family movie, because the production values are not there. ______________________________________________________________________________ Score: ______________________________________

The movie was a total train wreck. The main character was completely insane and he was just a stupid idiot. He was a good actor but he was not that great in this movie. The film was just ridiculous.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I have to admit, I had some pretty low expectations coming in here. The trailer made me look forward to it, and I was expecting something like an action thriller, but the movie didn't disappoint at all.  My wife loved the film, but for some reason I felt it was pretty dull. I can't explain why. It's not that the film wasn't entertaining, it's just that it was kind of bland, and boring. It was just not that much of an experience. I thought the story was pretty interesting, but it was very predictable, and there were so many "aha" moments, I felt like it was just padding on the story. Overall, the story itself wasn't that great either, but I would still say it was well done.   I give the film an 8 out of 10. I enjoyed it, but don't think it's a must see. .

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________ A simple, but very effective, movie. This is the best example of "horror" on the big screen I have ever seen. The story is simple, and it makes sense, but it is still a very scary movie, despite it's short running time. It is a story of a girl that is trapped in a house, and of a little boy who is being trapped in that same house. Both characters have to find out what is happening to the other, but only one can get out of the house. This movie was released in the mid-70s, and has a very dated look to it, but that is the effect it has on you. I think this movie would have been much better if it had been longer. It was a bit too short for my tastes, but still has some good scenes. A bit of a slow start, but the characters are very well developed. The music is just good enough, but you don't have to worry about the lyrics, and the acting is very good, although it could have been a bit better. This might not be a good movie for children, but for older teens or adults, it is a great horror movie. The only real problem I have with this movie is that there were too many things happening at once. The plot is quite simple, yet it doesn't make sense until you see the ending. The end credits just kept getting longer and longer. This was one of those movies that just doesn't have any real bad endings. Overall, this is a good example of a good horror movie, and a very effective one at that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________  When the trailer came out for The Man Who Would Be King, it immediately set my hair on fire. The man is clearly a super human, who has done amazing things, like save the world, save his son and be a hero. The only problem with the trailer is that it does not tell the whole story. It is like a trailer for the film, except the story is being told from his perspective. This is just plain lazy and misleading. It makes it seem like he was a great hero, when he wasn't.  I was so excited when I saw the trailer, that I started watching the trailer while I was reading a book, and the book kept on reading while I watched. I was also so excited about the movie, that when I found out the movie was about a super hero, I was excited to see how the story was going to play out. But when the movie started, it didn't seem like it was going in a superhero's direction. The villain was a bad guy. The hero had an accident, he was in a coma for a few days and was getting better, then came back and defeated the bad guy by himself. So why did it feel like he only had a small part in the movie?  It was like the hero was the star of the movie and everything else was just an afterthought. I have seen some bad movies before, like The Dark Knight, but The Man who Would Be king felt like a movie that was made to cash in on the movie superhero craze. It was an okay movie. But it was just a movie, so I guess I can't complain too much. It doesn't mean that it was bad. But I just wanted it to be a superhero movie. I wanted it not to be just another superhero movie, but a real hero movie. It should have been a movie about the real life hero that really did do amazing things. :  If you want a movie where the hero does a heroic thing, but he gets a little mixed up with the villain, and then is saved by his son, then this is a movie for you. If you want to see a superhero story about the hero who gets mixed up in a conspiracy that is destroying the world and saves a bunch of people that are under attack, then you will be disappointed. I think this movie was made by people who don't like superheroes. The movie is not bad, but I just wish

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ***********   If you like bad movies and don't mind a bunch of cheesy jokes, then "Bad Boys II" will make you laugh your ass off. I mean, it's not a bad film, but it is a pretty bad movie. The actors are all so lame, and the movie is so bad, that it is laughable. It is a parody of a "B" movie, but its jokes are not funny. The movie is a train wreck, and every scene that isn't about the train wreck is just a joke. The film starts off by having one of the main characters, "Lucky", being asked by his girlfriend, "Why don't you do some work for me?", and he responds, "It doesn't pay as well". Well, you can't make a living doing that, and it just makes me want to vomit. When they finally get some real work, they do some good stuff, but after a while it gets bad. The guy in charge of the "office" at the train yard gets fired, and a bunch more of the stupidest characters get hired, but nothing happens. So the guy with the funny glasses is fired, but then he gets promoted to the director of the office, and then he goes to Hollywood. It's like the film goes from bad to worse, and when it gets good, it is so lame it's hilarious. The acting is so awful, that you can tell who is who. This is not a movie that you should see.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ If the movie was good, then the reviewers are bad. If the reviewer is bad, then you're the one who's not watching the movie correctly. The movie's good, and the reviewers were wrong, but you're not the one to blame.  The movie is about a man who becomes obsessed with a man he finds at a carnival. The carnival is a parody of all the places that people go when they're bored or sad. The guy is a former boxer who has gotten lost in a labyrinth of carnival-like rides and games, where he's always getting into trouble with the police. The film is about the man's struggle with his identity as a loser who must try to find himself again.   The film was well-reviewed in the U.S. and was a big hit in Japan. There was a remake made for American audiences, but it was a terrible mess that had the director (and star) making a fool of himself.  : This film was written and directed by Masaaki Yuasa, who is known for his work in this genre of films, but he did make a lot of terrible mistakes. For example, he tried to make it a "Japanese version" of a European horror film. He cast an American and a German actor to play the roles, and they had to be separated so that one actor could do a Japanese accent. In the end, it's a terrible performance, as the Americans and Germans are too different from each other. He also tried to use a lot more Japanese people for the cast, and he's supposed to be trying to make the Japanese people look more Japanese than the Germans, but they're all doing the same weird "blondes with glasses" thing, which is terrible. It makes the Japanese look like they're not being realistic, and that's not how Japanese people really look. The director also made a lot mistakes with his film's script. Most of it was nonsensical, so it's hard to figure out what's going on. And he made some of the movie seem like it was written in a hurry, so he didn't have time to add any good bits. For instance, the Japanese character who tries to seduce the American guy is supposed to have a big speech in the middle of the film, but the director just wrote it on the script and then never put it onscreen. It doesn't make much sense.   and so on. I've never

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ Reviewed by: Paul K. This is a very strange film. I'm a fan of the movie, and I thought the director had done an excellent job, but I'm very disappointed with this film. The story is about a man (Robert Redford) who is a part-time psychic who believes in "voodoo." In his daily life, he has to deal with people who want to "kill" him. After the murders occur, he goes to the hospital where the people are kept, to give them "the talk" in which he tries to get them to see that he has no responsibility for the murders. I don't understand what Redford's character is trying to do. He's a nice, decent guy. Why would he want to hurt these people? Also, it doesn't make sense that a person who has a psychic ability, but is totally innocent, would want to kill people. It's just not in his nature. The film is very interesting in that it tries to make the audience see the other side of the coin. I enjoyed it and hope the movie will be on the big screen someday.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  A great idea, but bad execution  What could have been a great idea to create a world of heroes that could be your own, instead of the bland "good guy" that you've seen in so many movies. Well, it all comes down to the execution. The movie just isn't very good. The writing is weak. The characters aren't really developed and the plot is completely made up. The plot is just way too stupid. The film does a lot of things right, however. The art is great, the story is great. But the execution is just so very bad. There are things in the film that I actually like. The action, the characters, the setting. But in the end, it just doesn't have enough going for it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________ I really did not want to watch this movie. It was just so bad. I mean it was bad for the same reason the "The Walking Dead" is bad: It has a boring plot and boring characters, and it has some of the worst special effects ever. And this movie even has the same actors playing the same roles! It's like "The Lord of the Rings" all over again. The only thing worse than the acting is the writing. I was trying to keep up with what was happening, but I was just not paying attention. The characters were just too dumb and the plot was just too contrived. I'm sure this movie will become a classic when I'm 80 years old, but for now, it's just a horrible waste of time. If you have not seen this movie, don't go out of your way to watch it. It's not worth the time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ This movie was really bad. I am not a big fan of horror movies, so I was expecting it to be really bad, but the first half was really boring and didn't give me any feelings, so that was a big let down. Then it turned out to be a really bad sequel, so this movie isn't worth watching. The ending was pretty lame. I feel that it would be better if they did not make a sequel to the original, but instead make a new movie. Also, I really didn't like that the actor playing the doctor didn't show up in this movie. The only thing I really like about the movie was the ending.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. No need to put that in the title. It's not that the movie sucks. It sucks badly. If I was going to make a list of the worst movies I've ever seen, it would be called "Hollywood's Worst Movies."  I went into this movie completely uneducated. This is my first time seeing a horror film, and I expected something that would be much better than the typical slasher flick. However, this is not a slasher film. This film has a horror element, but it's nothing that would make you jump out of your seat, or scream. This movie has a much more grounded feeling.  You start off in a room. It is dark, but you can still see light from the hallway. You hear a door open. You turn around and see a woman walking into the room. You are a bit disturbed at the thought of a woman coming into your house. You go back to bed. You can hear footsteps coming from the bathroom, and then you hear them come into the bedroom. The woman is standing there in the middle of the room with a knife. You pull the covers up and you get up. You try to run to the door, but there is a knife in your hand. You close the door and you lock it, and you hope you can get out of there. You run out of the house, and a woman is following you. The only thing that is consistent in this movie is that there is no consistency. You will see things that happen over and over and it doesn't really matter. The most common thing that will happen is that you will see a knife, and there will be blood.  the movie is extremely cheesy. The acting is very bad. There are some scenes where they make you think that the actors are talking out of their ass. The music is not good, either. It doesn't fit the scene very well. The movie does have some very strong moments, though. The ending is the most memorable and the one that most people are going to remember.  a very boring movie that was really hard to watch. it's a very good movie that you could watch at work.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  This is a very well-acted movie that has some good moments but it is too long and is not funny. There are too many characters and they don't seem to be very well developed. I really would have liked to have seen some more action or if they added in a character who wasn't so mean to the characters in the beginning, it would have made it a more fun movie. It seems that they don�t have any idea of what a comedy is. They don�tty know how to make a movie funny.  I would recommend this movie to everyone, but if you are an audience that has seen it, then you know that it will have a bad ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________________________________________  The film is not as bad as the title says. It was just poorly made. The acting was terrible. I felt like I was watching a poor man's version of a film by John Travolta. They gave the movie a lot of money and then they spent it all on a movie that was never even released. The movie was so bad that they had to add a disclaimer on the beginning of the movie that it was made in 1999. It is very obvious that the director just went through a lot to get this film made. It took him 3 years to film it. He got a little help from an actress (Sarah Michelle Gellar) who played his wife in a television show called "Firefly" and also starred in the film. It has been reported that they actually bought the rights to a television program called "Battlestar Galactica" and used that in the movie to give it more action and to have the characters look like the TV show. They also did a little extra CGI. The only good thing about this movie is that it has the original "Star Wars" theme and it is very funny. If you have not seen the original movie, do not watch this. You will not enjoy it. It's a terrible film. I wish they would have gone with the original concept that the movie is based on. ________________________________________________________________________________________  I think this is a great movie. I like the movie and the cast did an excellent job. The main problem is that this is NOT the original Star Wars. I found it hard to believe that this was not the original film. The film is very good. The plot is not that good. However, it is well made. There is action in the first part of the film, but the rest is very forgettable. The ending is very confusing. It gives you more of a sense of what happened with the movie but it is still not a satisfying ending. The story itself was not that bad. The script was good. Some of the actors had some great moments. I hope they do another one. I really enjoyed this movie and it would be a good idea to do another. It should be rated higher.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ _____________ What a fucking mess. I have never seen a movie that was so stupid and pointless. And it's not just about stupid. It's not about the acting. It doesn't even get into the fucking pointless. I was never impressed with the direction, and I didn't even care about the script. And this is a movie about a person's life. This is a life-changing movie. If I hadn't already seen it I would not have gone to see it. And you know what? I don't even like the ending. It was so silly, it was almost like a dream. I can't even begin to explain how stupid it was. And I don the director did a bad job at directing this. This movie was terrible. It didn't make me laugh. It made me want to scream. And then I think about the people involved and I wonder what they're thinking. And if they had been successful in getting it made, what kind of impact that movie would have had. I wonder if they would still be famous. I don`t know. I hope they're not. I didn`t think the acting was any good. I thought it was terrible and it didn't help that I could only watch it with my family. This was one of those movies where if I ever wanted to go to a movie theater and I saw this movie I would be embarrassed to go there. This one time when I was at a movie and I wasn't even watching the movie, I was just thinking about this movie. I felt like I was watching it with a bad memory. That's why I have this bad memory about movies, I mean I really can`t remember many of them. So that's how I feel about this one. I just can` t stand this movie and if you see this movie with a group of friends you will have a great time but don't go to this movie alone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ I saw the original Godzilla and the sequel with Arnold and they were both awful. They weren't that great, but I saw them as a kid and they sucked. This movie is a remake of a movie I never saw as a child. It's about a giant monster and it looks like a giant robot that is in a trench. The movie was just awful. It was bad enough to be funny, but it was just really boring. The monster looks really stupid and the plot is just silly. The story is basically that a scientist is trying to create a monster, but the creature just doesn't look good. It just looks like the same monster that was in the original movie. The whole movie just makes no sense. I mean, what is that? A giant robot? I don't know. That is pretty lame.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ A movie is a piece of art and a work of art should be appreciated for its artistic value. I didn't find the movie to be artistic. I found it to be a terrible movie with poor acting, terrible writing, and terrible direction. It's like you've watched a horrible horror movie. And I don't mean the kind that's just scary, I mean that the movie was just stupid and it had the look of a terrible poorly written movie that was directed by a mediocre movie director. I was completely and utterly bored by the movie and when the ending started playing, I was ready to throw the DVD on the ground. A terrible movie is not worth your time. If you want to see a bad bad movie, go to a friend's house and watch a terrible bad movie with him. If he doesn't have a copy of the movie, you can buy a copy and watch it. If it's a bad copy, go see the movie at a video store, because you can rent it for a reasonable price. Don't waste your time with this movie. You might get something out of it, but it's not worth the time.

I know it's a children's movie but they could at least have had a better script. The story is a big fat lie. The first half of the film is really funny and there are a few nice moments. The second half however is just awful. It's like a bad TV series where you have to keep watching because you can't help but laugh. The characters are so one dimensional and stupid. And then it turns into some cheesy comedy. It makes no sense at all. The film is not very scary at all and I can't wait for the next installment.

I don' like this at all and I don''t want to listen to it.   This movie is not very good. It is slow paced and it is really boring. It only has about 6 minutes of music. But I think that is the only good thing about this movie.   in my opinion, this is a waste of money.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________________ I loved this movie! It was fun to watch and it made me feel like a kid again, especially after watching all the other bad movies in the 80's. This movie was a classic in my opinion. I was so happy when it ended! I remember watching this movie with my friends when I was a little girl. I think the movie was about an alien who was sent to earth as a child, he was given the name of "The Boy". I remember that my friends and I used to call him "Pops" because he was always smiling. I always wanted to be like him when I grew up. He was the only boy that I loved, but I also loved my other two sisters very much. They were very good people, always happy and laughing. One day they decided to go on a picnic with some friends and that was the last time I saw my brothers. They are always with me and I miss them so much. I still think of them every time I watch this movie. It's always been my favorite movie. I hope it will be made into a movie again. It is such a shame that this movie didn't have a sequel, because I feel like it could have been one of the great movies of all time! I hope that some one will make a sequel to this great movie. Please make a movie about Pops and his family.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie you have to see.  It is a story about a young girl named Lucy who is abducted and held captive by a sadistic cult that worships an evil demon.  The demon has a huge cock and is willing to sacrifice children in order to satisfy his appetite.  She is rescued by a couple of men, one of which is a priest and the other a priest's brother.  In order to get Lucy back, they must find a way to stop the demon.   The movie has a strong message.    When I first saw it, I didn't really understand what the movie was about but after watching it I can't deny it's impact.  It will make you want to take a shower.  For people who are not familiar with the story, I would suggest watching it first.  There are a few twists in this movie that I haven't seen in other movies so you will have to pay attention to what's going on.  If you don't understand it, you will hate it.  This movie has everything to make it a classic.  I think that is one of the best movies ever made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Share this  Tweet   I just got a bad review on Amazon, but I don't want it to discourage you from going see this movie. I thought the movie was very well done and well acted. It was very funny and had a good story line. I don\'t understand why it got a 2 star rating. I think a 1 or 2 star would have been more appropriate. The only thing I didn\'t like was the sex scene. It seemed like the director wanted to show sex, but in a way that was too realistic. I felt like the actor was trying to simulate sex, and it just didn\'ts work. The other thing that I don\'t understand is why a girl with a big breast would have a bad sex scene in this movie? I don\\\'t get it. I had the same problem with that movie and I think the director probably should have done a sex scene with a guy with a smaller breast. I know the movie is rated PG-13, but it felt like sex was being shown too realistically. Also, I think it was a little overrated. The movie had a few good songs in it, but the acting was so bad that it felt more like a parody of a porno than a real movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot of movies. This movie was absolutely horrible. I was expecting something really cool from a guy that plays a giant in a video game. Instead this guy plays a generic character that was supposed to be a bad guy. There was no evil and there was no reason for the giant to be bad. In the first two minutes of the movie the giant is supposed to kick the bad guy's ass and then the giant kills the bad guys. The bad guys are walking down a dark alley when the giant jumps on them and kills them. The movie never stops, it was like an episode of The Walking Dead. The scene where the giant grabs the badguy and throws him out of the window was absolutely ridiculous. I can't believe this movie got a PG-13 rating. The giant is a big ass dude and the guy playing him was small and looked like he was in a coma. This is a horror movie. If you are looking for a cool and fun movie then this is not the movie for you. I gave this movie a 1 because it was very un-memorable and I don't think that the whole movie would have worked if it had been PG-rated. I hope that the producers of this movie get the message that there is a difference between a PG and a PG for a reason.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it doesn't make you want to see it anymore.  It makes you want it less.  The biggest issue I have with the movie is that the characters aren't given enough screen time.    It's one of those things you see in movies all the time and never think to criticize.    In the first act, the characters are shown to be very good friends, so we understand that it's a friendship that was developed over a long period of time and that they don't see each other that often.  We don't really get to see them talk a lot, but we get to know what makes them feel like they're so close that it could kill them to lose them.  It gets a little cheesy later in the movie, when the two friends are fighting over a girl.  She's not really important to the plot, but it's there for the purposes of establishing how close they are.  But, for the rest of the movie?  There's really nothing special about them, other than that they are friends.  What I really want to know is why they are so close.  Is it because they are both very tall and have huge chests?  Why are they friends?   Is there some deeper reason?  I'm not sure.  In a movie that is trying to be funny, it does a pretty good job, but there's not much to the humor.  Even though the humor is supposed to be based on a bunch of funny moments, they all seem like they could be taken out and there would be nothing else.  This is not a movie you want a friend to tell you about.  There's not a lot of character development.  That's the biggest problem I have.  I don't know what happens to them.    And if there is, I don' t know why I need to know.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________.  I will make this brief because this movie was absolutely awful. A very low budget film. Very poor acting and direction. I will try and avoid any spoilers. This movie should have never been made. I really want to see this film. This is a very poor film. The plot was terrible. The ending was very unsatisfying. The music was terrible too. The best thing about this movie is that the movie is on DVD. If you want to check out a movie about an ex-police officer who goes back to the beat in a new city and starts a small business. This would have been a great movie to see. But the plot was so terrible, it would have never made it to theaters. I would give this a 0.5 stars. I gave it a 1 because of the DVD. I'm giving it a 0 because I'm not a fan of the movie and I hope it doesn't make it to the big screen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Apr 13, 2017 3:33 AM by A Girl In The Dark     2018-04-13 20:32:30 �� View this image › 2017-04, 13, 20, 8.7.34 A Girl in the Dark, a movie about a girl (Jessica Chastain) who is attacked and raped in her college dorm by two boys, is one of those films that you just have to see. Chastaine's performance as the victim was one of the most compelling parts of the movie, as she has a really rough time with the attack and the aftermath. She was very traumatized by what happened to her, and it showed on the screen in a very real and affecting way. However, as the film progressed, it became clear that there were some serious issues at work, and I was not convinced that the film was about as real as it claimed to be. The fact that Chastains was able to go on to be an accomplished actress and a successful director is very impressive, but her performance as a victim of sexual assault was very disappointing. The film does feature a couple of scenes that really make the victim's story real, but that's about it.   2018-03-09 12:55:56     The movie is a little less than two hours long and centers on the story of a young girl who goes to live in a cabin with her family in the woods, where she meets a couple who are being attacked by an unknown animal. The pair eventually decide to fight back, and when they're in the forest, the animal attacks them. The girl, as well as her family, find themselves under attack by the animal, which eventually kills them. After this horrible event, the family moves to a new place, but this time they find themselves living in a house. The story begins when the girl goes to visit her mom in the old cabin, and the two are attacked by the same animal that attacked them in the first place. The animal also leaves some of its bloodied clothes in the cabin, which the girl wears. Soon after this, a strange man shows up in the area, and one of his daughters invites the girl to join them on a fishing trip.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________.  "The Big Lebowski" is the most enjoyable of the "Godfather" films. It's the only "GodFather" film in which Donnie Brasco doesn't appear and the only film in the series in which the title character is not named Walter Sobchak. This makes for a rather awkward situation for the movie's director, John Landis, who also co-wrote the screenplay. Landis' "Godzilla" would be a more appropriate comparison because of the similarities in plot. Both films revolve around a character who is obsessed with a powerful creature. The Big LeBowski is about the titular "Lebowski," a middle-aged man who owns a bowling alley, and Walter SobChak is about his son. Both movies are set in the 1970s and feature the same cast, including Jack Nicholson and John Travolta. The film begins with an intro of narration by "Buck" Lebowksi (Jack Nicholson), the proprietor of a bowling center in a suburb of San Francisco. "It's the best time of the year, Buck, and I'm glad you're here, because I've got some great bowling balls for you." Lebowkus tells us that his father has hired a young man to work the lanes, but he's got problems. The young man has no job, no home, and no money. This is a problem for Lebowkesi because his father wants him to work at the bowling alley for a few years to earn a little money, but Buck doesn't want to wait around. He decides to hire a driver to pick up his son at the airport, and then take him home. "So, here goes. It starts out okay." But things quickly go downhill. The bowling alley has been robbed, and the young man is in danger. A group of drug dealers are watching the bowling game from a house across the street. They're trying to steal the bowling ball, but they get shot. Lebowkoski is a bit worried because the police have been called. They do a good job, but one of the dealers gets away. When the police arrive at the scene, Lebowkis tells them he had hired the young boy as a security guard and he has no idea that he's the man who's been shooting at him. It seems to Lebowkas that the boy was hired by the dealers to kill him. "This is the

I'm not sure why the film was rated so poorly by the critics. I'd like to thank the people who wrote that bad review. I feel a little sorry for them. I can't think of any bad reviews that are written about a movie. The movie was good. It was fun, funny and the acting was excellent. If you like to see some gore then this is for you. The acting was great. I loved seeing the character of the little boy playing the guitar. It made me laugh. The soundtrack was good as well with songs that made me happy and sad. The last song that I heard was the song of the girl who was murdered. The ending was pretty neat. It didn't make me cry. I enjoyed it. I don't know why this movie was rated such a low score by the public. It is an enjoyable movie. I think it is a good movie to watch with friends. I hope that the reviewers will watch this movie again. The good and the bad are really not that different. The only difference is that the bad ones make you think and the good ones make your heart jump. I give it 4 stars.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________   The movie is really just a compilation of the best of the 80's exploitation movies. The actors look amazing and the special effects are fantastic.   There is one scene in particular where the director cuts out the dialogue and the audience doesn't hear it. I think he just wanted to get a good effect for the shot and cut it out. The shot is pretty awesome.  There are some scenes in the movie that are a little more disturbing and creepy than they need to be.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ I hate this movie. It's just horrible. I hate how they just use all these horrible shots and make it seem like a horror movie, even though it's not. The acting is horrible. The music is really terrible. It doesn't have any atmosphere to it, it's just all just shots of people screaming and moaning. I feel like this is a movie about a young girl who goes missing and ends up at a haunted house and she gets trapped in a dark room. I guess the movie is about a haunted girl. It is pretty creepy, but it doesn't hold my attention for very long. I just feel like they put a bunch of stuff into this movie and it didn't seem like there was any real point to it. I would hate to see it in theaters. It really should not be seen by anyone, even if they want to laugh. It makes me feel like a complete ass.

But the story itself is terrible. The characters are really flat and the story is not at all interesting. I really don't care who the character is as long as it gets some action going. The story does not have any character development so it's almost like it's just one big set up for the main character to get laid. It's really a shame because the book is actually pretty good. It has some pretty good story elements, but it also has a few plot holes, which were not really addressed in the movie. If you are a fan of this movie then you will probably like the book. Otherwise, if you want a good book to read on a Friday night, this isn't it. read more My Cousing Vinny is a book I had actually read a couple years ago, and I had read the screenplay, and the book has a bit of an odd feeling to it. The first time I read it, I was like, "oh, this is going to be great, it's got this great premise" and I was excited to see what would happen next. But as the book progressed, it started to get a little less interesting. This movie was a huge disappointment. It tries so hard to make the movie about Vinny, and it doesn't really work. Vinny doesn't have a lot of personality, and he's not really a likable character. He's a very average guy, but a lot less interesting than the other characters. He does have some great action scenes, but he's pretty average in his acting. There are some good
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  The problem: ___________________. ,  ,   This film is the worst movie I've ever seen, but I don't think I'll ever watch a worse movie again.   I had watched the trailer for this movie a month ago and had a great time with it. I thought it was a funny and cute movie with a lot of cute characters. But it's not. The characters are awful. The movie is filled with terrible acting and cheesy dialogue, and all of the action scenes are just stupid. This movie is just a waste of time, it is filled to the brim with stupid characters, and bad acting. The ending is just horrible and completely pointless.  ,  . : I know it sounds crazy but... it was the first time I've watched this movie and I never saw a worse film. It was horrible, I had to pause the movie several times to get a full picture of the stupid acting, the stupid plot, the silly jokes, and the stupid characters. The only reason I can say it's decent is because it was an indie film and the director wasn't paid to do it, so he had to make it as well as he could. But in my opinion this is just the worst film I've seen, and I've only seen the trailer. It has no plot, no characters, no dialogue, nothing. I can't say I've enjoyed any of the other indie films that I've been to.   : I would not recommend this film to anyone. It is bad, it has nothing to do with the rest of the movies I've heard of, and it is the most ridiculous and stupid film I have ever seen.  I don't know if you're going to be a fan of this film, because it really isn't that bad, but if you aren't then I suggest you stay away from it. The acting is terrible, and there's nothing cute or funny about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ I really liked this movie. It's about a man who is an expert on all kinds of stuff. He was really cool and I liked him because he was like the person that I was going to tell my friends about this movie (I was really impressed with the way he talked about the movie and all the stuff that happened in it. I liked his personality and all that.) He went to college and did all this stuff to get his degree and then he went to work at the hospital and made a lot of money. He went on vacation with his friends and his wife and his son and his friends to the beach but he didn't get any of it. He felt like he had no fun because his friends didn't like him and his dad didn't love him. He finally had enough and said "I'm gonna go back to the dorm and I'm going to be a bachelor!" He gets to his dorm room and he's in his underwear, just lying there, and his mom's there with him. She says "What are you doing?" and he says "I wanna go home and get some rest." He went out to his car and he was about to take off when he heard a knock on the door. He opened the door and he saw this woman standing there, he was so scared. He said "Who's there?" and she says "My name is Jessica and I've got a baby here." She said she was pregnant and that it was a girl and she had no idea who her father was. He looked at her and he said "You have no idea what you're in for." He said to her "I have no problem giving you $5,000 but if you want the baby you have to come back and let me know right now!" He says that she left the next day and he never saw her again. He never got any money from her and never saw any of the baby or her parents. He always thought that he would get some money eventually and he really wanted that baby. He thought he was gonna marry this woman and have a family. He loved her and she loved him. This movie really made me think about all the things that can happen to people when they go out to the world and have fun. I hope that there are people out there that are going to read this review and they will understand that there's nothing wrong with this movie and that there is nothing wrong in life. It really made my heart feel better

It is so hard to review a movie, because there are so many aspects that are just not relevant to the film itself, but I can't stop thinking about how awful this movie is. It is so bad, that it would be the first thing that you look for if you see it on TV. The actors are so bad that I had to go to the Internet to find the cast, which means that it's not even their actual real names. I think they are all dead. Even the title is wrong. This movie is called The Human Centipede, and it was released in 1992, not 1987. There is a song in the movie called "The Human Centipeede." That's all I can say.  …

I would have given this movie a 10, but not even close to a 9. It's not a bad film by any means, but for an audience like me, it was just a piece of crap.

I really liked the music in the movie and it is very catchy. The music was good, I even loved the song "Get The Girl" but I really wish they had cut that part out because it just wasn't needed. I do wish they would have changed the name of the girl in the film to something more "attractive" but that is just me being a jerk. The other characters weren't very developed and they didn't really make much sense. The whole film was kind of a slog to get through but at least it was over pretty quickly. The girl was also kind of annoying and didn?t seem like she had much of an interest in what was going on in the story. There was a lot of sex in this movie and I can?t really say that it was any good. I mean it was pretty hot. The way they shot it was very cheesy and I really wished they didn?d have done it in the nude instead of in a bathing suit. I don?t know what they were thinking. I have to say that the movie was definitely a disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Halloween: Resurrection" (1999) is a bad horror movie.  I mean, come on!  Halloween 4 (2003) was a terrible movie.   "Halloween 2" (2002) was an even worse movie. "HALLOWEEN: REVIVAL" (1997) is not a good horror movie, it is a terrible horror movie!      It is a remake of the 1986 film.   But don't let this get you wrong, there is still a lot of blood and violence in this movie. I've seen a lot worse, but not this bad!  I can see why this movie is so popular, it has great acting, gore, and a killer movie atmosphere.  If you are a fan of the original "HALLOWSEEN", you are going to love this movie! There are a lot people who loved this movie, and I can't blame them.  There are a ton of killer scenes and some really great acting.  The gore was pretty good, but there were a lot more blood splatter in this one.  But I think it's not as good as the original!  It is just a bad remake.  "HOMECOMING" (1998) is an even better movie.  This one was shot on video, and is a much better movie than this one!  This one is a movie you will remember for years.  It has some awesome acting, the gore is pretty good (no pun intended), and it's a great movie to watch at Halloween.  I saw this movie as a child, and loved it.  My parents hated it, and they both agreed this movie was too violent.  This is one of the most violent horror movies of all time!   But it is still fun to watch!  "MYSTERY OF MELISSA CRONE" (1994) is also a great horror movie (or at least, that is what I thought when I watched it).  "Mystery of Melisa" has a great story, lots of cool scenes, and it is just really good!  There is a killer in this film.  I can never forget this film, and the movie makes me happy!  If your a fan, you will love this film!   I know I did!  My brother loved this one too!  So if you are looking for a

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ "My friends and I watched this movie at the local theatre on Christmas Eve. We got there about 10 minutes early. It was a nice chill evening, the theatre was packed. There were only two theaters in town. It started with a good, if a little slow opening. I can't remember the title of the movie, but I don't remember anything else. It felt like it was trying to catch up on old films. After a few minutes, it just got boring. I was wondering how the movie would finish. I think the actors were all having trouble. I don;t think the film was directed well, so I don''t think I will watch it again. I would rather watch the movie for free. The guy who played the guy with the gun, was great. He had an easy voice, and a good body. I liked his character. He was a guy that I could imagine being my father. It just wasn''t the same." -R.P.  "It is a shame that the story ends on a bad note. The ending was a bit forced. The characters did not seem to be really interested in what they were doing, and seemed to be in a rush to get out of the theater. They did not even seem to notice the fact that a policeman was trying in vain to stop the escape of one of them. I wonder if there was something wrong with the policeman's timing." -J.F. . "This movie is a mess. There is not one single thing that is good about it. It is an obvious rip off of "The Big Lebowski". There is nothing in this movie that is original or even good. It feels like a cheap knock off movie that was made for a small town in the middle of nowhere. The only thing good about this movie is that it has a title. This movie is so bad that I would never watch it." -D.W.  on a side note: It was not just a movie that got away. I got a copy of this movie, a $15 VHS, which was the only copy of it that was ever made. The owner of this store, that was in the same strip mall as this movie was in was one of the owners of that movie. They said they were selling all of the copies that were made, because they had to sell it. There was even a line at the store when they had it for sale

I really like this movie, it was so much more than a simple documentary, it had a good plot and some good acting (especially by Andrei Tarkovski and Svetlana Mirkina). And it's a good film too, very funny. But I have to say, there are some very strange and hard to understand things in this movie. For example, we see a bunch of dead bodies in the basement, but nobody seems to be dead. It is strange. I think it was just for the sake of the movie, and it's interesting, but it's just a little bit strange. Another strange thing, is that the first part of the film shows the characters in a very strange way, it's so different from the real film. This is just my opinion though. Overall, this is a great movie, I recommend it to everyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It was good."  A bad movie is "a film made by a fool."    An interesting film is a "picture made by an artist."    A good film is "something made by somebody who knows what he's doing."    If you like movies at all, don't try to make them.   The best way to make a movie is to get it into the hands of someone who knows how to do it.  This means the director is the one who must make the movie and not someone who has only watched the movie.  When a director doesn't know how to make something, he or she makes it "the way they want."  This is the worst possible thing for a movie to be.  But there is one exception.  The director has to do everything the producer wants.  If the producer doesn't want to make the picture he wants, then the director has failed to make it.   It is this failure to understand what he is doing that allows a director to make movies that are mediocre.  It is also this failure that allows the director to think that he is making a masterpiece when he is really just making a movie that nobody wants to see.  These are the movies that the producers are looking for when they make a film.  In the end, the only movie that anybody wants to watch is the movie that the director makes.  Because the director doesn' t understand that he can't make a masterpiece, he does not know what he has done wrong.  He has failed.  His movie is mediocre.   He should just stop making movies.  Or he should just learn how to act.  Which is something he is certainly going to need in order to get any money for his next film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ is an awful movie. I hate it, I hate the actors, I don't care for the story, I think that's why it's such a failure: because the whole story and the way it was told just doesn't work. It's just like a story that was written by an idiot. It doesn't even have a plot. It just goes on forever with a couple of really annoying characters. It should have been called _______________, or something. I'm going to try to find out why it has so many reviewers raving about it, but I'm just going to assume that the reviewers were not really there.  Rating: 3.5 stars  Advertisements
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ Do not watch this movie if you want a good movie! I think it's the worst movie in the history of the world, that's how bad it is! It's so bad that you won't believe it's good. And if you watch it, you'll feel bad because it's so horrible. It was filmed in the worst possible way. The director, who is also a director of the film, tries to be funny but it's really not funny at all. The actors don't know what to do with themselves. They don't act at all and it's not funny. And the cinematography is terrible. And you will not believe how awful the movie is! The soundtrack was made by a group of people who are not even musicians and that is so bad. And don't think that this movie will be better in the future because that is not the way things are done these days. They made this movie in 2001 and it was filmed on a cheap camcorder. But that's ok because it doesn't matter because they are making another movie that's way worse! This is the worst film I've ever seen! It has all the wrong things and all the people in it are horrible! You can't believe that these people are acting! They are so bad! It really is a horrible movie and you will hate it! This movie is so terrible that you will think it was made for kids!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is an example of how not to make a film. I was hoping this film would be a good parody of the 1990s. The premise was simple, the characters were good looking and the plot was ridiculous. It had a few interesting parts but most of it was a joke and did not really work. If you want to see a good movie with a strong plot that works then this is the one to watch. If not, this is not a good film and if you are looking for a fun time, then this movie will not be worth your time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________. I'm not sure that I will ever watch a movie with a female lead again. In fact, I will probably never even see a movie that features a female character again. The film starts off pretty good and I was enjoying the beginning of the film, especially when the character that is the protagonist of the story (played by Anna Kendrick) is trying to make her way through the world of prostitution. She was doing well and seemed to be on her way to a good life. Then the character she was living with was murdered. She then goes into a kind of mental state and is a very depressed person. She goes to the hospital for help, and that's where she meets the mysterious man who gives her the power to become a superhero. They then go on a mission to save other women and find out what is going on in this city. The movie was great but there was something that I didn't like about it. It seemed like the characters were just trying to be in a movie and were just acting. The villain had a voice that sounded like a man, but it didn't sound like him and I could tell he was a male. This was a major problem. I didn,t like the way that this movie was written because there was nothing really happening. The main character didn't seem to really care about anything. She seemed to just be in the role of a character. And it seemed like she was being forced into this role. This is probably the most boring movie I've ever seen. The director should not have let this movie be made. The story was great, but the characters that were written and voiced were very dull. There were also things that I wasn't able to understand because they didn't explain anything. The acting was great in this movie, but there were some moments that were not very believable. I don't think this movie is worth seeing. It was very boring and I didn t like it.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________The first time I saw this film, I had never seen a horror movie. I thought I was going to be in the mood for a good horror movie, but this film was so much more than that. It was really creepy. The way the camera was set up made it feel like you were actually watching a real haunted house. And even though the film was very violent, it was still so very well done. This film was also one of the first films that used the sound effect of a chainsaw. You know, it's one of those things that make you realize how much better horror is when you can hear it.This is probably my favorite film I have ever seen. It has everything you would expect in a horror film. It's got some awesome gore, and it's scary as hell. I don't think I will ever go to a haunted house or anything like that again, but if I do, this is the film I'll be watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I hate this movie. I am not sure why I didn't just skip the trailer. It is a very uninspired movie. It's just a story about a man who is obsessed with being a "bad boy". I didn`t understand the point of the movie. The director made a movie that was not good, and now he is making a movie about the man who made the movie, and the movie is called "Bad Boy". So I don`t know why they are calling it a movie. So if you are looking for a good movie with good acting, great cinematography, and great music, go to "Bad Boys". But if you want a good horror movie with bad acting, terrible cinematography and bad music, just watch the trailer!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________________________ The reason the movie is not good is that it is all over the place. It takes a good hour and a half to get from the first scene of the movie to the last scene. There is no real direction and no sense of direction. If you were to watch the movie from beginning to end, it would take you a week. The movie has a plot that is confusing. The characters are all talking about the same things. The dialogue is repetitive and repetitive is not very good for a movie. The acting is awful. The cinematography is not that great either. The music is not amazing. The editing is not great either but the movie will be worth watching only if you can get past all the bad. I was not expecting much out of this movie but it was so bad I would still recommend it if you are looking for a quick movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________  A good movie: (2/5) - I've never been a big fan of horror, but I enjoyed this movie. The plot was interesting and I was hooked by the end. However, it had some plot holes and some very poorly done acting.  Helpful I'd never seen before. I had no idea it would be so good. I just assumed it was the usual formula for a horror movie. It's a great little movie, but not a must see. I'd recommend it to people who love horror and love to watch a good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************* This movie has a very generic feel to it. I don't think that it is very well written. It has a lot of scenes where the characters just talk. It would be better if they actually did something with that talk. The characters are pretty stereotypical too. I can't stand that they are constantly trying to be the perfect wife and mother. I mean, they are even in the same house. They even do the same things at the same time. I would have liked to see them actually get married and having children and raise them. It may not be that bad though, since it is just an action film. I am going to give this movie a C-.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________ The worst thing about this movie is that it doesn't really have a bad character. The main character is so completely useless that she's like a robot with no real emotions or feelings. If there is a character that is supposed to be a tragic one, it's this one. She's a complete asshole who doesn't care if she kills her enemies or not. She doesn't even seem to care about her brother's life and wants to kill him as well. She goes on a killing spree and kills hundreds of people and it's not even for her brother, it just so happens that she got him and is now the strongest being in the universe. She is the most evil, twisted, and psychotic person I have ever seen in a movie. She just goes on killing sprees and there's not a single good thing she does. I don't think I've ever seen a movie where a main character who doesn.t seem to have any real feelings was so much more horrifying than any other character in the movie. Even the most monstrous villains are more disgusting than her. It's really shocking and sickening. The last scene is just an evil version of that scene from that horror movie where you see the monster's face and you're scared of it, but you can't look away because it's still so scary. There are also a few moments of violence in this movie. There's a few instances where someone is stabbed in the head. There was one scene where someone got shot in the chest and another when someone was stabbed in his chest. And there's a scene where a character is shot in her foot and it hurts like hell. It is really sad to see these people suffer in this horrible movie. The ending is also pretty sad. There is a scene at the end where one of the villains is going to shoot someone and there are some people that are trying to save them. They're trying to shoot them, but the bullets miss and they're just left there. It seems like a pretty stupid way to end the movie, but I don' t think that it is. It just seems like it's supposed to show how horrible and evil the movie is. Overall, I think that this movie would be more entertaining if they just changed the ending and changed the characters. It would have been better to leave the characters as they are, but still have the ending be as bad as it is in my opinion. I recommend that you don't see this movie at all

He meets the woman he likes and they start a relationship. He remembers her, but she doesn't. He starts to have feelings for her. They go on a trip to an amusement park. The woman is murdered. They are both very upset. They see a movie and go to another amusement park, but it is not the same. They don't remember anything about the park. It's as if the person who murdered them never existed. He also can't remember the woman. She is in his mind, but they are not the woman from his life. They find a girl that looks just like the woman, but in a completely different body. It is her, and she's not dead. They decide to return to the amusement park and go on the ride that they saw in the movie. The ride doesn't go as they remember. They meet a man with the same memories as the person they saw, but without his personality. The man is very angry. He tells them to forget about him. He then attacks them. The two of them are forced to leave. The person that they were in love with is gone. The movie ends with them being taken to a hospital. It seems that the man who killed the woman is now in prison. He has been convicted and is going to be sentenced. The doctor says that he will be released after a while, but if the prisoner is a good prisoner, he will never be released.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________  "In a lot of ways, the most frightening moment of the film comes at the very end, when a young girl, in the throes of the panic, tries to kill herself with a broken bottle. It's a brilliant twist of plot that takes us back to the beginning, as a woman named Lisa (Jill St. John) washes up on a remote beach in a small boat. As Lisa wanders aimlessly around the island, she hears the sounds of her mother (Sally Hawkins) and father (Robert Downey Jr.) discussing the murder of her brother. As the girl continues her lonely wanderings, she becomes increasingly unsettled, eventually coming face to face with her mother's killer. As she looks down at her bloody hands, she realizes the killer is a man named Tom (Christopher Walken) who looks exactly like her father. The two have never met, and they seem to have an unnatural kinship."   I saw this movie at a local theater, and it was one of those scary movies that will stick in your mind forever. It was so terrifying that I went to see it again after I'd been to California, and even though it was almost two decades old at that point, I still had nightmares about it. I've never seen the movie in its entirety, but I remember seeing it once or twice in the theater, because of the amazing soundtrack.   There is a lot more to the movie than I've described, but it's worth watching to see what's in it. It also has a great ending, and a nice message that makes you think about how you can be a better person than you are now. I highly recommend this movie, if only because it's a good horror movie.

The game has a lot of the same elements as Metal Gear, like a very dark and somber atmosphere, a lot more open areas, and a ton of side missions. The only thing that differs between the first and second games is the gameplay, and how much more elaborate the missions are. The missions in the second game are also a lot harder than the missions in Metal Gear. Also, as I mentioned earlier, you play in third person, but the camera angle and view of the world is very different. The world of Metal Gear is almost entirely open, and you can move around almost anywhere, but in the sequel, the world of Shadow Moses is mostly closed off to you. Also the map

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ (1/10)_______________________________________________This is a bad film. It is an excuse to bring in some of the actors and actresses who have never done anything good. It was poorly done and not funny at all. The story is the worst part of this movie. The movie is about a girl who lives with her mother who wants to be a nurse and a boy who wants his mom to be his girlfriend. There are a lot of sex scenes and the characters are not funny. The actors are bad and the acting is bad. The script was bad and there are a few plot holes that need to be explained. The only redeeming thing about this movie is the music by the band "Kurt Cobain". The music is so bad it is good. I love this band. It will make you want to see more bad movies. If you have a strong stomach this is not for you. I give this movie a 1/10.

The only reason I even watched it was because it was free. And, it was. A free movie! If I wanted something I could just rent I would have done that, too. The worst part of this movie was the ending. It wasn't a good ending. This was one of those movies that you can't even enjoy if you've never seen it. But if you have seen it, you'll hate it, no matter what. It has the worst acting of all the bad movies I've seen. It had nothing to do with the action. It just had an awful story. And the ending was just plain stupid. I know I'm going to get a lot of hate for this, but just keep in mind, I only watched it because it wasn't free. I don't think I've ever seen a worse movie. You should just skip this movie, and don't waste your time watching it. It should have never been released.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  It is not possible to give a good review about this movie. The only reason why this movie is a decent one is because of the actors. They all have their own unique roles in this movie but they are all the same. I hate these kind of movies where the roles are the same because it makes me think that it's not a good movie. I think this movie should be rated 5 stars but it is not because of these kinds of movies. The actors all did a good job and the movie is worth watching if you like action movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.   That's not to say there aren't some good movies on the list. There are. There is also a movie from 1995, "Moulin Rouge," which is on the same list as a few other recent movies, as well as a couple of movies from the early 90s. Some of them are classics. For instance, "The Godfather" is on there as is "The English Patient" and "A Few Good Men." There are other movies that are great but are not on this list. But the list is very interesting. I will try to add more as time goes on.  ....  I saw this movie in my early twenties. I was in my third year at the University of California at Santa Cruz when I saw it. I've seen a lot of movies since then. But it still has a special place in my heart. The music, the acting, the story, the directing, and the cinematography are all just amazing. It is an incredibly well made film. The film is based on the real life story of Vincent Chin, who is a Chinese American who was a stockbroker in New York in the 1930s. The story revolves around his friendship with a wealthy Chinese American named Vincent Wong, who later married a French woman and had three kids. The movie was written by Vincent Chin and directed by John Frankenheimer. The screenplay was written during the time when the Japanese occupied Shanghai. The plot centers around Vincent's relationship with Vincent Wong and his children. The original film was not very successful but was revived in 1997, and a remake was released in 2001.   the first time I saw this film was a few years ago, and I was very happy with the film. I have not seen the re-make. The reason why I have watched this film a few times since I was a teenager is because I loved the original. I think that it is an underrated film and I hope that someone makes a remake.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.  That's how the whole of this review will be structured. I'm going to start with some facts. _____________. This is a film based on a series of books about a young girl named Jenny that gets abducted by aliens and taken to a dark world full of creatures. Jenny is given a choice to either become a monster or be a good girl and join the aliens as a servant, in exchange for the aliens' technology. The humans of this world were not ready for the new world, but Jenny becomes a hero and a leader for the humans. I've read the books, and I've seen the movie, and in terms of the movie I don't think it's very good, but in terms I've just seen the film I think it does a decent job of depicting the events of the books. I think this is a movie based on the books because I can see the difference in the plot. I could tell there was a plot difference because of the way it was done in the book. This movie has a good plot. The script was written by Gary J. Wolfe, who also wrote the movie "Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home." In the book Jenny gets taken to this dark world and is forced to fight to survive. In the movie she joins the aliens and they help her. The movie is much better than the book, and that's the only reason I didn't give it a 1 or a 5. _____. The special effects are OK, and they're pretty good, because the aliens are CGI and the humans are just CGI. The CGI was ok, and the CGI did the job, because in the movie the aliens were in much better detail than in the books and the human CGI was much better. ____. The film has some problems in that the ending is very confusing. ______________________________.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. If it was a good movie, it would have been a masterpiece.  1. It's Not Over (1980)  2. The Exorcist (1973) .  a. An American Werewolf in London (1931)  airdate: October 9, 1978 (Theatrical) "It's Not over" is a very funny movie, that is actually a very disturbing movie. I don't know how to describe this movie, but I'll try: it's a thriller about a woman who is kidnapped, tortured and ultimately executed by a demon. The movie is made of a series of flashbacks, in which the main character, a young American woman named Anna, is tortured and tortured by her captor. The film takes a rather dark turn, but at the same time, it is very funny and entertaining, and if you want to watch a film that is about a very sad and horrible tragedy, I highly recommend you watch this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  1.2/5  Novel: The Book of the New Sun (The Star Wars Book of New Suns, Book 1)  By: Orson Scott Card   Rating: 3.5/5   I have to admit that when I first saw this book it made me think that there might be some truth in the old saying that "the only thing worse than a liar is a fool".  In that sense, it might have been worse than the movie that I had seen earlier.   The plot is simple enough. A group of people, most of them children, are on a trip to the desert planet Arrakis, to see the sunset. While on their way, they are attacked by a group of ruthless warriors known as the Sith.  The kids are left to die in the sand.  to die.  the sand  (As if sand could hurt me. As if the sand would hurt me when it's the sand I'm standing on!)   And there is a twist to the story. There is a group, a few kids, that are able to escape from the sand and find their way back to the settlement on Arrak.    This is the part of the story that was most disturbing to me. The kids have been able to survive on Arraki for about two weeks. But they still haven't found their way home. . But there is still no sign of their parents. And the adults around them are not much better.  as the kids try to get help from the adults, some of them get killed. The Sith and their leader (named "Kolob" in the book) are able (by some unknown means) to track the children's home to the village of Arrakai. , The children try to escape into the town, but are shot at by a Sith patrol and a group trying to capture them.   At the end of the book, we learn that the kids are able, by some mysterious method, to get back home. But it is unknown where the children are. And when the adults find out that the children have returned, they get angry. And they are not about to let the children go without a fight.    . So the kids must flee to the nearest settlement to try and hide from the Sith and Kolob. They do not know which settlement, exactly, and it's not clear who

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had no idea what I was in for when I picked this one up, but it was pretty bad. The plot was basically a rehash of another film. It's just the same old guy trying to get rid of his debt, but instead of going to a lawyer or going to the police, he just gets himself a bunch of thugs. I don't know why I thought this was going to be any different, but I don the film to be the exact same one as "A Hard Day's Night". The only thing different about it was that the bad guy was black instead of white. Not only that, but the lead singer had to say a few lines to himself and then say them out loud.  I found it really hard to watch this movie, because I knew what it was going too. And I don?t think this film is worth a single dime.

They shouldn't be allowed to wear that stuff.  ________________________________________  This film was a lot like "Hollywoodland" - except without the "flamingos" and "stuntmen" that make that movie a hit. In this film the lead characters are "mascots", dressed in bright colors and wearing wacky costumes that seem to come from the 1950's. The movie is a bit slow and the music is very soft. , with the same "wacky" costumes and with the "stunts" that we all remember. The one "stupid" thing that happened in this film was that a "striptease" was performed on one of the "machines" by a group of "movies". Not a good idea to put a machine in a movie!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ It's a really cool story about the beginning of a relationship with a guy. The movie starts with a couple who met when they were teenagers, got together, and got married. It's really great how they got married and started a family. It shows that love and commitment are great, and they don't need to rush into anything, they don�t need to get a million dollars. They just start to have sex and the story starts there. Then there is a really interesting part where the couple goes to a club, where the wife is really into the music and she really has a crush on this guy. They are all really happy, and the movie shows how their life changes after that. There are some good jokes in this movie too. The plot is really cool. The characters are really good. The acting is great. The song that plays during the movie is really good, and it has a very unique, dark feel. The ending is really amazing. I really enjoyed the movie, and I recommend it for everyone.

If you like the movie: I would like to thank the writer/director and all of the actors for making this film so awesome.  a good movie: an awesome movie.    I'll just say that this movie was awesome. If you like adventure, comedy, or any kind of action, you need to watch this movie.   It was really cool seeing how this movie took a lot of different ideas and turned them into a fun movie that was actually entertaining.  the cast did a great job in making this movie as good as it could be.   the story was good and the jokes were funny and I loved that the movie kept having new ideas to keep the movie fresh.   The best part of this movie is when the characters were fighting with each other and it just kept getting better and better. The fight scenes were really cool and it gave the movie an adrenaline rush. I also really liked the music of the movie. It really matched the mood of the scene.   "I don't want to be a hero. I want to get revenge!" is an amazing quote from the movie and it was really well done.  ,   Overall this movie had a great plot, good action, and the best acting. It's one of the best movies that I have seen in a while and I love how this film kept having ideas to make the movie better.  and if you like action movies, this movie will give you that. .
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not the best critic in the world.   What I did do was write this review, so you know what I'm going to say.  So, here goes. I watched this film when I was in college.  I was actually in the audience.  When I got back to school, I actually watched it.  It was at a film festival, and I was so excited to watch it. The film was directed by a woman named Rachel Bach, and it is based on a novel by a man named Paul Auster.  The novel was an autobiography, but it was a very popular one at the time.  There is so much about the book that is not well-known that it actually makes the movie really interesting to watch.  I actually loved this book.  After I finished it, I just couldn't get over how much I loved it.   I felt like I was back in college with all of the friends who were watching it.  They were all reading the same book that I was.  And they were all laughing at my jokes, which made me feel so silly and funny.  They were laughing at all of my jokes because they were so funny.  When you are in a film and it's a bad film, and you're laughing and you are having a good time, it makes you feel better.  You just want to laugh and laugh and keep on laughing.  Well, I loved the book.   So, I was hoping to see this movie and I did, but when I saw it, the movie was terrible.  If you don't have a good memory or if you can't remember the book, it's not that bad of a movie.  But when I got the DVD, I saw that it was actually much better than the book in the book's favor.  For the first half, it was really good.  Then it got worse, and worse, until I got to the end.  That's when it started to get really bad.  Once you get to the very end, it starts to get worse.  Not in a good way, but in a bad way.  Even with all the good things that I remember about the movie, it still was a bad idea to make a movie based on this book and make it so bad.   There is a reason why they didn't make this movie for the Academy Awards.  Why would

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I hate to admit it, but this movie is just a horrible waste of time. If you're looking for a movie that shows what "true crime" looks like, you've come to the wrong place. If true crime is a thing you like, this is a bad attempt at it. The acting is laughable, the production values are laughable, and the plot is laughable. Even though it's supposed to be a true crime movie, it's nothing but a comedy. It's like watching a group of people in a public bathroom make fart jokes while a police officer stands right behind them making fart jokes. The only thing I found funny was how the movie makers tried to make it seem like the victim was a serial killer and the cop was a cop from the 1970s. They were supposed to look like that, and it made the movie look like it was a throwback to the 70s. The movie even had a plot about a guy named Larry who was supposedly a serial murderer. I really have no idea why it was necessary to have this movie on TV at all. I mean, it took five minutes for the movie to be over. What the hell was the point of that? The only other redeeming factor in this movie was that there were a couple of sex scenes. I don't know if that's good or bad, but I was kind of enjoying it. If I had been in the theater when the movie was on, I would have just sat there with my popcorn and watched the movie. This is one of those movies that's just going to make you want to curl up in a fetal position and cry.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********  This movie is a total joke. The director wants you to feel sorry for the protagonist (he is a big, fat, racist, white trash) and wants you see him as a hero. The actors don't have a clue who the guy is or what his problem is. The acting is awful, with the only actor being able to hold a scene was Paul Walker. The music is not the best, it has a terrible beat and the song is so out of place. The writing is bad and the whole movie is just a joke. This movie would be better with a good comedy or a serious drama. It's not worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________________  "I've seen so many movies and not one of them was good. They're all terrible. "  -Kurt Russell, on "The Big Chill"  This film is so terrible it's almost a miracle. It's a film about a family with a bad car and a bad attitude. In a way it's a very predictable film. What happens is you get an idiot trying to make the family happy. What is a family without a happy home? What is the family without good food and a good home? Well, this is the home. So, you have an idiot family trying to do something they can't do. I suppose the idea was that it would make a good movie. But the problem is that it doesn't make a decent film. It makes a mediocre film. A film that makes you laugh because you laugh at the idiocy of a family that doesn't know how to be happy. I don't know if it's the director's fault or not. But I don.t think the director knows how to make a movie. I think it's his idea of what a film should be. He thinks that movies should be like TV shows. But movies aren't like TV. Movies are movies. If you can't make one you should quit making them.  1 of 1 people found this review helpful

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ Why would anyone like this movie? ______________________________________________________________ The main problem with this movie is that it is so poorly made that it really has nothing going for it. I would say that the main problem is that the story is nothing but a bunch of bad jokes, bad acting, and bad plot. The acting is pretty bad and the story just doesn't make any sense at all. The movie starts off by telling us that we are in a world that is not very good, and then it shows us that the world is full of evil people that are trying to take over the world, and the only way to stop them is to get an amazing weapon. We are also shown that this weapon is called a gun, but it's not really a gun at all; it's just a weapon that is made to kill people. It's like a machine gun with a body. This movie then takes the idea of a gun and turns it into a big pile of shit. It takes the concept of a machinegun and makes it into something that looks like a gun. The story then starts out with the main character, who is named Bill, going to a place where people fight in a battle of life and death. It is called the arena, and you can't leave until you are dead. It seems that the people in the arena all have a weapon, and they are all armed with weapons that have special abilities. The main character gets into the arena with the intention of killing everyone there. He is able to kill all of them by using the special ability of a weapon called the hammer. Bill then goes on a rampage through the arena killing everyone he comes across. He kills all of the people that he comes upon, but then he decides that he needs to do something else with all of that killing. He decides to kill the people with the special weapons that they use to kill each other, but he doesn't do it. He takes it upon himself to kill everyone with those weapons. He then kills a man by using a weapon made of a car, and another by using something called a fire extinguisher. Then he goes on to kill a girl by using an old radio. Then a girl gets in the way and Bill kills her. Bill kills a few more people by using those weapons, and he also kills a kid by using this thing called a hammer. He continues killing people until a guy with a gun shows up and stops him. Bill doesn't take the guy seriously and

The Ghostbusters were all real, except for the Ghostbuster himself. He was a robot, but he had a great voice, and it was cool that you could see through his eyes. This was a cool show, but it wasn't as cool as I remember it being. The "Ghostbusters" movie is much cooler. The movies are about the Ghostbusters, and they are the only ones with the power to stop evil. They are all different, and have a different personality, and the movie has a lot more action and scares than the TV show. The story is good, the actors are good, and some of the action is awesome.   I love the movies, and I love the show. It is still a lot of fun to watch, even with the different personalities and actors. I hope they make another movie soon.   the good:  The cast is great  the action is fun  it has a great story and is better than the tv show  I have seen this movie so many times, and still have the same reaction  i think the cast is awesome  and the way they are all together in a small group is very cool   the bad:  to me, the most disappointing part of the movie is the ending. The end of the first movie had a very good and different ending. It was like a "happy ending", where the ghosts would go back to where they came from. In this movie they go back, and all they do is destroy everything they just destroyed, and everyone dies. It felt so cheap, and not very good at all. Also, there was no real plot, just a bunch of ghostbuster trying to kill each other. There is no real meaning to the ending of this movie.  ...
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________ This movie is an absolute disgrace to our film industry. It is nothing but a cheap knock off of a popular horror movie from the 80's. The story line is a complete and total cheap copy of a movie called "The Monster". The only thing that is different is the monster has wings and a tail and the monster kills the people with an axe in the movie. It was a terrible movie that was released in a bad time for our film community and made millions of dollars for the studio. It should have been shelved and never been released. The movie is a total rip off of the original "The Nightmare". I don't even think the director read the book. This movie was made for a quick cash grab and it did not live up to expectations. The producers of this movie were very arrogant and I don 't believe that they have the talent to make a good movie. The monster was a cheap imitation of the classic movie monster. This is an example of how cheaply the industry is doing horror films. The picture is terrible and the sound was terrible. The only good thing about the movie is the actors who were in this movie. They are good actors and their characters are good. If you are looking for a good horror movie then this is a good one. If not then don't waste your money and don't watch it. - October 25, 2010I can't stand it.  Reviewer: kabrown - favorite favorite favorite - September 22, 2010  Subject: What a ripoff! I hate to say this, but I had to write a review about this movie as I saw it on cable one day and thought "I'll check out the movie" but I couldn't find it on the web and couldn't afford it. Well, I finally found it and found that it is basically a cheap, poorly done imitation of another popular movie from 1987. I know that it was released by a different studio than the one that made the original movie but the quality of the acting and the directing is not nearly as good. The acting is horrible and the script is not that good. I can't say that I enjoyed this movie because I wasn't able to see it for what it was. - September 2, 2010What a rip off!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ It was an alright movie, but the acting was atrocious. The main character (Giovanni) was not funny, he was just an annoying douchebag. The two female characters were also a chore to watch. The acting was just bad. I was looking forward to watching it because it looked so interesting, but it was so horrible. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. I'll try watching it again and see if I can get a good laugh out of it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________   On the one hand, you have to admit that the film is just plain terrible. It's not like I didn't enjoy it when it first came out, and it's definitely worth a watch for those who don't like a lot of stuff. And if you don't enjoy a lot, that's perfectly fine too. But if you're looking for a fun movie to sit down and watch with your friends, this is not the movie for you. The movie is so bad that you have no idea what to think of it and the ending is so dumb that you can't believe that it happened. And even worse, it's really, really stupid and there's no way that it could ever have made any sense at all. This movie is basically a parody of itself. There's nothing funny about it at all and it doesn't even try. The whole thing is basically just an insult to its own characters.   The movie starts out very slow. It takes you through a fairly standard revenge plot, with a bunch of bad guys who get revenge on the person who put them in prison. And you can tell that it's going to be very, very slow in the beginning. But it's not. The first few minutes are pretty much just the same plot as the first act of any other revenge movie: a bunch bad guys get revenge, and there are a bunch more bad guys after that, and so on. But by the end, it just turns into a bunch old dudes getting revenge, for no reason. The story of revenge has always been a stupid one, but in this movie, the whole thing just becomes completely ridiculous. And I'm not talking about the ending, but the whole beginning. I mean, it takes forever to get going and it just starts to become a complete train wreck.   the ending of this movie was one of the worst in the history of movies. I'm talking about any ending, not just the end of this film. I don't even want to think about what the movie could have done in a better way. If there was ever an ending to a movie that was just terrible, this was it. I honestly cannot think of any way that the movie even could have ended at all, let alone in the way it ended.  - I'm sure there will be a sequel, but I'm going to say that this was one terrible movie and I won't be watching it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ How about a good movie? ___________ That's what this movie is about. This movie has everything: bad acting, poor story, bad acting-and worse plot. I will not go into the plot but let's just say the whole movie is a waste of time. In the beginning of the movie you will see a girl being abducted. Then the movie turns into a horror movie with her going back and forth in time. This is where it starts to get really bad, as you will find out that this movie has been made by a guy who made a movie called "Time-Slip" about a girl who goes back in time to save her grandmother. In "Time Slip" this movie was better. This "Time Slips" movie is just the same as "Time slip". The only difference is that this time the girl doesn't save her grandfather but a guy and his dog, who then go back in a time machine. The movie then goes back to a kid's room where she sees her grandfather with her. She then goes on to save the other kids in the past and the movie ends. Then they come to the present, where they find out the kids are all dead. The girl then goes home and meets her grandma who says that she must go back to the past. This girl has to go back through time to her grandfather, and when she goes through time she will have to meet him again. In order to go through time you have to travel back to your past and go to the other side of the time stream. This makes no sense at all, as how is she going to go to her future grandfather when she hasn't even met him? The movie goes on for a while with the girl being kidnapped, her grandfather going back in the time machine, the time machines, and the girl going back through the past to her grandmother, but when the movie finally ends you find out this movie never happened. So the movie really sucked. Then at the end they find a girl in the future who is going back to her own time stream, and that girl goes back into the past again. This time the grandmother tells the girl that her grandfather is dead. But the movie never happens. This kind of movie would have made a great movie but this movie sucked because of all the bad acting and the plot. This was just a waste. I think the only good thing about this movie were the songs by Robert Cray. I'm not sure if

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ (Don't hate me because I'm a reviewer. I'm just saying) The movie itself was good enough. The story itself was cool and the characters were great. The only thing that really bugged me was the acting. They didn't have much chemistry together. They weren't good actors either. I don't like to watch actors act in bad movies. I think the acting is much better in some of the other movies. The other thing is, I don;t know what the movie was trying to say. I guess it's about the relationship between a cop and a gang member. I would've liked to know what their relationship was like before they got together. I'd like to see the cop and the gang member interact more in the next movie. I wouldn't mind watching a movie with the cops and the gangs. I like to be surprised. I hope that the next one has more interaction between the cops. I thought it was a good movie. It's pretty funny.

The world is going through a very difficult time. I don't think it's all bad, but it sure is very, very dark. But don't worry. There's plenty of horror movies that make you laugh, even when it's dark. It's hard to pick the best ones, but here are my top five horror movies. I mean, if you don't want to watch a horror movie because of the dark and scary, there are plenty of other things to watch instead. See, you can have your cake and eat it too. No, I'm not suggesting you watch something like "Saw" or "The Conjuring." These movies are just a lot more disturbing and dark. Watch something more lighthearted like "The Ring" or even a movie like "Fright Night." No, you don,t have to watch "Scream." That movie is pretty dark and has lots of gore and violence. Watch "The Silence of the Lambs." It's a very good movie and it's a little bit scary, too. But you can also watch "The Omen" and "Poltergeist" for fun. If you want a dark, dark comedy, watch "Dumb and Dumber" or just watch "It's Alive." They're both great movies. There are tons of other good movies to watch, but if you're not going to watch

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why did you watch this? ___________ If you liked it, why not? If you didn't, why now? _____ This is the only bad movie I've seen, so I'm not going to go into details about it. _____  There are so many ways to love this movie. The acting is great, the songs are catchy and the film is a lot of fun. What really makes this movie is the humor. If you've never seen a movie with a guy with a giant penis, then you haven't seen a penis movie. It's a little shocking at first, but then you realize that a guy's penis is the most adorable thing in the world. So many things about this movie are just funny, and it's easy to watch. It may not be for everyone, but if you like watching a bunch of friends in a movie where they try to find the best way to take a giant dick, then this movie has you covered.

I didn't even know what a demon was until I saw it on television. I thought I was going to die. But I guess I was just in a really bad state of mind at the time. I'm a Catholic, and the idea of "demonic possession" made me uncomfortable. And yet, when I saw this movie, I felt strangely comforted. I felt like I knew this girl who was possessed. It was very disturbing to see, and yet, I was able to look at her with a sort of understanding and respect.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* I went to see the original film in a theater with about 300 people. It was a little slow but I still enjoyed it. The remake is terrible and I hope they get rid of all the horrible changes that have been made. I hate how they changed everything about the film and I don't care if you think that it is a good film, the remake is a horrible film. If you like the original then you should go and see it.  Helpful I'm sure most of you have seen it. It is one of those movies that are kind of hit and miss. It has a good story line but it has some serious flaws. The film starts off slow with some cool action but it gets really boring. It turns into a cheesy action movie that is a little too obvious. And there is so much swearing that it gets old really quick. It also has some very poor acting. The main guy, Bill Pullman, is not a good actor. It seems like he is trying his best but he doesn't have the right amount of charisma. Then there are a bunch of other actors that do not have enough charisma. I liked a lot of the other actors but I do not like the actors in the remake. They are all terrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ I have seen so many bad movies in my life. I was always looking for a good movie to watch. So I went into this movie with low expectations. After I saw it, I was really disappointed. The story is horrible and the acting is awful. The best thing is the ending. I loved the ending so much. It's so sad, but it makes you feel really happy and sad at the same time. So sad. It made me cry a few times. The music in the movie was soo good. I wish I could listen to the movie for hours. It was sooo sad and soo sad. I just wanted to go home and tell my mom about it. I would give anything to hear her tell me the story of how she lost her best friend. It will always be a sad movie for me, but I'll never forget it. It is such a shame to see a movie that is so good, but such a terrible story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  I'm sure most of you know this one, but for those who don't, it's a movie about a group of friends who get trapped in a haunted house when their parents are away for the weekend. Well, that's a great premise, but what happens next is just not cool. I mean, if you think you can do something creepy in your own basement, think again. I mean, we have seen some freaky things in movies, but this was just ridiculous. I could never believe that my parents would let my friends come over and go into a haunted mansion. I guess it's because I was too young to understand what was happening and just thought that my friends were getting really, really freaked out. I know there's a scene where they're playing a game of "hide the bodies" and one of them is pretending to be a corpse, but that was just not something I would have done. ...  So what happened? Well, my parents had taken me to a Halloween party at their place and I guess they thought it would be a good idea to dress me up as a zombie. But then they thought, "well, maybe we should have a real zombie instead of a zombie." So they brought me into the basement and put me in a zombie costume and told me to run around and scare them. Well.. I was terrified. I was so scared that I just started crying. They were shocked and I just sat there and cried. It was really sad. Then, after a while, they took me outside and told my friends what happened and they all thought it was cool. Then I saw them later at their house and they were laughing about it. But my parents didn't even tell me about the incident, they just said I didn't scare them at all. But, of course, I wasn't scared anymore because I saw what was really happening and it was really weird. It just made me realize that you should never let your parents put you into a situation where you don't know what's going on. So anyway, I was really scared when I was in that basement. But what I didn in the end was actually cool. My parents had just told me how my brother had been in a similar situation and had died. He was just a baby and he was trapped in his parents basement. He didn't know how to get out. But that's not all, he had a little
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love the movie but this movie sucked for me. It has too many plot holes, poor acting and plot that was not properly planned. This is a movie that should be rated a 1/5 or a 0/5. The actors are all average or below. I really do not like how it ends. I did not care about the plot, and it was just a cheap thrill ride. I think if you like movies with lots of action and fast paced. Then this movie will make you happy. The story was predictable and boring. I just thought it was a waste of time and money. I hope the studio will change it for the DVD release. I would recommend this movie only for a good laugh. Overall rating: 4/5 I will leave you with this quote from a movie review by Mark Harris: I can't recommend this film highly enough. -Mike

I liked how they made it interesting. The movie was well made and interesting. I enjoyed it. I really enjoyed the story. I think the story could be done better. The film is about a kid who can teleport and go anywhere. He has a dog named Lumpy. They have a really fun time together. I was not impressed by the dog at all. It was just a dog. I don't know why they did that. The boy did a lot of running and jumping. He didn't seem to know where he was going. When the dog ran out in front of the car, the boy went to the side and started jumping. The dog went into the air and he jumped over it. That was not good. I thought the dog was not well done at all! It looked silly. The car and car wreck were a good scene, the car was moving. The kid's father was not a good dad. The girl was not too attractive. They were in a movie so they had to act like they were really there. The people in the movie did not look like they knew how to act. I did not care for the car crash. The way it was done made it look like a big accident. It didn't look realistic. I saw it on a big screen with lots of people around. The music was not bad, but not great either. The best thing about the movie was the characters. I had fun with them. I would like to see this movie again. I loved it!___________________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** *** This movie is terrible, horrible, and I don't know if it's supposed to be entertaining or not. The script is horrible. I can't understand how anyone thought that this was a good idea. I thought it was supposed to show a bunch of kids getting to know each other and be friends, but that's not what it was. It's supposed be an educational movie about animals, but it was all about humans in it. All the animals are talking and being funny, but you don't hear them talk. They just act it out. The one thing that made it entertaining was the animals' reaction to the humans, but I don' think that was the main thing that was entertaining about it. It was all just really bad. ***********  See more ▼ See less ▲  Lucky Number Slevin (1999) If you ever wanted to be an animal trainer, you should watch this movie. I'm not joking. It really makes you feel like an animal in training. I mean, seriously, that was my favorite part of this movie because the animals were really cool. But it also made me want to be a trainer. It taught me about animal behavior and animal training. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was that it was too long. I don;t know how it was ever going to be shown in the theater. It is really long. The first 20 minutes are really boring, but by the end of the movie, you're so excited that you can't wait to see the ending. The story is really good, but the acting is terrible. I think they just wanted to use all the actors in the movie because they thought it would make the movie longer. They also had to cut out a lot of scenes because they didn't want the movie to be too long, so they cut out some of the more interesting scenes. I just wish they would have cut out more of the scenes about animals' personalities. I also wish they had put more into the animal training part of the story, because it was really cool to see. There's also a really funny scene where a dog was being trained to be obedient, and the trainer was doing things that weren't so good, and it just ended up looking really bad for the trainer. There was also a scene where the trainer took a cat out to do some training, but he got so angry with the cat that he started to bite the cat.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* (or: _____ **********) If I can get a good review out of this then it'll be a win! So, I'm giving this movie 4 stars for the simple reason that I really like it, and even though the story is a bit of a cliche, it's not boring, it was actually pretty good! And as for the plot: ************ I'm a big fan of Sci-Fi and Horror and I think this movie is a very good example of both of those genres. The story takes place in a futuristic world where people are living in pods. It's not exactly a realistic setting, but it's still an interesting concept, so I like the idea. The main character is named Raul, and he's a very nice guy. The whole movie is told from Raul's point of view, so he's not very good at explaining things, but the movie does a great job at portraying a lot of different emotions. He's scared, he's sad, he wants to know more, he gets angry, he doesn't know what to think. But the most interesting part about Raul is the way he looks at things. When he sees a scary monster or something that shouldn't be there, he'll always have that look on his face. He'll turn pale, and then he'll start running away. He just doesn't understand what's happening. I think it was a great way to show the difference between humans and monsters. I didn't like the story at all. I know it's a Sci-fi movie, and the idea was good, but there was just so much going on, I was confused at times. Also, it seemed that the movie wanted to tell a really long and complicated story, but in the end it felt like it was trying too hard. The acting was really good, and a lot has to do with the fact that all the actors are really good at what they do, but for some reason it just wasn't enough. And there was the whole "Alien"-ness going on all throughout the movie. So, this movie was a really fun ride for me, but I really wanted to see more! I liked the idea of the movie a lot, but as for what actually happened in the movie, I just didn't get it. But I do like Raul a lot. I also enjoyed watching the movie in 3D.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  Don't tell me that the Devil's Brigade is a good movie, because it is not. If you love war movies then this is one of the best you'll ever see. If it was just war movies I might have given it a 4. But it is also a political drama that tells the story of two men who find themselves fighting for the same country and then the same nation starts fighting against them. This is a movie that takes a lot of its ideas from the classic novel The Great War and then it goes on to take a bunch of stuff from other movies like The Deer Hunter, The Deer King, and The Hunt for Red October. It is a classic war movie that can be appreciated by any war buff. I hope that one day some day I can go back to my high school and sit in on a class and watch this movie with the students.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What was wrong with this movie? _____________ I have watched this movie for several years, and I have always thought it was a bad one. I always have thought that the plot was terrible and that the acting was not good. I have even given this movie low marks because of it. The only reason I gave it a 3 star rating was because the actors were good and the movie had a great ending. Why is it a terrible movie? It is because of the actors. They don't do much in this movie, they just do their parts and are not able to be funny or interesting. The director doesn't do anything to make this movie funny, but he does not make this a bad film either. If the director was in the right mood, this movie could have been a good one. The other reason it is a terrible film is because the music is terrible. The music in this film is not that great, but at least it is not bad. If you have never seen a horror movie, then I would advise you not to watch this one. This movie has horrible acting and is just a bad horror movie. I give this movie a 3 out of 5 stars.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why I didn't give this 4 stars: ______________________________________________ The plot was weak and the acting was so poor. The ending was so rushed and I thought it was going to be the end of the movie and they would have left it at that. The only thing that kept me watching this movie was the story line. But the plot was very bad and there was too much dialogue. Also, the ending was very unsatisfying. I wish the movie had a happy ending.

The writing was pretty good, and if you could have gotten away with making the movie longer, it would have been good. I think it was just too slow. This was a poor decision.]

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ What a waste of time! I have already watched it at least five times now. The only good thing about this movie is that it is so bad that it's funny, it's so bad it's good. I'm sure if you were to take a look at my comments you would find some kind of humor in it. But it isn't. The characters are so boring that it isn the same joke over and over. The plot is even more boring, the whole time the characters keep saying things like "they'll come" or "they're coming", but there isn't a single person who says anything to anyone. And the dialogue in this movie just makes you think it's just some silly little movie that someone made. The music is so boring and not at all memorable. I know the actors, I know they're good at their job. But the only thing I remember from this movie was when the woman said "Oh my god, they're in there!" And I knew that that woman was the bad guy and that the scene had been filmed a thousand times. And I was wondering if they were trying to kill us all. So I guess that the movie was a waste for everyone involved.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________ What is this movie? __________________________________________________________________ I really really really want to like this movie. I really want this movie to work. I'm going to write about this movie in great detail, because I really, really want it to work out. So I'm gonna be as detailed as possible. First of all, I really don't care that much about the plot. It doesn't matter, because it's just a stupid movie. If you want a good movie about a stupid guy trying to get a girl to have sex with him, then this is the movie for you. And you know, if this movie was a movie about, say, the guy who was born with two thumbs, I would watch it and love it. But this movie is a movie of a guy who tries to get laid with a girl who is in a coma. And what makes the movie so stupid is that it's not that dumb. It's just really bad. This is one of those "why the hell did I bother watching it?" type movies. I don't even know what the point of this movie actually is. The movie is just really dumb. But it is kind of funny. This movie is about the movie "Caddyshack". And it's really hard to watch a movie called "Caddy Shuck" after you've seen "Cadillac Man" because the movie is really, REALLY DUMB. And this movie doesn't make a whole lot of sense. So this movie could be funny, but it could also be very stupid. So it doesn't really matter. It could also make me laugh. It would be really hard for me to make fun of a movie like this. But I will say this, it's the movie that really made me want to quit drinking. So if you are going to watch this movie, it might be good. But if you want to watch another dumb movie, I don' t know why you would. So here we go, the review. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This movie starts off pretty stupid. The guy who is trying to pick up a girl just doesn't seem like he has any ideas. He keeps saying things like "hey you, wanna watch a dumb movie?" and "Hey you want some movies with dumb characters?" and then he just keeps saying dumb shit. But then the movie starts getting funny. The girl keeps falling in love with the guy, and the guy keeps talking about her

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why not write a positive review about something that is actually a great movie? You'd have a better chance of getting a date with Scarlett Johansson in "Lucy" or with any of the other women in "My Week With Marilyn" than you would of writing a negative piece about a terrible movie like "The Hangover." If you want to write about a movie that is just terrible, write about "The Sixth Sense" or "The Blair Witch Project." These are movies about people who were really abducted by aliens and have no idea that they are missing. They are real, they really did experience it, and the aliens are real too. The "The Grudge" movie is just as real. The film has some great special effects, some excellent acting and some pretty good music. The only problem is that it is terrible. It's a horrible, boring, forgettable movie. It has one of the most boring storylines I have ever seen, and it features a very uninteresting villain. It is hard to believe that such a terrible film could have been made, but I'm glad it was. This is a very bad movie, and if you can't stomach it, don't bother to watch it. If you do, you will likely be shocked at how much the movie sucks. The plot is pretty boring and the characters are boring. It features the most uninteresting action set pieces I have seen in a long time. The villains are not very interesting and the special effects are bad. If this is what you are looking for, then "The Fifth Element" or even "The Matrix" are better options. I give this movie a D- (4.0). See it for what it is, but don't waste your time. See something better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. I think the worst part of this film is how the movie's writers thought they could get away with such a crappy ending to this movie. Why did the writer want to end it like that? The movie is about a girl who loses her parents in a car accident and then she is kidnapped by a group of bad guys and they are going to make her their bride. It is a long movie and a very bad movie, and I feel like the only good part of it was the ending. There were many times where I was thinking: ____. I thought the ending was horrible. The girl has been kidnapped and she is not going to get out. Why didn't she get out? Why did she keep trying to talk to people? Why was she even in this situation? The guy who was the kidnapper, he was the bad guy. Why was he able to kidnap her? Why didn' t he just kill her? The girl had to keep trying all this time to get her parents to come to help her. And then after she had finally gotten them to come and help her, they just let her go. That is the only thing I thought was really bad about this movie! Why? Why not just kill this girl? Why make her try to talk about it, but she is so afraid to say anything? Why let her try so hard and then just let the kidnappers just take her away? That is why I think this movie should not have ended like that. Also, why was there a bad guy that they had to kidnap the girl? It was a good idea to have this guy come to save the girl. They should have put a real bad guy in the movie. Then when he came to save her, he should have killed her. The guy in this movie was supposed to be a bad person, but he was really a good guy. It was not a good movie. It wasn't a good ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ I'm so happy that I saw this. I don't have to sit through an over-long, boring, over-the-top, overrated movie about a guy who is in love with a girl who is a prostitute, or a girl whose dad is a drug dealer, or even a movie that features some kind of "black comedy" thing. This is a movie with a lot of heart, and a very funny ending. I think this movie should have been nominated for Best Picture. It really is good, and it's a great movie, which you don't find every day. I'll never forget the last scene where the director shows the audience his entire film collection. He is holding up a DVD of this movie. I can still remember the look on the guy's face. I am pretty sure he thought that he had been duped. I had never seen this movie until a few years ago. It's a little different from other movies. It is a very good movie, and you should give it a try. The only complaint I have is that there were a few scenes that were too long. Overall, this movie was a good movie. Good actors, and very funny. You will like it.   My Rating: _____________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  A great movie, but I found the ending too confusing. The story, which is about a man who finds a box and is able to read the letter inside, is intriguing, but the way it ends feels like a cop-out. It leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth. There is no explanation as to how the box was found, and it's possible that it is something that was in the box that was left behind. There are many other plot holes as well, which I hope they are addressed in future movies. Overall, it is an excellent movie and a fun watch. The soundtrack is fantastic. I hope the DVD comes with a bonus disc with extra features. I would recommend this to any horror fan, as it is a very good movie.  Overall, a great movie with great sound and great special effects, especially the special effects in the train car. .
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________ __________  A movie I enjoyed as a kid. A good film that never had a chance to show what it could have been. A lot of action scenes and bad acting in a movie that should have been a drama. This movie was made for the 80s and it was the 80's and this movie wasn't made for action. I don't understand why people complain about it being "too violent". The violence is pretty tame. I was in the audience when this was released and it wasn't the most violent movie I have ever seen but it wasn'T really a bad film. _________________________________________________________ _________  In the early 90s, I was a big fan of this movie. A fun movie that had a lot of cool special effects. But I've been a little disappointed with this movie over the years. The acting was fine. The action was okay. The CGI was ok. It had a cool look to it. It's just a boring film. The plot was pretty basic. I enjoyed the special effects and the action. But it was never fun.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  The first of my two films, "The Best of Me", I can honestly say that I didn't want to make this one. I wanted to do the opposite of "The best of me", which was a love story between a woman and a man. So I went for a horror film. The first half was interesting, the second half was a disaster. I can only compare this film to a horror movie made by some French director who never saw the American movies. The whole film is so bizarre. It's hard to explain.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________   "The Last Action Hero" was a fun movie with some cool action scenes, which were the real star. I can't believe that nobody made a movie like that 20 years ago.   It was a very fast paced movie with a good cast and an interesting plot. I liked it a lot, but it just wasn't the same as "Last Action Hero."   This movie is about a soldier who is out to get revenge on the guy who took away his leg. But, as soon as he gets to the target, he realizes that his leg is still there.   the movie didn't have any of the silly and silly action scenes that you often get in a movie with this kind of plot. It was more like a good movie, with some great scenes.   a few of my favorite scenes were the ones in which Michael Biehn and Tom Berenger played a good old fashioned cop and an old time gangster. They both played their parts quite well.     I also liked that the plot of the movie kept me guessing. When we found out that the soldier's leg was still there, it made me wonder what kind of crazy scheme he and his fellow soldiers were up to.  . I also liked the movie when they finally got to the enemy's headquarters. It had a good soundtrack with a lot of the old school rock music.   that was one of my favourite scenes in the movie. The movie did a good job with the action scenes. It wasn't too long and they were all good.   "The Last in a Line" (2001)  (4/5)  and I really liked it. The story was really well written and the story about a kid who can't walk is pretty awesome. I really thought that this movie was really good. It did have a lot to do with the fact that the story was about a young kid who was a kid back then, but you can't deny that it was a good story.  - It was really interesting to see the movie because I never saw it before. I think that this is the first movie that was about someone who was just a kid. It's pretty cool.   in my opinion, the best scene was when the kid was playing baseball. It made me laugh so much.   I liked the fact when the movie was done with the whole "it's like the early 70s" thing. It reminded me of some of the

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ is a bad film. The worst kind of bad, the kind where the entire experience is just so… well… wrong. A poorly made, badly acted, and poorly written movie. A movie that seems to have been designed to make you laugh but instead only brings out the worst in you. A film that tries so hard to make its audience feel bad about themselves that the whole thing just becomes depressing. A sad film about people who don't know how to have a good time, and just want to watch the world burn. And so many jokes are made about it that it becomes an exercise in making you feel like you're laughing at the wrong people. This movie has such a negative and unpleasant tone to it, and I think that's why I liked it so much. It made me want to punch a wall and then cry myself to sleep. I don't care how good a movie is, you don't want to laugh at it. I can't even begin to imagine how much of a negative experience this film must have been for the people who made it. This is a movie that made me feel like I was watching something that should not have been made. There are so many mistakes that are so glaring that I can almost say it made me hate this movie. I'm so sad to have to say this because I love so many things about this movie that I was so excited to see. I loved the concept of it. And I love the fact that it tried so hard in so many ways to make itself funny. I just wish it hadn't been so awful and disappointing. I do not recommend this movie at all. I will say that if you want to see a good movie, you should watch this movie first.

I thought the first two episodes were funny, and I thought they were kind of interesting, but they just got worse. It gets worse and worse. I've seen it so many times that I don't even remember what it was. I remember that the first time I saw it, it was really bad. And then the third time, it just got even worse and I can't even believe it. It is a really bad movie and I wish I could take it back to the store and buy a DVD so that I can take it out of my head.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. If you've never seen a bad bad movie, you're missing out. The bad movie genre, or the "flicks you have to see for the badness", is a great way to discover a great movie. I'm always surprised when a bad film I've seen a million times comes across as fresh. And, you can always tell the filmmakers have a lot of fun.   I'll start with the bad movie that I'm sure most people have seen. It was the original "Halloween". The movie is terrible, and I don't care if you have seen it. It's not a good film. The movie was originally made as a horror movie and was supposed to scare kids. But it didn't scare them, so the movie was changed. They went back to their horror roots and changed it into a horror comedy. This movie is really bad, and you won't be able to take your eyes off of it, unless you're just sitting and watching. The film was so bad, that it was a big box office flop.   of course, this movie has gotten a big re-release, and a lot has been made of it. But the "HALLOWEEN" movie is not a great film, and it doesn't hold up to today's standards. The new, re-released version is so different that it really doesn't compare to the original. The original version has a few things that are great. One of them is that the original version is not as jumpy. It is a little slower and more subtle. The changes are too many to list, but you can't even watch the original without laughing. The re-edit doesn't even come close to the horror that was originally put on film. There are some good moments here and there, but it is a very different movie.   the first 20 minutes of the movie are great!   The second half of the film is really great. There is a really good character, who is trying to figure out why he was kidnapped. He is trying not to be the monster. He's trying to find out why his mother had him. He has to make friends with a little boy. He also has to find a way out of the house. This guy is the only one in the entire film who seems like he is having fun. The rest of the people in the film are just killing time. The only character who is doing something is the mother who

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ How do you rate a movie that does not even bother to make a good movie? A movie that makes you cry because it tries too hard to be something it is not. The movie tries to be too much, and does not know what it is. You get to know the characters, but the movie does not give them any depth. The film has a story, but it is poorly written. The story does not make sense, and the characters do not have any depth either. This movie is nothing but a waste of time. The plot is too simple, and everything is wrong with it. It does not need to be like this. It is too hard for a story to be made like this, because the characters of this movie are way too simple and stupid. It has no substance to it. The best part of this story is that the director does not try to make it interesting. He is too lazy to try to create a good plot. The director is too busy trying to make his movie look good. If he really wanted to make something good, he could have made it with the better plot. He made this movie just to make money, but he was not even able to make anything good with it at all. The characters are very boring, and no one has any depth or any reason to be in this movie. The reason why I give it a 2/10 is because it is just a waste to waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________   1) The movie is crap. I've been waiting for this for a while now.   2) It is directed by a guy that is a horrible actor. He is trying to look like a big action star.   a) The acting is atrocious. You should have seen it the first time he showed up on camera, the guy is a huge loser. The first time I saw him on camera was at a Halloween party. He was at the Halloween party because his daughter is a cheerleader and he wanted to give her a party, so he asked me to go and do a party with him. We were at a party in an apartment. He had a lot of makeup on, I thought he looked a little like a really fat and disgusting version of a human being. He said his daughter had come over and asked him to give them a party. We had the party and then went out.   I remember being at the party at some point, I remember hearing a woman yell "DOUBLE THREAT!". We all ran for cover, he yelled "WHAT?!" and ran after her, he had a mask on. He ran and I ran after him, he threw me to the ground and I had a good hard punch to the head.   of course he called the cops and I got arrested for resisting arrest. He threw me in a cell, then asked me what was going on, he asked why I was resisting arrest and I said, "You're the one that kicked me!". I got thrown in the cell for hours and was released without charge.   He then called the police again and asked me again what was wrong. I told him it was nothing. He got more pissed and asked if I was trying to fight back. I said no. He started yelling and yelling at me. He asked if they had a warrant for my arrest. I stated I didn't know, but then I said I knew it wasn't me. At this point I'm in a bit of shock, I didn  not know what to do. I was very scared and scared of what this guy might do to me. I got the impression that he was going to come back and get me. The next thing I remember, he was coming back, and I heard him say something like, "I'll see you in court." I was so scared. I didn 't even know what he said. I had no idea what to say,

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ Don't watch this movie. It's the worst movie I have ever seen. The film is so bad that it doesn't even deserve to be called a film. The plot was so terrible that I was disgusted with it and couldn't watch it. The story starts out with the main character being raped and tortured for days by the evil dictator in his palace. He is forced to have sex with several women, some of whom are not even human. Then he has to do a horrible dance to his own music. This is a scene where the movie tries to make the audience hate the main protagonist. He has no choice. The movie then goes into a torture scene where he is forced into having sex with a dog. And this is a real dog. This dog was made of flesh and blood and he was forced to perform sexual acts on him. He was tortured for hours. Then the movie goes into another scene where a girl is being forced to watch as her boyfriend is raped. I thought this movie was bad enough, but this is the worst scene of the whole movie. I was sick to my stomach watching this movie, and I was in tears. And then there is a final scene where this bad guy is tortured to death. I think this movie should be banned in America. I just don't think this film should be allowed to be seen. I'm sure there is nothing good about it, but it just shows that America has a problem with what they call "art". That is all this movie is. It shows the world the kind of evil people in the world are capable of. And they are all around you. They are all in your schools. They all are in your churches. They don't even have to kill anybody to do their evil deeds. They can do it through the movies. They do it by the music that they put on the radio. I don't want to see any more movies like this. It should be illegal. If it is illegal in America, then it should be completely banned in the rest of the world. I hope that the people in America will be able to see this movie and understand what is really going on in this movie-house. If they don't see it, then I really don't know what is wrong with them. If I ever see this film again, I am going to kill myself. And I am telling you that because of this movie I will never see another movie like this again. I have tried so hard
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  A story about a young girl and her grandfather. It's really, really bad, but she has the courage to give it a try.  So this is the story of a girl named Elvira. She is a normal girl. She has a normal life, except she has to go back to her home town to live with her grandfather, because his sister died. This is a very depressing film, but you really have to watch it to see why. It has some interesting ideas and a very strong, simple plot, but it is so awful it will make you want to cry and shake. I was scared from the beginning. It was so bad that I had to put it on mute. But, even in this movie, there are some good ideas, and it had a good ending, but I think the whole movie is just awful. It is so sad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________  "It was a beautiful day."  A bad movie is like a broken record.  The same things keep repeating in the same way:  It was such a beautiful morning.  I saw a beautiful sunrise.  the sun was shining brightly.  of course it was a perfect day. I didn't even think of doing anything else. I was so happy, so satisfied with life. I felt like the world was right in front of me, and it was perfect. Everything was perfect for me, including my life. It was like being in a dream. I wanted to wake up and have another perfect day like that. I couldn't stop thinking about the beautiful sunrise that morning. The sun was so big. The light was so beautiful. It felt like I was looking out of a window on a beautiful cloud. The clouds were so pretty. I felt so relaxed and happy that I was sitting there in the shade with my feet on the ground. The rain had stopped. It didn't seem like there was a cloud in the sky, it felt like there wasn't even a shadow of a cloud. I thought, wow this was such an incredible day. Everything seemed so perfect and perfect. I remember the sun and the clouds, I remembered the birds and the birds, the sun, the sky. I just felt like it was so perfect.  a negative movie is a movie that is so bad it makes you want to scream. _____________  In a bad movies, I remember a scene where the characters are just standing around talking and then they are suddenly in the middle of a huge explosion. I know they are just talking about how much they hate each other and they are making fun of each other but they are all in the exact same position. The explosions are so loud and it is so hard to hear them. The characters are all just talking and all they are saying is "we hate eachother." It makes me want to just jump out of my seat and scream. A movie has to have some kind of story that is not just a bunch of talking. __________________  I'm always surprised that people watch a bad film and say, "wow, I liked that." They like it because they like the explosions.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ Reviewed by: Michael W. _______________________________  I'm a big fan of movies like this, and this one was fantastic. It was a great action movie, with a story that could have been written by a great author. The cast was really good, the cinematography was beautiful, and the story was good. The problem is that there wasn't enough to care about. I felt that the movie just ended on a cliffhanger. If it was going to have a happy ending, it needed to be longer, and more interesting. Overall, I enjoyed the movie. _________________________________________  The reason I like this movie so much is because it has great acting and a great story. This movie is not a typical action movie. The plot was very unique and well done. The characters were well done and believable. The story itself was also well done, although it wasn't as fast-paced as other movies of this genre. I really enjoyed this movie. It has great characters, great action, and a good story. _____________________________________________________________________________  As far as action movies go, this one had a good mix of action, drama, and comedy. The movie was entertaining, fun, and exciting. The action was good and well choreographed, but the most interesting part was the story. It really was well written. I liked that they made the main character so unique, it gave the movie a very different feel. There were some very good jokes in the movie, and I found myself laughing out loud a few times. The soundtrack was good, and there were some great effects in the film. I'd recommend this movie to any action fan, but don't expect a fast-moving movie. This was a movie that I would watch over and over again, even if I had to go back and watch it a couple of times. It is one of those action movies that you will want to see again and again.  ___________________________________________  There are a lot of movies out there that you can choose from when you are looking for a good action movie and this is one you don't want to miss. It's action packed, and really has you in a good position to enjoy this movie for many years to come.  the cast is very strong, there is a good storyline, and good action. I recommend this to anyone that likes action, especially the older audiences. __________  In my opinion, this is the best

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ Your Rating: 5/5 A movie you will not be able to forget. I saw this movie in a 7:30 show on my way to the movie theater to see The Dark Knight Rises and I was blown away. The plot is great and the acting was superb. I loved how the movie kept making references to the original series and how they tied in the new ones. I also loved how they kept adding new characters and new villains to the film. This movie is one of my favorite Batman movies. If you have never seen this movie then you must see it. You will not regret it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________"It is a well-made film that is a rip-off of the old "The Man with the Golden Gun" from the sixties." -Robert K. Rheingold The Man with a Golden Gun, is one of the most popular, well-known and beloved films in the history of cinema. It was directed by the legendary Roman Polanski (who would later become one of Hollywood's most successful directors). It has been made into a number of television series and a feature film. The film tells the story of Dr. Jekyll, played by Edward G. Robinson, who is arrested by the police and put on trial for the murder of his wife. The trial turns out to be a farce as Jekyl is acquitted. The next morning, he wakes up and finds that his wife has been replaced by the beautiful Dr. Mary Jekll. As they fall in love, Jeklyll becomes increasingly unstable. The story was adapted from a novel by Raymond Chandler and was a big success during its initial release in 1956. After the success of this film, the film became a big hit and spawned a number or sequels. However, the success wasn't as great as it should have been as the film didn't last very long after its initial run. The original novel was a very popular one and there was a long running series of films about Jekyll and the Strange Case of Dr Jekilyll (1961-1972). However, it was not very successful and was never quite able to recapture the popularity that it once had. In the early nineties, there were some good re-releases of this classic film that had been made in the early sixties. However this version of the film did not do well. A new version, made by the great French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, was released in 2000 and had a very successful run. I don't know why this film has been such a big flop, but I guess it has to do with the fact that it is based on a novel which is not well known in the US. I was very pleased to find this film online and I think that it was worth watching just to see how good it was. I am a huge fan of the movie and I have seen it at least six times. I have to say that I have not seen it on television before. I think it is a good film and worth watching. If you like a

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ Why I Hated The Dark Knight Rises (2012) I was excited to see the Batman Rises movie this weekend and was thrilled that they chose not to do a sequel. I was also a little upset because this movie is very weak. This movie is about Batman (Christian Bale) and Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) on the anniversary of the murder of their son, Jason (Tom Hardy). Jason is seen with an arrow through his neck and the whole movie seems to be a flashback. Gordon is very angry and he and Bruce have to go out to find the killer. I have to say that this movie was so boring and I could not get interested in it. It was so bad that I did not even like Batman. I thought he was a pretty bad character. He has some good moments but he was just a complete waste of time. I don't think this movie has a happy ending. I think the movie just ends with Batman and Gordon looking at each other. Batman was just there and not very interesting. This was so lame that I could have cared less about this movie. This is not even the best Batman movie. Batman Begins (2005) This is the best movie of the Dark Knight trilogy. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because I think that the story of this movie got boring. I felt that Nolan did not give this movie the time it needed to develop a plot. I also felt that the ending was a little predictable. I really liked the first two movies, but this one just was not as good as the first three. I wish that the movie had a good ending because it would have been more memorable. I would have liked to see more Batman and Bruce Wayne. The first two films were a little better because there was a more dramatic story but this movie just felt very bland. It just felt like an action movie with Batman, Robin and Catwoman. The villains were not very well developed and the only real villains were Two-Face and Bane. I just felt that there were too many villains. The movie was okay because it was just action and it was fun to watch but I think this is the worst movie of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. I am glad that it was not a sequel because I would not have been interested in seeing it again. I recommend that you watch this movie to your children so they do not forget about this amazing movie. If you are not a fan of Batman, I do not think you should
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________. It's one of the most common phrases to hear in the film business, and yet, you never hear it coming from me. My favorite horror films are the ones where the characters do not behave well, and they all have this element of unpredictability to them. The characters of This Is the End have all been in the middle of a relationship in the past, and the way they behave in this film is the exact opposite of the character that we've seen in the previous films. The actors seem to have gotten into an altercation in the night, and then are now out of the movie for several years. This movie, which is not a great movie in the first place, is so bad that it's funny. You will laugh out loud at the scenes and dialog in this movie. It really doesn't matter what is going on in the movie, because it's always a fun watch. The acting in this is just horrible. The main character, who I will refer to as The Professor, is the worst actor in the world. He seems to have no emotions at all, and I find it hard to believe that he has to say any lines. The other characters, the rest of the cast, all have great performances as well. There are a few scenes in this that really stand out for me, but it is really just an overall bad movie. If you're a horror fan, then this movie will not do anything for you. If, however, you are a comedy fan, this movie may be the best one of it's kind you will ever see. I give it an A-
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ ( 4 out of 5) _____________________________________________________________________________________ I didn't see this one till the theater was already packed. The movie was pretty good. There were some nice effects, but they did seem a bit too clean for my taste. The characters weren't all that interesting, but at least the action scenes were entertaining. There was a lot of sex and violence in this one. It didn't really bother me, but it was a little bit too much. The ending was a bit weird. I was hoping that they would end the movie on a happy note. But that's not what happened. They ended on a sad note and I don't know why. I felt sorry for the girl. The guy is just an average guy who gets himself into trouble with his girlfriend. It doesn't make him an evil guy. The story was okay, but I really didn't care for it. The only reason I'm giving this movie 4 stars is because of the sex scenes. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________ ( 5 out of 10) ______________________________________ ___________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ If you don't like a movie, it probably isn't worth seeing. It is also a fact that there is always a "good" movie in the world. If you want to see something good, go to a theater. If not, at least watch it on a TV with a good picture. There are lots of good movies out there, just like there are a lot of bad movies. There is a big difference between a good movie and a bad one. If there is a good reason to watch a movie (for example, to be with your friends), then I don't mind if I see it. It's only a movie. I've been to the movies many times. When a movie is good, it's a good feeling. The audience is with you. The characters are well-developed and interesting. The director knows how to use a script to his advantage. A great movie is not good just because it's made by a director with good taste. It has to be good because of the director's creative vision. If it is good for the director, it will be good for you. If I see a movie that is good and interesting, I won't get bored. I don' t know if the movie is a flop, but I'm sure I will find some reason to stay at home and watch it over and over again. I would rather be entertained by something that is not a masterpiece than by something like this. - June 10, 2009Not a masterpiece  Reviewer: the-great-dude - favorite favorite favorite - June 8, 2009  Subject: The Film Was Great, but.......the film was fun. But it was also a great opportunity for a lot to get out of hand and not be very funny. At the end, the audience was just laughing at the wrong people.   The movie itself was ok. The movie was fun, but at the same time, the wrong person got a chance to be on camera. The scene where he is playing with the other guys in the bar and the girls in the background get pissed off and come over to talk to them, and the whole scene gets cut off because they are being too annoying was great.  . The only other bad thing was the fact that they did not get the name of the guy playing the bartender. It was funny at first, but then he was not very funny at all. - December 11, 2008The Film Was Good, but....
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ The film opens with a black and white image of a man in a white suit being handcuffed to a white woman, the woman being chained in the background. The man is being escorted to a police station after his car was hit by a police car. The woman is handcuffed to him and is looking at her hands in front of her. The scene fades to black. There are no sound effects and no subtitles. There is only the black and whites. The film then goes to black again and the camera pans over a black screen. This time, there are no subtitles and only the blacks. The screen is just a large black rectangle. The men's voice is in a deep voice, but there is no sound, just the sound of a person breathing. This voice repeats a phrase. This is followed by a man who is in black clothes, and he is yelling at the woman and telling her not to look at her own hands. The next shot is of a black man, and the image is the same as the first, except that it's black and there are subtitles. Then there is a shot of a woman, and she is looking into a small mirror that has a small hole in the middle of it. The final shot is a black woman looking into the mirror and then it fades to white. The black man then yells at the camera and says that he is a cop and that he has done everything in his power to bring this woman in front him. The camera then pans to the next black woman and she looks at the police officers and then goes into the next shot. This film is an action film with a very simplistic plot. The plot is a simple one. The main character, "Dee", gets kidnapped by a group of thugs. She is then taken to the place of the crime, a bar, and is given a drug called "Sting" to help her get out of the situation. Dee does manage to escape from the thugs and they take her to the "House of the Devil", a hotel in a town in the countryside. The house of the devil is where they meet up with a man called "Vinny", who is a big shot gangster who is going to kill Dee. The gangsters also try to get the drug "Bunny", from Dee to kill Vinny. They succeed in getting the drug from Dee but Vinny shoots the police officer that was following him and takes his gun. He then takes Dee to the bar

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________  I am a fan of all of the Alien films but I have always been annoyed that they never went for a good Alien creature or a new alien species. In Alien: Resurrection it was the perfect time to do so, but instead they chose to use the same old, same old as always. It wasn't much better than the last Alien film.  In Alien: Covenant, it seems like they took all of what worked in the previous films and made a new film. It's a shame as the film has a great idea and the actors all seemed to have a great time making it. Unfortunately it just wasn't that great. There are too many plot holes to ignore and the film itself is just plain silly.  and the alien is a bit boring, not much changed from the first film. I would have preferred them to give him a better costume, but again the old "head and spine" suits were the same as always, so they could just go back to that. I was also really disappointed that they didn't go for a proper Alien Queen or Queen 2.0. It would have been a great twist to the plot. Instead we get a lot of "sasquatch" scenes. If they had gone with a Queen 2.0 or something they could have really pushed the horror of the aliens and their true origins. , the original Alien films are a bit of a disappointment. I'm not saying they are bad or anything but I think they could do a lot better. If there was some kind of new species or something to make them stand out a bit, this would have made a great film. Instead they just did what they always do, making it just another Alien film in the franchise.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________   The first time I saw the movie was at my brother's house (the movie was originally titled, "Movies at my Brother's House"), and it had a bit of a "who cares" feel to it. The movie was about a girl who was on her first date with her boyfriend. She was at a bar when the guy, who she met in a class, decided to talk to her. After a little conversation, she asked him out, and they went on a date. Things were going well, until they went back to his apartment and found that he had a little girl, who he called her daughter. They had sex in his bed, but she felt violated and thought it was wrong. She asked him to get rid of the child, and he didn't, so she broke up with him. Later that night, she had an accident and fell off a balcony.   This is the only way I can describe the movie. It was not bad, but the first half of it was just a bit confusing. And I was so interested in the characters that I was not really paying attention to the story.   the movie has a girl and a guy who has a kid, and a girl whose daughter was taken from her by the father.   and the movie is about the girl who broke up, and how she feels. and what happens.   he was very good in the movie, but i think the ending was a bit rushed.   of course, this is not a movie for children.  ___________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________  The movie starts off with a few minutes of slow motion (I have no idea why) of a woman talking to herself. This is followed by a montage of the movie's main characters, which is pretty interesting as we get to know them better. The next scene shows the whole gang (the gangster and the drug dealer) standing in a room and getting ready to rob a bank. I don't remember anything else from the scene, but that's the only time I remember the scene. It was just a monty. There is no plot and the movie ends with a couple of minutes of the gang's boss being kidnapped. The movie really starts to pick up once the gang starts to figure out the plan. There's a great scene in this movie where the gang makes the decision to get in the van and run. It's a simple scene but it shows what the movie was going for.

A lot of people will see this and think it's great and will think it has potential, but that's what happens when you get the "A" in the movie business. This is not a movie. This has no story, no character development, no chemistry. It's all just bad. I think it would have been better if it was a movie like a "Godzilla" and a "Kung Fu Panda" - no story and all just monsters - but I guess that would be too boring for some people. It would have also been easier to see a monster movie without the usual "action" - it would be just the monster and some people, but no people in suits. No "people fighting". Just monsters. I can't see this as a monster film. It has no heart. It doesn't make sense. I'd like to see it as a movie that a friend made because he was bored and didn't like his friends. I would have thought that a good friend would have come up with a good movie for me, but he didn't. It was too boring and too bad. This movie is a big mistake on the part of this movie maker. I'm not mad at him, but I am disappointed. If you want a fun, stupid, but silly monster movie, this is it. It should have been a fun action movie instead of just a stupid movie. I hope that a director with more sense than this one makes a better movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  The movie I just watched was terrible. The writing was poor and the acting was horrible. The acting was so bad that I was embarrassed to be in the movie. I don't have anything good to say about this movie.  "The Dummy" is an animated comedy film about a robot that has a mind of his own and tries to solve the mystery of why he was created.  (more)  In "The Dumbie" an evil and evil looking robot wants to get revenge on a person that made him do wrong. He tries to do this by kidnapping a girl and torturing her. The plot of the movie is pretty much how the robots character is made, and how the girl is captured. The robot in the film is voiced by Kevin Kline and his name is Dummy. He was created by a guy named Mr. Kline, and it was Kline who wanted to make a better version of the robot. This movie is made for kids and is only about 15 minutes long. The movie has great writing and animation, but the acting in this movie is terrible. There were times when the robot was in a lot of pain and it felt like he was not meant to be. The story of the film was a little hard to understand. The whole movie was made out of little jokes, but I didn't get the jokes because of the horrible acting in the show. This is not a great movie to watch for kids, it's more of a horror movie. The only reason I gave this movie 3 stars is because it's a fun movie to see with your kids.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. I don't even want to say how awful the movie is, but I'll just say that if I could make up my mind and change my opinion of it, I'd probably be able to. I thought this was going to be great, I thought it was going be a great sequel, but it wasn't. I'm not sure what I thought I was getting with this movie, and I'm really not sure why I even bothered going to see it. The acting was terrible, the plot was laughable, and the acting was even worse. It's a waste of time, and you could be doing something better with your time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** "This movie was so awful that I felt compelled to write a negative reviews about it, as I have never enjoyed anything so bad in my life. The movie itself is so bad, I can't even remember what it was about. It was like watching a bad documentary. The acting was awful and every character was an idiot. I would have quit watching it a long time ago if it weren't for the fact that I saw it in the theater and could never forget it. I am ashamed to say that I did not enjoy it." (Anonymous) (This review was collected as part of a promotion for "Pitch Perfect" on Facebook. Thanks to everyone who wrote in with such thoughtful and helpful comments. I have now seen "PITCH PERFECT", and it's one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen this year.)  ______________________________________________________  "The Pitch Perfect 2" stars the hottest new actresses in Hollywood. They are the perfect pair to kick off the next generation of movie stars. The original film featured Emily Blunt, Rebel Wilson, Hailee Steinfeld, Hailey Baldwin and Victoria Justice.  The new film, which also stars Chris Pratt and Anna Kendrick, picks up right where the first left off, but there are some new twists. The characters are better and the story is better. . - - - -  I watched "The Pitchperfect" at a special midnight screening for my friends. This was not a typical screening, because we were all there to see it. The event was sponsored by the folks at Amazon.com and they were able to get the movie on the screen for everyone. As we waited for the movie to start, a group of teenage girls started dancing. I'm not sure why, but I thought it was cute. The boys didn't mind, and some of the girls started following their lead. This scene was filmed in front of a live audience. We were all excited. , - - The film opens with the narrator (played by Anna Kendrick) talking about the original film. She talks about the excitement of being a part of this film. It's a little confusing at first, but then she tells us that the original movie ended up being a flop. It had a budget of $2 million. So, this new movie is supposed to be much more successful. She tells us about the amazing reception that the first film received, and about how they changed the original script because

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________________ The first half of the film is very good. It starts off with a really good introduction of what's going on with the world around you. We learn that the earth has been in a "dark age" since the end of the world and that all of the technology has been taken over by the bad guys. It takes a few minutes for the film to introduce the characters but I liked that they did so in a very good way. The characters were all distinct and their roles were handled very well. The film starts out very well with a very strong first half. It's very cool how the characters are all introduced in such a way that you feel like you know them. It was nice how the film took time to introduce each character and their role. The music is very fitting and is the one thing that makes the film work. It does a good job of keeping the tone of the story and making the characters feel like they are more than just one dimensional villains. The last 20 minutes of the movie are very disappointing. It is very obvious that this film was done by a different director than the first one. It just feels as if the film was rushed and the film just ends too soon. It doesn't make up for all of that great first half though and just ends in a bad way. _______________________________________________________________________________ (5 out of 5)
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________ The only problem with this movie is that there isn't really a good villain. The one I was rooting for was The Red King, but he was a big fat stupid jerk that was a total jerk to everyone he met. He just wanted power, so he tricked everyone and then just killed everyone. It was so boring that it didn't even seem like he cared about anyone except himself. And even then, he was trying to kill everyone just to see who was going to die, so that he could then get to the good guys and steal their stuff. The other guy, The Black King, was just an angry old man that didn't care about anyone, and he had no problem with killing anyone. He had a grudge against everyone and just wanted to see the end of them. This guy also had a stupid sword, and it was just a cheap plastic sword. It had nothing to do with anything, and you couldn't even swing it. It just looked like a sword because the guy just kept stabbing people with it. The movie had a lot of blood, but it was not worth it. A lot of the movie was just stupid. The only thing that kept me watching was when The Black Prince came into the story. He was the good guy. He actually had a reason for all the evil he did. He killed The Red Queen so that she would not have a son, and that's why she couldn't be the next Queen. Then he killed The White Queen, because she tried to stop him. Then they had a giant fight and he was going down. Then we see him falling down and a big cloud of smoke comes out. He is then revealed to be a woman named Princess Lillian. The guy that killed him is the Black Prince. The Black Princess was just the bad guy who killed the Black King and turned him into a woman. And she was all like "You are the king now. You are the true king." And then she turned into the Black Queen. So, that's how the movie ended. I really wish that they made a sequel. I mean, the movie would have made a lot more sense if they just kept this woman alive. The way they killed her was so stupid. It made no sense, but at the same time, it was so funny. It looked so ridiculous. It looks like something that was done in a low budget movie. I think that there is more to the story, but I really don
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It was an amazing film to watch. It was the kind of movie that made me cry and laugh with one another."  -- Johnathan O'Toole on the movie "Liar Liar" (1997) "The movie is a lot like a great film that I've seen before, in the way that the characters and the story are the same, but there are some differences, so it doesn't really have the same kind of feeling, the same emotional connection, the way you would have with a great movie." -- Johnathan P. "Jackass" (1994) "It's like an extended 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,' in which a bunch of people from the 1970s get together and go on a drunken, drug-fueled, sexual adventure, all in a rowboat."   -- John C. on the film "Jurassic Park" (1993) "If it wasn't for the first movie, I'd have a lot of trouble remembering the name of this movie."  -- David G. on "Jungle Book" (1967) "I was just about to turn on the television and see this, and I'm like, 'What the hell is this?' It's just a bunch o' dumb-ass kids, running around, playing and shit. There's not a single original thing about it." -- Richard C. "A Fish Called Wanda" (1951) "When you see a movie like 'A Fish Named Wanda' you get the sense that they were a bunch crazy kids in a basement, and they just happened to make this movie and then all of a sudden it was the next big thing."  - John C on "A Bug's Life" (1960) "A bunch of guys running around in a cage. It's a lot more fun than the film itself, it's just so stupid."  – John C (the film) "There are too many of these 'A Bird's Life' movies now. I mean, the producers should really think about canceling this show. It should be cancelled.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ ___________  A little bit about the movie: "Django Unchained" (2012) tells the story of the slave-turned-freedom fighter. Django, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, was captured and enslaved by the plantation owner, Calvin Candie (Christoph Waltz). Django, however, was able to escape from his chains and free himself and his people from the plantation. He was also the man who shot and killed Candie. The film was a huge hit, winning numerous awards. DiCaprice has become one of the most sought after actors of the year.  The movie is a bit too long, too, as the story doesn't really end. It's just one big action sequence that takes place over the course of the film. Di Caprio is so good in the film that I'm sure there will be more movies like this one. Di caprio is able to convey the brutality and fear of slavery in a way that will really bring home the horror of slavery. .  and finally..

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________  Why did they have to ruin the ending? _________________________  You don't know a good movie until you see it again: ______________________ , when it was released, is one of those movies that just takes you back to your childhood. If you're like me, you will want to go back and see it a second time. You can do so by watching this review. This is the sequel to The Little Mermaid and I've seen it many times. The story is about Prince Eric, a boy who has a magical underwater cave and a mermaid, Ursula. Together they try to rescue their princess, but they can't escape from the evil monster Kraken. This movie is pretty much like the first one. The only difference is that the King and Ariel are gone, and the princess has become a merwoman. The King and Ursula are now separated and Eric has to do his best to save her. The plot is still the same, but the setting and characters have changed. It is a good sequel. I highly recommend this movie to any fan of the first movie. The sound effects are excellent. The characters and the music are all very good. This was the first Disney movie I ever saw and I enjoyed it very much. I will definitely be watching this movie again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________   This movie is so terrible it hurts. It starts off so well, with a cute little story about a little girl who falls in love with a dog who is just a little bigger than she is. It's so cute and it's really touching at the end. I was in love! Then the movie starts getting very confusing very quickly. The story starts off with a man falling in love at first sight with a woman he met on the street. The woman falls in LOVE with him and they begin to date. The man is a cop, who is very good at his job. The movie then goes off the rails when the man decides to go undercover, which he does by posing as a woman, and using her as a prostitute. The problem with this is that this doesn't actually happen in the movie, but is something that was just added in for the movie. After he becomes a cop he tries to commit suicide and it is at that moment that the movie becomes really messed up and confusing.   After the movie ends we learn that the woman is actually the woman's sister and the man is actually her husband, and the story really ends with a very weird and horrible ending. It is so hard to watch this movie, as it is so confusing and weird. I mean, at first I thought it was a really good movie. Then it got weird and I couldn't even watch it.  . I give this movie a 0 out of 10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. I loved this movie and it is a great movie. I love the movie. However, I had an issue with the movie and that was a bad choice. My husband and I went to the movie to see how the actors would do in this movie. The movie started with a very quick and intense scene. The actors looked great. They were all great in this scene. I think they were acting in character. After the scene, I thought the movie had a nice pace and I thought it was a good film. I was in the theater for about 3 1/2 hours and it was just a good movie. After that, the film was like the rest of the movies. The acting was good. The plot was good and I like that it was all based on history. I also liked that there were some political messages. The ending was pretty good. I did not like the movie because of the ending. I felt that they didn't show us what really happened. The director should have shown us what was going on in the real life. I just thought the ending was a bit abrupt. I would like to see what was really going on. The music was good as well. I liked the movie but I did have an issue. I will give this movie a 7.

A penny movie is a movie for kids with a tiny dollar. If you were to take a penny out of a kid's pocket, they would think you were a clown."  I'm going to take you through this whole movie in detail. It's a good movie. A good idea, and it had potential. The movie is called "Romeo and Juliet" (1952). The movie was directed by John Frankenheimer. The movie has some great lines and some of the funniest parts. The plot involves a bunch of kids in a high school who are having a big fight. - The lead is Romeo (James Dean) and Juliet (Anne Bancroft). They are both rich, and they're dating a guy called Romeo (Barrymore). The girl he's with is called Juliet (Carol Channing).  - They're going out to the city, and Romeo is so drunk that he gets arrested. They have to find him a lawyer, so they go to a lawyer who is an expert in cases involving drunk people. The lawyer, played by Dean, tries to explain to the kids that he's not actually a drunk. He's a genius who can find the right lawyer, and if you go to him you'll get a good lawyer. "We have to go find Romeo," says Juliet. "I don't want to go looking for Romeo," said the lawyer. "What if we do?" "Then he's going to get in a lot of trouble," the lawyer says.  a lawyer (played by John Franklin). "We have...to go find" said Juliet.

"Well, then he's a great lawyer." , but the other lawyers, who are all experts in this field, think they're good at this, and say that they've done

I'm going to give it a 3/10 because it's only a 1/10 for me. I'll give it 2/10 if you want to. The cast is just bad. And the script is so bad, I just don't know how they made it. It was written by Michael Dorn. This is the best thing about the movie, the acting is so terrible. The best part is that the music is so awful, you can just hear the sound effects and all the cheesy voice-overs in it. There's a scene in this movie where one of the actors is playing a computer game and he's playing a game called "Blazing Saddles" and he says "And you're a cow, and I'm a pig. That's all there is to it." It was so funny, and the movie was just so stupid. This movie was made in 1986, and it had a budget of around $100,000, and only made about $15,000 at the box office. But the cast was so bad. It made my blood boil. It makes me sad. I really liked the original film, and this just made me hate it. So bad.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________  I would not go out of my way to see a movie with such a low Rotten Tomatoes score. I just read the synopsis of the movie and that is all that is given about it. It is a short movie about a boy that is in trouble at school and has no choice but to take a job at a small store. What was not mentioned is that he works at a store where he is seen by a woman in a short skirt. The rest of the story is told through flashbacks.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________   The Best and Worst Films of the Year (December 20, 2012)   If you were ever curious about what some of the more obscure movies that were released on home video, were about, then you need to see The Best and the Worst Films.   While the majority of these films were simply not well received, they still managed to capture the imaginations of a generation. So with that said, let's dive in and find out the top ten worst films of the year.     10. A Man Walks Into a Bar   (2002)  - The worst film ever made? It certainly could have been. This film is so unbelievably bad that it was considered by some to be a masterpiece at the time of its release. The premise is simple. The film follows a man who, for reasons he doesn't fully understand, becomes convinced that he is a zombie and goes out to wreak havoc. Of course, being a movie from 2002, the film tries to pass itself off as a documentary, but even the best documentaries don't go this far wrong. It's just really bad. It really is. The acting is terrible. The plot is bad. The editing is bad and the special effects are terrible. And, the soundtrack is bad, bad, BAD.  .   is so bad that some people even claim it was a "filler" film. This movie was a complete flop and should have been considered a complete waste of money. It wasn't even really made to be successful. If it was, it probably would have made a bit more money, but the studio just thought it was so much fun to make.   in 2002, this film was the number one movie at the box office and grossed $22 million dollars. And it was made for a total of $1.8 million. That's a lot of money for a film that was supposed to be about a man, that would never be successful in the box-office.  :)   is a terrible film. And that's saying something considering the terrible films that were made the year before it. But it does deserve a place on this list. It has all the right ingredients of a bad film, and yet it's really, really bad!   I have seen this film a handful of times and, despite all the complaints about it, I still love it. It does have some good parts, and I've actually laughed a couple of
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________ It's a movie about the worst kind of person in the world, and he makes a very good villain. He's a jerk who doesn't have the brains or courage to pull his own weight in a team-building exercise. He is an idiot who is so stupid he thinks he's invincible. He has a complete disregard for the consequences of his actions. He doesn't care that his friends might die. He wants everyone to be safe and happy, so he makes stupid decisions. He makes stupid plans that get him into trouble. He keeps running to save himself when he could have taken a different path. He never stops to consider the consequences, never cares about the lives of others. He only cares about himself and his own ego. The plot is simple: ______________________________________ The first act is great. It's not a big action scene, but it's a good action scene. The villain gets a lot of screen time and the audience gets to see how he operates. He manages to be both a dick and a coward at the same time. His main goal is to kill as many people as possible, and all he wants is to be liked. He spends all his time looking for the perfect way to screw with people, and this is what gets him into all the trouble. His only goal is getting as much pleasure as he can. His plan is so obvious that even his enemies can see it coming. They don't have to find out what he's planning because he already told them. The only thing he does wrong is to forget about his friends. He would be much better off if he never talked to them, because if he were smart he would be thinking about the future. He could be a great leader or a great husband, but instead he's a total asshole. He tries to force his way into all their lives without realizing that they will all turn against him. He always wants to be the center of attention and everyone else has to look to him for approval. He can be very charming, but his actions are always in bad taste. _________________________________________ The second act is also great. The action scene is much more exciting this time around. It gives the audience a lot to think about. ___________________________ The third act is pretty much an hour and a half of bad acting. There's not much to say about the story.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Do a good movie:__________ I want to do a good job: _______ I want my name in the credits: _____ ____________________  So, let's talk about how this movie makes you think. The whole point of this film is that you are not supposed to be in it. The story, which is pretty bad, was told with such a low-key, uneventful, almost boring style that you wouldn't even notice it's a movie, and the characters were very flat. They were a bunch of idiots who had nothing going for them but their stupidness. And, of course, the whole movie is narrated by a female character who speaks in a very silly voice and is so annoying that I would be afraid to listen to her.  This film was supposed to showcase the incredible talent of the director, a man named Yury Zaitsev. Unfortunately, he did not get much work after that, although he did have a few great movies, including The Last Day and The Man Who Wasn't There. The man was also responsible for such movies as My Name is Khan, The Day the Earth Stood Still, and The Three Stooges. His films are good, but he wasn't able to pull off this. This movie was not only a disaster, but it's also the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I was surprised how much it was bad. It really makes me want to hate this film. I can't say that I am a huge fan of Russian movies, but this was so bad I would not want to watch it again. The film is so bad that the only reason I can recommend it is because the music is okay. The movie is really bad and that's why I can tell you that the music wasn't very good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** I have read a lot of negative reviews about this movie. They're all wrong. I think it's a great movie, and a great story, but this is a movie you have to watch with a group. A good story alone will not be enough to pull you into the story. The acting was great, the music was great. I just didn't have any interest in the plot. I thought it was boring. It was a pretty good movie, but not a great one. It's not worth seeing with a large group of people. I'm glad I watched it with a few other people. It had a great ending, which I will probably never forget.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it is as though you are watching a bad version of something better, but the bad version was never released. This is just a horrible movie and I don't want to see it ever again. It is very unoriginal and a huge ripoff of the movie "Pleasantville". The director of this movie also made the movie called "Plesterville".  This is not a good movie and there is nothing good about it. It takes the same idea from "Pitch Perfect" and tries to make it into a movie. It does a very poor job at doing so and it is just an incredibly bad movie. I hope the movie does not get released because it is so bad that it is hard to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ My Rating: **** My Rating is only 3 stars, because it had a good cast, the acting was great, the music was great and the story was great. Unfortunately the story got a bit twisted and they took the ending away from the movie. It was not a cliffhanger ending, the movie kept us guessing and was very good. I would have preferred a good story, but there was no cliffhanging ending. The movie got a 3 out of 5 for me. If you want a good movie, but you are not into science fiction and space movies, then I highly recommend this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* "Worse than the worst of the worst" is a phrase that is often heard when one of our children watches a bad horror movie.  This is a fact and if you think it is a bad film, then don't be surprised if you feel the same.    This is one of the films that has been making the rounds for a while now and even when we were expecting a "good" movie it didn't seem to be any different than any other.   So when it comes to horror films, this is a film you will have to be prepared for.    The acting was just average at best and the script is quite awful.  I guess I can't be disappointed by a bad-looking movie but this one was bad-ass!  The story was not a bad one and there was no way that it could be worse than some of the other horror films we have seen.  And I know there is a difference between a good film and a bad or a mediocre film.  In a bad way this movie was a good movie. If you don't like horror films or don't have a problem with them then you can probably still enjoy this movie. There were some moments of good humor in this film, it's just not a very good movie to watch.  If you are looking for a good horror movie this is not the one for you.  There is a sequel that is much worse, and if this is your first time watching a bad and bad-to-the-bone horror film then you might be surprised.

The first 20 minutes of the movie are a train wreck of horrible acting, horrible writing, and horrible directing. This movie just doesn't seem to want to be a movie. It's just a mess of an incoherent mess of a movie that I don't want to watch ever again. I will never ever buy a DVD of this movie again. ______________________________ "I'm gonna eat the entire cast" ____________________________ I'll never ever watch this movie ever again because of this. I can't stand this movie and I never want to see it again. It has to be the worst movie ever made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this is a really bad movie. The writing was horrible. It was so bad that if you wanted to do something that would be an easy way to make a point. You could say that this movie was written by a retard.  I'm sure if you had actually sat down and watched it, you would have laughed your ass off.  The movie is based on the novel by Michael Crichton.   Crichtons novel had a really good plot.  In the beginning, it was a thriller with a lot of suspense and mystery.  But by the end, it turned into a comedy.  At the end of the movie, the only thing that I really laughed at was when one of the characters was trying to hide something.  The movie had some great acting but not nearly enough of it.  I wish they had more actors in the movie.  Some of the other actors that played the characters did not have any lines but they were there.  There were a few times where I was really shocked when one character acted a certain way.  One time, I had no idea why they were doing it. It just seemed so ridiculous.  When it was over, I felt like I was sitting in a bad sitcom.  It was a really terrible movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ******** The first thing that comes to mind about this movie is how much the story changes depending on which characters you pick. The first two times we see it, we see the same story but with the same characters. Then there is the time when we have to switch between different characters and the story completely changes. So the first time we see a movie is the movie, the first few times we hear the same movie is a movie. Then we have the other time, the movie is not the movie. It is the other times, the other characters and other stories. I think it is great that they kept the same names and everything but it is still hard to understand how we are going to see the characters in different time periods. The acting is great, it is very easy to understand what is going on. It has been a while since I saw a movie that I can say that about.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  "It's a classic example of how a bad sequel can work its way into the public consciousness and end up being more popular than the original."  - The Onion  For years, I have lamented the fact that there were so many sequels to bad movies. I was just about to write about a sequel that I've never seen. But then I heard from a friend that it was out. So I took a quick look at the trailer and, in all honesty, I didn't think it was that bad. After all, the director is one of my favorite directors, John Landis, and he has made several good movies.  However, I am going to tell you what I think of this film because I believe it is one that should be avoided. ,  I have always been a big fan of John Landwas' work. I loved his "The Blues Brothers", and I loved "Straw Dogs". I loved both of his movies about the Vietnam war, "Sons of the Purple Heart" and "For a Few Dollars More". I really enjoyed his "Halloween". But then there are the bad movies, the ones that I don't think you should watch. So when I heard this movie was being made, I thought I'd go see it for myself. I thought it was going to be a really good movie.  in the end, I was wrong. : This movie has all of the hallmarks of being a good movie, except it is not a good film. I really liked the movie, I enjoyed the story, and I thought the director did a really great job of telling the story. But there are several things about this movie that I cannot stand. There are some things in this movie which I cannot watch. The thing is that this movie is just so bad, and there is no way to describe how bad it is. There is nothing good about this film. In fact, there is nothing to see in this film except bad. In my opinion, there are two things that really makes this movie really bad. The first is the bad acting. There was one scene in this flick where the actress was supposed to say, "I have a feeling I'm going to see you again," and in the scene she actually says, "Yeah I'm not going to the same place, but I'm gonna see you." The second thing that makes this film so bad is the music. I've seen

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If the film itself was so bad that the actors were incapable of conveying emotion or acting believably, the movie would be a piece of art, an accomplishment worth lauding. But this movie is so inept and unfunny that it is almost laughable. I don't know how a movie so bad can be so enjoyable. The movie has too many plot holes to even try to get a grip on the film. It has too much continuity errors to be believable. The actors are either so terrible that their characters don't seem real or so good that they can only play characters who are too perfect. I can't believe that this was even made. I really don't think this film deserves to be called a "film". This is more like a piece out of a bad comedy sketch, a movie for those who just like to make fun of movies and movies themselves. A really, really bad movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** It was an alright movie. It was a fun little adventure movie. I liked it. I thought it was alright. There was a lot of action in it. The girls were a little too innocent. It wasn't bad. I would probably watch it again, but I'd probably pass on the sequel, as well. It's got a cute little cast. The actors were all good, but the girls were just too innocent and that's not what I like in a movie. Maybe it was the budget? Or the plot. Either way, I can't wait for the sequel.  Review: *************** My mom bought this movie for me as a birthday present. I was born in the 90s so it was a good movie for my age group. The cast was good. It had a little bit of a story line to it. It just kept getting worse. It kept getting more stupid and worse. I found myself thinking "wow, this is a bad idea" and then realizing that it was too late. My dad had the same problem. This movie is horrible. It is so bad, that it made my mom and dad watch it in the car and then have to watch it together. The movie kept getting sillier and sillier. I wish they had made a movie for younger kids. I feel that a movie like this is the worst movie I have ever seen. Here's the review: ********************* I was expecting something like this to be about a little girl and her father, but there was a ton of cursing and bad acting. I think the only reason this movie was successful was because the cast was so small. If they had hired someone bigger, the movie would have been a total failure. There were a few funny lines, but it wasn't worth it. We had a party at my sister's house for our little brother's birthday. We were all there, but my mom decided to have the movie on at the same time as the party. She knew my brother and sister wouldn't be able to get through the whole movie, so she let us watch it when we got home. I saw a few times and never thought it would be bad, but as the movie progressed, it just got worse and worse and then we just got sick of it. Now I know there were people who really enjoyed it, but for me, it wasn,t worth it and I couldn't see why someone would watch it.

It was made by a bunch of Hollywood hacks who got a lot of money from the movie and didn't care about it. There were some good moments and it was funny. But this movie was just an awful waste of time. If you want to see some good movies with a good story go to: The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle or even a couple of the more popular Rocky movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ The first half of the movie was boring. The story was really predictable, and the first half was about a bunch of people getting killed. It was pretty boring and not very exciting. The second half of this movie was very exciting and suspenseful. The film starts out with a man named Ben (played by Michael Clarke Duncan) in a dark room. He looks in a mirror and sees his wife being killed by a man with a knife. The man then comes out of the mirror and kills Ben with a gun. The woman in the mirror then wakes up and sees the man killing her husband. She screams, and her husband grabs a gun and kills the man. He shoots the man, and then goes outside to get some coffee. The next day, he wakes up in the morning and finds that the police have arrested him for murder. They tell him that he was a psychopath who killed his wife because he thought she was cheating on him. Ben has no idea who he killed and is just glad that his wife was not in the car when he shot her. When the police leave the police station, Ben decides to kill himself by running into the river. The police try to arrest him, but Ben has a gun that he is carrying. Ben kills one of the policemen and escapes. The other police come and chase him down. They have no choice but to shoot Ben and put him in the back of a car. When they stop at a gas station, the police realize that they are stuck in the desert with no food and water. Ben runs into a store and steals some food and drinks some water from the fountain. He gets a ride to the police department where he meets up with the police chief (played great by Michael Madsen). He tells the chief that he murdered his wife and he wants to be tried as a murderer. The chief tells him that if he doesn't want to be a murderer, he should come up with a plan. Ben thinks about the plan, and they go to a place called the 'Stargate'. When they get there, they see a huge, metal door that looks like it should lead to a spaceship. They go inside the door and there are two Stargates that look like they are ready to go. They open the Stargates and they are taken to a planet called Anubis. Ben tells the police that he came up with an idea for a plan to escape and escape from the planet. The plan was to go through a worm

But this one had more to do with a bad joke. I was very excited about the story because it was a sequel to the very good The Rescuers Down Under, but it was still a bad film. The voice actors were great, but the music was terrible. The story was horrible, the acting was horrible and the story line was a complete mess. The only thing I liked about this movie was the song they used, it was called "I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings."
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________  "I hate the idea of being a woman in Hollywood" -Meryl Streep, 'The Devil Wears Prada'  The Devil's Advocate: A Movie about the Lawyer-Bitch Judge, Patricia Ranahan, from the Screenplay of 'The Blind Side' by Michael Lewis.  My review:  I read this in a group of eight women (two of whom were my close girlfriends, and a few who were not) and my reaction was, "What the fuck?!? This is a movie about a woman who is an advocate for women who are in the court of law? I can't believe this movie made it through." It is about Patricia Ranaghan, who has had a successful career as a lawyer. She is a great lawyer, but she has a terrible personality, and the movie makes it seem like she is just being a mean, aggressive woman. When she starts to work on a case for a woman, she thinks she has the right to do it. She knows that the woman is not guilty, but there are people who will try to twist this to say that she was too harsh on the woman. She has a good case, but in the end she decides not to take it, saying that she doesn't want to waste any time. She leaves the case, and when she is going to take the case again, her mother is found dead in the middle of the street. A few days later, she is called to her lawyer's office. The case is going badly, and she thinks that her mother's death was a result of her taking the case. ....  Now, I could write a long essay about how the movie portrayed women, how it is about how women are portrayed in the media, how Patricia Ranagh is portrayed as a woman with no sense of morality, how the women were portrayed as being stupid, etc. etc. but I will just say that it is very sexist. It is a film about a lawyer that is very aggressive, but not about women. I really don't understand why this movie was made.  the movie was a real disappointment, even if the first few minutes were quite good. , I really wanted to like this movie. I saw it with my friends, and it was great. I loved how it portrayed women in the movie, and how Patricia was a badass. I also really liked the way that the movie depicted men,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This movie was terrible." "It was a bad film. I would never watch it again." That's a bit harsh, but we'll see if it has any effect on my review. I'll admit that I thought this movie was interesting and had some funny parts, but it was still a mess of a movie. This movie is not worth watching, and if you are a fan of The Matrix or another Matrix movie, you will probably hate it. If you have never seen a Matrix movie or are not a big fan of the movies, you might want to skip this one and move on. "Well, it was a great idea. I can see it now, but at the time, I didn't think it would work." This movie is just a terrible mess, and it's the worst Matrix movie to date. It's a terrible movie, with terrible acting, terrible story, terrible plot, terrible effects, horrible action scenes, and worst of all, bad effects. I'm just sick and tired of this movie. It is a mess. If I didn' t like this movie, I wouldn't have given it four stars. The acting was bad and the acting is one of the things that makes this movie such a mess, but I can't blame the acting. The movie was poorly produced and there were a lot of errors made in the movie. I've seen worse. The worst part is that this movie doesn't really deserve the four stars that it got from me. I really don't care. This is just another Matrix rip-off movie, but for some reason I still love it. I guess I'm a sucker for bad movies. I mean, I was a sucker when I was young and I'm still a sucker. I give Matrix Reloaded four stars because I was at least entertained by it. It had a good plot, great acting, great effects, and a good story. I think I've just seen my favorite Matrix movie yet. Matrix Reloaded is definitely a great movie. The effects were fantastic, the plot was good, and the story was interesting. Matrix Revolutions is definitely one of my favorites. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. This was one of those movies that I loved the first time I watched it and it got me hooked on the Matrix. I loved this movie and I think that it will make a great Christmas movie. Matrix Reloaded:  My rating:  4/5

I really think that they needed to add a lot of action scenes, because they could have at least made it exciting. I am glad that I did not see it, because I don't think it is good. I think that the film is a bit more than an action movie, because there is a lot more to it. I would have liked to see more characters, because it is a short film, and there are not enough of them. I did like the movie and I would like to see a sequel, but I think it should be a bit longer, because the movie does not really end.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. _______________. ________________. ___________________________. ______________________________________. I hate when this happens to me. The guy I am with has been on this side of the aisle all his life and is very open minded and very thoughtful. I am a woman and he is a man so we have a very open conversation about everything. He was very kind to me and did not judge me because of my gender. The other night, he said that he was sick and he wanted to go see a movie. I told him that I would get him a refund. He said, "Well, I'll just sit here with you and watch a movie and you can just sit there and watch it with me." I just couldn't believe it! I told my husband about it. I asked him how he could let a guy take him to a movie when he has to sit there all the time with her. He told me that the guy just said that I can sit in my chair and I will just watch a film with him and we can just go to the bathroom together. I was so mad that he would let this guy take me to a film. I could not believe that this guy would let a woman go to a male friend's movie. It was a real turn off. I know that I should have told him to get off of me. I have to tell you, I am still mad. I will get over it. This is not how it should be. If you want to go to this movie, I will sit in the theatre and watch with you. Just tell me that you want a refund and I'll give it to you. But this guy should not be allowed to take me anywhere. He should be kicked out of the house. I mean, I could have done something. But I did not. I just want you to know that this happened to me tonight. This guy just took me to see a film that he wants to watch with his female friend. I think that this is a gross violation of my personal space. This happened in the middle of the day when no one was there to see it. It has taken a real toll on me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ My rating: **** 1/2 stars - the movie was terrible, but so are many movies about the mafia, it just got so ridiculous that the writing got more ridiculous. I have seen worse movies than this, but I've seen worse. And to the people who complain about how this movie was shot: please go to www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR1lYvKF8k0 and watch the first 40 seconds of this movie, then tell me you don't think it was shot in the wrong color. I mean, it wasn't shot in any color, but they shot it in such a way that everything looks like it was filmed in a color that is so close to being blue that the entire movie looks like some sort of color porn, and it's all blue and white, and they've got a guy who looks like a blue and yellow striped cartoon character with a mustache and a beard. And the director, you know, he has a mustache. And then he has two little kids in a house. I don't even know how to describe this movie. It's like they went and did the first half of the "Fatal Attraction" remake, and then they went back to the "Murder by Decree" version. If I were to tell you what the movie is about, you would think it's some kind of horror movie. And I can see where you're coming from. But the first scene of the movie, where this little kid has just been killed, and there's no one around him, and all of a sudden he looks at this old guy with a long white beard, and he looks like he's about to laugh and he's going to laugh, and the old guy looks at him and he says, "I think you're funny, kid." And the kid says, no, I don' t think so, old man. I think you look just like the rest of your family, old guy. And he says: No, no. You're not funny, you're just like your father, and you're going to die like your mother. And there's nothing funny about it. And they're just walking out of the house, and that's the last shot of this film. I've never seen anything like this. And you can't tell me it's not because it's an Italian movie. Because it's definitely a Italian movie, and I've been to Italy a

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ I was really looking forward to this movie, as the synopsis and trailer made it sound great. So when I got my tickets I got really excited, and I was not disappointed. The film starts off in a typical horror movie. The first scene starts off with a girl being raped and murdered. But, before the actual murder happens, a young man (I didn't realize until later that he was a kid) is being chased by a dog. It's all just so sad and terrible. The girl was so cute and innocent. She's being chased for no reason. And when the dog sees the young man he attacks him. Then, the girl comes back and screams, "He raped me! He raped me!" It was so shocking and horrible. But as the young guy tries to get away from the dog he gets bitten. He then realizes that he has a huge infection on his arm. It turns out that he is infected by a bug and that it's really deadly. He runs away and is covered in bug bites. Then a few scenes later, there is a shot of a girl and a young guy getting raped and killing each other. That's when the film really starts. The rape and murder scenes are really brutal and really disturbing. The way they show the young boy running away is a very realistic way of how the child would run away. The fact that the child is in a very small room, which is not very bright at all, makes it all the more scary. I would really recommend this film to people who are not afraid of violence. But I would never recommend it to kids, as it is a really disturbing film. The ending was pretty awesome and I would recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Is there anything more annoying than people who hate a movie just because it isn't perfect? I mean, it's the movie. You didn't like it because you hated the plot or you didn't get the ending. I've seen worse, but still. It's not like it was bad for the sake of being bad. It wasn't good because it was good. It was good because you liked the story, the characters, the plot, and you liked what the director did. It just so happened that that story and characters are exactly the same as the plot of the movie they hate.  I've seen other people make a movie where you hate it because of the plot. That's bullshit. If you hated a movie because it didn't have enough action and explosions, then that's a completely different story. If someone wants to hate a story because the characters suck, then go watch an action movie or watch a shitty romantic comedy. If they want to hate something because of a plot, then they should go watch a good drama or read a good book. And the only way that it can be a bad story is if the plot sucks. It doesn't matter if it's a good movie or not. You don't hate a good plot, you hate the bad plot.  "Oh, you love the story so much that you can't take a joke?" "Oh well, I don't give a shit. That movie sucked anyway." And that's it. That was the whole point of this blog. I hate bad plots. It has nothing to do with a good story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  *! *   * * * / *  / *   * * _____________________________________________________________________________________  The most common way to lose a job or a friend, is to be a snob. This is an old expression. And the truth is, I am a snobby person. But this is the time to put an end to it. If you really want to be good friends, then you have to learn how to respect others. This way you will not only help them get the job they really want, but also help them in life. I remember when I was a child I went with my parents to visit my grandparents in Spain. They had a beautiful home and a beautiful garden. But I could not help noticing that their home was more beautiful than the garden. This was not because they had a nicer house. It was because they were much more relaxed and peaceful. Their house was full of love and happiness. And this is what I love about them. And it is the same for me. The thing that makes a family happy is to live together in peace. And a family that lives together in happiness, is much more interesting and better.  So, why do we want to lose this happy family? I think that we do not understand what happiness really is. I mean, the reason why we get involved in relationships, is because we want the things that we love. But we are not happy about it. We love a beautiful woman. But the reason she was attractive to us, was because she was an angel. She was an incredible and pure soul. We were so happy that we decided to be with her. And then we discovered she was also cheating on us with her lover. We couldn't accept this and we got angry. But then we thought that maybe this is normal. That the love of a person is not just about what they have, but it is also about what you can give. And what we are talking about here is giving your happiness. The same way as the beautiful woman in Spain was giving us the love that we wanted. And we wanted to give her our happiness.    So how can we give happiness? First of all we need to think about what is really important to us. What is the greatest thing we can give to another person? Is it money? Is that what you want? I guess not. Maybe the thing that is really needed is

I would give it a 0 and then I'd say to my friends "Hey, I saw this movie, it was bad, go see something else." It was a bad, boring movie, but I liked it. I think it's just because I saw it so often that I saw something good in it. The story was boring. It was an "oh my god, it's a movie, so I'm just going to go along with it" story. It just didn't have much going for it. There was nothing that was particularly interesting or unique about it. In the end, it wasn't a very good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. This is a review of "Doom," the second film of the series of "Alien" films, and it's probably one of the worst films of the franchise. The production value of the film is, like the original "Alien," very poor, and the effects are laughable, especially the creature effects. This one also suffers from one of my favorite flaws in the series, the movie is so long that it starts to become boring. If you want a movie that is a little bit better than the original, this is probably the worst film in the franchise, although it is still entertaining.  A "horror" movie, "Dooom" tells the story of a group of students who are on their way home from a night of partying, and have crashed on the outskirts of a small town, when they encounter a mysterious creature, which is not a human. The creature is called the "Hooded One," and its origin is very mysterious. It's main weapon is the ability to create a "dark cloud," which is a thick mist that prevents its victims from seeing anything and makes them forget their surroundings. It can create an entire army of Hooded Ones, which it uses to take control of the town and turn it into a "haunted house." The film is very reminiscent of the "The Omen," which may be a bit of a coincidence, but I don't know, I like "The Exorcist" better. I found this film to be incredibly cheesy and cheap, which I found very unsettling. There are some genuinely disturbing scenes that have to be seen to be believed. It is also one of those movies that is so poorly edited that it's really hard to figure out what is going on. The sound is also terrible, and although there are some good scenes in this film, I don`t remember many of them. I felt the film could have been a lot better, but the ending left a bad taste in my mouth. This film was made for a low budget, so the visual effects are not as good as they could have possibly been. If this movie had been made for, say, $10 million, it would have been better, because there would have probably been a little more story, and maybe a bit more tension. There is no doubt that this movie was made by an amateurs, and therefore the quality is bad, but you don't see this in a lot of amateur movies, so I'm
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________  A bad movie is a movie you wish was better.  That's it, that's all that's left. A bad movie. If it were just one bad movie it wouldn't be a bad thing, but if it were a bunch of them, it would be a lot of bad movies.  and that's a lot to take in. If you've never watched an episode of MST3k, then this may seem like a daunting task. And if you've only watched a couple episodes, then it may seem a bit daunting. And even if you have seen all of the episodes, you may still not understand all of what's going on. , it is a film that is not very good. And it is not that bad. In fact, it's pretty good. It's just that it's not that good. But it is what it is. The story is about a woman named Karen, who is sent on a mission to kill an alien that has taken the form of a giant robot. When she gets to the robot, it attacks her and she has to fight it off. When Karen defeats the robot it says, "We will never defeat you. We can only defeat the world. The world can only be destroyed by you." Karen then turns into a robot herself and goes after the alien. When the robot says "It is all right," Karen turns back into a human and goes on to destroy the alien robot. In the end the alien is destroyed and Karen turns into the giant robot again. But before she turns back, she says, "…and then you will be destroyed." It's a pretty good story. It even has some good animation and the story was pretty good, especially the beginning. But there are a few problems with the story. The main one is that the story is really long. It is a 3 hour movie. The movie is really confusing to watch because the pacing is pretty slow and sometimes it feels like it is just dragging on. It also doesn't make any sense. Why is Karen so obsessed with the robot and what was going through her mind at the time? In the beginning she's trying to kill the robot. Why then does she turn back into the robot? Why doesn't she try to kill it again? Why is the robot so strong? Why does it only go after humans? All of these questions are never answered in the movie. It makes the story kind of incoherent. It

John Tyler | Episode #146 | Election College: United States Presidential Election History Play Direct Link Download 0 Minutes 13 Jul 2016 John Tyler was a man with very few friends. His father was in Congress and a big shot politician. His mother was a single mother who worked at the local diner. The only time Tyler was in a good mood was when he was hanging out with his father. He would ask about his political views and how his father was handling the presidency. But it was not a good time for him in terms of social standing and self-esteem. He was not good looking, he was a poor athlete, he had no friends, and his father didn't think highly of him. He had a hard time relating to his peers. He wasn't one to make friends easily and he did not know how to interact with women. His parents would occasionally bring him home from school and spend time together. He didn't know how he felt about his mother and father's relationship, but it did not make him happy. In fact, he thought his mother was too nice and that his father treated her better than he did. __________________ Leave us a review on iTunes - It really helps us out!! Email us at ElectionSchool@

Write a negative review about a bad movie: rst of all, don't let a bad review put you off of seeing this movie. The bad reviews were based on the fact that the movie is not a true depiction of the history. The movie was made by a man named Paul Schindler, who was a German-Jewish businessman and a friend of Hitler. The film is based on Schindlers life in the German-occupied parts of Europe during World War II, and it was released in 1943. Schindlers was a successful businessman and owner of the biggest grocery store in Germany and was very popular with the Germans. He was one of the people who helped to organize the first Nazi Party in the country. Hitler was also very fond of Schindles and was a big fan of his work. He liked to watch the movie Schindlestaff (The Nazi Party). He had Schindelers in his cabinet and he also made a film called Schindlehre (The Struggle). In the film, Schindels family is living in a house that was built for them by Hitler and the Nazis. The family was constantly having to do jobs for the Nazi's, and Hitler always paid for all of them. After the war, Schinder was charged with war crimes by the German government. He fled to London where he was arrested by the British and was sentenced to life in prison. Schinder's family was murdered by the Nazis and he was sent to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. During the movie, Schinders family is being transported from the camp to the camp hospital. During their journey they have to fight off the guards to survive. At the end of the movie when the movie ends, the movie says: "And the Jews did live. And the Nazis did die. And all because of Paul Schinder. But Paul Schinders life is still living. And we can all live." Now that's a movie that I can recommend to anyone! I highly recommend this movie to everyone. I hope that you will watch this movie if you are a fan of history and history fiction. You will love this movie!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Bully" is a very poor movie. The acting, the writing and the direction are so bad it's just sad to watch. If you want a bad action movie, this is the movie for you. The story line is so bad. It's really sad and hard to watch it. I mean, I know the story line was changed in the re-release of the film, but it's still pretty bad. I wish I could give this a 0 because of the acting and the story.   "BULLY" is the second film from director Michael Mann. This movie is based on the book "The Last Boy on Earth." The book is based off of a real life incident that happened in a high school. This is a story about a high profile football player that was accused of raping a 16 year old girl. This girl's family felt so bad for the girl that they filed a lawsuit against the football player. The victim in the lawsuit said that she had been forced to have sex with this football player because he was the only guy who would not punch her in the face. The family claimed that the football players father was a racist and this is why the mother did not let her daughter have any contact with the boy. After the rape allegations were made public, this football players family sued the girl's parents. In the end, the family was able to settle out of court. After a trial, the jury decided that the boy was guilty. However, a year after the rape, a former football player, who had been suspended for his involvement in the rape case, came forward and claimed that he did not rape the girl. The former player said that he was never suspended from the team because he had a relationship with the victim. The mother of the girl was so angry at the football star that she filed a defamation lawsuit against him. The boy's mother went to the media and claimed to the world that the girl made up the rape story. She said that the media would never believe her and her son. This was the first time that the victim's family made such a claim. The media went crazy with this story. The public was outraged that the family made a false claim. They demanded that the man who had assaulted her be arrested. The police department did not arrest him and the family went to court. The court ruled that he would be released on a personal recognizance bond. The woman said that
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ _________________ ___________ So I read the novelization for this movie years ago. This movie was written in 1984 and it was not very well done. I remember that they had a scene where Bruce Willis is hanging by a noose and he gets a kick out of it and it is one of the best scenes in the movie. This scene was shot in 1986. In the movie there was a little girl who was hanging by her hair and Bruce Willis just kicks her and makes her laugh. The scene was supposed to have been a little kid who was just a kid but Bruce Willis was just not in the mood and decided to kick her instead. This is a really bad scene in the film and I think it is because Bruce Willis had no idea how to act as a big movie star. Bruce Willis did not have a chance to act with a little child in his movies and the movie would have been much better if they just cut that scene and replaced it with a scene of Willis with his big brother. ______________________________ The movie has a lot of sex scenes. I did not find any good ones. This film has a nice ending. This was a good movie. I recommend it for a laugh and to see Bruce Willis in action. ____________________ Review by R.K. __________ Date: 02/14/05 Reviewed by: _________ Date: 2/07/05 Rating: 3/5  This movie is not as bad as I thought it would be. I don't have much to add. I didn't have the chance to go to see the movie in the theater because my friends and I had to do something else in the meantime. The movie was so much better in my mind than the book. _________________________________ ___________________________________ ______________________________________ ___________________________________________ _____________________________ _____________________ _______________________________________ _____________________________________ __________________________ __________________________________ ________________________ _____________________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ This movie is a complete disappointment. The special effects are very bad. The acting was so-so. The plot was terrible. The characters were very unlikable. The movie was really boring and boring. There was no excitement or anything. If you were hoping for a good "Indiana Jones" film, this was not it. And the special effects sucked.  Helpful bad movie. This movie was great, and the special effect was great. The only thing is that the special of this movie is so bad, the special was made by a bad artist. The effects in this movie were made by poor artist. So the movie is just a total disappointment. I don't know why they made this movie. Why they made it at all? They did it just to have some sort of special effect, but they failed and did it badly. They failed badly. I would never watch this movie again. I just don't think it's worth watching. It's so boring. The ending of this horrible movie was so bad. This is the worst Indiana Jones movie ever made. And this is my absolute favorite Indiana Jones film ever made, but I just can't recommend this movie at all. I hope they make a good sequel to this movie, and make the special good. I want to see the special again. And maybe I'll see this movie one day. But if you have to see this, don't watch this. It's really good, but... The special was really good. The best part was when the aliens are fighting the Nazis. They fight very well. The action was great and the fight was very cool. The Nazis fight really well. But the rest of the movie was just bad. I was just hoping for something great with a special. And it was just not that good. So this is the movie that I didn't like. I guess it's my first time seeing this movie... And it really wasn't that bad. But it was really bad. And that's what I didn 't like. But I didn' t like it. But you can't judge a movie by it's trailer. It doesn't tell you what this movie has to offer. It just tells you what it's going to be. I'll just give a synopsis for the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. ____________. _____.  That was a pretty bad movie. I didn't care for it at all. It wasn't bad. It was boring. I hated the ending. And I'm sure that this movie would've been more entertaining if the actors and actresses didn't have such horrible faces.   I think that I was expecting some kind of great story, but all I got was a bunch of people talking to each other about the past. I mean, it could've been interesting. It could've turned into a great movie. But I guess it was all just talk.   and it didn't feel like it was a real movie, even though it was supposed to be.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ (Wisely, you've only got a few minutes to do it.) I'm not a fan of the Star Wars prequels, but I think they're a good movie in their own right. The story is set during the first trilogy, and it follows Luke Skywalker as he searches for a way to destroy the Emperor, and eventually finds him. Luke doesn't get to see a whole lot of the Jedi, but they're good. I thought the special effects were good, and the special music score is great. The first half is very linear, and I think the second half is much more fun. There are a few funny lines, and some great action scenes, but nothing that will blow your mind. It's not a good picture by any means, but it's a good adventure. The prequel is the best part of the trilogy, but this one just didn't hit me. I don't think I'd recommend it, but if you can get it on DVD I think it's worth it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________. Please, please, please stop. Please. I hate this film so much. I've read all the reviews, and I've already watched it twice and both times I couldn't stand the movie. First time it was in a theatre. It was terrible. The second time I watched it in a movie house (yes, there are still movie houses, so I'm not an idiot). I didn't enjoy it either. And I hate that I can't give a better rating, because there are a lot of people who have enjoyed it and a lot who have hated it. The people who loved it have been sooooo sweet. And those who hated it? Well, you're welcome. I hope you never see this movie again.  I'm not really a horror movie person. I love gore and stuff like that. But I was surprised by how good this movie is. It is very well made. The characters are all interesting and you can really get attached to them. And the director is just a really good actor. He's great at making the audience think that he's not really acting and that it's really scary. So he can make you think he's crazy, but he's really just playing the part. I wish he could have done it in some other movie, because this movie has it all. I hope you enjoy this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ This is not a good movie and I don't think it has any redeeming qualities. If it had been made in any other genre it would have been a complete disaster. I'm sure it was made for a low budget and was shot cheaply. The acting was bad and the characters were too shallow to make any sense. The plot is a bit of a mess. There is no reason why there was a nuclear war. The US was trying to get a missile system in South America and it was discovered that they had nuclear missiles and they were attacking a US base. This was before the Cuban missile crisis, when the US didn't have missiles to defend South America. The reason for the missile launch was to punish the Soviets for bombing the US. The Russians were outraged that the US was attacking them in Afghanistan, and the Americans were angered because they wanted to use the missiles to get closer to the Soviets and thus gain a strategic advantage. The movie is full of plot holes and there are very few plot points that don't have a logical explanation. One of the most unbelievable plot points was that the CIA gave the nuclear launch codes to the President. The President was so scared of the Russians that he had to send in the Marines and the US Air Force. The Marines were told to attack the Russian base, but the US president was worried that the Russians would use the Marines as a diversion. This means that the President was a complete fool. The last third of the movie is a re-enactment of the nuclear war between the US and the Russians. The Americans used their nuclear missiles to destroy all the Russian bases and destroy their planes. The Soviets did not know that the missiles were headed their way and did not react in time to destroy them. The missile system crashed in a remote area of Alaska and the missiles broke up. All of the Soviet bases were destroyed and the Russian people were left in complete devastation. There are no survivors. It is only the US government that survived the nuclear holocaust. The main plot of the film is a story about how the Soviets are supposed to have sent their ships to Alaska. The film is filled with ridiculous plot holes. There were only 4 Soviet ships that were ever there. There was a total of only 10 Soviet troops in the movie. The only reason that the Soviets had ships was because the US Navy gave them nuclear missiles in exchange for the ships. The missiles were never fired because the Russians never attacked the US base that was attacked. The

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. I am going to be honest and admit it, I had no idea what to expect when I saw the trailer for this movie. It is set in a world where everything is controlled by the government, and there is no privacy. This movie is a political satire, but the characters do not have a political agenda. The only thing they want is money. This film is based on a true story, and has the feeling of a bad 90's movie. This is the first time I've seen a movie that I actually felt bad for. I think the director should be criticized for making the movie too politically incorrect for his audience. There are some good lines in this movie, but I think that most of the jokes are forced. Overall, this is a good movie that was poorly done.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst thing about the movie is how it's written. It starts off with a girl who has been dumped by her boyfriend and is on the hunt for a guy. I felt that this was not an interesting story and then she meets a guy that seems to have the same feelings for her and she goes with him. Then they get into an argument and he breaks up with her. This guy comes back and the story takes a completely different turn. He's a jerk and there are many things that are wrong with his character. It's a really boring movie and it has no tension. I was not impressed with this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ (How to be a human being) [UPDATED]  The review is now updated with a more complete and accurate review of the film.  This film was supposed to be the first in a trilogy about a young boy who is born without a soul, with no desire to live or to die, but his spirit, that which is purer than the other, is captured by the devil in order to save the world from itself. The film is filled with dark and depressing themes, with the most extreme of the many scenes involving the torture and murder of a child. The movie's production values are not as good as they could have been, but at the same time the production values in this movie are the worst possible. The music, as well as the sound effects, are terrible, and the acting is almost completely uninspired, especially from the actor who played the child, James Deen, who, at the end of the movie, has been transformed into a hideous creature with a blackened eye. The script is also very simplistic, with a great deal of pointless and pointless dialogue, and most of the action sequences are poorly done, being very slow and drawn out. The acting is also extremely bad, with James Deens' character, Jack the Devil, being particularly uninteresting. The cinematography in the movie is also not as well done as it could have, being much more grainy than what is supposed to represent a movie like this. The only redeeming thing about this film is the music by Kevin MacLeod, which is very unsettling and chilling, and which is also the reason why I kept watching this film, even though it was terrible. This is not a good film, but it is a good soundtrack. The DVD of this film was released in the U.S. in 2010, and is still available, as a bonus feature on the Blu-ray release.  the music of this movie is terrible. The only redeemable thing about it is the soundtrack by Kevin MacDonald.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ (if possible, I'm writing a review about an un-rated movie I watched but I feel bad enough to put it here instead of just not giving a star)  The Worst Movie I Ever Saw  This movie has no redeeming qualities. I'm so sorry, but the acting was so bad. Even though they are actors, the acting is so bad, they make a joke out of the actors. You can't take the time to get a hold of your emotions or anything. There are some funny moments, but it was just so bad that it makes you hate them even more. It was really hard to get through the movie because the dialogue was so slow.  As for the plot, it's very simple. The main character, Saito, is an elementary school teacher. The problem is that he is married to his student's mom, and his students, the twins, are his own children. The story is about his relationship with the twins. It makes you see that even though Saito may be a good teacher, he's still a bit of a pedophile.  is a very old-fashioned movie. The music is very slow and very creepy. The acting is bad, and the acting director doesn't seem to have any talent for acting. The movie is not very funny. The characters don't really make any sense. This is a terrible movie and it made me want to kill myself. It made me very sad. .

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________  The first part of the film is a collection of very short scenes, mostly featuring a few actors from previous productions, and the rest is pretty much a collection the film's characters, all of whom are introduced and introduced as well. The characters in this film have nothing to do, and that's what's the most infuriating about it. As an action movie, you would think that the character's names would be something to remember, and yet none of them are even in the film, and we don't even know who any of them is. This is really dumb, and you get the sense that the producers had no idea what they were doing when they were casting the movie. The first part is just a collection scenes of characters talking about stuff that happened a long time ago, so nothing is new, but it doesn't really matter because all of the characters are pretty much interchangeable. You could be introduced to all of them and have absolutely no relation to them. One character you can't help but like, and then the next one you just know you won't like. This movie is just very bland and repetitive. And while it is nice to see some old school movie, I really can't stand this film. The only redeeming quality of the movie is that it's actually a pretty good action movie in terms of it's choreography. ______________________________________________    So, the plot of this film is that a small group of people find themselves on a space station that is being attacked by aliens. After a group of marines are killed by a giant alien, they decide to take the fight to them, and they manage to destroy one of the alien's ships. They then have to go on a long journey, and eventually they decide that they want to find a planet that they can live on. Unfortunately for them, there is an enormous alien army, and when they land on the planet, it turns out that they're surrounded by huge alien cities. They have to fight their way through these cities and eventually get to the planet's core where they fight another massive alien army. It's a pretty standard story, and it's fairly action-packed as well, so it doesn the first half of the picture a little bit. Unfortunately, the story is not really good. The alien soldiers are very bland, and while there are some great fight scenes, they are very little in comparison to the rest of the scenes. The story doesn't have any sort of

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ Your rating: None Average: 3 ( 3 votes) Category: Action, Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy, Romance, Sci-Fi War, War on Terror, War On Drugs   War, War, is a 2009 movie that takes place in the early 21st century, where it is now illegal to own a gun, but there is a thriving black market for illegal guns. An undercover agent is assigned to go undercover in order to bust a gang that is smuggling guns.  If the movie had just been about the guns and guns being smuggled, it would have been an interesting action movie. The movie does a good job of getting the audience to think about the ramifications of gun ownership, as it takes place during a time where it would be legal to own any type of firearm, and is set in a world where guns are common. However, the movie takes a turn towards the end of the movie, and becomes a more serious story, which is a shame, because this movie was pretty good to start with. .

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________   This is not a bad film. It has a very simple story that doesn't have a lot of depth. It's pretty much just a few people, a gun, a plane crash, and the guy in the plane with the gun who is the hero. It really doesn't need a lot, but it's nice to see a man in a plane with a gun doing some pretty cool things. The acting is great. The director did a great job of telling the story. It wasn't too fast-paced, but you could still get lost in it. The only problem is that it seems like they are rushing through the film. The whole thing is just a little bit rushed. They could have easily made this into a trilogy instead. I'd watch that, but I can't imagine how that would go. I think this film could be better. I really think they could have made this more interesting. But the story is a good story. I don't know if I'd call it a bad one, but the ending is a bit of a letdown.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________  This movie was not bad. It's just that they messed up the ending. And the ending is the worst part of this movie. It was pretty much a complete mess. I don't know why they didn't go through with it. They would have had an extra $20 million to spend if they actually followed through with the ending and made it a good movie. I really don't see why they would try to end the movie with a "goodbye" but they ended it with a horrible, confusing, incoherent mess of a movie. They should have at least ended with "See you next year" or something to make it more like a real film. That way the fans of this show would at least be satisfied and would at the least see a movie that wasn't just another garbage film. I am disappointed in the film but not to the extent of not watching it. I guess the best way to end a good show is with a bad one. ____________________________________________________________________  I have to admit that this is one of my favorites. The characters were fun to watch. I was sad that they were not together. I felt that they should have made the movie about their relationship. I had hoped they would end it together. And I think they did a good job in that department. I'm a big fan of the original series, so I had a lot of fun watching this movie with the new cast. I have to say that the ending was pretty disappointing. It didn't feel like the end of the story. It felt like a half way point. I feel like it was supposed to have the characters back together. But I guess that was not going to happen because it felt too rushed and not finished. I will say that it's a really good movie that I would recommend to everyone who loves the original show.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really did not like this movie. I know, I know. It's a kids movie. But you have to admit that it's got a lot of bad jokes. It also has some of the most stupid lines of dialogue ever. My favorite line was, "This is a movie about two little guys who just want to watch a movie." That's like saying, "I just want some popcorn and a drink." If you have ever watched a movie like this, you'll know that this is a children's movie, not a serious movie. There's no substance to the plot. The kids are always doing stupid things. It has no real story. The story is really just there to provide some sort of excitement for the kids. The acting is bad, the music is bad and it's all over the place. If you're a fan of movies like this you might as well skip this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ If you liked it, then please rate it! If you didn't like it, please let me know why.  Helpful about the quality of the film: _____________________  The movie is interesting and worth watching, but there is a problem with the acting and the storyline. The actors did not act well. The dialogue is terrible and the acting is really bad. This movie is really dumb and stupid. It's a bad idea to have a movie like this, it really is not worth watching. The story is about a man named "Eddie" who is working on a construction site and he has a bad case of PTSD and is living in a mental hospital. He has a wife named "Greta", but she is dead and he wants to leave her. He meets an old man named Bill and he asks him to help him get rid of his wife. Bill does this and gets rid of Eddie's wife. Eddie decides to go back to the house and kill his wife, but he finds that she has a daughter named Lisa. Eddie wants to kill her because he thinks she killed his wife (which is not true). He gets the gun and shoots her in the head, but the bullets are too weak. He goes back to Bill's house and finds a bottle of wine and a knife. He is about to kill Bill, but Bill sees Eddie and runs away. Eddie gets back to Lisa's house but he doesn't find her. Eddie tries to kill himself by hanging himself, but his hangover is too strong and he dies. Lisa finds him and tells him that he is dead. She takes his gun and tries to defend herself. She has a lot of trouble killing Bill because he has killed Eddie before. He says to her, "I think this is your last chance." She tries to fight him, but all he does is shoot her and she dies. She gets a shotgun and kills Bill. She kills him and goes back home. She goes into her bedroom and looks at a picture of her and her daughter. She remembers that Eddie has killed her mother and tries not to remember that she is his mother.                 The plot of the movie is pretty much pointless. There is not much story here and all you get is the fact that Eddie killed his mother and wants revenge. The movie is boring and dumb.

The movie has no point at all, and the ending was rushed and made it even worse. It just ended in a cliffhanger. Second, I don't understand why they chose to have the villain turn into a robot, or the robot turn into the villain. I thought they would have ended it with them both being dead. Third, why was the android character in the hospital? It was like they made him an extra. And fourth, why did the villain die? I think they should have used the time machine for a better ending. I would not recommend this movie. I hope they remake it.

That's all the plot there is, and a bunch of people come down, and they try to kill Noah.  The actors in this movie are bad.  The director is terrible.   The script is horrible.  They are trying to make a movie about a boy who is in a coma and is going to heaven. What the heck is a coma?  The plot of this movie is all made up.  There are no real scenes in this film, the people are just there in a dream, and there is nothing happening in the movie.  This movie is bad, and I think the director should be ashamed of himself.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The movie has no plot. The actors are not great. The story is poorly told."  It's hard to know what to say here. I do know that it's not a bad film, but the story is not that good, and it does not hold together as a complete story.  It's just a mess, full of cliches and bad acting.  This movie was supposed to be about two young boys who go on a trip to visit a local farm.  It's a very typical family film, a nice one at that. The kids are friendly, the dad loves his daughter, and there's a lot of action and comedy.  One of the best parts about this movie is that it shows a family in a happy and positive way, and the kids are able to enjoy themselves.  However, this movie doesn't end with the kids being able to go home and enjoy their family.    It ends with them running away.  The next morning, they show up on a farm and are taken hostage.  We're told that they are the "good guys", but then we find out that they're really the bad guys.  They've kidnapped the father to take him away. They're not even the good guys anymore, they're just kidnappers.  These are children, they are going to be held hostage. That's not really a good ending.  But it was a good film, it was entertaining.  I really liked the actors in this movie, the kids were good, they were funny, and I liked how they played their characters.  This movie would be much better if the story had a better plot.  And if the kids had a more positive ending.   I'm not going to go too much into the film because I didn't really like it.  At least I liked it enough to recommend it, but I don't think I'd recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________ The Last Stand is a bad film. The only thing I can praise it for is that it doesn't look dated or old. This is a remake of a great movie with great acting, but it is just bad. I don't know if the film makers thought that a remake would fix the bad acting or they just wanted to do another "good" film. Either way, it is still a bad remake. The movie starts out great with an awesome opening scene. A soldier is driving down the road with his dog when he hits a deer. The dog is killed in the accident, but the soldier survives. He gets up and is about to leave, but a truck runs over him. He survives. This would be one of those "man survives a car crash" type stories, but instead, we get a bad guy who runs over the soldier. This movie is so bad it makes a great remake of the great movie "A Bridge Too Far". This bad guy is a man named Roy Hobbs. He is a tough guy who has never gotten along with anyone in his life. Hobbs is the guy who killed his girlfriend and then killed the other guy who tried to help her. He does all of this for a cash reward. When he finds out that his partner is the last one alive, he starts hunting them down. In the end, he has killed all of them except for one, who is the only survivor. The film is based on the book "A Perfect Murder" by Robert S. McBride, and the film was made in 1994. I had heard of this movie before because it was mentioned in the "Dead Pool" movie. This film is the same actor who played "The Terminator" in the movie "Terminator 2: Judgment Day". His character, "Roy Hobbs" is still in this movie. I think this movie was made by a couple of different directors. This guy has been working as a director since 1987, but this is the first time he has made a movie. There are several other directors in this film as well. This one is really bad. It is filled with bad acting, horrible plot twists, and bad CGI. The worst thing about this movie is the ending. When the movie ends, the bad guy turns around and says, "I'm going to be a hero!" Then he just shoots the last guy, who was a hero. I would have been happy if the bad guys had

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It was a little bit of a disappointment. It just was not the movie I expected it to be." A film about a young boy, who is a part of a big fight between his family and a band of gangsters. A little boy is left with an injured leg and a lot of scars from the fight. When he starts to recover, he is given a task by his mother, to go to a hospital to see if he is OK. He finds a boy there, who was injured and now his father has to help him. When they arrive, the doctor tells them that he must stay in the hospital for some time, but he can leave in an hour. He is told that he can take a walk outside the hospital to the street where he can find a woman to help his father. As they leave the hospital, a boy in the street comes up to them. They have to follow him, to find out if he was the boy who helped his father or a member of the gangsters who is trying to kill his family. It is a great film that has a very good cast. The plot is very well done and the action is really good. The special effects are a little shaky, but it makes up for it with the incredible action sequences. It was a very sad and tragic film, but really good at the same time. I am a huge fan of the 80's and 90's. The movies have a different charm and are really well made. It has the best soundtrack ever. I love the 80s. A boy with a lot to learn.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ The movie is so bad that the film is actually good! But the worst part of the movie is the music. The music is horrible! I mean, the music is so horrible. The movie was great but the music sucks! I'm not going to say anything else about this movie. But if you're into the 80's or 80's music, then this movie is for you! But you're going to get sick of this movie! The acting sucks, the characters are too stupid and there is so much violence. The violence is so stupid! Like, they were in a car and then they were shot at with a machine gun. That's not violence! It's stupidity! The film is so lame. The story is stupid! And then they have a bunch of stupid people running around and then one of them dies! Why would they shoot at this one guy when he is going to die? And then it's all about the ending! The ending is a total joke! They are all running around. They have to kill someone. The girl has to kill the boy. And then he is all like "I love you!" And then we have to watch a shot of him in a coffin! Why did they do that? They have a big coffin with a man in it! Why is the girl in a black dress with the boy in the coffin? Why are they both dressed up like that? Why does the girl have her dress on the other side of the coffin, but the boy doesn't? And it's a very stupid ending! I was sick of the ending of this film! There is no suspense. There is nothing happening. It's a stupid movie! If you want a movie with lots of action and some suspense, then I would suggest watching this. But don't watch this movie if you want to be scared. Don't watch the movie if this is your thing! But if this isn't your thing then watch this! This is the movie for people who love 80's and 90's music! I don't know why they even made this movie... I don' t know what was wrong with them. This movie sucks!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ If I've been following the movies like a drug addict, then I'm addicted to the movies of Ridley Scott. In all of his movies, he's made a living off of setting up a high bar for a film, and then smashing it. So for Scott to take on a script written by the brilliant Frank Darabont is nothing short of a miracle. For those of you who haven't seen the original film, the story is set in the early '70s, and follows a family that owns a motel in the middle of nowhere, and who are being terrorized by a group of psychopaths. It's like an amalgamation of the worst of the 70s, only way more interesting and twisted. Scott did a marvelous job with the film, making it almost unbearable for me to watch. His acting is fantastic, and his direction is masterful. He takes the audience on an emotional roller coaster of emotions, and the final confrontation between the family is pure nightmare fuel. I could go on, but the rest of the film is just as amazing. This is a movie that every director should watch, and anyone who enjoys the genre should see this. I would say that the only downside is that the film was shot on video, and is a bit rough around the edges. Still, I can't think of anything better than watching a movie on a small screen. Watch it. If you have any interest in the horror genre, or in the director's work in general, then you owe it to yourself to watch this film. _________________________________________________________________________________  1/2 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In a recent interview, the late Robert De Niro revealed that he was initially opposed to the script for Taxi Driver. He was concerned that it was too "penny dreadful" and too much about drug use. It's a fair assessment, but De Nirzio was ultimately right to reject the script, and not just because he was worried about how it would be received. The film would have been much more interesting if De Niello had allowed his actors to take some chances. Instead of following the archetypal Hollywood drug addict story, Taxi Driver has been interpreted as a meditation on the nature of addiction. It explores the relationship between two men who become addicted to their own addiction, and then attempt to find a way to let go of it. This theme is explored in the film in a much deeper and more profound way than we might have expected.  Actors John Cusack and Russell Crowe have been compared to each other in the press for a long time, and it's interesting that both of them have taken the lead roles in the same film. Crowe plays the role of a retired mobster who returns to New York after decades away and is unable to shake his addiction. Cusak's character is the opposite, a man whose life has been destroyed by his addiction to heroin. Cushman, Crowe, and Cusacks all had different experiences in their life, and their addiction took different forms. Cuscagner's was a drug that took hold of him so deeply that he lost all control of his life. It left him with a life of isolation, an inability to interact with other people, and a life where he never had a chance to live out his life without drugs. His life was ruined, and he became a recluse, only able to get the odd job at a diner. He lived like a reclUSE in his own home, a place where he had no contact with the world.  the man whose story is told in Taxi Driver, but who never seems to fully get to live it. Taxi Driver is about John Cushmans recovery from his addiction, but his life is not completely over. The drug addiction has left him in a sort of purgatory, where he is stuck between two realities. The first reality is a version of reality that is almost entirely based on his addiction and his life as a drug addict. The second reality is the version of the past that he wants to avoid
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ I don't know why this film is so bad. It is an entertaining film that does a good job of telling the story. There is some very clever acting and it shows. But there are some things about the film that are very wrong. The first thing that I found very wrong was the title. It should have been called "The Evils of Being a Good Father". That was a much better title. Then there are the things about this film that make me laugh and laugh. The guy with the mustache is really a great character. He is so good and funny. Then the girl who is supposed to be in love with him, the way she looks at him, and the way he says "I love you" are all wrong. And there is the way the girl talks about him. She says things like "I know you love me" or "You're a wonderful person." or "It must be hard being a good father". Then the dad and son are supposed to become a family. They should have gotten married and had a family together. I can't believe how dumb the parents were. And then there is a lot of talking about the devil. He has a huge beard and a long red cape and a black cape and he talks like a demon. I have heard about a lot people being possessed by demons. I don't think it is a demon that has possessed them, but I do think it may be the evil that they have been living with. Then at the end, when the father is trying to find his daughter and the son is trying so hard to find her, the father says "It has been a long time" and "I've been so lonely." I really don't get what they are talking about. And I know that the dad is really sad and wants to be with his daughter, but what is the point of having a movie called "It's been a LONG time since you've had a girl" if you have a daughter who doesn't want to be a girl? I think they should have gone back and made a movie about the father and his daughter. But then I think that they would have had to change the name of the movie to something like "It Has Been A LONG Time Since You've Had A Son". But then again I guess I would have liked to see them make a movie like "A Long Time Since Your Father Has Had A Boyfriend" instead of "It Was A LONG TIME Since Your

There are some gruesome scenes in the film, but they are well-timed to add drama to the story. The acting is very good, especially by the leading lady. There is also a small child in the movie. His name is Johnny, and he is played by a very nice young actor, Adam Brown. There's not much else to say, because the movie is a good one, but this was a good idea that didn't get out of hand. - May 16, 2005a good idea but not so good execution  Reviewer: josee-jones - favorite favorite favorite - May 13, 2005  Subject: Good movie but some scenes are too violent I liked this movie. It had some good lines. However, some of the scenes in this movie are not very good. They are in the middle of a war, and the people in this world are very violent. I think that some people are just too sensitive for this movie to be made. The movie should have been in a more appropriate setting, but that's just me. - 5/13/05  Overall: A good movie, good acting, good plot, but some parts are too bloody for me. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good horror movie. - 3/9/05
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. You are welcome. I am writing about this movie because I had to. If you're not a fan of the series, you might want to skip it. If this movie doesn't make you want to binge watch the entire series, I'm not sure what will. This movie is so bad that you'd have to be crazy to go see it. The movie is filled with such horrible acting, it's not even funny anymore. It's just awful. The characters were all so unlikable, even the bad guy. I felt sorry for them all, but they were the only ones left. The story was pretty boring and there were too many characters. It would have been better if they had cut out a few of them and just made a few good scenes. It was hard to believe that they could make a movie so bad, but somehow they did. I'd rather watch a shitty movie than watch a good movie. I hope the director and writer are both insane.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  I watched the movie last night with my dad, and it was awful. The script was bad, the acting was terrible, the music was bad. But my dad is a good listener, so I listened to the whole thing. Afterward, I sat down in front of the TV and watched the DVD for the 2nd time. I was so angry. I felt like I'd just been robbed. I could not get into the film. I don't even think my dad wanted to see it. We watched it, and we were both disappointed. I'll probably never see it again, and I'm sure my dad will, too.  Be a dick to people on the internet: _______  One time, a couple of years ago, I went on a date with a girl who was very shy, and the guy I was with said something really stupid about how girls don't like men who talk in front, or whatever. She said something mean to him and he just snapped. I had to tell him off. I just got pissed, and then he said something like "you know you can always tell a girl that". I was really upset and I told him that he didn't know how to react. I mean, he had no right to be mean to someone who'd just told him off, and that was it. He said he regretted what he'd said, but I didn't think it was really worth getting into. He was a really nice guy, but it didn't really go anywhere, so it wasn't worth it. I told her I was sorry, and she said that she felt bad for me. But then she didn't say anything about him, which was really weird. So I thought maybe she was mad at him. So then I got mad, and asked her how she could get mad at someone for what he said, and how could she get mad that he'd apologized, but didn't mean it. She just stared at me, so dumbfounded, and didn't have an answer for me at all. Then I left, feeling really shitty, and a little hurt. I didn the next day, and found out she'd been texting him all day. I asked her why she was doing it. "I'm so sorry, but he was just so mean." I told my dad that I really felt sorry for her, and he told me to just be careful. But I didn aint. I never
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would like to add this. I did not see this movie, but was told that the producers and cast did not know anything about the movie. They had never even read the script. So they came to a theater with a movie called "The Black Hole" and they put this movie in the middle of the screen and asked the audience to help them with the script, and they had to read it. They also asked us to make suggestions about what movie we liked in the movie theater, and we just said we liked "The Day the Earth Stood Still" (with Richard Dreyfuss) and we wanted to see it. The producers also said they didn't know that this movie was supposed to be about the Black Hole, so they tried to change it to make it about "The Space Jockey" (which they thought was a more popular movie than "The Earth is Still Stood still"). I think the director should have called the actors and had them read the movie to find out what they really thought about it. Then they could have made a different film, but they made a really bad one and the people who liked it are just not interested in going to the movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I was born in 1970 and never had a chance to see Star Wars. I've seen the movie on many occasions, but only with my parents. It wasn't until I was in my mid-twenties that I finally saw the movie. The film is the first Star Wars film I ever saw and it has the potential to be an epic. However, there is one thing that bugged me about the film, and that was the scene where Luke Skywalker talks about the Empire. I thought the scene was poorly done, because it was very poorly done. The scene starts out very well, with Luke talking about his father, and he even does a little speech about how his father was always looking out for him. The problem is that he doesn't actually say the words "Father". This would be fine if it wasn't for the fact that he repeats the phrase over and over again. When I first saw the scene, I thought, "This guy has no idea how to say a proper Father's name. He doesn't have any confidence, and his dialogue is filled with mistakes. He could have just said "father", or maybe even "mother". I think this is the worst dialogue in the entire film. It was annoying because I thought that he didn't know how to properly say "father". He's like a child, and this scene was like he didn"t know how.  - R.L.  the movie was alright it wasn"t that bad of a film, but it was really not as good as I had heard. It didn't make me want to see the rest of the films, I didn't care about the story or the characters. The only reason I saw it was because it came out on the 25th anniversary of the original.  to tell you the truth, i hated the movie for a while. it was just a huge disappointment. the dialogue was very bad, and the plot was very predictable.  for me, the only reason i went to see this movie was to see if it was the first in the series or not.    but, the truth is, this is not the first film in the saga. the movie starts off with a short prologue, before the main cast comes together. The plot of the film is pretty simple. Luke is an orphan, and is raised by the Jedi Order, and then is taken on a mission by Darth Vader to the planet Yavin 4.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ The movie is about a family who are forced to leave their farm in their home village and move to a new city in order to save the family farm. They are joined by their children who are all born in the city. They go to a big city with all the new things and excitement, but they soon realize that the city has some serious problems and problems that they are unaware of. They soon learn that this city is very dirty and dangerous. They start to think of ways of solving the problems in the country they are going to leave, but there is a man in their city who seems to have a solution to all their problems. The man and his children have a farm and the man is also a very successful businessman. He owns the largest company in the town and is very popular with the people of the city, but is also considered a tyrant and a very selfish person. This movie is a great example of how the media and people can make a bad film better than it actually is. There is nothing bad about the movie, but the movie does have some flaws. The movie starts off very fast and the film does not have a strong beginning or middle, but it does have a good ending. The film has a lot of humor, which is a good thing because this movie has a very heavy subject matter. I think this movie is the most realistic movie of all time. It has all the details and details that are needed to make a realistic movie. There are a few times when the movie is really slow, but these are not too serious and the slow scenes are used to make you think about the problem a little bit. There was also a scene where a woman who was pregnant with twins is attacked by a snake and killed by it. The snake gets her pregnant and then kills her in a horrific way. This scene is very hard to watch, but when the woman realizes that she is pregnant, she is a little upset and doesn't want to be a mother, but she does it anyway. The woman in the movie was a little more realistic than some of the other women in the film. She was a good role model for women. I thought this movie was very emotional and very dark. The main character is very evil and I think it is great that the movie shows the horrible things that this man has done. He is very well acted by a lot and his character is just as dark as the story of the movie. I really liked this movie. It is

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________   What a horrible movie. The acting was pretty awful. The characters were pretty boring. The movie was slow. It was pretty boring to watch.   There was a very short scene that was supposed to be some sort of flashback, but instead was just another scene of two people walking. I was just hoping that this scene was going to be more interesting.   and the ending of the movie was just ridiculous.  What was the point of the ending?  I just got bored.  of course the ending was ridiculous. but why did they need to end the movie in the way that it did? I guess this was supposed be a flashback to some sort. But why not just show the flashback at the beginning of the film?   I guess this movie should be renamed, "The Movie With No Ending."  Why was this movie so boring?   (I also noticed that the people who said that this movie was a great movie had a lot more reviews, but the reviewers were much more positive than the actual movie itself.)

I was happy to see the movie in black and white but not really expecting anything special. This movie is not really scary but I would say that the story is not that bad. I would really like to see a movie that is like "The Evil Dead" in which the character's are really interesting. There are many actors that I really like. The actors really do their job in the movie. I like the performances of the actors. This is a movie for everyone because it is not just scary and gruesome but it is funny and it is really enjoyable. There is something for everyone in this film. It is not only for kids, but it can be a great movie for adults. It will definitely keep you going through out the night. The movie is great to watch at night when you need some more horror. I hope you guys will enjoy this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Why do bad movies exist? Why does a bad writer exist? How do you make a bad script? Why do people want to watch bad movies? Why can't I watch bad TV shows? Why is bad acting so popular? Why are people so angry at the movies?  What a world! I can't believe this is the case. If you look at the movie industry today, you'll find the following trends:  - Movie directors get paid more for doing a bad job than a good job.  The bad movies are made by people who can't direct a good movie, because they don't have the skills, the passion, the desire to make a good film. They make movies that aren't even bad enough to be considered bad. In other words, the good movies are so popular that the bad movies have to be "brought back" in a big way. In this case, a movie studio pays a bunch of money to the director of a bad film. He will take a bunch more money and hire another group of people to make even more bad movies. Eventually, the bad directors get so lazy and uninspired that they'll start making good movies. In the end, they'll probably make a bunch less bad movies, and the audience will be disappointed again.  I'm not saying that good movies shouldn't be made. What I'm saying is that the only way to make good movies is to make lots of good movies, not to keep making bad ones. Bad movies are a huge waste of money and time. If the movies made by these directors were good enough, they wouldn't need to be made at all. But, since they aren't, they're still made, and it's still a huge expense. In addition, it's a huge risk for the audience to pay for a bad product. Why? Because they're paying money for something that they know won't be worth a thing. A movie with a good story, acting, music, and direction is usually a much better investment than a movie with no story, no acting, no music, no direction, and a bunch the bad actors in it.  the bad movie is not an expression of artistic genius. It's an expression (or a reaction) of the director's laziness. You've heard of the "Great American Novel" before. I'll use it to define a bad movies: a movie that has been poorly written and poorly acted, which is
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Your best friend  It is hard to get a negative movie reviewed and get it published on the internet. I have been trying to get an article about my movie "A Few Good Men" to be posted on the front page of the Hollywood Reporter. I was hoping to get it posted this month, but the Hollywood producers are dragging their feet on it. They are keeping the information from me. The movie is a true story and the actors are true. It has been so long since I have seen this movie, and it is so powerful to me. My movie "The Way We Were" has been nominated for 4 Oscars and my movie is in competition for the Academy Award for Best Picture. My book "A Most Wanted Man" is a great novel. I am very happy to be in the movie business. I think people will appreciate my movie and will want to see it. It is a good story, a true life story. My friends are waiting for me to be there to support me. It will be an emotional day. I want the people who have a negative opinion about my movies to know that I am doing this for them. I believe it is my right to tell my story. I know this is the last movie I will make. I will go out on a high note. I thank all of you for your support. God bless you.

(March 10)  The "Good Soldier" will be released on March 18, 2012, but it will be a few months before the movie will be shown at all, Ford said. The film will be distributed by Paramount Pictures, the studio behind "The Bourne Ultimatum," "Hancock," "R.I.P.D." and "J. Edgar." The studio has no plans to release the film before March 2013, Ford told the film trade magazine. : Ford's comments were published online in a Hollywood Reporter story about the upcoming movie "JFK," about the former president.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  A lot of the negative reviews that I read about the movie are so biased that they're insulting to the movie itself. In the end, I'm glad I went to see it. The movie is a big disappointment, but in all honesty, I was expecting something much worse. I'm disappointed that it's just as bad as I thought it would be. I wish the producers had spent more time on developing the story and less on getting the actors to act. The story and script is a mess. There are just so many things that I didn't understand in the movie. I know that there are some things in the script that I would have liked to have seen a bit more in the screenplay. I really didn't like the idea of having to go out to the desert and fight with animals in a desert. And that's a big stretch, considering that the movie was filmed in a very desert environment. But that was a problem with the movie, not with the actors. The actors were great in the desert. They didn't do the scenes justice. I liked the way that they played the role of Jack, but the movie as a whole left me with no feeling of warmth or sympathy. I can't even say that I liked their acting, since it was pretty bad. The one thing that I really liked about the script is the idea that the animals would come to you and beg you to feed them. I would love to have been given that kind of a story. I loved how the animals were able to talk to you, and I thought that the script was pretty good. I thought the script could have been improved. I didn´t get all the things that were in the book. But at least I could see the movie without being distracted by the bad parts. If you don't want to see a movie, or just want to go to a desert movie and have fun, I would recommend that you avoid this movie. The desert is one of the most beautiful places on earth. But in this movie, you'll be treated to a film that has so many flaws that it will probably take you a while to realize that it is a disaster.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ Reviewer: __________ Date: __________________ Rating: _______ (0 votes) _______________________________  The first thing you should know about "G.I. Jane" is that it is a movie about an aging girl. That's not a bad thing; there's nothing wrong with aging. The problem is that the movie makes it seem like she's just a little girl who is getting old and then one day she discovers she's in love with a younger man. It's an awkward transition, and it's one that gets progressively more painful as the movie goes on. "G-I-Jane" is a story about an old, gray, and balding girl who can't get over her feelings for a young man and is forced to find another way to connect with him. It doesn't matter if the two are friends or not. The way "G" tries to turn a teenage love story into a story of an aging, married woman trying to make sense of her feelings is a bit embarrassing. "The film doesn't really focus on how this is all happening, but instead spends the whole time focusing on the emotional struggles of the young woman," says John McTiernan, who was in "The Hunt for Red October" and the original "Terminator" movies.  Advertisement  "G. I. Jane," based on a story by Jane Alcorn, is a love story, but it's not the kind of love story that ends happily ever after. There are a few scenes of romance, but most of the time the movie's focus is on the awkwardness between the two characters. The two are just kind of standing around. They aren't talking. They're not laughing. They don't kiss. And it's because of this that they end up falling in love. There is a sense that there's something off about them, and that's why their relationship is a little difficult to understand. There's also a scene where they're talking about the two of them, but they're not talking to each other. They are talking about how they are going to make their love last, and the scenes that follow are very emotional, and I can't help but feel that this is a film that will be remembered as a bit of a disappointment. It certainly doesn't deserve a place in my list of the 10 worst movies of 1990.

I mean this movie is horrible and it has nothing to do with it being a remake. the reason why it is so bad is because the director did not want to make a good story. the only thing that he did was make this movie as bad as possible. I just think that the director got bored of making movies and thought he could make a really bad movie that nobody will like. He should have done something original. __________________________  __________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________   The film has the basic premise that a group of friends is traveling to Europe and there is a guy with a shotgun that is harassing them on their way. The movie was a disaster and the acting was terrible. The main actor did a lot of ridiculous things to make it even worse. The director tried to make the movie more funny by using a lot more comedic actors and it made it worse.   Overall, this movie is a train wreck that has nothing to do with it's premise and has no redeeming value. If you want to see a dumb comedy, then look at the movie, but don't waste your time or money on it.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________Don't buy this movie. Don't buy any of the sequels. This film is horrible and I don't want to see anything else about this franchise. This movie was made in 1996 when people were not aware of the fact that you can't change something if it was not made to start with. Donnie Darko was a horrible, poor adaptation of a great book. The actors all sucked, and the director was just trying to cash in on the popularity of the book. I'm not going to waste my time watching another one of these crap movies. If you want to watch a bad film, you should watch the first one: _________________The original movie was good, but this one is a disgrace to the original. I think that there are too many flaws in this movie to make it worthwhile. If I ever see this movie I will never watch it again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________   A great story, well told. The movie was really good and not too much of a story to take in. But it did the job of a "spare" movie to go to for those who wanted to watch something different.   I didn't enjoy it but not enough to really care too much. I will give it a 6 because it is a good movie.   The only reason it was a 5 instead of a 6 was because of the acting. The film did have a lot of acting and I was not really enjoying it.  , July 30, 2010  I really enjoyed this movie, and the cast was great. However, the story was a bit hard to follow.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________  If a movie is good, then it's good. If it's bad, then, well, it's a movie. If a movie can be bad, it can be good, too. The thing is, I think a lot of the time, a bad film is the worst way to watch a movie: it's like watching someone do the thing you'd never do. If you like a movie, you'll remember it. If the movie's good, you're just gonna remember it, and you won't remember anything else. It's a bad way to see a bad, bad movie. But, that's what it is. It doesn't mean it's any less good, because it's not. It means it's more likely to be remembered as a bad time than it is as a good time.  A good movie can leave you with a lot to think about and a lot on your mind, and that's exactly what a bad flick does. And, I don't think a good movie will make you remember a bad experience, because that's not the point. It would be more accurate to say that a good film will make me remember a good experience.  of that. 1. "The Lost World: Jurassic Park" (1993)  I mean, this movie is kind of a mess.  "The Island" and "The Incredibles" are a bit better, but still pretty poor films. The Lost World is the most poorly executed film in the history of film. It takes a lot for a movie to be this bad, but it does. If I were a kid and I had a friend who I'd seen this movie with, I'd probably get in trouble for that. But I don,t think that's a good way to remember a movie either. I'm not even sure that's how I would remember it if I were that age. I'd just think of it as a really bad movie that sucked. It'd be like saying "that movie was pretty cool." And I'm pretty sure that would make the experience less memorable than the movie itself.  the plot is pretty terrible, and there's a ton of confusing, convoluted scenes, but the characters aren't bad at all. It does feel like there's some bad writing in there, but I can't figure out where. There are some decent character moments. The characters have some nice chemistry and they have some interesting backstories. The

Write a negative review about a bad movie:           This film is an anti-feminist piece of work. It is a film in which we are given a series of women who are very strong, but are not strong enough to deal with the male-dominated world they live in. The men in this world are the ones who dominate the women, they are the men who have power over women, and the women in this film are nothing more than objects to be used and discarded. It's a story about a young girl who finds out she is a "bad girl" and how she must learn to accept her destiny and her new life in this harsh world.  The story is very predictable. We know the bad girl must have a boyfriend who is going to break her heart and ruin her life, and we know the "good girl" has to make the bad boy go away. There are no surprises. There is no fun or romance in this movie. It makes you feel like you are watching a soap opera, and there is absolutely no heart. There isn't even a character who is a strong woman. There just isn't any. The women just exist as objects to fulfill men's needs. The male characters are the good guys. There aren't any strong women in the film who are in the same world as the male characters. The only "bad" female character is the one who has to deal only with men. She doesn't have to deal directly with the men.  the "bad boy"  There is absolutely nothing interesting about this movie, and I mean nothing at all. This movie is just a sad, sad, depressing movie. I feel bad for anyone who actually watched this movie and gave it a chance. It made me want to vomit. I was in tears from the first scene and I didn't know what to do. The entire movie was just a very bad, depressing, depressing story about an unhappy woman. I can't stand watching movies about women who have to be nice and try to please men in order to survive. There was nothing at stake for me. I just wanted to go to sleep.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not that the movie is bad, it's that the film is terrible.  This movie is so bad, so bad it's good.  "Oh God, it was so fucking awful."  What are they talking about?  They were talking about how great this movie was.  And they said,  It's like, if you were to make a movie about a group of people who had a giant war in space and you had to make that movie for a million dollars, and you said, "Well, why don't we have them fighting over an old lady?"  And then you made it for a billion dollars, then you said to yourself,  "Okay, well, why do they fight over her?  What's the reason for that?"  So, in the end you end up with a movie that is terrible, but it's really, really bad.  It's not like they have an epic space war or anything like that,  but it is a movie where every fucking single thing in the movie you want to scream at,  and you can't help but to scream,  because it's just so fucking bad. It's so bad. You'll never ever watch this movie again.  That's the thing about this movie.  No one wants to watch this again. It is such a bad,  horrible movie. You know that in a movie,  if you go in there and you try to make it good, and it's so fucking stupid, and so badly made,  that it's a good thing when you watch it,   and then you go,  "I'll never watch this ever again."  That is why this movie is still being made and re-made.  Because people still watch it.  So it's always a good sign when a bad bad movie is being made, and then it gets a sequel.  This movie, however, was never meant to be a sequel to anything.  What it was meant to do, was to be just one terrible movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ The following review is based on the film, "The Room". The film is a terrible mess that tries to take away from the real horrors of the Holocaust and does not even come close. The Holocaust is a real tragedy, and the movie does not do anything to bring this into the foreground. If you're looking for a movie that will tell you about the Holocaust then look elsewhere, this movie is a joke. The director tries to hide the Holocaust in the story but fails miserably. The entire movie takes place in a room in a house that was used as a prison for the Jews. A Nazi is coming back to kill all the Jews, but he is stopped by two guys that are playing chess. After they play their game they say to the Nazi that he has to leave because he is playing against a girl and will not win. The Nazis then kill the two guys and go to get the girl. But there is no girl. The two guys are killed and the girl is murdered and taken to the camp. The movie then ends with a picture of a Jew being hanged by a noose and a picture the girl being hanged. The girl then cries out that she doesn't want to go with the Nazis because she wants to go to America. But the Nazi says he is going to kill her anyway. Then the Nazi's dog runs up to the girl and bites her. The Nazi is then taken away by the Jewish inmates and the woman says "we are going to have a party".

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. It does not get any worse than that. _________. The film is about a small-town girl named Mimi who is in love with a local high school student named Josh. Josh is a great guy and has everything that a girl like Mimi should want in a man: a bright future, good looks, good friends, etc. Mimi is only interested in Josh's friend, Jason, because she thinks that Jason is a bit of a pervert. She falls in love but doesn't know that she's in love until Jason confesses to her. So it's pretty much Mimi's first time, so she doesn't really know what she's doing, but she knows that she is in a real relationship and it's going to be a tough road. __________________. The movie has no humor, it's about love and being in love, but it has no romance and it doesn't show any real emotions on either side. The movie doesn't go anywhere. _____.

What about,  the fact that she does a lot of things that she's not supposed to do?  I thought that was interesting.   The fact that it was set in a black neighborhood and the people in it were not as happy as the ones in the movie. I was very upset by the fact that the movie took place in the ghetto.  It's a ghetto!  You don' want to know about the ghetto, do you?  It was a very long and boring movie.  I guess the thing is,   when you go see a movie,  the first thing you should see is the trailers.  You should see what the other people have to say about it before you even get to see the movie!   And I am telling you,  it was a terrible movie! I don't understand how people think that this is a good movie. You could have gone to a movie with this kind of story, and you could have left it with a good impression.  There are so many bad things in this movie. And it's not even about a woman!  The white man is the one who doesn't want a black man around.  He wants a white woman and that's all she wants.  She's just a slave to him.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  What's a good movie that nobody has seen: ____________________  ______________________________________________  I've heard a million times about how "you need to read the book before you watch the movie." And I thought that was a very good idea. But the book, "Tiger: The Legend of Lou Diamond Phillips," is about one of the worst baseball players ever, Lou Diamond Philips. And the movie is all about him, about his life, and how it was like that. He was an awful player. He didn't care. He played for the New York Yankees, and he was bad. He hit.300 in one year. He had a few homers. He stole 100 bases. But he was just awful. And I wanted to read about him before I saw the movie. But I couldn't find any of that stuff. I can't read about baseball. It's hard enough to find out about baseball, and then to find the guy that was actually good, and to see him play. But to see the whole thing through a sports lens was so hard. The sports aspect was really hard. Because, again, it was a sport. And in baseball, when you're a bad baseball player, you're called a bad ballplayer. And they don't talk about your personality or your history or what you've done in life. So you don't really know who you are. And Lou Diamond, he was a terrible person. He wasn't a nice guy. He just wanted to be the best, and you can't be the top. You can't do that. I mean, you can. But you can never be the number one. And you know, the Yankees were good. The Yankees had the best ballclub in baseball. So I was really disappointed. I really wanted to know more about Lou Diamond. I was hoping that I would get to know Lou Diamond before I watched the movie and get a better feel for him, and really get an idea of who he was.  How much did you like "Tigerman" and the movie:  _____________________  The movie was not good. It was not bad. It had a lot of good things about it. But it was not the movie that I expected.

They are both in love in spite of the fact that they are not allowed to be in love because they are too different. They make mistakes, but then they make them in spite.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love bad movies.  They are not for everybody but they are a wonderful diversion for the soul and are perfect for the weekend.  I really like bad movies!   The worst of the bad movies I've seen is a comedy called "Dirty Work" by William Holden, about a young girl who goes to work for a man that is very rich, but doesn't care for her.    She's supposed to work with him and make him rich.  She hates working with a man like that and is in love with a beautiful woman who is the maid of the house.  But the man is a bully and has a huge ego and a lot of pride and so the girl just has to work hard.  I found it funny.  The story is very short but it was very funny and very interesting.  Unfortunately, it has a bit of a cheesy ending and it was not a great movie.  This movie is worth seeing if you like bad bad movies, like I do.  If you are looking for a good comedy, try "Rocco and His Brothers" or "Million Dollar Baby" by John Hughes.  A friend of mine also likes "The Big Lebowski".  It's not a bad comedy.  My other favorite is "Funny Games".  I have seen the movie many times and have always enjoyed it.  It has great characters and is funny.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. That's what I said about this movie. I think the idea of this movie is brilliant. It's got a great idea and the execution is great. I loved it. However, I think it's one of those films that people have to watch a couple times to really appreciate it. But it was still a great film to see on the big screen. I know I enjoyed it and I would have to see it again. I would give this a 9/10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ I don't think it was a good idea to release this film in the first place. I've never understood the decision to release a movie this way. It is just plain terrible. The script is a mess and I don�t even think it made it onto the screen. This film is really only about the first 2-3 minutes of the movie. It was never going to make it onto any "Best of" lists. I really wanted to love this film, but all I could think about was the horrible script. I�m sorry, but it really is not worth the money to pay $3.99 to see this film. If you�re going to watch this film then I would recommend renting it from Vudu or something. The DVD version has a lot of scratches and bad audio quality. If your looking for a good film to watch on a Friday night then I suggest you buy a copy of "Halloween III: Season of the Witch". I think that is a better film. See it at your own risk.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "You'll never guess what happens next." A movie with so many problems it's like a bad book. This one is bad on every level. First of all, it's a story about a woman (played by Susan Sarandon) who is a prostitute. This is a common theme in movies, it usually doesn't make it to the screen. This movie has a very interesting take on the subject and the movie does a good job of getting you involved. However, the movie gets completely lost in its own world. There are so many characters that the movie has gone off the rails and become a bad comedy. I could give it a 10, but for me, it was just too much to handle. It had too much going on and I could see why some people hated it. This movie is not funny. There's a very small audience of people who actually like this movie and some of them, if they were smart, would have realized the movie wasn't going to be a hit. There are a lot of bad jokes in this movie, they just happen to be directed at the most stupid characters in the movie. I won't go into all of them but a lot have to do with the woman and a little about the male character. Some are pretty good and some are so bad they are almost funny. The movie is so stupid and bad that I am really glad there are so few people who like it. It's a sad thing to see a movie this bad on the big screen and I'm glad there aren't that many people who do.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It was a great film but the ending was the worst thing about it" 1.  "The Girl Who Played with Fire"  (1980) What is it about the title?  It's about the most horrible movie I've ever seen.  There was nothing about this film that was even remotely interesting.  2.    The Shining (1980)  If you're looking for a movie to show your children to get them to watch movies with their families (I was), this is the one to get.  In fact, if you're thinking about getting this movie for your children, you should probably stop reading this and go buy it for yourself.  This film is the pinnacle of bad movie making.  The entire movie was shot in one continuous take.  There are no scenes shot from different angles.  It's all one shot.  And if you thought that the film was bad, the ending is the worst part of it.  So, what did we get?  We got a girl who is trying to burn down a hotel.  No, seriously.  She is trying so hard to burn the hotel down that she actually does burn down the hotel. The hotel is then used as a burning pile of trash.  I don't know how anyone can think this is a good movie.  If I ever want my kids to watch a bad film with me, I would tell them to just turn the volume all the way up and have them listen to the soundtrack.  That way, they'll understand how bad it is.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* This movie is bad. There are some really bad jokes, some really horrible lines, and the acting is terrible. And that is the only way I can describe this movie. The plot was really stupid. A couple who want to get a divorce and go on a cruise get into an accident on a boat and die. Now the movie is about a couple who gets back together to get their revenge on the other person. The whole thing is really ridiculous. The main character is stupid and the girl is a dumb blonde. I mean seriously, who would want to spend a vacation with this character? The movie is over-rated and a bad watch.  Sean Paul - Slap Trap  by iPromote4Free  Reggae

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________.  This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It is a movie about a woman and her son who is a man, so this is how she views him. This movie is a total disaster. This is a real life story about a mother and her teenage son. The son is a boy, so the mother is going to try to force him to change his sex. This son is going through a lot, and he is in pain. The movie has no redeeming value. I cannot say anything positive about this movie because this movie is horrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: . ...!!!  "We are not in a movie," the girl said. "It's a movie."  The director looked over at the girl. "But that doesn't make it any less terrible," he said.  A year later, the girl's parents, the director and the actors of "Saving Mr. Banks" had a meeting at a diner in Hollywood. The director said to the actors, "You know, if you all get sick and die, we're gonna get rich. The whole deal."  "I knew that," one of the actors said. Then he turned to the director. "I don't care," the director said. He told the actors that if they didn't get sick, he wouldn't get rich either. "That's what he told me," the actor said. That's why you're here, I said. It's because I can't let you guys get sick.  the director: "But what about the children? They're the ones that will get sick." , the actors: "You don't think that the kids would get sick?" , director: (chuckling) "They'd be in the audience, right?" "He said that. I know he did. That was what he said." The actor turned to his friend. "If he told us that, he was probably right." A few months later, one of my friends was in the hospital with a kidney infection. A few hours later, he called me. He told me that when he was in pain, he knew the pain would pass. When he was able to eat, he didn't think about it. When the pain was bad, he thought about how it would pass, and how the pain of eating would be better than the pain from pain. I was angry with him. So the next time I was sick, I didn't want him to die. "I want you to get sick," I said, "so you can get rich." His friend had just died. I didn,t want him, too. The same thing happened with every other patient. The doctor would say, "I've tried everything," and then he would give me some medicine that made me feel good. He would then say, "You know," he would say "this medicine is so bad, you will probably die." He told

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is an awful, terrible, horrible movie, that has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. You are better off looking at a comic book or a picture book of some sort. The story is a complete disaster, with a script that makes absolutely no sense, with scenes that seem to take forever to actually play out, with characters that are uninteresting at best, and at worst, outright evil. The acting is awful as well, with most of the leads being uninteresting or completely non-existent, the worst being the main protagonist, Edward G. Robinson. He is so unlikable that I would rather watch someone like Christopher Reeve or Gene Hackman try to play him. This film is an insult to everyone who ever worked on this film, including the director, who clearly has no talent. This movie is a disaster, and it's only redeeming quality is that it's one of the worst of the 1980s, which is saying a lot. Don't waste your time with this movie, unless you are a child of the 80s.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________   On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being absolutely awful and 10 being absolutely perfect, how bad was the movie?   How bad was it? -5   -5 out of 10   I can't believe that I'm about to give this movie a 1, but then again, the only other movie I have ever seen that has this many "bad" and "good" points is "I'm Gonna Git You Sucka" and I still give it a 10, even though the writing and acting are bad.   It has an awesome cast that I love to death, from the two leads, Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt, to the rest of the cast. And it has the best music in the history of movies.  , and I loved this movie. I think it's one of the better films in the last few years. And this movie could have been a movie that could have gotten Oscar's and won Best Picture. If only they had gotten it right the first time. I would have given it a 9. However, the film is riddled with problems. The acting is horrible, the script is horrible (it was the first draft, the writer changed a lot, but the worst thing is that the film's pacing is way off. And I'm not sure if it was the script or the pacing, but it just kept getting better and better, and then at the end it ends with a cliffhanger. What the heck, people? I thought the movie was going to be so good! And you just want to end it. But noooo! It kept getting even better and worse and worse. And what a way to end a movie! Just... nooooo! Nooo! Nooooooo! You just wanna end it! And then you get an extra, extra, "finale" in there where... yeah, it's bad. But I guess it had to happen? And it's so weird that it was only the second time that I watched the movie. So I guess the movie is good? Yes. It's better than I thought it was going in, and better than it should have been. But it's still... not good. It doesn't have a story. It has an ending. And yet... I still liked it. I liked it because it had great music, great acting, great special effects, and great special moments. But not good enough. It just didn't
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really liked the original Alien and Alien 3 but the first two had a lot of problems.  The third movie was even worse than the two before it, so I didn't really give it a second thought. Â It was just a generic space horror with aliens and aliens being horrible.   This movie is about a scientist named Scott who gets captured by the aliens.  The thing about the third movie is that it had a really hard time making the audience care about the character.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________________________  1 out of 5 stars A really bad movie. The acting was bad and the acting was great, but the plot was horrible. This movie was made by a producer who never made a movie before. He had the idea to have a movie that would go against the bible and he tried to do so. He was a bad producer, he made a bad script. The whole movie was about a preacher who comes to America. This preacher has a mission and he is trying to preach to the people about the bible. He is preaching about how bad it is. He doesn't want to preach about the good stuff that God made. He only wants to preach against it. He tries to convince the people to turn to the bad stuff. The people are scared and don't want anything to do with him. Then he starts having a hard time and he loses his wife and child. He goes on a journey to find her. This whole movie just seems to be a horrible movie. It was terrible. The only reason why it is on here is because of the great acting. It is just a really bad thing.  2 out of 1 stars "I have a friend in the Army" This movie is a terrible, horrible, horrible movie with terrible acting and a story that is made to make you hate the military. The movie is about an Army soldier who is sent to Iraq to investigate what is going on. After his arrival, he finds that his unit is having problems with a local man named J.G. (that's what his name is) who is a member of the "Death Brigade" of the Iraqi army. J.g. is a nice guy who likes to give a good show when he's playing football. Jg. has a problem with J.F. and his gang who are constantly killing people. He also has a hard on for the Army because he believes that the Army is "the best" at fighting and has a good reason to believe that. I don't think that the movie made you hate anyone or anything but the movie does make you think that all soldiers are jerks. I wish that the film had been better written. , 4 out of 4 stars. The plot was just awful. I really thought that it was a really great story but it wasn't. It had all the makings of a movie to make us hate the soldiers and the army.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I was expecting more from a movie called "The Great Gatsby." It's a story about the rise of a fictionalized version of the Gatsbys, and the way they've managed to remain a myth even in the shadow of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel. What I got instead was a very thin story about two people and their love affair with the idea of the great Gats by being a great lover of the idea. I liked the fact that it's not just about the money, and that the movie was able to take the time to show the world of 1920s New York, which was very different than the one we're used to. I just didn't feel that it was done very well."  I'm not going to comment on the story or the acting, because it's just not that interesting. If you're really looking for a good movie with a good story, go for "Gatsby" instead.  And if you're a fan of the book and don't like the movie, then you can always watch the book for a much better version of that story. _____________________________________________________________________________

It wasn't until 1994 that a director by the name of Tom Shadyac got his hands on the rights to the book.  I believe that the book, titled The Art of the Screenplay, is actually the first movie that was actually based on a book. So it's interesting to see that the author, Tom Sharyac, was actually involved in the production of this movie.  This is also the movie where the movie industry changed the most.  We're going to be seeing the first real female star in a Hollywood movie.   The book actually had a huge impact on Hollywood as a whole.  It was a big hit in the 80s and I think that's why it wasn't released in the US until 1994.  There were a lot more big movies that were based on this book, including a movie called The Princess Bride, that had the same director.  The movie was a huge hit and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.  In 1996, there was a documentary on the making of The Princess Bride.  It's also interesting to note that this book was the inspiration for many of the movies that came out during the 80's.  Here is a list of some of the most famous movies based on The Art of the Screenplays:   Princess Bride - Robert Townsend WALL·E - Andy Weir The Princess Bride is based on the book by Tracy Hickman, originally written in 1980.

It was about an old guy who gets attacked by a bear, and he gets his head chopped off. I thought that was pretty cool. So I watched this movie with my dad when I was in elementary school. It seemed like a cool movie. I've been told that it is a classic, so that makes me a classic movie lover, right? Wrong. I watched it as a kid. I saw it with my friends. I still have it on my shelf, but I've watched a million other movies since then, and this is still the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting was awful, the story was dumb, and it was over long ago. I don't want to give it a bad rating, but it's pretty much the worst thing I've ever seen."  ____________________________________________________________________________  I think that this film has some of the worst acting I have seen in a movie. If this movie had been made in the 50's, I would be in the theater every time. The music is really not all that good either. The movie has a great story, but the acting is awful and it just makes me hate this movie. This movie will make you want to go on a murderous rampage or to try to commit suicide. I'm sorry, but this movie is terrible.  If you are looking for a really good horror movie, this is it. If you are a fan of the camp, this film is for you.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really enjoyed this movie but not so much for its story. It is a pretty typical zombie movie but it wasn't so much about the zombies and the virus. It was more about the characters. They are a bunch of college students who had to find a way to survive. They find a place where they can live in this zombie apocalypse. They have to try to find out who killed the last remaining doctor so they can use his blood to make a vaccine. This is not very original or unique but it was a fun little movie to watch. I recommend it if you are into zombie movies and want to see some zombies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Don't listen to people who are negative about a movie you've never seen. If you've seen a bad film, you've probably seen a lot worse. There is no such thing as bad movies. If someone tells you they've seen bad movies, they've never really seen a good one. There are bad movies and good movies, and you've just got to figure out what the heck it is that makes the good movies so good. And if you can't, that's OK, because it's a matter of perspective. I think the great directors in the world are not afraid to make movies that are very bad. If the directors are willing to make a movie that is so bad that it will scare people, they'll probably make a great movie. If they're willing to take a shot at making a movie so bad it will just seem like the worst movie ever made, they will probably make the best movie ever. It's all about what you're willing and what you can do with the material that you've got. So you never know what you'll find.

After the failure of The Last Dragon in 1980, the movie industry was in a bit of a funk. Hollywood studios were taking a lot of heat for the fact that The Last Warrior didn't have much of a budget. , directed by Steven Spielberg, had a budget of $6 million and a production value of only $4 million. The film's production was delayed for many months after the failure in 1980. It took five years to complete the film. The movie stars Clint Eastwood and George C. Scott as the lead characters. They had to fight an entire army of Chinese soldiers in order to get into the Forbidden City.  is a real mess. There are a lot wrong with this movie. In the movie, the Chinese soldiers wear green uniforms, but they are actually made of plastic and they look nothing like the real ones. The soldiers' helmets are made of a different material and they are painted a completely different color. The whole movie is like this. If you are expecting a great action movie, this movie is for you. This movie was originally supposed to be released in the 1980s but it never came out in theaters. The budget was so big that it had to be completely reworked. The production cost of this movie was around $7 million dollars and the film has a production time of 10 years. The plot of the movie is really dumb. The main character, Henry Fong, is a military commander in the US. He wants to invade China and kill the Communist leader, Chou En Lai. He also has a brother named "Shao" and a cousin named "Chi". Fong's army wants to attack China at night and sneak into the country without anyone knowing about it. Henry Fongs is not a very bright guy and he doesn't have a clue how to carry out this plan. The Chinese government is not too happy with this idea either. The US government wants to get involved in the war and to fight the Chinese forces. This is a war between two countries and both countries have a different set of laws. The United States has a law called the Arms

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________ The story: I have not seen this movie, so my thoughts are limited to the trailers, the poster and some quotes from the trailer. I'll try to summarize the movie as best as I can: it is an action movie with a female lead. We see this female lead in a number of different action sequences, some with guns and some with swords. The main character, the main villain is a woman, but we see her in many different situations. The movie starts out very violent, with a gun to the head of a guy. Then the movie changes pace and moves into the beginning of the film, showing us the female lead with a sword fighting and fighting the evil guys. There are a lot of blood and gore. We are treated to a lot more gore in this movie. There is a scene where we see a guy getting stabbed in the head with a knife, we see another guy getting beaten to death with a baseball bat, and a man being thrown off a roof. We also see a woman being hit by a car, another woman getting hit by an automobile and a woman getting thrown off an airplane, as well as several other scenes showing the bad guys getting their way. I think this movie would have been more effective if it was more violent, but it is still a good movie. I thought the female characters were pretty good and I thought it was an effective way to portray a female character in a fantasy/action movie. It is a pretty good movie overall. The ending of the movie is not good, but I thought they handled it well. Overall, a good action/fantasy movie.

It's a little too late for me to watch it now because it just didn't do it for me at the right time. The only thing I did like was when the camera was on the side of the guy and the other side was the side they were fighting.  And then when he came out and looked at the camera.  That's how he was acting all the time, just like a zombie or something.  He was a little bit creepy and creepy.  " It's very hard to watch because of the editing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It was a very, very bad movie." "It's a very bad, stupid movie."   You see what I mean? I'd really love to see a sequel to that movie because that's one of the most entertaining things I've seen in a long time.  This movie is very much a parody of what is popular on TV. The whole premise is "You can do whatever you want." The guys are doing their thing, but they don't care about their surroundings.  In a scene where the guys are in the mall, one of them gets a girl's phone number and calls her at 2:30 in the morning. I guess they just went to sleep in a hotel and didn't want to wake up to find that they'd been robbed.   They're also constantly making fun of their friends. The guys call their friends "faggots" and make fun of the guy's girlfriend.  They call one of their best friends "the fat guy".  They make fun, crude comments about each other's bodies.  The whole movie has this "I'm the boss, and I don't give a damn about anybody" attitude that they all seem to share. The movie also has the "I know I'm a loser" attitude of the guys in "Lethal Weapon". It also has a lot of bad dialogue. The lines are not even close to being funny.   I thought it was funny at first but the more I watched it, the more it made me angry.  The guys talk about their sexual preferences and the fact that they love anal sex.  Then there's the scene where one of his friends shows up at his house, and the guys make fun about him.  It was very offensive to me.  Another scene is when a woman at the party wants to have sex with the guys, but she's afraid that he might beat her up.  I felt bad for the girl and thought that it would have been better for her if she just didn't have sex. The guy in the scene doesn't think that he can take on a girl who is very strong, and he ends up being beaten up by her.    The girl in the movie is called "Slut".  It's very insulting to women who have a penis.   She's called a slut in every scene, and is often a "slut" when she's being a little more than what she should be
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________  The worst movie I have ever seen! A total train wreck. I am not even sure I am still alive. It was horrible! I did not understand the movie until a few hours later. I got the feeling that I had seen it before. The actor in it was really good. I guess he could have been in another movie. I really hate the whole movie. It should have never been made.  -JOE  (March 25, 2007)  I'm very disappointed in this movie. My boyfriend and I both got the same issue when we both saw it in the theater. We both thought that the guy was in love with his wife, and she left him. After we saw it a couple of times, I was convinced that it was a movie that had a very short run time. We were both very disappointed when we finished it. I don't know what I was thinking when I was watching it. It just made me want to cry. The movie just left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. It is just not worth the price of admission. I'm glad that it did not do well at the box office.  the whole cast of this movie was horrible. they were not even funny. they are just trying to be funny but it just came off very cheesy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________ ___________________________________________ 1) It's all too short. I enjoyed the film a lot and I hope it is as good for you as it is for me. The story is well paced and has some great dialogue, but it is over too quickly. It ends on a cliffhanger that leaves the audience wondering what will happen next. I think the movie should have lasted for another 5 or 6 minutes and I would have enjoyed it even more. I would also like to note that the director (John F. Johnson) had to wait about 6 years before his next movie, "Papillon." I think that was the best of his movies. 2) The music in the movie is great. However, the lyrics are not. I was very disappointed with the song. I know the song is supposed to be a song about a girl named Tilly, but when you listen to it you think it is about some girl called Tilly. It's not. It is just a really bad song. And if you listen it, you can see how the composer didn't really think about the lyrics. 3) I found the ending to be the best part of the movie. I loved the last 3 minutes and it made the movie even better. 4) This is a very good movie, but the movie could have been better if the music and the lyrics were better. It was a great movie, just not a great song. ___________________________________________________________  Rated 5 out of 5 by JGJ7 from GREAT MOVIE! This is one of my favorites! I have not seen any of the films from this franchise (the second and third), so I'm really enjoying it. The action is very fast paced and it is a great story. The only thing that I would add is that the ending wasn't as nice as it could have. It felt like a bit of a cheat. It didn't feel like the movie was done. But overall, I think it's great and a must see for all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "My first horror film. The only reason it got a R-rating was because of the sex scenes. I was scared for a minute when a girl with an ugly face is shot in the back of the head. I thought she was dead. I'm glad it's over." I was not scared, but I was a little disturbed. I didn't feel scared, though. I wasn't really expecting to see such a violent scene. I can't really think of any other horror movie with a sex scene.  It just makes sense. I guess the film was supposed to be about a serial killer, not a sex monster.  The serial killer is a "vampire" (a human with a vampire's blood).  This is the killer's lair.  The film has an odd style.  I found it very odd. I don't like the "horror" style of film. I found the film to be rather disturbing.   The acting is bad. The actors were not very convincing.  A lot of people complain about this movie, but it's not my favorite film from the '70s.  It's a little too strange for me. I have not seen any other films from the same time period that were so disturbing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ "Cinematic" (not "dramatic" or "movie", not "film", not a "movie") is an adjective used to describe movies that are made for and by the camera. You are not watching a movie being shown on the big screen, you are watching a scene of a movie. It's not the cinematography, the set design, or the acting that makes a movie cinematically good or bad. No, it is the camera itself that makes it a movie: the photographer, the lighting, the actors. But that doesn't mean that you don't want to see a good camera in a good movie. The good cameras don't make the bad movies; the bad cameras don the good movies. So, if you want to learn how to use a good cinematographer for your next movie, you should start with this one. ___________________________________________________ What is a good Cinematographer: The key to a good cameraman is not how well he can take good pictures, but how well his camera can take the right picture. He should know how to work with his camera, what settings it should use and how to set it up, and also how to change the settings. He needs to know how light, shadow, and color work, as well as how to get the most out of those things. The better the cinematographers understands the techniques and concepts of cinematography (both the technical and artistic) the better he will be able to tell a good story from a good picture. A good cinematography will not only tell a story, it will make the audience feel what the story is about. _________________________________________________________________________________ So, you want a good cinematic cinematogrph. You have a good idea of what you want your picture to be about and how you want it to look. You've got the equipment and the skills to get it done, and you're ready to start. The problem is, there are a lot of cinematographic cameramen out there, and it's a good job to have one. You need to know them. Here's how to learn. The first thing to do is to find one of them. This can be hard, but you need to do it. Find one cinematographical cameraman that is well-known and well-liked by people. A friend, a student, a teacher, a newspaper columnist, a professor, someone on a local talk show. Just find someone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What is wrong with you? It is not your fault, but the fault of the producers. When you want to make a movie you must not think about what you want it to be. It must not be about what the director thinks the movie should be. The movie must be about you. It has to be about your life. You must be the one who creates it, you must be in control. And when you are in control, when you know what you are doing, when your ideas are your own and you have control over your material, it is your film. That is what makes it great. You have to have faith. You can't rely on the director or anybody else to make your film good. You know what is going to happen, you know how to get the film made. If you have faith, if you have vision, then it is going be a great movie. If it is not, it will be a disaster. If the producers are afraid to make it, they are afraid of you. When a movie fails, it fails because the producer has the wrong ideas about what he wants the movie to be, he doesn't have the right ideas, or he has the right idea, but he doesn�t have the vision to make the movie. And if you think you have the wrong idea, then you can make a film about that. If what you do is right, then the movie will succeed. If, on the other hand, what you think is right is wrong, it won�t. That�s why a lot of people make movies about their lives. It is a chance for them to express what they think. When the director is right and you are wrong, the result is a disaster, and the result of the director being right is a success. That happens to a lot more movies than it should happen to. That means the directors are wrong and that the producers and the distributors are wrong. That's why the people who make movies are so upset about the fact that a movie might fail, because it makes them look stupid. They don�t know anything about movies. They only know about movies in Hollywood. They want to be Hollywood. And they don�T know anything, because they never have. They have no experience in movies. When they talk about movies, they talk in Hollywood terms. When we talk about Hollywood, we are talking about the movies. We are talking only about Hollywood. But if you talk about

I had heard good things about the movie and was looking forward to seeing it. It was one of those films that was so much more than the sum of its parts.  The story was really interesting and captivating. There was no action but you felt it and it kept you on your toes. The acting was top notch and really helped create a believable character. I can't say that there was much of a story but I found it interesting. I was fascinated by the whole plot, I would say it was a slow burn but it worked. I could see it all through my own eyes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________  "The problem with this film is that it's not about anything. It's just a movie about a guy named Billy. Billy has been in a car accident and has a broken leg. He's been in the hospital for a few days and is slowly getting better. He finds a guy called Mike and they decide to go out and get some alcohol. They go out to a bar and they are playing pool. Suddenly they find out that the guy they're playing pool with is actually an undercover cop who is going to give them a ride home. But Billy has a really weird memory. He thinks he remembers his sister's name. Then, the cops show up and take him away. Then he thinks that his sister is his girlfriend and he breaks up with her. He goes back to the bar and he goes to find her. But then he remembers she's his sister. Then they end up in the woods and it turns out that his memory is a bit more than just a bad dream. This movie is really a lot of things but it's about nothing. It is just a very boring story about a man who has a weird memory, a girlfriend who is actually his sister, and some really annoying police. It doesn't have any plot. It has no real characters. It just has this strange thing about a missing person who goes out and gets drunk. It was really disappointing because I really wanted to like this movie. It had all the elements I like in a movie: a cool car, a couple of bad guys, and a girl who can be your sister. It even had a pretty good soundtrack.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ Do you have a favorite bad movie? What is your favorite bad-movie-of-all-time?  The answer depends on who you ask. The first step in figuring out which movies are worth your time is to recognize what's good and what's bad about them. To be sure, there are many great movies that are not considered "bad" by critics, and there are also many bad movies that have good elements. So which are the best bad movies? The answer is: they're those movies that you don't think are bad because you don.t know they're bad. They just are. They are not "bad movies." You see, they have a sense of humor. They're not too serious. They don't have any political correctness. They aren't too silly. They've got some of the basic elements that you need in a movie to be entertaining and, in fact, to be very popular.  Here are some of my favorites:  1. The Blues Brothers (1980)  This movie has become almost mythical, but it's also pretty much true. It's the only movie that I've ever seen in which two brothers play a musical team in a bluegrass bar and then have to find a way to survive in a town that doesn't think they should exist. If you've never seen this movie, you have to see it. It will change your life. , written by: Paul Reubens, directed by: Bob Zmuda  2. Dead Poets Society (1989)  The film was so well received that it is widely considered to be one of the best movies ever made. The movie takes place in a world where everyone has a tragic story and everyone is constantly trying to find the meaning of their lives. So it's a comedy, but if you're a big comedy fan, you'll enjoy it. If not, then you'll probably enjoy it more if you like comedies about people who are always getting in trouble. It also has a great cast: Will Ferrell, Jim Carrey, John Cusack, Jeff Daniels, and Bill Murray.  (1994) , directed: John Waters, written: Michael Ondaatje  3. The Goonies (1985) .

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. This one was terrible, but the writing was so bad, that I was tempted to give it a pass. So, my review will not be as bad as the movie itself. This is a very old-school movie and I know it. I was born in 1977 and my mom bought this movie when I was about 6 or 7 years old. I'm not too sure how old my friends were, but my mom told me that they were about 15 years old at the time, and that they watched it a few times and hated it. My mom said that this movie was so "stupid" and "bad", that it would make your parents sick. I think that's exactly what it did. My friends and I hated this movie as much as my mom hated it, and we would ask our parents to watch it with us. The movie was made in 1981. The main character, "T.J.", was played by my mom's oldest daughter, Jessica. This movie was meant to be a parody of movies that were popular at the turn of the century, like "The Naked Gun" and others. This "bad" movie was supposed to be the ultimate example of this genre. I didn't understand why this movie got made. I saw this movie for the first time when I went to high school. I don't know if it was because my friends and myself were very into this movie, or if it had some other reason, but I just loved this movie. It was my favorite movie in the entire school year. I can remember my friends being all "Why does this movie have to be so bad? It's really good!" and I'm thinking, "Yeah, it is pretty bad, but it's not really that bad." I really thought that my friends liked this movie because it was made by the same studio as "The Sandlot" and the other popular movie that my high school friends watched: "Star Wars". I'm pretty sure that my parents would have been proud of me for liking this movie so much, because it wasn't really a "bad movie". This movie had a lot of action scenes, and was a good action movie. My favorite part of this movie is the opening scene, where my mom gets beaten by a bunch of kids. I loved how they did the scene. My parents never let me watch that movie again, but this movie definitely had some cool moments, like the fight scene in the movie "Predator"

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ Why? I have never hated a movie that much. ____________________________ So, I saw this movie a couple of years ago and had a great time. The story is not really that original. It is a movie about a guy who was given a magic book which would take him to the other side of the world, and he had to fight monsters and rescue a girl. I liked the movie. It had a lot of action, a lot good dialogue, and the story was pretty good. The movie also has a few "wtf moments". The movie was a bit slow at times, but it was still a good movie. If you like action movies and want to see some good ones then I would recommend this movie. I have not seen all of the other movies in the series, but this movie is pretty much the same as the rest.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________.  "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is a masterpiece. It is the quintessential film. The film has been talked about so much, but there is a lot that I don't like about the film. There are a lot of issues with the film, but what it does well is that it makes you think about the movies that came before it. In other words, it does not follow the formula of the film that has been done so many times before. It's the first true modern western, and it has a lot to say about the American west. In fact, it is a western that is about the west. So if you're looking for a western, or just a film that will keep you guessing and keep you on the edge of your seat, then "The Good The Bad and The Ugly", is a great film. It was nominated for three Oscars. In case you haven't seen it, let me give you the rundown of the plot of the movie. The Good, The Bad, and The "Ugly" follows a bounty hunter, Johnny Cash (played by Clint Eastwood) who is trying to get revenge for the death of his friend, Sam Briger (played with great emotion by John Wayne). After Briger's murder, Johnny is sent to track down the murderer who shot him. This is where things start to get a little weird. The plot of "The Ugly," is the same as the plot in "The Bad," but the plot is a little different in " The U,gly" It begins in Mexico and then goes to America where the U.S. is a frontier. The western theme is present throughout the entire movie. Johnny's journey is full of dangers and he is often alone. In a way, it reminds me of "Unforgiven." This is a film for the fans of westerns, but also those who like the classic westerns. This film is not as popular as "The Searchers," but if you like westerns and western themes, then it is worth the watch. The soundtrack of the western theme song, "The Man That Corrupted The West", is worth mentioning. In the movie, the song plays over and over again. If you're a fan of the classic Western theme song you'll love this film. "The Best of Clint Eastwoods" is the movie of the week for October 18, 2012. Check it out here. If I missed
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it's hard to make a bad film good.  It's hard. Â The problem is that I can't find many good films, and so when a bad one does happen, I can tell that it's a bad, bad movie.    The other problem is this: Â I've had my fair share of crappy movies.   I hate seeing the film in the theater.  "I hate the movie!"    "Why are you ruining my fun?"     "I am not going to be entertained by your film."   I don't mean that I hate it, I just think that the audience isn't really having fun.  And I'm not even a good audience.  I'm the worst.  This movie has been on my mind for a while, and I figured that if I could write about it and get some people to read it, maybe some people would find it useful.  For some reason, I've been thinking about the movie for about three years now.  What was it like?  It was a mess.  The first two hours are a mess, and they're not even in the same genre.  There's a lot of "drama" here, but it's all pretty predictable.  That's not the case with the first three hours.  It's a story about a man who has to kill his daughter.  He has a plan, and he's about to execute it.  They're just not going about it very smoothly.  But in the end, he can't go through with it.   What I mean by that is that the plot doesn't have any suspense.  At least, not any suspense that you can feel.  Maybe he's going to have a problem with the man who killed his daughter, and maybe he'll shoot him.  However, the plan he's got isn't working very well, and the only thing he can do is go through the motions and not really do anything to stop the man.  If he did, it would be really hard to not kill him.   The plot itself is also pretty predictable, but that's not to say that it doesn't be fun.   There are a lot more laughs in this movie than you'd expect.  You see some very funny moments, and even some tears.  Even the most cynical person might find this a little funny.  Then, you have the bad acting

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I have ever seen.  I have never seen anything so lame, so stupid, so cheesy, so cliche, so dumb and so stupid.  I've seen some really bad movies.   This one is not one of them.  The story is so bad.  It starts with a guy who is in a bar and is having a drink when a cop comes in and asks for the guy.  That's it.  He then goes on to tell the cop that the guy he was drinking with, who he didn't even know was a cop, was a rapist and he is going to come back with him to jail.  Now, this guy is a big guy, so he would have had to have done something to the cop to make him think he was a threat.  Also, why did the cop want to arrest the guy?  The guy was just having a beer.  And how did he even know the cop was going to be coming back with the rapist?  If he was so drunk, then why did he try to take the cop's gun out?  And why did all of this start in a public place, in a club, and not at home or in the office?   The only thing that I found funny about this movie was the guy that had to wear a hat and sunglasses.  I have never ever seen someone who needed sunglasses to be able to look cool.  This guy looks like he has a headache.  If this guy had a girlfriend, she would have to be very strong to even hold him up.  But seriously, how do they think this is a comedy?  I thought it was a comedy when I saw it.   What I thought was a bad idea when it was written was not funny when I actually watched it. I wish I could give this movie zero stars.  Please don't make a sequel.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________ A young couple and their friend head to the mountains to get away from the hustle and bustle of their suburban lives. As they get there, the couple and friend are caught up in a terrible car accident. The couple and a friend are both severely injured, and the friend dies on the way to the hospital. When the friend is found, a doctor has to try and revive him. After the friend's body is finally recovered, the doctor tries to get to the bottom of who caused the accident. His investigation turns up more than just the accident that killed him. This is the beginning of a very disturbing and unsettling tale of mystery and danger. _________________________________________________ (from IMDB) It was a cold, snowy night in December. Two women had just left a bar. They were headed for home when a white car came from behind and slammed into their vehicle. Both women were thrown into the air and their lives changed forever. One woman was trapped inside and was barely alive. She was pulled from the car and taken to the ER where she was pronounced dead. The other woman had a broken neck and was in a coma. The man was also taken to a hospital with a broken arm. The woman was in the hospital for over three months recovering from her injuries. The accident had a tremendous impact on both women. The women were separated for the next seven years. One had a husband, who would never come home again. The second woman became an alcoholic and would go to rehab a number of times. One day, the husband returned home from work. He found that his wife had been taken from his wife's bed and dumped on the floor. She had been sexually assaulted and stabbed in the back. She died in the process of being murdered. The wife's body was then thrown out of the window. The husband was taken into custody and was later released. He later sued the medical examiner who had performed the autopsy on the wife's corpse. The doctor testified that she died of a drug overdose and was never sexually assaulted. The judge agreed, and convicted him of first degree murder. He was sentenced to life in prison. ______________________ The film follows a detective and his wife, played by a great supporting cast. They go to a house in a very rural part of New York where they find a man (played by a very good actor in his early thirties) who claims he is a priest.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A couple of years ago I got an email from a guy in a foreign country with a beautiful young wife. He said he was going to the movies to meet her. I was surprised to see the name "Dirty Dancing" at the top of the email. I had never heard of it. He wrote that he had a "new job" that took him a lot of time away from his wife. The first night they went to the movie, I found out he was really into a porno movie. It was very disturbing for me. He had a friend with him, who had an earpiece. The friend sat in the front row. The guy who was in the porno showed up a few times and sat next to me. The porno had a lot to do with the woman's husband. When the couple walked out, the guy who had been in the movie looked at me and said "We got him, we got him." That was the last time I saw that man. He never came back to see me again. I did not meet his wife, but I believe he was murdered.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  "No, I don't like it"  What is the meaning of the phrase 'No,I don't really like it'?  To say that one does not really like something, or at least not very much.  Origin of the expression 'No no no no, I really like that movie'  The first reference to 'no no no nada' was in the 1920s. It was first heard in a song written by Charlie Chaplin and published in 1920, which is entitled 'A Little Piece of Heaven'.  In it, Chaplin describes how he once came across a dog on the side of the road who was obviously suffering. He stopped the car and took it home to feed it a bowl of milk, and then he let it sleep for a few hours before returning it to the side on the road. The next morning, the dog was dead. Chaplin was deeply disturbed by the death, and so he wrote the song to explain his feelings.  of course the dog had died from drinking milk, but that didn't make it any less of a tragedy. , I never get over the death of that dog. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really expecting a fun time with a great cast of actors, but the plot and the acting was very bad. This movie was so boring I could barely get into it. There was no humor in this movie, there was no fun, no action, just an overall lame movie. I'm a big fan of the series and loved this movie. So disappointed. I love the original series so I'm not surprised by how terrible this movie is. I'll say that the voice acting was awesome for the series, and the animation was really nice. I didn't really like the movie, but I'm still a fan of it so I'll give it a pass. Overall:

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********I would rate this a 3 if they could have just made the movie into a comedy instead of just doing a movie that made the worst movie ever. And I am sure that the studio is going to have to come out and apologize for that. If you have a problem with that, you're either a dumbass or a faggot. This movie is just not funny. The dialogue is too long and the plot is stupid. There are just too many plot holes. The director even has trouble keeping the plot straight. I am just going to list the biggest plot holes and let you guys figure it out. 1) When did the police catch the guy who shot the girl? They are at the police station in two different time periods and they do not catch him at all. 2) Why does the woman say she is not his wife? 3) Why is the guy so stupid? He should have known that the cops are not going to let him off with a slap on the wrist. 4) Why doesn't the guy go back and tell his parents? 5) Why did the woman stay with her boyfriend when he was going to kill himself? She didn't even let him get a condom because she thought he was in love with her. 6) Why didn't she tell her parents before he went to the police? I could go on and on, but you get the idea. You are watching a movie about a bunch of losers who get killed. This is not the way a real life person should go. If the movie were made into a movie, I would have a hard time watching it. But this is a bad film, and it is a shame that this is the way that they tried to make a film. I would like to see more originality from this director. I know they made the film for money, but this movie should have been done in black and white and had no music. There is a great soundtrack in this film, but it is all the same songs. I guess they were too lazy to do the background music. I will give it a 2.25 out of 5 stars.Read full review

"I think the only good thing about that movie is that the studio didn't have the nerve to try to sell it for less than it cost." - John Turturro.  the film is a complete clusterfuck. It's a mess of an entertaining film but the production value is completely and utterly ruined by the incompetent script. The characters are all stereotypical morons and the plot is nothing but a bunch of wacky jokes thrown together in a vain attempt to sell a movie. The only decent thing about the movie is the acting. There is a lot of funny stuff in it and it's always entertaining. The actors are all pretty good. But the script makes the film completely unfunny. It is basically a bunch that don't know how to act and just say the lines like it's a bad sitcom. The script is awful and the director should be fired. The film is completely awful and one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was like watching someone write a script and then make a film out of it. I don't even recommend watching this movie. If you like bad movies and people that don;t know how bad they are, then by all means go out and watch this.

The first time I saw the movie was at a friend's house. It was in the theater for a night screening, and the screen was so small that I thought the movie would go on forever. But I got the chance to see it again and I'm glad I did, because the plot is pretty lame and the special effects are laughable. The acting was weak. The plot doesn't make sense and it's not funny. If you're looking for a funny movie about a group of kids going to a high school reunion and have to watch a group on TV trying to kill each other, then look no further. I'm not a big fan of horror movies, and I had no fun watching this one.

They are the only survivors of a terrible hotel fire that almost took the lives of their parents. They find themselves in a dark room. There is no escape. They're trapped and they must fight for their lives. What is this? A horror movie? It has no horror. The people who are trapped are so cute and innocent.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________  If you want a movie to show your friends, make it a film with high production value. I saw this one and the movie was not even good. The movie had a bad story and actors who are not actors but actors who do not have any character. The actors are the ones who are doing this and do not want to do this because they are not doing the job. This movie did not have much humor in it, and when I watched this movie, I felt a bad feeling, a bad memory of when my father told me not to watch this movie. So I thought I should not watch this. I told my friend to watch it and my friend told me that he did not like it. So then I thought why should I watch a bad thing? The movie was about a boy who was trying to live a normal life but he does not want it because he has a mother who is trying to be a normal person. This was the first movie where I felt bad because I was thinking about my father, when I was watching this movie because it was not good. So, this movie is not good, but you can say that it is not bad. I did not see the movie because I do not like to see the people who have bad taste. This is not the best movie.

It was, after all, the book. I mean, if the movie is so bad, why did I bother to see it?" - Tom Hanks, author, "The Terminal Experiment" The film is a remake of the 1986 novel "The Transmigration of Timothy Archer," written by Dennis Lehane. The film was directed by Peter Weir (with Michael Cimino as producer) and stars Hanks as Tim Archer, an astronaut on a mission to Mars, where he discovers a mysterious spacecraft. He discovers that a group of "aliens" have landed on Earth. The aliens are led by a young woman named Tilly (Halle Berry) who has a magnetic bracelet that can "teleport" people. She is accompanied by two men, played by Lance Henriksen and Jason Lee. The alien leader, played in the film by Sam Neill, is revealed to be a brilliant scientist named Peter Venkman, played as the villain by James Spader. The plot of the film is the same as the book, but the story has been "remade" by director Peter Weir. Although the film takes place in a futuristic world, the characters are the same people from the book and the same places. The "Cinematic" part of the title refers to the fact that the film has a more stylized look and the "adaptation" of the story is a complete "re-do" of all the events in the book without changing a single line. The story takes place on a Mars-like planet with a large city on the surface and the city has "alien" architecture. The main character, Tim Archer (Hanks) has a reputation for being very intelligent, but he has a very bad attitude towards "civilization" and society. He is not a good student, he does not fit in at school, and he spends a lot of time in the laboratory. He also is obsessed with "magic" and has a strange, magical ability that enables him to "tele-port" anyone from one place to another. When Tim's "cousin" Peter (Lee) tells him about his alien friends, he is interested in helping them to return to Earth. He wants to become an astronaut. Tim has a lot in common
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  Please note that it is absolutely not a compliment to compare a movie to another movie or to mention something that happened in another movie. Please do not take this as an insult. I just wanted to make sure that everyone knows that I have seen a few bad movies, but not a lot. Please don't let that affect your judgment. It's just that I wanted to get that out in the open. I will add that I've seen some really good movies, so I don't think that the bad ones hold a candle to them.   It's a sad day when a movie that I loved is rated this bad. I don' t know what the rating is, but it is far too low. I hope that this movie is not made into a bad, trashy, stupid movie. It was great to see a real family who had nothing to do with the other characters in the movie. They really had some good moments.   The worst part of the movie is the dialogue. It is so cheesy and terrible. They said it was about the love of a mother for her children and it is not. It really is a movie about two children who are stuck together in a house, and it just made me feel bad for them. The other actors are so terrible. One of the parents was a bad actress. It wasn't a bad acting job, but I don;t think that she did her best work. I also felt bad for the mother, but she was so awful. The father, while not as bad as the mother was, was still bad. The way he spoke was awful. I really thought that he was supposed to be the evil father, but he just didn't have any of that evil. He didn't even have that mean attitude that was in the other parents. He just spoke like he was talking to a child. It makes me think that they tried to write a good story, but then it was too hard to make it work.  .    Overall, this is a really bad movie. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I was really surprised to find out that this was rated this low. It didn't seem like it was that bad to me. I have to say that I think that it was made for a little more money, but that doesn't mean that it isn't bad. It just doesn't look that great. I've never seen a movie with a poor acting, but this
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________  If you like your movies about vampires, vampires and more vampires, then you'll love this movie. It's not a good movie, but it's a good vampire movie.  As a huge fan of the film The Ring, I was excited for this movie as it is a vampire movie that also happens to be about a vampire hunter, or "vampire hunter" as we call them. The movie starts off in a very interesting way. We see an entire family (the Haines family) move into a new house, and a few days before the family is supposed to move in they get a call that someone is on the loose. The Hainses, being a very private family, have moved to the area of Los Angeles in hopes of hiding out. When they arrive at the house, they realize that someone else is already living there. The new family member is a young girl that has been raised by vampires since birth, and she is called "Lily".  The rest of the movie follows the Hainnes as they try to get to the bottom of this mystery. The vampire family have a problem, and their leader, the "Prince" wants Lily dead. They have to work with the local police and a "monster hunter" named "Klaus", to solve this mystery and hopefully get Lily back. I thought this movie was pretty good. It was interesting, creepy and a little bit creepy. The story wasn't very original but it still made me laugh. I'm not going to give this movie a 1 star because I really enjoyed it and thought it was a good idea. It may not be the best movie ever made but it was definitely worth watching. I gave this movie 4/5 stars.

The actors are so natural. -The Bad: The Bad:  ,, -A very old-fashioned ending, and one of the worst I've ever seen.

I've seen many great Hollywood movies, but this was by far my favorite, and if you haven't seen it yet, then you really should. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good story told well, with good acting.   *The movie was rated R for violence, profanity and some sexual content.     My rating: ______________ ______________________ _________  ______________  -Outstanding acting. It's one of those movies where you can tell the actors are really trying to do their best.  the movie does end with a twist (which is really just a very, very small part of the plot) which I did not like at all. The movie could have been much better, if the ending didn't turn so out of left field.   the movie is in black and white, but it's not so bad. I liked how the film felt like it was on a small scale.  , and I meant REALLY tried to put some depth and mystery into this story, and it really did work. It did get old when the movie got a little too formulaic and predictable. It could have gone either way. But it's a pretty solid movie, with an excellent ending, with some great acting, and good writing.   a very good movie, and a great ending. If you liked the movie, you'll like this one.   If you hated the movie: It's the same movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm going to call this movie a total bust, it is not a good movie, and I feel sorry for the director because the film is so bad, the story is so weak, the acting is bad, and it has a total bad taste in the end.  The story is a huge disappointment, we get the whole story about the man that is getting married to a woman that he barely knows, the couple is happy, everything is fine, until he gets drunk, and decides to sleep with the woman, and the woman starts to find out that he is cheating on her, and they break up.   After that, we never see this man again, he just goes to live with his brother, and his brother has the same job as him, he even has the exact same car.  This is what happens, we do get the story that the woman is mad at the man because she found out he was cheating on the woman she had fallen for, but he just wants to live a happy life and doesn't want to hurt anyone.  There is one scene in the movie where we see a woman getting her head smashed on the wall, it seems like she did it because of him.  The whole movie is a total mess.  Now you are probably thinking, "Well, I don't care if it was a bad film, this was the 80's, and everything was different".    But this was a very big deal in the 80s, people were getting married for the first time, there were a lot of new movies being made, and many people were starting to think about getting married.  In fact, there is a famous movie, the "I Love Lucy" series, about a marriage.  When this movie was made, marriage was very important, it was considered a big deal.  But in this movie, it doesn't make sense, the man and woman have no problems getting married, they don't even argue about getting a divorce, and even if they had a problem, they can go to a lawyer and it would be solved.  It's so bad that even the lawyers in the film don't seem to have a clue why they are getting divorced.  At the end of the movie, we see the two of them going to a wedding, and there are lots of people there, it looks like the couple has done this before, so everyone is cheering them on, and then it goes down in flames

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________ __________________________ The plot revolves around two characters: a young girl named Riz (Rila Fukushima) and a mysterious man named The Kid (Hiroshi Takayama). The Kid is a master of manipulation and has a strong hatred of the supernatural. However, when he is possessed by a spirit, he begins to realize that he is actually one of its victims. It was not a very well-thought-out plot that involved an excessive amount of supernatural elements. In addition, the story has a somewhat slow pace, as the characters are not given enough time to develop. In fact, the plot is not really important, but it does provide a nice atmosphere. The only part of the movie that did not seem to be well-done was the soundtrack. The songs were very generic and not very good. The cinematography was nice, though. The characters are interesting. The Kid has a very unique way of controlling the other characters. It's nice to see a man who can see the supernatural world through other people's eyes. The movie's final scene was interesting, as Riz was able to get out of the possession by the Kid. There was not much else to the movie, but I liked the idea of an adult who has psychic powers.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** A movie I was looking forward to for a long time was finally released in theatres in 2003. It has been so long since I have seen a film this good and so different. I never thought I would like a film with this much humor and this many different styles. This is a film that will not hold your hand and make you feel as if you are the one being funny. The humor is not meant to make you laugh, it is meant to have a certain shock value that will make you think. This film has been called an American Classic. It is. The film is not an American classic because it does not have a plot or a central character. Instead the film is about people that live in a small town. This town has a long history of bad deeds, murders, corruption, and even a supernatural event that happens to people and it is a town that people want to get out of. In order to do that they must get rid of the towns current mayor and in order to accomplish that they will need the help of a retired FBI Agent. There is a lot of history and a lot to look forward to. This movie does not rely on the traditional story telling of Hollywood. Instead it relies on how the film shows you the events through the eyes of those involved. The actors and actresses in this film do an amazing job. The cast is so well balanced and the roles they play are so different from each other. I have never seen so many different types of people playing the roles. From the sheriff to the mayor, from the priest to the mob boss, from a teacher to a preacher, from someone who is not supposed to be in the movie to someone who does not know what is happening, they all bring a different type of humor to the film. There are some characters that are a little too obvious. They seem too easy to write and too obvious of an audience can see them and it seems as if this is a way to get the film off the ground and then forget about it. But that is not the case. There was no way this movie could have gotten made without some of these characters. The movie is full of good ideas and well executed. The writing is good and it gets you laughing and also feeling as if there is something going on. The plot of the film was so good that it almost made it more interesting than the film itself. This isn't a bad thing. This kind of story telling is good for a lot more than just
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just another mediocre movie. The plot was boring, the acting was horrible and the ending was just a cheap joke.  But at least the story was interesting. _________________________________________________ The Best of the Worst - The Worst of the Best, Season 5 (2006) There are a lot of bad movies out there, but this was the worst of the worst. Â It was also the most violent and offensive.    This movie made me cringe so hard I nearly threw up.  The best part of the movie was the "The Worst of The Best" segment that showed what all the awful movies were about.  This segment included movies such as,  The Best Of The Worst,   Halloween,    The Shining,  &   The Terminator.  The best part about the Worst of  The Best of  the Worst segment was the cast was amazing and they really brought some variety to the list.  Some of the actors were great like Paul Sorvino, Jennifer Aniston, and Michael J. Fox.  It was fun to see the cast from some of the most terrible movies.  Another great part about this segment was how the writers made fun of some of these terrible movies and even made some references to them.  There were also some fun segments in the Worst  of the Best that were so over the top that they made the movie worse.  My favorite part of this segment is when the host said to the audience "We are gonna go through a lot tonight.  You have a choice:  To be part of     our   family, or   to be  _____  ."  I had to look it up and it is called "The Family" segment.  And he went on to talk about how the people who worked on the movies were very funny and funny characters.  But the best part was when he talked about the movie that he did for NBC called "Shakey Graves" and how the actor that played the main character was actually the director of this movie.  I am glad that the worst movie was filmed for TV, so I can watch it on tv!  If you like movies that are violent, offensive, and offensive this is not for you.  If you want to watch some really terrible movies this is definitely for you!  _____________________________________________________________ What Do You Do With a Vampire? - The

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ "I have seen most of the films on this list and this is the only one that is not a total trash."  A movie is bad when:  -The plot is bad.  –The acting is bad and the character designs are not creative. .    -If it had been released in a different time period, it would have been rated X.   This movie was produced during the late 1960's. The movie was about a man who goes through some life problems. He is a man with a great reputation who loves his wife and kids. The woman, who has just given birth to a baby girl, wants him to move to the desert to be with her. She is pregnant with another boy, who is already living in the desert with a father and a mother. I'm not sure if the movie is too early for it to be considered a bad film, but it's definitely not for me. I loved this movie. It was a little slow and it's not the best acting in the world, but this movie has great music. The scenes were amazing. It is a movie that you have to see if you have a passion for great music, and great acting.

I've seen it before and I was pretty sure it was crap but I didn't think I would be that much more bored than I already am. I don't really care about the plot so much, and I'm just sick of being bored, but this movie has so many flaws that it was a complete letdown. I have never seen this movie and I will be surprised if I ever see it again. I really don't care that much about the story and I don´t care about any of the characters in the movie. I didn´t get anything out of this movie, and it was just a waste of time and money. My recommendation to anyone who wants to see a movie, but just because it has a budget, doesn't mean that you should watch it. The movie had no plot and nothing was good. It was just boring. There is no need to watch this movie."  More

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This is a very, very poor movie."  If this is how you feel about a film, I would like to ask you what the hell you're watching.  This is one of those movies where you watch it, and then you have to read a comment section or two and then say "Man, that was just a terrible movie."   The plot of this movie is pretty simple, it's a police procedural.  "What about this story made you want to see the rest of it?"   There is no other plot.   I mean, this is the story of a police officer named David (Hans Zimmer) who's on the trail of a serial killer who's targeting the rich and famous.  This film is a lot like  The Departed, the first time I saw it, I loved it, but I'm not sure if I'll be seeing it again.  There are many similarities between this movie and The Departure, and it's really weird.  I can't remember the last time I liked a film that involved a serial murderer and a wealthy celebrity.  The acting is terrible, and the plot is a mess.  In a good film, this would be an action film, but this isn't, the director is just using the same old tropes.  So what makes this movie great?   This movie is so much better than it is, and I can definitely see why people like it so much, it just has the most amazing set pieces.  If you ever wanted to see a movie with a serial killing, but you don't like action films, then this is a great movie to watch.  It's also worth mentioning that this movie has some of the most beautiful music ever.  But I think what really made the movie great was the actors.  Hans Zimmer is just amazing in this movie, he's just like a different character than we've seen before.  What's even better is the fact that he's acting this way for the first movie.  You'll love him even more in this film.  Also, this movie was directed by Darren Aronofsky, who is probably one of the greatest directors to ever work on a film. "But he's a god."   I don't even want to talk about this movie's visuals, because that's not even the worst part about this film, it is the acting.  One of my favorite
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      This review is a critique of the movie: the plot, the acting, the direction, the characters, the setting, and the overall theme of the film. The movie is a movie for people who do not like horror movies. The story of this movie is about an ordinary person who suddenly finds himself in the middle of a series of paranormal events. The events involve murder, rape, and a strange green light. The people in the movie are all people that the person finds himself involved with in some way, shape, or form. Some of the people are normal people that are involved in some strange situation, some are the person's friends, and some are people that he is forced to have sex with. The character who is in charge of the situation is called the Ghostbuster. The main villain is called a Witch and her role is to prevent the people from ever finding out that there is a real paranormal phenomenon that is happening. The ghostbusters have been investigating the paranormal phenomenon for years. Some people do not believe that there are ghosts in the world, and that is why they are not interested in the ghostbusters. The witch wants to get rid of the ghostbuster, and when she finds out that he has been with someone else, she decides to kill him. This leads to a murder mystery where the people that live in the town are trying to figure out the reason why a man has been killed. The town is divided. Some believe that it is a person who has a very dark secret and who is going to bring something horrible into their lives. Others think that it has to do with a woman and she is trying to keep the ghost from being found. The woman is named Amy. The most memorable part of the story is when the ghostbusters are investigating a house. They come across a group of people who are being attacked by a giant spider. They get help from a young girl who is also being attacked. She tells them that there must be a way to destroy the spider. Amy is able to tell them where the spider is and that they can kill it with a ray gun. After finding the spider, they find out that it's a man that has been infected by a spider that was inside of him. The spider then kills the man and turns him into a spider. The Ghostbuster then finds out about this and is able use a chemical to turn him back

I'm not going to explain the plot of the movie because it's not interesting. The characters in the film are like cardboard cutouts, and I'm sure that some of the lines they say were made up.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ Do you want to see an example of how a bad Hollywood movie is made? I'll give you a hint. It's not in a good movie. If you've never seen it, or even heard of it, go and see it. Don't be put off by the title. There's a film about it. I can't remember what the title was. Maybe the one with the guy with the yellow hair and the white face. Anyway, this is a film by Frank Tashlin and it's about the assassination of President Kennedy. The director of the film is called Michael Anderson. He was a former member of the Secret Service. He has done many films, and he was the guy who shot Oswald. The problem with this film is that he doesn't get the story. He's trying to make this into a big conspiracy story, but the film isn't about conspiracy. It isn't even about the JFK assassination. He gets the story completely wrong. I've seen the film a few times, and it is a terrible film. It was never released on VHS, and only recently has it been put on DVD. It should never have been released at all. I don't think it is necessary for a person to see it, but it might be a good idea for a movie buff to watch it. There is a scene in the film that is very funny. The whole time I was watching it, I thought it was an anti-Kennedy film. If anyone says that they don't like this film, they don' t know what they are talking about. I'll let a few of the negative reviews speak for themselves: "I don't believe the movie is about the Kennedy assassination at all, but a film like this should not be released." "It was the most bizarre thing I've ever seen. The only thing that made me laugh was the whole conspiracy thing. I'm not even sure why they did it." "This film is nothing but a fake movie. It is all made up of lies and lies and there is nothing there at all." "I think this is the worst movie I have ever seen." "You have to see this movie to understand the Kennedy Assassination." "There is nothing in it. No one is killed. It shows the wrong thing, which is that the government shot Oswald." "Oh my God, this movie is an absolute disgrace! What a disgrace!" "This is a very bad movie, a disgusting movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________   If you're looking for a positive review on a bad flick, look no further. I can't remember the last time I saw a bad film. Even the worse ones aren't THAT bad. So you're telling me there are some good movies out there?   The movie is called "Moulin Rouge." I have seen the movie about a hundred times. I love the movie. But every time I see it, I get a little bit older and I feel like I'm going to see a whole new side of Moulin Rouge. The movie is an adaptation of a French ballet, and as you can see, the characters are more mature and less naive.   So I thought I'd see if I could find some good stuff about this movie. So I did. This is a review of the movie as I see the movie now.  , so I was looking for some good reviews about this film, and this one caught my eye. I'll do my best to summarize this movie for you.It's a romantic comedy. I don't know what to call it. It's a movie about an opera singer who has to work at a movie studio, and eventually ends up in a relationship with a guy she met in the studio. And it's a comedy. That's all I can say. But it has all of the things you'd expect from a romantic movie, like love triangles and sexy men. It has all the things a romantic would expect from it, except for the fact that the movie is a bit dark and the romantic leads are rather dull. But even with all that, I thought it was a good movie.It starts off pretty fast. We're introduced to some of the characters and their lives. We meet the guy who takes care of them. He's kind of a bossy character who treats them badly. The girl is pretty and has a pretty voice. She has a bad habit of falling in love with men who are mean to her. The guy who is the producer of the film is kind of the "nice guy" who is kind to the girls and treats them well. Then we get a bit more into the plot. It starts off a bit like a normal movie with the plot being like any other. We see the guys and girls being introduced to the producer and the singer, and then we go on to see how things develop from there. This film is basically about the guys trying to find love. The guys

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* I watched this and was appalled by it! It was horrible! The director was trying to make a film about the assassination of JFK and it came off like a complete cheap film. He shot this movie in 3 days, and the dialogue was terrible. I saw it when it came out, and it really didn't hold my attention for very long. He was so out of his mind when shooting this movie that I was scared to death, and I still think that it is a great piece of art. The acting was bad, but the script was bad! I'm glad I saw this film when it was released. ***********  What a rip-off! The plot of this film is so wrong and so stupid that it's not even funny. The characters are not real at all. The director made it sound like a real movie, but it's really just a complete waste of time. It was very boring to watch, but there are some good moments in the movie. It's a good idea to have a fake movie to play for an audience who have never seen a movie before, but this was just a big waste of money and time. I would never watch this again. ***************************

So she has him live in their house and then she keeps seeing other guys who are just guys, not the real thing. They all hate her and she can't stand them. Then, she gets a new man, who's a much better looking guy than him, and she is just so excited to get this guy. The guy is so nice and then the two of them go to a nice place and he does all the work, and they're all so happy together. Then she gets her period and she wants to keep going with him but she can no longer have sex. So the guy says to her "What do you mean you can't have sex? If you don't want it, it can't be with me." So she says "Okay, but don't make me feel like I'm a slut. I've already made the choice. I'm not going to change my mind." So he says "I'll give you a blowjob." The next thing she knows, she's being whipped by this guy and she starts crying. So they have sex and it's great. The next day, she comes in to the house and says "My husband has been really nice to me. He even gave me a massage. I was happy." She's so happy. She thinks they're going to be happy, and then they go to this nice restaurant. They are both so happy they can't believe it. Then the guy comes in and starts making her feel like she's a slut and he keeps saying things like "If you can do this for me, then you can have sex all day." So the whole time, the guy is doing all the dishes. The whole time he's being mean to her and telling her she's nothing. She is so hurt, and the guy starts hitting her in the face. So finally, she decides that she is not going back with him, so she goes back

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************* If you are going to give a movie a bad review, you should at least have a good reason why it's a bad film. ********* I would give the movie a 2 out of 10 if it weren't for the fact that it had to have been a lot easier than it turned out to be. The plot was predictable, the acting was good but the acting in this film was the worst I've ever seen and the acting here in particular was terrible. I can understand how they would try to show how easy it is to get in the CIA and that it's so easy to do anything, but they were making me believe it was a really difficult thing to get into and to get out of. The movie made me believe that the CIA is a big joke. ************** I found this film to be a very enjoyable comedy. The acting was so bad in this movie that it was hard to laugh, but the jokes were good. The characters were fun and entertaining. I think this movie has been rated much higher than it really is, but there are some good scenes here. I really enjoyed this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********  I have watched a bunch of bad movies, and this one is the worst. The plot was a joke. The actors, most of them, were just bad. This was an opportunity to have a great role for a good actor, but it was ruined. The movie was supposed to be about an FBI agent who goes on a case with an undercover cop to find the killer of a high school student. The undercover cop is killed in the first scene. He had been so good at this and had no clue he was going to be killed. The cop goes to the FBI and tells them he is an undercover, and they have him killed. Then the movie starts with him on a yacht. It was a very long boat ride. Then it shows the scene of the cop being killed. There is no explanation. No one says anything about it. There was no way to figure out what was going on. It didn't matter. I have to watch this movie again just to see the end of it. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I was just a little disappointed. I didn't expect a good movie from this. It really sucked. I had to watch it three times.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________________  "What is the secret of happiness? The answer is not to avoid unpleasant experiences, but to make the most of them."  ― Arthur Koestler  This film was so horrible, it made me sick. I'm not even kidding. I could not believe this movie. Not only was it poorly written and directed, it was also boring and dull. I have a few words for the writers and directors of this movie, and to the people involved in this film. You are just plain wrong. This is a movie that is about as good as it gets. It's a movie for kids, and it's a waste of a good movie. The characters are dull, the plot is stupid, the acting is not good, the music is not interesting, and the acting in this movie is so bad, you can't even believe it. The only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack. The music in this is so good, that I can't believe it's not by one of my favorite bands. The movie was so bad I felt I had to leave it. It is absolutely pathetic. This movie is just so bad that I'm surprised the producers did not make a sequel.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________   ____________   The movie has a bad ending, so you will hate me for writing this. This movie has been on my mind for a few weeks and I still don't like it. I watched it the day after it came out and I was not pleased. I was just thinking how can a movie be this bad? The acting was horrible, the plot was stupid, and it was all over the place. It was a big mistake to make a movie about a dog fighting ring. It makes it so much more of a horror film than it is.   I was also surprised by how poorly the film did with the kids. The children were too cute.   (I don't think that the kids were all bad. I think it was a bad idea to have the dog fight in the middle of a city.)   (The dog fight was a mistake too, and I wish the dog was the main character. They should have had a dog fight at a school. Then we could have seen the dog and the kids fight.)  .
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This movie is crap!" "This movie sucks!" "It was a dumb movie!" "I didn't even want to see it." "I just didn't like it!"  These are all reasonable statements.  But in this case, these are all wrong. _________ THE MOVIE This movie is a little bit different. ______________________________ It's the year 2025, and the world has been in a state of constant warfare since the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. ____________________ This is a world that has been ruled by the military for centuries. __________________________________ The world has become a very militaristic place, with many wars that have claimed millions of lives.    The military has become very powerful, with their control of the government, and are able to manipulate society at will.  This leads to a lot of discontent and rebellion, but most of the citizens are not able to do anything about it.  In this particular society, the government has become corrupt.  One of the main characters is a young man who is the only one who can stand up to the corrupt government.  He is the leader of a resistance movement.  The people of the country are able, and want, to rebel.  These are very interesting characters.  I like that the film has an international cast, with a lot more women than men.  They all have their own story and feelings about what is happening.  It's very interesting that these characters are not just heroes.  Even the villains are not perfect, and there are a few people who are very sympathetic.  As for the action, it is very good.  Lots of action, and I love it. There is a lot going on, and it keeps me on the edge of my seat.  If you like action, or want a good movie that you can watch at a leisurely pace, then this movie is for you.  You'll like it!  ______________ SPOILERS AHEAD I really don't know what to say about this movie, so I'm going to let you watch it.    ___________ SPOILER:   I was a little surprised that there wasn't more action in this movie.  Although I think it's a good idea for there to be more action, I felt like there was a lack of it.

I mean the actors are all so bad that they should not be allowed to do this. I can't believe these people got paid to do a movie like this. They should be ashamed. The movie should not have been made. You get all of the worst things you can possibly get out of a movie. The characters are all over the place. One of them even has the nerve to say the word "FUCK". There is no reason to go to a movie called "Jupiter Ascending" if you don't want to get fucked up. The only reason I went to the movie is because my friend told me it was a good movie. This movie has absolutely nothing going for it. I had no expectations, and I was so wrong. I could not believe this movie even existed. I hope someone at Warner Brothers sees this and decides to stop making terrible movies."
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ The Big Lebowski (1997) I have watched this movie more times than I can count. It is a classic. I have also seen it in a variety of formats. It has always been the most enjoyable. This version is the one that is most easily accessible. I will also say that it has the most fun scenes. There is one scene in particular that I will never forget. It was the last scene of the movie and there was a man in a chair and I knew that he was going to die. This is how I got into it. He was having a bad day. He just wanted to get home and get a beer. He is a truck driver and he is going to miss his wife. He has been having a rough day and has been waiting for hours. This guy was having one of the worst days of his life. He goes to a bar to find a drink. He sees a guy there and says hi to him. The guy turns him down. The man then walks out and says he is a cop. The cop tells him to get out of the bar and that if he doesn't get out he will arrest him. He does. I always thought it was really funny that they showed the cop as being so mean and then the guy just walks out of there. He walks to his truck and then it ends. I guess they couldn't make him die that quickly. ____________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________ The Great Escape (1963) This is the movie that I had to see with my friends when I was in college. It gave me an insight into the times that were to come. It showed the world through the eyes of the people who lived through it. It made the events of the war really seem like they were happening in a small town in the United States. I really love this movie. I just wish it was better. ______________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________ Back to the Future (1985) I loved this movie and loved it so much I have seen it many times. I also like that it is a great science fiction movie. The fact that they are in time and space just makes it all so much more real. I love that the film is set in the future. It really makes it seem like it is really happening. I think the film has a great soundtrack. The song "All The Way" is a very nice piece of music that really helps set the mood of the scene. _________________ _____________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ***********  The movie is okay but the ending is ridiculous.  Rating:  5/5  Don't be a douchebag! I hope this movie doesn't become a cult classic like The Dark Knight or any other movies with bad endings. If you're going to give a bad ending to a movie, just make sure that you do it in the right way, otherwise it's just going to be annoying. If it was just a bad end then it wouldn't be so bad. However, this movie is so poorly written that it feels like the movie didn't have any direction to it. The entire movie is like this. I know it's not a bad thing to make a movie that's just a bunch of random stuff that happens to someone. However when the movie tries to do so by writing a bad bad ending, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ I'm sure that if you watch the movie you would not like it but if you want to watch it again, don't, you will hate it. It's a bad and very short movie, about a good guy, and a bad guy. They meet in a casino, and after a few drinks they play a game to see who's better. The bad guy wins and he leaves the guy to die, and the good guy saves the guy and saves his life. The good guy is a "bad guy" but in his way he is a hero. ______________________________  I'm not sure why the movie was rated PG-13. This movie was a disaster from start to finish. I mean, it was bad. But it was a terrible movie. It was not only a disaster in every sense of the word, it also had some of the worst acting I've ever seen. The director made it very hard for the actors to get the right performances. I'm not going to lie, I really wanted to see the movie. The trailers did sell it to me. But I don't recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: **********"It is very difficult to write a bad review about the movies. I think this is the worst film I've seen in the last 15 years. It is so bad that it's almost a crime. It was bad enough to make a movie about it, and I'm not sure I'll ever see it again. You see, this movie is so terrible, that it makes me want to be sick. And I'm still not sure if it's worse than the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie has to be one of the worst movies I've had the misfortune of watching, but at the same time, it's so bad, I just want to vomit. There is nothing about this movie that I don't dislike. I mean, I would love to be on the set of this movie so bad I would never want to see anything about it again, but there is no way I'm ever going to get that opportunity. If I did, I bet it would be so awful that I would hate it as much as I hate this movie. It's so gross and so bad it is impossible for me to give it any rating other than one star. This is the most offensive, offensive, gross, and worst movie ever made. " -Tyrone D. White, The Examiner, July 22, 1991  "This film is so offensive it's not even funny.

After a few drinks, they decide to head for the airport and get on the plane to Los Angeles. While getting on the bus, they have an argument, and after a heated exchange, they end up getting into a fight, where the man wins. He goes to the airport to confront the man, but it's too late; the man is already on the flight. The man gets off the plane, and on the way home, his wife is murdered. The next day, the two young friends go to a bar to try to sort out their lives. One of them, the guy who won the fight, comes up with the idea of robbing a bank. However, as the two go into the bank, the manager and a bunch of police officers, come out and start shooting at them. The two boys survive the gunfire, but not without some damage. As the police pull away, they shoot one of the men in the back, and they are then apprehended by the police. The other man is shot by the policemen as well. The guy in the front seat was killed, and the other guy was taken to the hospital. He was dead for days, and his family was left to deal with the funeral costs. The cops then release the two guys, and say that they would like to speak with them again, but only if they get the money. The owner of the bank is going to pay them the money, but as they get off the bus and are walking to the bank with the money in their hands, the driver of the bus is stopped by the cops. The cop tells the guy in front of him that he needs to get off his bus because he is a suspect in the bank robbery, and that he will shoot him if he doesn't get off. The driver refuses, and is then shot dead. The guys then walk into the banking, and as the cops try to arrest them, one of them shoots a policeman in the leg. The three then make their way to the police station, where they are told to wait. After about an hour
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ Do you like horror movies? If so, then you might like this movie. It is an old film from the 70's and the actors were not very good, but the movie has the atmosphere of a scary movie. The director and writer of the movie is a big influence of Stephen King. The movie was filmed in 1976 in Los Angeles and it is the last of the King movies to be filmed in Los Angles. This movie has a good story, but it does not have any suspense and it could have been better. The actors played by Paul Muni, James L. Brooks and Michael Caine are all good actors, but they are not very convincing. This is the first of a trilogy and I would not recommend this movie for a first-time viewer.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________ 1.0 - No, it's a great movie! 2.0- It's not bad, but it's just a little too long for a movie like this. 3.0 – Very well done, the plot is good and the characters are good. 3 stars - The movie is awesome and I'd love to see it in a theater near me. The soundtrack is awesome too! __________________________________________________________ A film of this magnitude deserves an article that tells how it was made. If you want to know what it was like to make a movie this big, you should watch the documentary called 'The Making of Star Trek: The Motion Picture'. It will give you an inside look at the movie. I've only seen a small part of the documentary and I can tell you that the story is a lot more complex than the movie makes it seem. _________________________________________________ So I've read the 'Star Trek Movie' book, so I know a little bit about the production of the movie, but I'm new to the movie industry and I wanted to know a bit more. The movie was made in the 70's, and was very much a low budget film. What do you know about how they did it? Did they have actors and actresses that you'd find in a movie today? How many sets did they build and what was the process like to get a crew of a few hundred to do a movie in that size? I hope this was helpful, I've seen a lot of movies in my life and the only thing I know about 'The Motion Picture' is the name, and that's it. I just love the movie and have been watching it a lot lately. ____________________________

And they tried to do too much with this movie. I think they should have focused more on the characters and less on the plot. The movie takes itself too seriously and it's a shame because the script is so good. The best part is the art and music. I really liked the music and it was really good. But I don't think the art is good enough to stand on its own. And the art was a lot of fun. I just can't give it an 8 because it's just a big mess. It's a bad rip- off and I hate it! The characters are all the same and you don't really care about them. They all look the same. They don't even have their own personalities. I don t like that this movie is about a gang of thieves. It was never a gang. It wasn t a crime gang. I was just there to see a bunch of thieves trying to rob a store. And I'm so glad I didn t pay for this movie because it was a terrible movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. This review is about an incredible movie: I saw this movie about 3 years ago. The first half of the movie was just as I remember it from my childhood. The movie started out with a girl in a wheelchair who was told that she is going to be "special" if she wants to have a life. The boy who was going to bring her to the doctor wanted to take her on a ride but the ride ended up going out of control and then he was the one in the hospital. The girl was in the car but she was not able to get out of the car because her leg was trapped under the wheel. When she finally did get out she was going out and the doctor told her to go into the house to change her clothes. The doctor told the boy to get in the house and he was going into the bathroom. When the girl came out of his bathroom she saw him taking his pants off. The woman took a picture and it showed the boy's penis. The next scene showed the girl in the room with her mother and brother. They were all laughing because they all thought it was a dream. The mother said that it was real and it was like she was living it. The mom said that her daughter was so beautiful and she wanted her to have the best life possible. The daughter was crying and she told her mother that she didn't want to be special. Her mother asked the daughter if she wanted to have her own special life. When they were going to the store they were able to talk about everything they wanted to do. When it came time to pick out clothes, the daughter wanted to buy her mother a dress. The son said that he had a present for his sister. He told her he wanted her a dress like the one the boy was wearing. The man in the store came up to the girl and asked her if she could get a dress for her brother. The sister said that she was fine with it and she was the only one in her family that wore dresses. When this happened, the sister said to the woman in the wheelchair, "you have a really good life." The woman replied that she knew that she did. The father of the boy told his mother that he was very proud of his son. When he came home, he was looking at pictures of his brother and the girl. He said that they were very similar.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________ (I was at a convention recently and saw the movie a few times and thought it was great, and I know many people who saw it at a family dinner in Vegas and thought the same thing.)   I'm a huge fan of David Lynch, and he's got an uncanny ability to capture the essence of an era. The series' first two movies - Blue Velvet (1986) and Mulholland Drive (2001) - were about the drug culture of the late 1960s and early 1970s, and they're the ones that have gotten most of the attention from fans.   But this movie is a little bit more obscure. It's about a young man, who has gone through a lot of trauma, who is on the verge of losing everything, when his girlfriend's boyfriend (Danny Lloyd) breaks into his apartment and he has a strange encounter.   in the middle of this he comes across a strange, white box in his attic that looks like it was once part of a UFO. He opens it and the box has a picture of a girl on it. I loved this. It was so bizarre and eerie and disturbing that I couldn't help but watch it again and again.   and here's where it gets weird. It looks like the picture was taken in an actual room. The man looks exactly like the man in the picture in the box. He even looks the same. He's the same height, he's the exact same build. He wears the exact clothes, he looks exactly the same and he even has the same haircut. But there's something wrong with him. He has a hole in his head and he looks like he's dying. He says that it's an accident. I'm not making this up.   I love that. He thinks he's dead and he just keeps talking to the picture of the girl in the attic. It goes on for a while. He talks to it about how it feels, about how he feels, and how it makes him feel. It makes him sad. It talks about how sad it is, and then it disappears. He keeps talking, but it's only words, and we just keep waiting for the girl to come out of the box and say something. And then she doesn't. We never find out where she is, or where she's gone to.     And then a few years later, we meet her again. She looks exactly as she did in the old picture,
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. I can't believe that this movie was even made. I mean, it's so bad that even a low-budget movie like this would be laughable. So why was this film made? Why would anyone make this? Why do I keep watching this? Because I like to see things that aren't true, so this is my kind of movie. But, even though I like seeing things that are not true, I am not going to spend a lot of time on this movie because it's really bad. So I'll just leave it at that. So, anyway, I'm not going on about this movie, so here's my review of it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

The only reason I didn't rate this lower is because I've seen the original, and I was already familiar with the premise, which is a bit of a throwback to the old school sci-fi, so that was the reason why I didnít like it as much. However, since I have seen it twice, I have come to love it as a genre of movie, and a good sci-fier. This is probably the most underrated film in the Alien series, and one of the best action movies as well.  …

"This is a very, very important election, and the coverage is really just not there. We're talking about real issues here, and real people are suffering. We need a president who is not going to be the beneficiary of a media system that is absolutely corrupt." "I don't know what more you could say to people who feel they've been abandoned by a political system that has become so dysfunctional that they feel that they can't even participate," she continued. "That the system is rigged, that it's stacked against them. It's just a matter of time before we have a serious crisis in this country." "There's only one person who has the solutions to these problems," Kerry said. Sanders and Hillary Clinton are both vying for the Democratic nomination, but Kerry has endorsed Clinton and will appear with her in New Hampshire on Saturday. The former secretary said she had hoped that Sanders would be able to become president. She has said she doesn't believe he has a path to victory, but is still endorsing him in the hopes that he will help the party fight back against the Republican nominee. Sanders has said he is confident he can win the general election. "He's going to have to win a lot of states," she said. Kerry also said she did not support the Keystone XL pipeline, but that the issue should not be a "litmus test" for Democrats. Kerry said she would have voted against the project had she been in Congress, but noted that it was ultimately a decision that the Obama administration made. "I was part
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  If you haven't seen this one already, I don't recommend watching it. It is awful. The actors are horrible, and the cinematography is awful, and it has all the things that you expect in a low-budgeted, poorly acted, poorly directed horror movie. And it's the only one of these films I have seen so far, so I don;t really know what the worst is about it. The only redeeming quality of this film is that the actors are really good and the film is well-written.  The acting is just terrible. It's so bad, that I didn't even know what was going on at first. The first person I thought of was Jason Sudeikis, the man behind the character of Frank, the lead character in the film. I thought he was the lead because he seemed like a good person, and that was it. Then I heard that he was in the movie because he was supposed to be a good actor and it just didn't add up to me. The rest of the characters were terrible, too. Even the ones that were supposed to have some redeeming qualities like the lead, Frank, were all terrible. A lot of people have said that they didn't see the point of this movie, but I did. I don' t think the movie is a good horror movie, and I don''t think it has a point. It has a ton of plot holes, and all of the ideas were terrible. The whole idea was that the monsters come back in order to wipe out humanity, but that's the stupidest idea I''ve ever heard in my life. I hate horror movies that come back because the monsters were always defeated before. So this movie is supposed to end with the monsters going on a rampage, and then humanity survives. That was the entire premise of this one. It''s the first film to come out in 2004 where it''s written that the movie was about humanity surviving, and not about a genocide. It didn''t make any sense. The worst part about the film was that it was filmed in 3-D and in 2-D. It looks so much better when it's in 2''s. I understand that they had to do a lot of special effects for this movie because of the budget, but it was just such a waste of money. , 2.5 out of 5 based on 11 reviews

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ _______________ ____________  How to get a bad review: ______________________________ ________________  On the topic of bad reviews, let me give you a little story. A man was walking in the street when a girl with a dog suddenly ran out from a side alley and grabbed him. He was trying to get away from her but she caught him and carried him off, to her house. He said, "I can't get away. The dog will eat me." He said nothing else. He got into the house. The girl said to him, "Do you want to eat me?" He said no. "Then eat me," she said. She went into a bathroom and locked the door. The man watched as she put a piece of paper under the tap, opened the door, and stepped out with the man's head sticking out. She said, "... You won't be able to escape me." The man was still trying to run away but the dog was chasing him. The woman said, ""You will be eaten by the dog." The dog took the man into the street and dragged him to the water fountain. The water was boiling hot. She put him in the fountain and closed the door so the dog couldn't get out. Then she went back into the bathroom. She was bathing herself and then went into the bedroom. She stripped and put on her underwear and jumped in the bathtub. She covered herself with the paper. She came out with her head sticking up. The dogs were chasing her. The men came out of the house and tried to catch her. One man grabbed her by the arm. She jumped out of his hand and ran into the woods. The other man ran after her, but she ran as fast as she could. She got into a hole in the ground and got down to the bottom. She tried to stand up but she couldn't. The hole was very small. She kept going and going until she reached the edge of the world. She could see nothing but trees and grass. Then there was nothing but the moon. The moon looked like a diamond. She fell asleep in the hole. She slept all night and the next day. The next day, when she woke up, she found the hole had disappeared. She thought, "It must have been a dream." That was the last time she saw the moon or the hole."

The theater had an awesome sound system and the projector was so bright I could see the image. I had never heard of this film, but I loved it. It was great for my 12 year old self. I never really knew what a 'disco' was until I heard the 'rock' track. I thought it was funny and the film did a great job with a 'rocker' soundtrack. The 'rockers' were the perfect length, and the music was really catchy. There were plenty of 'dance' scenes and some really good special effects. I enjoyed the film and I think this is one of the better 'dens' of the 1970's. I would say that this was my first exposure to the disco genre, but my parents were also into the music so I guess we weren't the only ones. I loved the ending and was glad it was over. I think the film was just a little too short and could have been better. I still have the DVD. I do have the original soundtrack on vinyl, but it's not on my collection. - April 4, 2008My first time  Review of DJD - favorite - March 3, 2008Great, but not quite a masterpiece This film is definitely worth a look. It has some of the best music ever made. The music is catchy, the actors were fantastic, the plot was really interesting, the lighting was great, the cinematography was outstanding and the special effects were very good. The film is not quite good enough to be a masterpiece, but the acting is good enough and the story is really good. I believe this was a major influence on later 'dissisco' movies such as The Last Boy Scout and I'm not sure about the plot, but this film is worth a watch. - February 23, 2008Good, but...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I will be honest: Â I didn't care for this movie. Â This was an action flick, but I can't tell you how many times I felt like the director was going to make it as "action" as he possibly could.  It was a very confusing and incoherent movie that was filled with so many confusing lines.    The main plot involved a man who is shot in the head while running away from a group of criminals.   His wife finds out he is dead and, in a bizarre twist, the criminals reveal that the man was a traitor to the gang. __________________ 1)  Titanic:  Â There are so many different elements of this movie that make it so fascinating.  The idea that this ship went down because of a single captain who made a poor choice.  This could have been a good movie if it had focused more on the relationship between the people on the ship and the captain.  Unfortunately, this movie didn't tell a good story.  It was a terrible movie because of its confusing plot.  I can understand the film makers making a movie about the Titanic but the people involved with this movie were not prepared.  What happened to that guy who was supposed to be the villain in the beginning?   I would like to know what happened to him.  Was he really dead?  He was supposed be a part of the story?  Who killed him?  Why was he so important?  This movie was such a mess.  But what a great story to tell.  2) Â The Princess Bride:  This was a great movie. I was in high school when I saw this movie, and it was an awesome movie. The movie is about a pirate who meets a princess and they fall in love.  One thing I love about this movie is that you can relate to the characters.  Even though it is a movie that deals with love and pirates, there are things that are still familiar to any teenager.  So why do I hate this movie so much?  It is the worst film I have ever seen.  There is no plot and no plot development.  A lot of the people in this movie are stupid and it just takes you out of the movie.   It also doesn't do anything with the Princess.  She is just a damsel in distress.  Also, it has so many bad lines and they are
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "the plot sucks" - what are you trying to prove?  This movie doesn't have a plot at all!  What it does have is a great cast, great acting and a great story.  The cast is awesome, and it's easy to see why.   You don't need to be a film expert to understand why these actors were amazing.    It's hard to say that any actor in this movie is a bad actor, because each actor is given a role that they are able to fully play.  There are many great scenes, but there are also some scenes that are so bad, you would have to be dead inside to watch them.  The worst scene in the movie is the one where all the characters are at a restaurant with some of the bad guys.  They are sitting at the table, and they are all drinking wine.  I swear, they just have one glass of wine and they start to drink.  Then they have one scene where all of the characters drink wine and all of them are laughing.  It is a really terrible scene that is not funny at all.  There are a few other scenes in this film that are equally bad, but they aren't really that bad.  Some of the most memorable scenes are the ones where you see the character's face.  You see their eyes, their lips and their noses.  Each character is so unique and so expressive that it is very easy to get lost in the characters.  If you like to watch good acting, and you like good acting and you want to see great acting, you should watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The film's plot revolves around a man who finds out that he has been possessed by a demon and tries to stop him.

That's like saying, "The film was boring because it was just a bunch of people going around a mall and eating ice cream."

It's hard to put into words what exactly makes this film so good. It is a very unique film that manages to keep a good balance of comedy and drama and never gets boring. The story of a man who is being pursued by a man with a gun and a young boy who is trying to save his dad is very interesting and well done. It has some of the most original ideas in any of the films, and that is what makes it so special. I will not spoil it for you, but trust me when I say this film is worth every single second. This movie should not be missed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ I don't usually write reviews for bad movies, but this one was a complete disaster and I can't give it 5 stars. This is a poorly written, poorly acted and poorly directed movie that should never have been released in the first place. The story takes place in the future where a virus has been discovered that turns people into zombies. In the future, the only cure is to inject the zombie with a special serum that can only be obtained from one person: an American woman named Jennifer. The film begins when Jennifer is kidnapped by a terrorist and taken to a remote island. There, she is tortured and then beheaded. The rest of the movie follows a group of men trying to find Jennifer. However, after a long time, they do find her. Jennifer is brain dead and is forced to watch as the men go to the island to take her back to the mainland. There are some things that are so bad that you would think that the producers of the film got their information from the Twilight Zone. There is a lot of nudity, sex and a very strange plot that would make you think that it was written by someone with no imagination whatsoever. The acting is a complete failure. All the actors are really bad, and it's hard to believe that they are actors. There's a few good parts in the movie but for the most part, it's a complete waste of time. This movie should have never been released. It is the definition of a disaster and it should never be released again. I don the sequel to this movie, "Night of the Living Dead" but it doesn't have much in the way of plot to it. It's more of a parody of the zombie genre. I'll give it a 4 stars, but it's definitely not worth a watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. It's a sad, sad day when a good movie is ruined by a negative movie.

I thought this movie was way better than the show, but it wasn't as good as the show. But at least the show was great! I'm going to see The Walking dead Season 2 soon, it's got a lot of fun scenes and will probably be better than this movie. So I'd recommend this movie for the fans of the show or the moviegoers who want to see a cool zombie movie. But if you want a movie about zombies, you should probably go watch the show first.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ If you are going to watch this, make sure you have at least watched the movie beforehand. You can't go into this thinking it's going to be the same. In the beginning the movie seems a little over-dramatic. You get the idea that it's all going to happen and it is. However, it gets so confusing and over-thought out that you don't care. The actors do their best and it makes it hard to not laugh. I did, however, notice that the director did a good job keeping the scenes from getting boring. I liked the fact that the movie was made as a series of short films. You really get to see different scenes in different movies and it shows. It's not a story-driven movie and it isn't as good as some of the other movies in this series. The director has made it very difficult to follow. He knows how to make it look like something that is happening and yet it's not. It is not a good movie. If you don,t care about a story you might like it. I was looking forward to this movie since I've always wanted to see a movie like this. If it was all about the acting, it would be great. I've never seen a movie where the actors are so good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first few minutes of The Wicker Man were so over the top that I wondered if it was meant to be a parody of the modern horror genre. The film's title character, played by Richard E. Grant, is a man with a strange, wiry build who is cursed by a demon to walk around and see every night for the rest of his life. He has to deal with this curse by wearing a red leather mask that makes him look like a tree-man. The Wickersman is not unlike a lot of other modern horror films. It is basically a story about a man who finds a mask he thinks he bought and it turns out to be very sinister. The movie is also one about how a small town can be taken over by a group of strange people. It also tells the story of a couple who have a child and the consequences of their relationship. This movie does not try to be clever and there is not a lot going on in this movie. It just does what a horror film should do. It scares you by being creepy. The acting in this film is really good. The cast was all pretty good and the performances were all well done. The script for this film was pretty well written. The only thing that I would have changed is the ending. The ending of the film is a bit forced. It was a little confusing and it left a bad taste in my mouth. The way that the film ends felt very rushed and it just didn't seem right to me.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________  In the 1980s, the city of Chicago was dealing with a major heroin epidemic. The city's drug dealers were killing off dealers in record numbers, and the police couldn't seem to get a grip on the problem. In one case, police found a dead body in a trunk. Police were suspicious of a woman's story about the death and they started investigating the woman. The investigation soon turned into a murder. This film is about that investigation. It has a lot of fun with it. It also has a bit of a political message in it.  What did you like best about this movie?  It is a very good film that I enjoy watching. I enjoyed it more than I expected to. I think it is a good way to get people thinking.  the story about a woman who is murdered after she's been accused of a crime she didn't commit.  The film also has an interesting plot. It starts off with a murder and the suspect being arrested. The film then follows the investigation of the suspect who is being questioned and questioned again after being released. The story of the investigation is really good and the characters are well developed. The police are also well developed as the police investigate the murder of the woman who was falsely accused of being involved. The characters are very well developed and the film is a nice piece of work. It is also a good film to watch on a rainy day.  is an excellent movie. It makes good use of its time and the movie gives a good story. The movie is about a police investigation of a murder of a drug dealer. The main characters of the film are a police officer and a prosecutor. The prosecutor has the best character of the movie. He is well developed, witty and very likable. The cop on the other hand is also well known in the film industry. The detective is a well developed character and the cop is a likable character as well. The director does a good job in making this film. The music in the movie is very good and it fits the tone of the story. This is a movie I can recommend to everyone. I recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys a good thriller. This movie is a fun movie to watch.

It's a movie that tries to tell a story in the same way a soap opera does, but I'm sorry I don  In the film you have a group of friends who are having a barbeque. When it starts to rain and they go inside to warm up, they find that the floor is covered in blood. It is then revealed that a bunch of people had been attacked by a group who want revenge. The group has a plan to take revenge on the people that attacked them, and to get back at the group who killed their parents. The movie is really interesting, and the characters are really likable. There are a lot of jokes in the movie, and there's a lot to learn about the people in the group. The film has some action, but it is very much for the sake of action. It doesn't really develop the characters, or give them anything to do. This movie is only worth watching if you're looking for a good laugh.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________ I saw this movie in a local theatre and thought it was just a boring "filler" until it started. I think the only redeeming quality about this movie is that I'm pretty sure it was an adaptation of a French novel, so it might have been the best of the genre. The movie follows a group of soldiers who decide to leave their "dormitory" for some unknown reason. The rest of the movie consists of them trying to find a way out of the country, and finding a couple of guys who are looking for them as well. It's not a very interesting movie, but it does have a couple nice scenes. The ending is somewhat unsatisfying. It was a bit weird, and I don't think it made sense. The guy who was searching for the guys ends up finding them and trying to kill them, but then he ends up losing the fight and is taken prisoner. That was it for me. It just didn't seem like there was a real plot. I would have liked to see more of the soldiers, but this movie just doesn't have enough of them. If you want to see some more of a "dramatic" movie, you should go check out "The Hunger Games". If you are looking to see a good action movie, check out the "Bourne" movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________  I am not a film critic, so I can't really speak to the quality of the movie itself. The plot is a bit hard to follow, but it's a fun, fast paced adventure. There's a bit of an over the top villain (who's name I can only assume is "The Madman") and a few other bad guys, but I don't think they are too big of a deal. I am not sure what kind of movie this is, but there's plenty of fun in it. The sound is good, and the action sequences are very well done. The movie had a good story, but the movie wasn't too bad. There is nothing really great about it, but everything is done well. ______________________________  What's great about this movie is how it takes a relatively unknown director and uses his skill and experience to make something that's actually enjoyable. It's a little over the head, but this movie will keep you in suspense for the entire running time. __________________  This is a really cool movie. It has a cool premise and some cool action, and you get a good sense of the characters. I thought it was a good idea to have a bunch of people who are completely unknown, but you don't really feel like you're watching someone else's movie. The cast is really good and they are all fun to watch. This movie is very good. It doesn't have the biggest budget, but that just means it has a better story. The characters are interesting and you can see them develop over the course of the story. ______________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it is the one thing that I've learned from working on this blog: if you are going to give a bad film a bad review, make sure that the negative review is about the bad film.  If you are writing about a movie that has flaws that the film does not have, the flaws should be highlighted.  There is nothing wrong with writing a negative about a good movie. Â But if you have nothing negative to say about a great movie, it's not the time to do it.    The worst movie I've ever seen in my life was the film that inspired the phrase "the most amazing and most terrifying film you've never seen".  The movie is called The Thing and it is a film that has a lot of good qualities. __________________________ If you would like to support me, you can buy my book at Amazon.com or click on the image below:

We decided to sit down, turn off the lights, and watch this movie with a drink in hand. And it was good."  -Cameron Crowe  This is a movie about a man who's trying to be a good guy but he can't seem to do anything right. His family and friends don't approve of his behavior and they can't stand to see him in pain. He has this big crush on a girl and all his friends try to stop him. The movie has a lot of heart and it's very well written. I also liked that the movie was not only about this guy and his friends, but also the people that loved and supported him.  The music was great, the acting was good, and the cinematography was beautiful.  The movie was written by Cameron Crowe and John Sayles. I don't know if this movie is a good movie or not, but I know it was an important movie to me. It was a film that taught me about life. It taught me that life is not easy and it is not without struggles. .

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ Why can't a movie have a good story? This movie is bad. The story is just about a guy and his sister who find a lost baby in a closet. The movie starts with a bad ending. A bad ending with a baby in the closet and then a weird twist. It is not a good ending. I am not going to write any more about the movie because there are more movies to talk about. I want to go to a movie I enjoyed this year. It was called, "Tangerines" and it was good. This movie was just a bad romance. I thought that it was a little odd that a movie like "Trouble With the Curve" had a story that was just romance. This is not romance. There are no emotions, no romance. Just two people and two houses. It doesn't even have a title. It's just two people going through a relationship. I think the only reason this movie is rated a R is because the movie has a bad title. This would be a PG-13 movie if it had a good title. But this has a crappy title. I liked it, but I don't recommend it. The rating is too high.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I was so excited to see it. The film had been in production for several years and had received a great deal of publicity. The plot was very simple and had no major surprises. I was excited to find out how this film would end.  It ended in a horrible way."   - Michael E. Miller, Los Angeles Times (8/15/78) This is the one that's really on the nose for me. I've always thought the idea of an "alternate history" with a fascist takeover of the United States would be fun to play with, but this one, in which the country is split between right-wing "liberals" and left-wing communists, has more in common with something from a George Orwell novel.   The plot seems pretty straightforward, with a series of assassinations and political intrigue, but the performances are laughable.   They're so bad that you want to laugh at them, but you can't.   A film like this is hard to sell because it's so terrible.   I can't believe people still watch it, but I guess I don't really understand what's so appealing about it. I'll give it a 3/10.   It's a fun watch, but if you want an alternate history with a little more action, I'd say go see a different movie.   If you've seen a movie like this, you'll have no problem with it either.

It's funny, the music is good and the acting is great. The action scenes are well-done and have a lot of impact.   This movie has some good acting and the script is very well thought out.   The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because the story didn't really move me. It seemed to just be another "guy is a loser" movie. There are some scenes where a guy actually is successful in life but it's not really enough to make me feel like I'm watching something worth watching. There's no character development in this movie and the ending doesn't really do anything to build up the next movie, so I don't know what the point of it was.   the only other thing I would have changed was the ending. It was a little too easy to predict, but it could have been used to make the movie more interesting.     The acting is decent. It gets better and better as the movie goes on. The movie was enjoyable. I think it's worth a watch for anyone who likes a good comedy and a good action movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the original "Pornstar"   Overall: 4.5/5  __________________________________________________________________________ 06-19-2017-05:28 AM #10 (perma) chaddecum Member   the guy with the great voice  Join date: Feb 2012 Posts: 1,072 My Review:   Pleasant to see.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ "The Thing" was a terrible film that was made in 1977. I remember it was terrible and I would watch it all the time, but I never understood why it was bad. I was told it was about a scientist and a giant creature and was supposed to scare the bejesus out of me. I mean, I'd seen a lot of horror films in high school and all of them were terrible. "The Shape of Water" is a beautiful movie. It's a modern classic. I'm glad that it's a great movie that we have to see again and again. It was the first feature film to get a Best Picture Oscar and was nominated for three others, but it didn't win.

This is not the case with this movie. I can't believe that I waited this long to watch it. It was so bad that I couldn't bear it. And even though I don't know the director or the actor, I really think that it's a pretty good movie. It's just so boring. The script is pretty bad and the acting is awful. I was completely bored throughout the movie. The story is a bunch of nothing and the movie does not take long to finish. The only reason that I am rating this movie this low is because I just don't think that this is a good movie for people who do not like horror movies. I hope that this movie was a flop for the director and for the actors because it is so bad.

It's just that I would have given it a B-  A- B-B- B+  "The Best Things in Life Are Free" is the perfect movie for kids (or adults for that matter) to watch. The story is simple: A boy and his brother go to a park where they encounter a girl named Anna. The two boys go up to her and ask for her phone number, but she doesn't answer it. The boys get really upset and tell the girl to give them their number and then tell them to get out of the park. They then tell Anna that they'll give her the phone number when they go to the police station, but then they leave. The girl, who is a police officer, asks the boy why they didn't give her their number. The boy says that they were scared of getting in trouble. The police officer says that the boys had to have been scared. They are, however, not afraid of the police because they were able to get away with it. "What are you afraid of? I am not going to get in trouble!"  The police officer then tells the boy that he is going to give him a ticket because he had to run away from the park in order to get their phone number. He then says that he was just kidding, and that they can get in a lot of trouble if they don't get the phone numbers right. The cop then says, "Don't worry. They're only gonna give you a ticket." The boy looks at the girl and says,  "…If you get the number right, they won't give you the ticket. But if you get it wrong, they will."  Anna then gets angry and says that she's going to call the boy to get the ticket for her. The camera then zooms in on the girl's face. The face of the girl is very different from the face of her mother. Anna's mother says, as she is watching her daughter, "You're just as stupid as you look. This is your life now, don't you think?" The boy asks her, "What are we gonna do?"  What the mother doesn't realize is that the boy had been planning on calling her. He had

I'm going to be honest with you, I haven't watched this movie. I've seen the trailer, but I don't know what it is. The trailer is a really weird looking guy on a motorcycle and he is riding around the movie set. I think it is a new movie that is set in the future. There is a lot of stuff going on and I really don't get it. It just doesn't seem to make any sense. The story starts off well. A guy named Jeff is traveling through a post apocalyptic wasteland. He finds some really cool stuff and he takes it home. The only problem is that it has mutated into some sort of insect. So he takes a new wife and goes back to the old world. He makes a robot, which turns out to be the ultimate weapon. He and his robot go around killing all of the bad guys. But eventually he gets a robot girlfriend and she is a horrible little bitch. The movie gets pretty bad at this point. The bad guys are all really cool looking. There are some cool special effects. The robots are cool. The people are all pretty cool. But the movie just doesn  The movie was really bad. The robot was kind of cool and all the baddies were pretty cool, but they are just all kind of generic and not very well designed. The music was really boring. The dialogue was really, really stupid. I was laughing at everything. It was really sad. I know it is supposed to be a comedy, but it is not funny. There were a couple of good bits in the movie, but in general, it was a pretty bad movie.  "I'm going back to where I came from"  3. This movie has been getting some pretty bad reviews.

The second one is very good, but there are some scenes that are just flat out bad. This is a very bad movie that I have never watched before. I have seen the original

This is an interesting film. It does have some good points.    The story is interesting.  The action is well done.  There is some interesting story elements to be explored in this film. The problem is that it just falls apart in the end.  In fact, it just starts to fall apart at about the 20 minute mark.  That's when the plot starts to break down.  At that point, it doesn't make sense.  It's like the movie is trying to make a point, but is unable to.  You start to think, is it trying to say something?  If so, it's trying to be clever.

So, let's get started on a review about this movie that is just a terrible movie.  First, the premise of this movie is so stupid.  What does it have to do with a little boy who gets lost in a jungle?  The movie itself was filmed in a cave.  So, why would a boy have a camera that he uses to find his way?  Well, to find a place that he can live and grow up.  Then, he gets lost, which is obviously not good, right?  This leads him to an abandoned shack and then a tribe of monkeys.  This tribe of monkey men, however, has a secret.  These monkeys are evil and they are responsible for killing a little girl.  How is this possible?  Well, there are a bunch of animals that live in this place, and they were actually responsible for the girl's death.  The film itself, however is so boring and horrible.  There is no real plot to this movie and it just goes on and on.  It is just boring.  If you are looking for a good movie that has a very well-written script, I recommend that you go watch this movie instead.  Now, I know that this is a bad review, but there is nothing more to say about this film.  I can't think of any good things to say and this is just horrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  I've heard some horror stories about the actors and crew from this movie. They are just that. Some of the actors don't seem to be able to tell the story of the movie they are in. The actors do what they are told, and that's it. The director/producer didn't even make an effort to make this movie any good. The acting is just bad. The music is just a cheap song and dance number. The script is bad. And the direction is awful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. This was the most horrible movie ever! I'm sorry if you are like me and like to see your favorite movie, but if you don't like this movie, then you are just a moron. It was way too long. I thought it was a good idea to use the same actor's voices. The movie is boring. The acting was lame. They didn't give anything to the story. I'm really mad at the movie. The only good thing is that I'm not sick of it!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********** "I've seen a lot of bad movies, but nothing quite like this. "The movie was awful, and I mean that in the worst way. It's one of those movies where if you are even slightly interested in watching it, you will be bored to tears. I mean, really, how can a movie like this get made? The only good thing about this movie is the music, which is really good. But don't let that get you excited; this is a movie for people who have no idea what a movie is supposed to be about. It was boring, over the top, and really not good. "It's like a bad version of a movie called "The Day The Earth Stood Still." A movie that I had no interest in watching at all. I was even a little angry at the whole thing, because I felt that it was just too cheesy. But it was fun to watch."  This movie is not funny and is very unoriginal. It has too much bad acting, bad scenes, and it takes way too long to get to the good part of the movie. The ending was cheesy, the characters were uninteresting, and the music was awful. The whole movie is a waste of time. I will not recommend this movie to anyone and I will only watch this movie if you love bad movies and don't care about plot.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________  __________________________________________________________________________  I was really hoping for a good horror movie. The plot sounded good: a boy has a bad day and finds a body in his garage. He thinks it is his father, but it's not his dad. He has no memory of the day before. He's told by his mother that he can't be home until he finds out what happened to his father. So, he goes to his mom's house. The woman is very rude to him and he is scared. He finds a dead body and takes a picture. A couple of days later, he wakes up to find a man in his house. He knows it's him, but is afraid to tell his mother. She doesn't believe him. He goes to the police and tells them about the body. The police tells him that he has to get the body out of his house as it has to be identified. He says that he doesn't want to go to the hospital because he doesn�t want to see his mother cry. So the boy goes into his basement, but he doesn´t find a body. He doesn't see anything at all. He leaves the basement, and he comes back to his house, and his mother tells him to go home. He is afraid that his mother won't let him go home and he leaves again. He starts to look for his dad in the garage. In the garage he finds his father's old car and takes it home. There he finds a car. His father�s car. But the man in the car is not his father! It's his friend. He takes him home and his dad is there. His dad tells him not to be afraid and not to say anything. His friend tells him what happened, but his dad doesn't know anything. He comes to a party, and there is another guy with a girl. His sister is there too. They talk, but the guy starts to date the girl, and the girl starts to like the guy. They go to a bar, and then he is going to leave. He tries to get in, but they won't allow him. Then the guy goes home. Then he starts to be scared. His mother is worried about him. She gets a phone call and tells her son that he needs to come home right now. He gets a message on his phone from his friend, saying that the guy is in the house and that he should come. He does

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________   I was disappointed with the movie, but that is my fault. The book is just as good, but the movie is terrible. I was not expecting to like it. I liked the book, but I thought that the book is better, the movie sucks. I guess I just didn't like it as much. I loved the characters in the book and they are so realistic. They are not perfect, but they are really good. It's like watching a play. They act, they act like real people, but then they have to act like they are actors. The acting in the movie was terrible. Even the main actors who are not the best actors, they were still terrible. This movie was really bad. I think that the director could have done something different with the acting, but it was really horrible. It made me want to throw up. I also don't think that this movie was very funny. The script was really hard to read and the acting was horrible.   The story is pretty bad. The main character, Jack, gets shot by his brother, who was trying to get revenge on Jack for beating him. Jack survives and the movie ends. After the movie it says that the brother killed himself. I do not understand why this was in the script. It was a stupid ending. I feel like I should have had a little more information before the movie started. I have to say that the main character in this movie is so weak that I really thought that he was going to die in the end. The whole movie was a waste of my time.   The ending is so horrible. The movie was just so stupid.  ,
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. _______________. _______________________. This movie is a mess. I would love to see a movie that was actually well made. I could care less about the characters and just want to watch a good film. This was not a good movie at all. It is so bad, you wonder how they made it. I was expecting something great but instead got a mess that is just not worth it. The worst part is how the director just can't even make a decent film. He should have just quit and did a series of other bad movies like "Serenity" and "Firefly". He should be ashamed of himself. I do not recommend this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It's a bad film, and I've seen a lot of bad films. The worst one I've ever seen."   If that's your attitude about a film, I recommend you go see another film.   And if you find yourself saying that, please go see some other film, not this one.   The first time I saw this movie I was so impressed by how good it was that I almost forgot about it.   It was a good movie with a good script, but it was a bad, bad movie.   I had to watch it three times, and even then I wasn't convinced that I wanted to see it again.   If you want to see a good, bad, good movie, go see Citizen Kane.   If the first time you saw it you thought, "Wow, that was really good," the second time you thought "Wow.   That was bad.   No, I don't want to go see it anymore."  The third time you think, "Hey, that's a good film, it could have been much better." __________________________________________________________ Why don't you think of something different:   Why do people who watch a lot more TV than I do still watch sitcoms?    Why do they still watch reality shows, but not talk shows?  I'm not trying to be the judge of anyone's taste.   I don 't think I'm a TV viewer at all, but I do watch TV.  I also like comedy and drama, but they aren't my things.  I watch sitcom when I'm bored, drama when I feel sad, and so on.  But the ones that I don' t like are usually the ones where they make fun of me.  If you think you're not supposed to like that, you've never watched any of the sitcoms that I'm talking about.  And if they make you laugh, then you 'll have to laugh.  Why don't they make jokes about you?  Because if they do, they're gonna make fun o' you.  In a sitcom, you can be funny and not be mean.  It's the same thing with the movies.  They have to make fun out of you, but you can still be funny.  Or they can make you seem stupid, or an idiot, and you can look like one too.  Because that's what you do

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I've seen a lot of bad movies, but this is by far the worst. I am disgusted at the thought that this is being made by an all-girl studio, with an all female cast and a male director who just seems so out of touch with the reality of the film industry. I have a hard time believing that any producer would hire a man who just does not understand or respect women. I was so offended by this film and the director's lack of sensitivity and knowledge. It's clear that this was made for women and their approval, not for men and their appreciation. I'm sick of seeing these kinds of films made with an agenda of making them look better and the men seem more like props."
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________  I'm sure you could find many reviews that were more negative than this one. I have to say I enjoyed it, it wasn't a bad film, but there were some parts I wished were different. The acting was good, but the way it was shot didn't help. The film was very dark and I didn't get much of a sense of the character's world. The only part of the film I found really interesting was when a character was playing cards in the bar, and she was wearing a leather jacket. The scene looked like something out of a film noir, and I felt the film was better for it. I wish there had been a bit more music in the film, the music was pretty good.

Edited by: theoneandonly | 2009/11-31 01:01:43 If the man could see you...the woman can...  Posted in: Haunted House, Halloween, Real Ghosts, Skeletons  I'll never forget this night. I was 16 and I had just been out at a friend's house. The whole time my parents were upstairs with the television set on and it was getting really late. When we went to bed I was in bed and I heard the tv in the room start to blare music. I turned around and saw this guy standing on the back porch. The way he stood was really odd. I don't know what it was about him, but I just felt this fear come over me and then I went to sleep. I had a nightmare the next morning, I woke up really confused. My parents had gone out early and they came back late. I didn't know why, but they hadn't called and I was worried about them. I tried to call my mom from the phone and when I did it went straight to voice mail. I then tried the phone in my room but it wasn't there. I found a note from my mom in my book bag, she wrote 'goodnight' and then she threw the book bag out of the bedroom window. I went out the door and called my dad but he was out of town and I couldn't reach him. I called my sister and she was at work so I just left a message. I felt really guilty for making the phone call, but at the same time I thought she probably just wanted to go out for dinner. That was a few years ago. I've been going to this house for the last 10 years and I've never had a bad experience there.  .  . .
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ is a terrible movie. I can't stand bad movies. And I don't even like bad movies (I mean I've seen some bad ones), but this is a really bad movie. First off, I was expecting a sequel to a really good movie that was made by another company called "The Asylum". It was a sequel of a film that was not only good, but had a few moments of greatness. This film has none of that, it's all awful. If you don't have an imagination, you will be disgusted. I would say this is the worst film I've ever seen. The characters are really unlikable and the writing is just as bad as the actors. The only reason I watched this movie is because it was part of a series and they all have the same acting talent. It's just bad. It has an annoying soundtrack (you have to turn it off for me), it's slow paced, and it doesn't even try to be original. It was made to be a franchise and this is exactly what it was. The actors are all terrible and they were just used to get a paycheck. If I see any sequels to this film, I will definitely never watch them. The production values are awful and the movie looks like a bad 90's movie. It makes me feel sick to watch this movie. And it should have never been made. This movie is one of those movies where it's not worth watching.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It was like watching a bad horror movie."  I guess if you have never seen it you will be shocked to hear that I actually agree with that statement.  The first movie is a movie that I could have enjoyed for the first hour or so.   It is actually pretty good if you can get past the first act and the second act of the movie is nothing but a joke.  There is no way that this movie was going to be good for the second half.  The movie has one great moment in the first half, when the character of Sam is being chased by his brother.  It is a great moment, the camera is focused on Sam and he has a good time running down the street with his brother in the car.  This is when Sam is trying to get away from the cops and he is being held down by a cop and the brother is chasing after him.  What I love about this moment is that Sam is holding the brother down so that he doesn't get away and is being pulled around by the car when he hears the brother's voice in his head saying "Hey!  "    This scene is great.  In the second part of the film, Sam is having a great time when he is getting the girl's phone number from her.  I'm not sure what happened to the brother in this scene, but I am pretty sure it didn't happen.  Sam is getting really drunk when he gets the phone number and he decides to text her.    The problem with this scene is that it is really boring.  All of Sam's drunken antics are going to the wrong number and all of the texting Sam does is to the girl in the other room.  No matter how much he texts her, she never answers.  She only ever answers when Sam leaves a message and I guess the text message wasn't important enough to her to answer the phone.  If Sam had had some real character development he would have found a way to find out who the brother was.  That would have been a nice change.  The other thing that I have found interesting about this movie is that I am starting to notice some similarities with the original "The Exorcist."  I can't say that I was actually able to tell the difference between the two movies, but it was kind of hard to tell.  Like I said before, the movie has some good scenes, but the acting is terrible

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *************   If you are a true horror fan and love to find something new in a horror movie, then you are going to love this movie.   I love horror movies, I just think this one is bad.  , it's a very slow paced movie with very little gore, and not much action. The plot revolves around a man who, while hunting a serial killer, comes into contact with a killer who is a girl and a ghost. This leads to a few really bad things happening, and then there is a really bad dream. This is where things get really bad. The movie is filled with some really nasty dialogue, but they are in such a way that it makes it all feel real.   "A girl who lived alone in a haunted house found a strange woman who had been murdered in the house and she wanted to kill her. Her sister found her, and they all agreed to work together to make sure the killer would not be killed. But she killed her instead and now they are all going crazy!"   The story has some really bad ideas that make no sense, and some scenes that are just ridiculous. Some of the characters are really stupid, and I can't say they are well developed. The film is only 90 minutes long, so it should be longer. The acting is pretty good for the most part, but there are some very cheesy lines.   the only thing I really like about this movie is the soundtrack. It's very eerie and very creepy. I really hope this movie never gets a sequel.     Overall, I'd give this a 4.5/5. It isn't the worst movie I've seen, but it isn't anything to write home about either.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It doesn't really matter how bad a movie is.  The worst part of any movie is the audience that goes to see it.  I've been looking for a good movie to see for awhile.  It's been a rough year, and I was craving something to take my mind off it. I've watched plenty of movies.  I've also watched a few bad movies. It wasn't until this one that I was truly disappointed.  In the beginning it was good.  But it was a bit too slow, and it seemed a bit silly to me.  The last third was really bad, and the ending was cheesy.  There was some good action scenes, and some very good fights.  If you like a slow paced movie, and a really silly one, you might like this.   I give this movie a 2.5 out of 5.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Don't read anything. Watch the movie. It's called The Dark Knight. And it's pretty much the best superhero movie ever made. If you're not a comic book fan, then you've missed out. I'm not sure I can say anything else positive about this movie, but it is a great film. The story is the same as the first Batman movie, which is pretty much a remake of the first Superman movie, and that was great. The original Batman was very fun, but I don't think it's the best Batman movie ever. Batman Begins is better. Batman v Superman was even better. The villain is much better, but not to the same degree. But overall, this is a good Batman movie. The fight scenes are awesome. The action is great. There are some cool gadgets in it. The Batman v. Superman trailers were good, but they were so rushed. I hope that we get some more Batman v Batman footage, and maybe the Batman v Supergirl movie. They really should put that movie on, it's good. If they did, I think it would have been a huge hit. This movie should have been the big one. The whole Batman mythology is great, and you'll never see anything like this. This is Batman without a doubt. I'll see this movie over and over. I highly recommend this movie. Read Less

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have a hard time saying this, but I have a soft spot for horror movies. I'm not going to lie: this movie is not good. Not at all. It's just not. It has an art direction that's more akin to artful film-making, but it's not even artful. There are so many shots and shots of scenery that look fake, and I could swear that a scene in the movie takes place in a movie theater or a movie-shop or something, but there's no such thing. This movie just looks like some random movie, shot for shot, and it's kind of fun. There's a weird feeling that something is wrong, but you can't really tell what it is. But the characters are so wooden that it doesn't matter what's wrong with them, it's just the way they're acting. It takes away from what the movie should be: it's so obvious that there is something wrong with these characters that they're just acting.  But I don't really care about the characters or the acting. I really like the movie, but the art style is just too distracting and distracting. It just ruins the experience for me. I wish they'd just cut out the art and just have a movie that was pretty.  in the end, I'm just happy that I can't see this movie anymore.

I mean, it was a lot of people talking about the same thing. It didn't feel like the movie was very interesting. The only time I was actually interested in the movie is when I saw all of the "starring" cast members in their underwear (I think it was Michael Shannon in a swimsuit). The acting in this movie was pretty bad, and it seemed like they really did not try to make the movie interesting at all. I also have a hard-time watching a movie where the main character is an "evil genius." It's just not that interesting. I would have liked to see some more action, but there wasn't a lot to see. The movie was boring and slow. I was really surprised by how long this movie is. I expected it to be shorter because it was an old movie, and I thought they were going to go out of their way to make it shorter. It just wasn't worth it.

It's about two teenage boys, who live in the city, who meet on a bus and have to figure out if they want to be in a band together. They go to a party, where the two of them meet each other and the whole thing is about love and sex and the kind of people you can get on a date with. There's a scene where they are kissing and it's really hot. I mean, it's not really that great a movie. It was made for money. It has nothing to do with the movies I love. I don't like the film. I wish I had never seen it. I'll be dead before I watch a movie again. It doesn't matter if it's good or bad. I would never watch a film again because of this. I was going to write a review about this movie, but I decided to do a different kind of review: "This is a movie that would be better to forget." -Cameron D., from the UK  I remember this movie. The scene with the boys at the party was really nice. -Chris C., from California, United States  Wow, I've never seen a movie like this one. -E.S., from Texas, United State  It was a very interesting movie, I never saw it. -Paul W., from Indiana, United  When I was about 12 years old, I saw this film for the first time, and it was the first film I ever saw. The love scene was something else. -Beth A., from Louisiana, United Stated  That was the most intense sex scene I ever seen, and the actors are really cute, and I loved the way the director took the time to make this scene special, and make the boys really sexy and look like they were in love. -Mary M., from Arizona, United
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________  The worst film I have ever seen. I was shocked, shocked, SHOCKED, that the director of this film was so much more talented than the writer of this script. This movie was a mess, full of horrible acting, bad writing and a lot of horrible action scenes. There was a scene in this movie that was so awful, I thought it was going to be a parody of some other movie and it was so bad, that I felt I was watching a movie from the 80s, or from the 50s. It was the worst scene in the entire movie. The only reason why I'm giving it a 2 is because it had one of the best final lines of the movie, which was a surprise, because the whole movie was so terrible. I guess the director was too excited to get the movie made and didn't stop himself from making this awful film. I would not recommend this movie.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ Why are you looking at me? Why are those two people with the sunglasses doing this? I thought they were supposed to be the bad guys. No way. If the bad guy is looking at you, then you're going to have a problem. You've got to be more smart than that. The two of them are going to think that we're stupid. If we were stupid, we wouldn't have to put on the sunglasses. It's stupid. It doesn't make any sense. Why would they do this? This doesn't even make any sort of sense. And it's not even the worst one in the series. I guess the best one was the other one. The one with the girl with the glasses. She has a different problem than us. It was more about the fact that the bad person in this movie was supposed to have been killed. The fact that he was supposed... He's supposed to die. That's why he had to wear that costume. The bad guy was supposed in that movie to die and the girl was supposed never to see him again. It makes no sense. It just doesn't. If you're supposed to kill the baddie, why are you wearing a mask? Why is she wearing a costume? She doesn't have a costume. I don't know what she's doing in the movie. She just comes in one day. She doesn,t say anything. I wonder why she's in there. What is she supposed to do? She's supposed not to see the badguy die? That doesn't sound like a girl to me. But she's a little girl, so I don' t think so. It does make no sense, it just makes no... No way! It's supposed... She was supposed not... It's not right. I mean, this doesn't... I don t know how I feel about it. I'll try not to think about it too much. I hope the baddies are gone by tomorrow. Oh, I see. I get it. That is good. I can live with that. I'm sorry. I was just going to say that this doesn t make any... That's what I was going to tell you, wasn t I? Well, I guess it doesn't really matter. I won't have time to think of anything else, anyway. I just wanted to say... I really hope the good guys are gone tomorrow. I really, really do. I need to

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  Why do bad movies suck so much more than good ones? It's not that bad movies are better than good movies. They're not. It's that bad films are so much worse than good films that they become acceptable to be considered art. You can make a bad film about anything. That's the power of cinema. And you can make it look good and have a million people see it and it still not be a good film. It can be a great film but you can still fuck it up. I've watched some really bad movies, and I've seen some really great ones. And the bad ones are much worse. They have a way of making you feel like you should be sick and disgusted with yourself for watching them. It makes me feel stupid for having ever seen them. I'd hate to have to be that person. I'm just lucky I was born on the right side of the tracks in Toronto, and was born into a family that was well off, and had a decent education. And that gave me the freedom to make movies for myself, not just for my parents to pay for.  What is your favorite film and why?  I'm a sucker for a good thriller, and the only one I can really think of is The Shining. It doesn't seem to have the staying power of Kubrick's films, but it's really well done. It has a very creepy atmosphere and I'm fascinated by the characters. It was the only film I saw in my teens that had a lot of depth.  a.m. - 7/1/03  In the beginning, I was really into action films, like the Fast and the Furious. I loved how they always took their time with everything, and made sure the suspense was really built up. Then I got into the slasher films. I remember the first time I saw Friday the 13th. It made me want to be a filmmaker. The second time I watched it I was shocked at how good it was. I was hooked. I watched all the sequels and even the remake, because it was so good. Then came the horror movies. I saw Scream for the first and last time, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it blew my mind. Then The Blair Witch Project, and that movie really changed my life. The fact that they used real actors and shot in the woods was incredible. The movie was scary as hell, but they also made it look like
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________ If you enjoyed this review, would you consider sharing it with someone you know?  You can help by clicking here to share this review with a friend!  (The review for "Paint Your Wagon" was completed on May 30, 2016.)  I am not one to use words like "terrible" or "bad" in describing a movie, but I am not going to lie and pretend that "Pitch Black" was not bad. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who wants to watch it. I will say that the movie is a horror movie at its core. And while I enjoyed the movie a little, it does have a few problems that are not easily fixable.   In the beginning, the story is told through a conversation between two characters. As the story progresses, it is revealed that the conversation is between a woman and a man who have been kidnapped by the same creature (they know they will die if they tell anyone, but it is a very emotional conversation and the woman is determined to keep it from getting out). The main character has a very difficult time communicating with the creature. He is also being forced to kill people and has a hard time with the fact that the creatures will try to kill him in the same way it has killed other people. The main story line of the movie consists of the main character, who is being tortured by the creature, and his friends trying to figure out what is happening to him. The movie never does any real detective work and it doesn't really make much sense. The story lines also consist of the characters, who all seem to have a lot of potential but then go out of their way to mess things up. I found myself wondering if there is any way to save the main characters other than making them kill each other. The ending to the movie left me wondering what would have happened if the main female character had not had to be tortured by a creature.  ,  The movie is also a little too long. The first act is a good way to get a feel for the story, and then it just jumps ahead in a hurry. I would have liked a little more time to develop the characters. There are a few different characters who all have different personalities. It seems that the story line could have been more interesting if there was more time devoted to developing them and making them a little less forgettable.   is a little slow at times. I didn't have
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ Let's just say I had no interest in a sequel. I didn't think the film was worth the time. _________________________ Do you like horror movies? ________________________  2) Don't let this movie ruin your enjoyment of the original. (October 16, 2012)  Posted by: Jay D. on Oct 16, 2013 - 07:47 PM What? I thought this was a remake of the "The Exorcist" franchise, which was made in 1979. So I thought it would be a good way to re-introduce it to a new generation of horror fans. Not to mention, there was a great script and direction, as well as a good cast. I am a little disappointed that they didn't go back to the original source material. I liked the script and the direction and the acting. I really wish they had gone with that original film. The film really didn't have much of a plot. It seemed to be more about the atmosphere and the character development. I don't think it was a very good movie, but I was hoping that it would do well at the box office. _________________________________________________ Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that this film is bad, I just feel that it was poorly directed. If they could have re-shot the film, I think it would have been a much better film. I also think that they could of done a better job of selling the concept to the audience. I think that the movie could have had a bit more of an original plot, but that is not really my fault, as I didn the script. I guess that the film is worth a watch if you are interested in the original film, but not for the sake of watching a good movie. I'll give this film a 4 star because of the atmosphere that it gives off, but it was not a very entertaining film. ____________________________________________________________________________________  1) You should've taken this film as a parody, because you've turned the original into a joke. (January 15, 2014) :) If I have to put it into words, it's a parody. That's all I can say. The original is a masterpiece. I know it's just a remake but, well, it looks like you've tried to steal it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ It is not so bad to be alive but if you are in a state of depression, then this movie is for you. It is about a woman who has been in prison for 18 years. She is married to an ex-con and they have two children, but the husband was caught doing drugs and he is going to prison. He has been a good husband to her for the past 16 years. One day she receives a phone call and she finds out that the man she married has been murdered. She finds out he was murdered by a fellow inmate. She goes to the prison and meets the murderer. The man is so handsome, but he looks like a clown. The woman has to help him escape. The movie is very well made and there are some funny scenes, especially the killer's dance. It has a good plot but I would not watch it again. It does not have much romance or action. The music is not that good, but it is not bad either. It was just a bad film. I did not enjoy this movie. It did not make me feel anything. It left me with the feeling of being bored. I was bored to death.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It was awful!" That's a statement that could be made about nearly every single film you've ever seen. You could just as easily say it about the majority of TV shows you watch, but there's something about a movie that leaves you wanting more. There's a reason why the term "drama" is often used to describe a movie, because a movie is a drama that happens to have action scenes and that means that the movie has some degree of structure to it. So a movie has to have a beginning, middle, and end. This is a movie you need to see.  The film starts off with a bang. It's a very basic, very simple setup. A bunch of people are sitting around and talking about the movie that came out last year. The movie was The Martian and they all want to see it again because it was so good. However, the conversation is quickly interrupted by a knock on the door. The guy who knocks on the window is called Michael (Tom Hanks) and he has a strange idea. He wants to show them the movie. He says, "You can't tell anyone about it. I promise, I'll show you the movie." He opens the door and lets them in. He goes into the back room and pulls out a box. He puts it on the table. He shows them the film inside and he says, "If you don't like it, I don't care, I'm going to show you something even better." The movie is called The Martian. The man behind the curtain is a man named Mark Watney (Matt Damon). It's about a man (Mark Watney) who is stranded on Mars after a huge storm and he is stranded alone. He's trying to figure out what to do. It is a very interesting story about the way we view ourselves and the way people view us. I'd recommend checking it out, but it's not something you're going to want to sit through every day. There are some really interesting bits that I just loved. It has some good acting in it and it also has a lot of action scenes. It also has some great humor that makes the whole thing interesting. It really has some stuff that is worth watching, so if you haven't seen it yet, I'd definitely recommend you check it out.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. The movie's over-all quality is about the same as other low-budget horror flicks I've seen, but this is by far the worst I've ever seen. I've been a fan of the late Sam Raimi since I was a kid, but the only thing I can compare this movie to is "The Conjuring" (which also starred Keanu Reeves). The actors were so bad, and the script is so bad and poorly written that the whole thing just kind of feels like a "bad dream" movie. The only way to watch this movie is to see it in a darkened room, with the lights turned off. This movie will only haunt your dreams and make you feel nauseous.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ "This is a bad film, and it will not make you happy. It makes you sad, and you will wish you had never seen it. " This review has nothing to do with the content of the film, but just because of the overall feeling it gives you. This is a very depressing film. It will make you feel like a worthless piece of shit. The ending is extremely disappointing. The reason why the story is so bad is because of how they portrayed the story. This movie portrays a poor boy who tries to make a name for himself by being the best wrestler in the world. This kid was in a bad situation, because he was a very small child, and he didn't have a parent that could help him. He had to make this huge sacrifice for something that will benefit him in the future, and all he gets is the title of "Wrestler of the Year", which is basically nothing. The boy in this film was in trouble before, and now he's in trouble for something he didn' t do. The kid that is in this movie doesn't deserve to be called the "Wrestling champion of the world", because he didn 't do anything. He was just given that title and that was it. The best thing about this film is how they made him so small and tiny. I was really sad to see this movie because it's a sad story. The main reason why I'm sad to watch this movie is because it made me feel so bad for this kid. I really felt sorry for him. The story was so bad, because it wasn't realistic at all. I felt bad for him because he had no one to help him and everything that he wanted to do was a joke. I didn't want him to succeed because I knew what would happen. The only reason why this film made me so sad is because this film didn't make me feel happy. The wrestling scene was very sad, because they made the kid go through so much trouble just to be the best in the sport. I wish that they didn't use a child actor to portray this kid because it just doesn't make sense. The scene where the boy was walking was also very sad because I really wanted him to be happy, but I know that he was miserable. I'm glad that they made this film because it did make me sad. I just wanted to be sad for a little bit and then I could enjoy the rest of the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: **********   "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"  "Scaredy Cat"   This is not a very good movie. I was not impressed with the acting and I found the plot a bit dull. The story is a little confusing but the movie is not very good anyway. I would rather watch a movie that I can laugh at than a movie with no plot or good acting. It is a good movie that is just bad. I wish it would have been better.   In the beginning of the movie, it is said that a woman, named Annabelle, has a baby and a man, named Sam, is in love with her. The baby is named Lyle. Sam and Annabelly go to New York to get married. After some time, Annabelie starts getting sick and they are forced to stay in New York for a while. Annabellee becomes very ill and when she goes to the doctor, he tells her that she is going to die. Annabellle is taken to a home where she meets a girl named Grace. They have a baby named George and Sam and Grace go to the United States to find a better hospital for Annabelee. Annabellalee dies on her husband Sam's birthday and Grace and Sam decide to go back to New Jersey. Sam is very sad about this and he goes to visit Annabeltee's grave and she tells him about the events that happened before she died.     The movie is about two characters named Sam and George. They are married but not together. Sam has a wife called Annabellie who is very sick and is in a hospital. They go to a house where they find Annabele's baby, Lyle, and he is named after Annabel Lee. Annallee is very mad at Sam and he says he is leaving her. He takes a job as a bartender and goes to live with Grace. The movie is a lot of things, including a bad plot and bad acting. This movie is just a bad film with a bad script. It has a lot to do with bad acting, bad plot, and a bad ending. The ending was not very nice.   to me, it was very frustrating to watch this movie because it was really bad. It was not a bad flick, but the story and acting is just terrible. This was a movie I did not enjoy at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________ If you want to be part of the cool crowd, you're going to have to learn how to act like one. I'm not saying you can't be an annoying little bitch like I was, but you're not going to be the hottest chick in the world. The girls in the movie, like everyone else in the film, look like they're just waiting for the man to come and give them a blowjob so they can get laid. There's a reason there are so few hot chicks in porn. The only way you're ever going to get a blow job is by a guy making you wait. There are no good reasons for it. It just makes the guy look like a jerk, and you're a bad girl for doing it. The other girls in this movie all look like strippers. I was a bit surprised at how many of the other girls looked like stripper/professional models. I wasn't expecting it, and I would have been okay with it if they were all like stripping porn stars, but it wasn't really the case. This film is a little more about the girls than the sex. I would not recommend this film to anyone who doesn't want to see a bunch of hot girls get naked and have sex. This is just a porn movie that makes you want a blowbang. The last 20 minutes of the movie are some of the sexiest porn I have ever seen. If you can take the "bad" parts of this movie, then it's a good film. I will probably never see it again, but if I do, I'm just going to stick to watching hardcore porn. If the only thing that makes a porno bad is the sex, then I don't want any part of it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What I thought: ______________________________ What I learned: _____________________ 1) There are a lot of bad movies out there. 2) This one is bad. It is also very, very unoriginal and uninspired. I am a big fan of the original trilogy, and I know many Star Wars fans are too. But this is not the original Star Wars movie. It has no originality and no creativity. 3) This is just a rehash of the first Star Wars. 4) You should never judge a book by its cover. This movie is so boring and stupid that it's hard to believe it was made in 1976. I would not recommend this movie to a Star Wars fan or anyone who has seen it. I'm not sure if there are many people who actually liked this movie. 5) Don't get mad. Get even. The movie should be re-released to be taken seriously. It's not even a good movie. I'd recommend this one only to those who are fans of Star Wars and know it inside and out. I doubt a lot people will get what is going on here. If you have not seen the original, you really should.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________ I don't know if this is a good review, but it is an interesting idea. If I was the director I'd make a horror movie. It would have to be a horror film with a very old school vibe. I'd also need to make it a very creepy movie because the whole story is very disturbing. And I'd have to use a bunch of classic movie props. A car, a doll, and a skeleton, all the things that you see in horror movies are in this movie. I would have had a lot of fun. I don,t know if I will make a movie like this in the future. But maybe someday. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  The most recent and the worst movie in my collection.   The story is very poor. I do not understand the character development at all. The girl in the movie is a total idiot. There is no character development whatsoever. I think the actor did not even try to act as a woman and he had no chemistry with the girl and the other actors. He is a complete waste of time.  , I think they tried to make a movie about a very real life, but the movie could not even begin to be close to that.  - There is some good scenes in the beginning but they get very boring very fast. It seems they are trying to make it look like a real life movie but they do not even do that. It is so boring that you do not want to watch it.   and here is the bad part: it is a horror movie so there are scary moments, but most of them are not scary. There are also some funny moments but they are very brief.   for the price of the movie, you could get a better movie for $15. It was not worth $15, at least not for me. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ __________ (that's the end of my review)  (this is a review about the movie, not about the book, by the way. I just found out about this book and I have no idea how I got it. I was hoping it was a book that had something to do with the movie. I guess I will just read it as a fan. I'm really not sure how I feel about it, but I will give it a try.)   I was super excited about this movie. It was going to be a sequel to the first movie, The Crow. I wasn't a big fan of the first one, but it was my first ever movie. So I was pretty hyped about this one.   The story is a simple one. It is a man that is cursed to always be in a state of fear. The only thing that he has going for him is a crow that flies around his house. When he leaves the house, the crow flies to the top of the house and caws at him. The crow doesn't talk to him, but he has an instinctual knowledge of what it is like to be afraid. The man, however, isn't afraid. He goes about his daily life as if he was scared of nothing. He is a good person. He doesn't get involved with bad things. He helps out around the house. He takes care of his family. He's a very normal, nice guy. But the curse is something that keeps him from doing what he wants to do. He has an itch that he can't scratch. The curse is always there for him.     It is about how the man deals with the curse. He becomes the crow, a creature of fear and helplessness. He never seems to be able to find peace. He feels as if there is a weight on his shoulders, but the weight is always heavy. He knows he's a bad person, but that doesn't stop him from going about his life, doing good things for others.   a good guy, but a bad guy all the same.  The man tries to find a way out of the curse, but is he strong enough? I loved the idea of the man getting to try and find a better way. This is an idea that has been around for ages, but never been explored in a horror film. I also liked how the movie never really takes itself too seriously. The film is about

It's like a story written by a pedophile. - Sarah from Ohio  This is such a terrible movie. I was hoping it would be a comedy or something, but it just turned into a horror film. I thought it was a bad film when I saw it but when I actually watched it, I thought the writers were so stupid. - Michael from California  In a world of crappy movies, this one just stood out to me as being one of the worst. I feel so bad when I hear that a film is so bad they had to call it "Pee Wee's Big Adventure" - J from Pennsylvania  Thank you for writing a review about this. I think it was so awful, I could hardly watch it. The only thing I can say that is better than the movie is a great piece of music. - Linda from Minnesota  Just as a disclaimer, this was a very bad movie. Just as a warning, if you do not

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________.   This was my first movie. I had no idea what to expect. I thought I'd be laughing and enjoying myself. But it was more like being in a bad nightmare. I was screaming and crying out in pain. I wasn't sure what was going on but the film was too much. I couldn't stand it. I ended up watching the whole thing in a row. I hated every minute of it. This is not a good movie. It's not a fun movie. Its a horrible movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      This review is for the movie, Star Trek: Into Darkness. The movie is so bad that it made me want to quit watching the movie. There are no redeeming factors to be found in this movie. I'm not a Trekkie, but the actors in this film are not actors. They are all really good at their job and they are in this thing for a reason. But that doesn't matter because it's not a good film. The story line has no real story, there is no logic to the plot, and there are no logical or emotional connections. The writing in this is terrible. The dialogue is cringe worthy and there is absolutely nothing in this that would ever interest me. I have seen a lot of bad Star Trek films, and this is one of the worst. I think that this movie should have been called "Star Trek: Starwars: Bad Star Trek".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's like a bad joke. The movie was a total waste of time. I thought it was just going to be a cheap laugh. The actor was in the movie and he looked like a drunk. They should never have cast him. And the director was a horrible director. They made a total mess of the movie. They had to shoot a scene in a bar that was just a waste of everyone's time. The music was terrible. It was just horrible. I'm giving it two stars because it was a comedy and it had a lot of action. The only thing I would say about it is that the ending was terrible and the movie should have ended after the ending.

The director, who is a genius, is so arrogant and over the top. She does not have a very good sense of humor. The way she made the movie was like a big advertisement for how stupid this movie was. This is a movie that was made for nothing. They have to keep making this crap. She just wanted to promote her movie so she just made it as dumb as possible. I'm not saying this is the best movie ever made, but this is definitely the worst.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________  The story:  Two young people are walking on the beach. One is a handsome boy named Kevin and the other is a girl named Mavis. Both of them are wearing bathing suits.  One day, Kevin sees a man walking by. Kevin's friend, Johnny, follows him. Kevin asks Johnny if he knows who this man is. Johnny tells Kevin not to be scared and asks if he can take a photo with him.  "That's easy," Kevin replies. "I've got a Polaroid camera with a long lens." Kevin puts the camera in his bag and starts walking away. The boy follows Kevin for a bit but soon stops. He sees that Kevin has something on his back. "What is it?" he asks. Kevin points to his chest and says, "My swimsuit."  After a few minutes, Johnny comes back and says he saw that Kevin was holding a plastic bag. He picks it up and sees that it's full of some kind of jellyfish. "Don't worry," Kevin says. "It's harmless." . ,  Kevin starts running away. He runs through the sand until he sees a group of men. He starts running toward them but is blocked by one of them. Kevin tries to run away again, but is stopped by another man. "Get off of me!" he yells. Kevin starts running again and this time he's in the clear.  and  , and  (a man in the foreground looks down at a sea monster).  "What the hell are you doing here?" the man in a bathing suit asks.  I have no idea why the guy in the bathing suit was afraid of this guy. He probably wasn't even wearing a bathing costume. 's a really weird movie. I think I've seen it twice, and it always seems to have the same plot. It's a boy and a girl are going to a beach and they meet a guy with a camera. Kevin says "Look at this camera," and the camera points at Kevin. Then the girl says "We're going to have a good time." Then they start talking about how they're going on a cruise ship. Then, after a while, the girl gets pregnant and they go off to a clinic to get a license. I've always been really bad at describing this movie. This is why I haven't had a good enough camera to take a good photo of it

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's like a good movie that was made by a bad writer.  (This review is for) "The Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole"  I don't know who wrote this movie but I don't want to know. I don.t. want to like it and I don..'want.to.hate.it. I want it to make me feel good but I can't.I can't even feel good about the movie because I just want to laugh. I just..want to smile and say it was a good time but I cant. I hate the characters. I think they are all annoying and boring. I wish they would have just gone to the grocery store and stayed there instead of being all high and mighty about how much they care about each other and all. and they are so stupid. I cant stand their stupid faces. I can not stand their voices. They are annoying and they just sound like they are on drugs. I was so confused the entire movie. The plot was so stupid and contrived and they did a bad job of making me care. It was a stupid movie but the acting was so bad and the music was so cheesy and boring I couldnt even enjoy it. The only thing that kept me from hating it is the fact that it was so close to being good. The movie was so good in the beginning but then it got really bad. The ending was so disappointing because they should have killed all of the animals and put them in a zoo. I hope they put them all in a museum. That would be better than this. This movie is not good. It's like it was made for kids and not adults. I'm sorry but kids don't like movies like this. Kids don't wanna see stupid stories that are so contrived. Kids just want their cartoons and their cartoons are not like this because they are not stupid.

A brilliant movie that has been made into a masterpiece, and one of the greatest films of all time. I have watched this movie over and over and it has never gotten old. The story is incredibly well told, and there is no shortage of twists and turns in the story. I found it interesting that when they were doing the interviews for the movie, they made sure to mention that they are still trying to find the identity of the killer, but it seems as though the real murderer has a huge ego. It was an excellent movie and I highly recommend it to all movie lovers.  ___________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________   I've watched this movie twice, once as a kid and again recently. My first time was at a friend's house, and this was the first movie I ever saw. I loved it, and the second time I saw it at my friends house was in an old VHS. The VHS was a terrible film, and I loved this movie.   When I saw the movie in the VHS, I had no idea that it was a musical. This is a really great musical, with great songs and lots of fun dancing. It really sets the stage for the movie. It's a really fun movie, and it's the only musical that I've ever seen that I really enjoyed. The music is great, and that really sets it apart. I'm not a huge musical fan, but I think this movie did an amazing job of making it feel like a musical!   The actors are really good, and their characters are really well drawn. The story itself is great. It takes a lot of different genres and mixes them together into something that makes a lot more sense than just watching one movie. This movie really gives us all kinds of different ideas, and each of the characters has a really good story that makes it worth watching. The movie was really good.   the actors are all really good and the performances are all pretty good, but the movie itself is really great. I really love the music. I think it really sets up the story. The dancing was great, the singing was really great, everything about the movie was great.  , but it really does go through a lot. I've watched it twice, both times as a teenager and again about a year ago. I was pretty young when I watched it, so I wasn't too familiar with the characters, so it was really nice that they had to explain all of the people and things to me. I guess I'll try to describe it a little better now.This is a movie that really does take a lot from different genres, and mixes it up really well. I actually enjoyed the movie a lot, and there was a lot to love about it. The people are all so likable, and they all have really unique stories. It was really fun to watch.I've only watched this once, but my favorite part of it was the ending. I love how it ends. It makes you feel like the movie's over, and then it starts up again with another

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________  1 out of 5 stars. The movie was alright, but the ending was disappointing. The way the director portrayed a person who is about to be married to a woman who is very religious was extremely insulting. It's so insulting that I think she might actually believe the whole story is true and that this guy is a good person because he doesn't really want to be with her. She's very angry at him and calls him a liar. The story is okay but the end was really poor.  5 out of 6 stars. I liked this movie. It was good to have an alternative point of view.  (June 18, 2014)  I loved this movie! The cast is great, the music is great and the story is interesting. I didn't see the ending though so that's a disappointment.    The movie starts out with a couple (played by Nick Stahl and Jennifer Tilly) who are living in a country cabin in the middle of nowhere. Nick is a photographer and the woman is a Christian. They are living the perfect life. They have their own cabin and they have everything they need. Except for one problem: They have been married for almost 10 years and the wife is about two years older than Nick. She wants Nick out of the way so she can take over. The problem is, there's a very small, old man who comes and lives with them. The man is so old that he seems like a ghost. He's been living with the couple for almost 20 years. It seems that the couple are too old for him and they don't want to deal with him. Nick comes across this old man as a guide to help him get back into the picture. They don't know how to deal so Nick decides to teach the old man how to live again. The old man seems to be a good man and Nick decides that he is going to keep him. He decides to make him a man again.  of the end. I think it's a shame that the movie ends like that. I really liked the ending of this movie and I was expecting it to have a different ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: *************   I had never heard of The Lost City of Z before I read this book, but it made the first scene in the movie sound more real to me than it actually was. The movie is based on the book, which is based off the book by Christopher Chabon (which is the first time I ever read a book by a woman).   In the book the narrator is a guy named Richard Grayson. He has been lost in the Amazon rainforest for 10 years. He hears a baby crying in the distance, and then it starts to rain. It seems he can't get out, so he finds a way to climb down into a small cave, which he can actually fit through. It turns out that he can hear the baby's cries in this cave, and when he gets close to it, he can see the baby through the cave. The baby is a boy, and he is alive. He calls out to him as he walks through the rainforest. The boy walks out from the cave, just as Richard Grayson would have if he were in the jungle with the boy. The narrator walks with the little boy, who looks at him and says "I'm a boy. I'm a baby." Then the little man takes the boy out into the jungle, where he lives with a tribe of men. It is a very moving scene.   The movie was very different. The voice-over guy was played by Morgan Freeman. He sounded like a very old man who had been stuck in the middle of a bad dream for the past 10 years, and who was trying to escape it. He was also in the wrong age. The little boy in the cave was played as a kid. The scene where he and the narrator are walking through the jungle was also a scene in a bad nightmare. It was not really a jungle, but a jungle of a different sort. I was not sure what to make of it. I found myself feeling that the jungle scenes were just as dark and horrible as the rain forest scenes in the book.   The book is about a man and a boy in a jungle. The book was published in 1994, when this movie was released in 1995. The story was written by a man named Mark Simon. It has been out of print for a long time, but I am glad that it has been republished.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  "I don't remember anything from this movie. I just remember sitting there and feeling very sad and confused. I don't know what happened. I had never heard of the movie. It was a good movie but I had no idea what was going on. It just didn't feel right to me. The ending made no sense to me."  (Sandra)  Review by: Darlene (R.I.P.)  I was raised in the 70's, the era of "The Seven Year Itch". I had seen "The Exorcist" in the theatre with my parents, but that was the only time I ever saw it in my life. When I got home, I looked it up and found that there was a sequel called "The Children of the Damned". I watched it with my younger sister and we loved it. After that, I wanted to see the sequel. It wasn't until I saw the original again and it made me think, "That's what they were trying to do. The children of the devil are coming back to get them." It was like a reverse "The Conjuring". I knew something was up with the second movie because the first movie was so creepy, but this movie was a little different. I have no idea why this movie wasn't made. This was a perfect story. I think it was a horror classic. If I lived in the 1980's, I would have watched this movie every weekend.  Read more reviews
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It has a bad opening.  I'm not even kidding.    I'm sorry for any poor reviews that may have been written for this movie.  Here we have the first movie with a "big star" as the main character.  The movie starts off very poorly.  It doesn't have a lot of plot.  There's a guy that has a lot to learn about life.  He's an orphan.  His family is all gone.  At first it's difficult for him to accept this and he tries to do the right thing by getting a job, but after a few days of working, he's bored and decides to steal some money.  This leads to a great chase scene where he steals a truck, which he then steals and crashes into a train.  I wish this was the end.  Instead it just leads to the train crash scene.    The train crash is pretty great and it's amazing that he didn't die.  For a movie that's about an orphan, I'm really surprised he survived the crash.  But then we learn the train that crashed was a "hot shot" train and they had been in a collision with a train the week before.  After the crash, we see that he's got a little brother that was on the train.   The boy has a sister that was kidnapped.  She has been held captive in a cave.  And then he has to rescue her.  What's wrong with this movie?  The only reason I liked this movie is because I like bad movies.  If you like good movies, you won't like this.  However, I did like the "hot shoot" train because that was a cool name.  So, this is a pretty bad movie. It's kind of sad because he doesn't get the girl.  Now, if I had watched this movie the week after it came out, I would have enjoyed it.  Because it was really bad.  My only saving grace was that it was on VHS and I could watch it. I would never watch it again.  Another bad movie that had some good parts was the movie "Beverly Hills Cop."  I actually liked the movie better than this movie because it was more interesting.   This movie was just kind of boring.   I'm not going to watch it now.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: . I like , , , ㅡ, 티, 기, and ㄴ but , ъ, ʰ, ĕ, ˡ, ⁢, ͛,  ͡, and ᵛ aren't even on my list of   My favorite film of 2016 is "Crazy Rich Asians" (2016). A film that's a good representation of Asian-American culture and a refreshing change from the typical Hollywood stereotypes of Asian men and women.  This movie has everything that I look for in a movie: Asian-Americans in their prime, a good plot, a diverse cast, a decent amount of action and some decent jokes. The acting is good. . The story is well written and has a few twists that were unexpected. It's a shame that this movie didn't get an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture or a Golden Globe for Best Actor but it still is a solid movie. The only thing that's bothering me is the casting choice of Constance Wu (who plays a love interest for Danny), but I guess that's the way Hollywood works these days. If you like Asian women then this movie is for you. : も. A film with the same director as "The Great Wall" but a different director is a sign of a strong director. The Great Wall was a great movie but I felt that it lacked a bit of directorial skills. If "CRAZY RICH ASIANS" had been directed by a better director I would have given it a more positive review. The movie is enjoyable. The movie was shot in Singapore. So I assume that the movie was released in 2016 but it is a movie that's released in 2017. So there is no guarantee that this film will be released in 2018 but I would be very happy if it does.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________ I think this is one of those movies that should be in the movie theaters. It's a classic, but it's not a great movie. It could have been a great classic, and it's worth a watch if you're looking for a movie to watch on a rainy day. The plot is basic, but not overly so. The story is simple. A man named Ray is living on the side of a mountain, and he has to make his way back to the town below in order to collect his money. There are a few other interesting characters, but they are not as fleshed out as Ray is. The acting is fine, but the plot isn't that interesting. The movie has some good action scenes, and the special effects are quite nice. The soundtrack is okay. It isn't great, but some of the tracks do help the film to flow. The special effects were quite well done, and some of them were pretty good. This movie is a classic that I highly recommend. However, it's nothing special.

I was bored, and that's why I didn't like it. I like fast movies, and I like funny movies, so I guess it was a good movie, but at the end I was tired, and bored, I think. It was just a bad slow-moving movie. The actors are good, I mean, it's all good, the actors are really good, they are all good actors, but the movie really was really boring, I felt. The acting is just very boring."  The film was also a commercial failure, grossing only $2 million at the domestic box office, with a total box office of only $30.4 million. The film did well in other markets, including Japan, but didn't fare well at the box office in the United States. The movie did very well overseas, grossed $40 million in its first three weeks of release in those countries.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This movie had no real plot. Just a bunch of people hanging out and making out and not really doing anything, so that's pretty much it."  -- Anonymous reader on Bad Movie Night In his own review, the great Richard Roeper said: "The film is not only a very funny movie but a pretty good one at that. It is a very well made, well acted and well directed movie.  There are some pretty solid comedy sequences here, but it never really takes off, and by the time it does there's a very large section of the movie that is not very funny at all, and I can't imagine how the rest of the film would have worked without the beginning of it being really silly.  But this film is funny, and that is a real achievement in a comedy." "The movie is really great. I am always interested in seeing a film that has all kinds of crazy ideas and is funny as hell.  I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. It's a little bit different than most of the comedies I've seen.  It's got a good time going on, and you'll have a great time laughing along with the characters.  The whole thing is really well made.  You get a real sense of the characters and the world that is portrayed." A great film, if you are a fan of good comedy.  Just a good, funny comedy. "We were in this room in a motel room with a bunch [of] people... and there's this guy who was kind of a goof.  He was a bit of a character.  We all knew him and liked him, but there was no real chemistry between us... it was kind [of like] a mutual attraction.  Then, after about 15 minutes, we started to notice that he was starting to become a little more interested in us and that he would do things with us and we'd say 'No, no,' but then we'd start to go a little further and we ended up with some really good sex.  And I think that's what was most important about the film: that the movie is not a love story." --  Tom Bissell (writer) Bissell said that the film's first half was not a great success and that it was very short.  After the movie had finished filming, it was not long before Bissell noticed that the relationship between his characters and

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. _________. _______.  "He's a nice guy, but he's an idiot."  This movie was so bad that I'm just gonna make it short and skip to the end. If you have the time, I strongly recommend you watch the movie (or read the movie reviews) before reading this. The first act is so stupid and the second act was so annoying that I can't even remember it. Also, if you haven't watched the movie, don't bother watching the movie. It's only worth seeing if you already have seen it. I don't really want to talk about it. It was just too bad to be worth watching. 2 out of 5 stars  I was pretty disappointed with this movie. I loved the film, but the direction is really terrible. There's no rhyme or reason to it. And it's just way too long. I felt like I was wasting time watching this movie because I was bored the whole time. The actors were good, but it was just so long. The movie was about a guy that was supposed to be dead and now he's alive. But that's just the plot. The whole movie was just a mess. And that's not even mentioning the acting. Everyone was awful. There was only one good actor in the movie and he was just horrible. He was so stupid that you'd think he was in a bad TV show. I just don't get it. So much could have been done better. The worst part is, I don a lot of movies that are bad, but this one really sucked. I really wish that I never watched this movie again. I can never watch another movie again with the director of this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ I had no idea this movie would be so boring. I had been looking forward to seeing it and the previews looked good. The trailers did not tell me this. I watched this because it was a "funny" movie that had a little bit of humor. So, I sat down and watched the whole movie and I thought this movie was about the main character getting married and having kids. But, it was all very boring. The main character was not funny at all. I don't even know what his name was. He didn't even talk! He was all "I love yous" and was just walking around. There were many times when he would have to do his lines again and again because it didn't work at all and it was so boring! The movie just kept going and going. The movie did not seem like it was going anywhere. I was bored by the whole time! I felt like I was watching a movie and not watching a "movie". The only way I could feel something was going on was because of the music. The music was so annoying and horrible that I wanted it to stop. I felt bad for this movie because it did not deserve to be called a movie. It was so bad. I have to give it an F for that reason.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________  1. THE WOLF OF WALL STREET  (1977)  THE FILM: A very dark and serious film that was more concerned with being scary than being funny.  STORY: In the late 50's a wealthy Jewish family moves into a penthouse in Manhattan. The mother has an affair with a married Italian man and eventually decides to get divorced. The father doesn't approve of his daughter having an affair and attempts to stop her. He is confronted by his son's girlfriend who informs him of their affair and his father's disapproval. The son's mother eventually discovers her husband has an attraction to the daughter. .  a. A Jewish man (Max von Sydow) has a falling out with his wife. (1971) a. A father (Martin Landau) falls for a beautiful actress (Mary Steenburgen). (1973) b. A young Jewish man and a Catholic man (Robert Redford) are both obsessed with the same woman (Steenburgen), who they meet while on vacation. b-a. Jewish man is obsessed with a young woman. The story is about the Jewish man who meets the Catholic man, and what happens after the marriage. Both of these characters have their own issues that they must deal with. The Catholic man is a little more sympathetic and more open to his feelings towards the Jewish woman. The Jewish man doesn't want to deal with the issues that the Catholic Man has. The two men can't stand each other, and when they are on vacation in Europe the Jewish Man wants to go on the trip with the Catholic, but the Catholic won't let him. I found this film very disturbing, and the characters were pretty creepy. The character of the Jewish guy was the most realistic of them all. The other characters were not as realistic. The only character that was believable was the Jewish boy's girlfriend. "The Wolf of Wall Street" is a very dark movie. The acting is all over the place, and it was a little difficult to follow along with the story. It was really hard to tell what was going on, because it seemed like every scene was so crazy. The director of the movie was Martin Scorsese, and he did a great job of making this film. There is some great acting in this film, and Scorsia does a great impression of a rich man. The characters are all interesting and have

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________  "Citizen Kane" is a film about a film that was made about a movie. It is a fascinating, tragic, and wonderful film. I cannot praise this film enough. It has great acting, great directing, a great plot, and a great soundtrack. It was shot in a way that you could never imagine a modern Hollywood movie being shot. It may have been the best made film ever made. It's just that it was made in the 60's, when there was not that much innovation in film. It would be interesting to see how the film looks today, but that would take more than one viewing. It will not be for everyone, but if you love movies, you need to see this. It shows the amazing power of film and filmmaking.  3/5 stars  ________________________________________________  5/5 Stars  The following movie review was written by a guest reviewer:   "This film is a classic of American cinema. It should be seen by every movie lover. It features some of the greatest actors in the history of Hollywood and some of our greatest directors. If you love Hollywood movies this is a must see. If the above sentence was not enough for you, then you will love the movie. This movie is the definition of a masterpiece. This is the greatest film of all time. I would love to give this movie a 5 star rating, but I just cannot because it is not perfect. If it was perfect, it would be my favorite film ever. This film is just a movie."  - John  Advertisements

That will be so much better than if you just leave a negative and say, "Oh, well, that was just awful." You have nothing to apologize for. ______________________________________________________  (from a reviewer at www.buddhism.org.uk) The best of the worst: ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________  From a reviewer on www.amazon.com:  "The film's portrayal of Buddhism and the religion of sutras and tantra as the only viable alternatives to Christianity is both ludicrous and insulting. In a scene, a Buddhist priest is seen eating a live chicken, which he then uses to feed the hungry monks. After this incident, the film goes into a tirade against Christianity. The monk is then forced to take a vow of celibacy. He also takes the name of the Devil in order to be able to kill someone. I'm not sure if this is a parody or not, but it's not a very good parody at all."  _______________________________________________________  Buddhists believe that there is no such thing as a "good" or "evil" person. You are simply a reflection of your own actions. If you do good, it is because you did something good to begin with. If I do good to others, it's because I did something to myself that made me want to do good. The Buddha said that there are three types of good deeds: helping others, helping yourself, and acting in a way that will bring happiness to all. If it's in your power to help yourself, you should help yourself. If the Buddha were alive today, he would be doing everything he said he was doing. He would be a happy man. If we all acted in a Buddha-like manner, we'd be a happier nation.  _______________________________________________________________________________________________________ . "If you do it, it must be true." -T. S. Eliot  I love the phrase "if it's good enough for The Buddha, it ought to be good enough here" because it means that we should do whatever we think is best. The best way to help others is to help ourselves

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________." (This is my favorite) This movie was made to be a movie about a man who goes through a divorce, which he was not able to handle well. But, there is no point in looking for the good. It was made as a comedy, and the humor is not really there. There is no real comedy in this movie, no laugh out loud funny lines. The only time you can really tell a joke is in the end when you see his wife walking down the street, she is walking with her head down and looking very sad. This movie is really made to make you laugh, and this movie tries too hard to be funny, and fails to do it. If you are looking for a good laugh, do not watch this movie.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Loading...  If a movie is terrible, that doesn't mean that the director and actors are horrible or the script is terrible. If a movie has a good script and a good director, it will probably be worth watching even if the story is terrible or the acting is terrible and the cinematography is terrible!   Here are 10 bad movies and one good movie that everyone should watch at least once in their life.  10) The Dark Knight Rises (2012)   The Dark Knight  I know what you're thinking: 'He's already seen this movie, why would he go back and watch it again?'  Well, I have to say that I was pretty disappointed in the ending of The Dark Knights.   Batman has finally been killed and the Batman of the past has gone back to his "real" identity of The Joker. He now has a new plan for revenge: To find a "genius" to give him his "genuine" voice again and to find a way to destroy the world with a nuclear war. He does all of this by taking the form of the villain from the movie, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. .    It's one of the biggest mistakes a director could ever make and I really don't know why they made it. It just doesn't work. If you don't have an interesting villain and a story that has a beginning, middle and end, you have no chance at making a good movie.   in my opinion, the script could have been better if the movie was written in a more realistic way, but this is a big movie so I guess it worked out alright. , the movie is about a "Batman" who doesn't really know who he is and ends up going on a revenge rampage because of this. But it was pretty boring and I felt that they should have been more inventive with the characters and their roles in the story. I liked the Batman who was more mysterious and mysterious like he should have actually been and not just a typical, "we have to kill the bad guy" superhero. It was a good story and I enjoyed it, but it's not the best movie in the series.  that was not even close to the worst movie in this list.The Dark Knights is the third and last film in the Dark Knight series and I loved this movie.

They don't have much chemistry with each other. The director makes some decent films but this one falls flat. The story is pretty bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ How can I rate a movie when I've never seen it? This review will have no bearing on your enjoyment of the movie, but I'll try to be as objective as possible. The story is a great twist on the slasher genre, but unfortunately the movie falls apart at the last minute. This is a movie that should've been released in the 80s. I mean, it's the 80's and they had a lot of great slasher movies, but this one falls flat. The ending of the film is absolutely stupid. It makes no sense and doesn't add to the movie. It's so stupid that it actually feels like a parody. The rest of the characters are just a waste of time. The only characters that are memorable are the cop and the killer. The cop is an awesome character, but he really shouldn't have been killed off so soon. The killer is a little too cute, but that's about it. The movie is really not worth watching. The special effects are not that great. The gore is minimal, and the acting is bad. There's really nothing to recommend this movie. If you want to see a good slasher, I'd recommend this, but for a bad one, I don't think this is worth watching at all.   A little side note: The killer in this movie does have a different voice, but the cop in the movie did not.

I was expecting something with more story to the story line but the director wanted to use a few different actors and that is why the story is so weak. If they would have made this a western they could have made it better and have a few good action scenes. They are all just set up and they don't make any big scenes or even fight scenes. It is just one long action scene. I could understand that they were trying to make it a Western but not with this weak story. I am sorry that I didn't love it. It would have been better if they had just made it a western with more character development. I guess they are going for an action film, that is all I have to say about it. This is just another bad action film. The only good thing about it is the music. 07-27-2012 ahh, they are finally releasing a real western. I thought the first one was so bad but this one is much better. It has more action, and even more action in the second half. The music is a little better. I think the director is really smart because he was able to make a Western with the story and not the other way around. The acting is just as bad as the first movie, but the actors are better. They all just sit there and do their thing. The actors that are good are all too short. The other actors are so small that they have to put the same action over and over. This movie is a complete failure. I hate to say it but this movie is actually good. I love westerns so I was actually looking forward to it. I would have preferred it if the action had been more in the first half but the first action scene is pretty good. The third action scene in the last quarter of the movie is very good. It really made me wish that the director had gone back to the first two movies and made a western out of them. The first movie was so good that I thought this would be a good movie but it was

I thought that it would be a great horror film until the end when it completely and utterly broke the fourth wall and said "Look, I'm doing a horror movie and I'm giving you a very bad one".

I will be watching this film again because it's not as bad as I thought it was. It doesn't ruin the film but you will have to be ready for a few scares. It's worth a watch but don't expect much.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ The film is well-made, but it's not great. The pacing is terrible, and you have to watch this movie multiple times. The acting is good. But there are a few things in this movie that are very, very bad. The movie is about a cop, a private investigator, and a reporter, all of whom are investigating a crime. One of the detectives, John Marley (Bruce Willis) is investigating a case where a young girl is brutally murdered and the victim is a prostitute. His partner, Bill Gwynne (Steve Martin) is the other detective, and Marley's friend, David McManus (Burt Reynolds), is the reporter. They have to find the killer.The story is told by Marley, Willis, Gwynn, and McManu, and the only problem is that it seems that they have never seen a movie before. The story is very confusing and is hard to follow, and it's very hard to understand. The music is great. Bruce Willis and Steve Martin make a great duo in this film, but they never really get to know each other. The cinematography is great, but the lighting is terrible. They should have hired a real photographer. I don't know why they didn't use the original film negatives. The editing is not very good. I didn't understand a lot of the dialogue, but that was probably because I didn?t understand a word of the story.The only positive I can say about this movie is that there are some good scenes. It's just not the great movie that it should have been. It?s a good enough movie, but not a great one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________." You have to realize that this is a movie that has never had a chance of ever being a movie. This is a documentary. It's a documentary about a documentary, a documentary that is trying to tell you that something is wrong with the world. And it has been tried to be a movie, a story, but the people in the movie, the people that made this movie, are just so stupid, they're just so wrong. It doesn't work at all. I mean, the whole thing is a big joke. It makes no sense. I don't understand how a movie could be made that way, that it has such little understanding of what it is it's trying to say, how it should be seen. The entire thing is so ridiculous. And so far out. It is so far off in the universe. It does nothing but waste time and money. And if they did that to me, I would be like, "You know what? I'm just going to stop watching movies." It's so, so, bad.  I was so excited for this movie. I loved this movie before it came out. I was excited to see it because it was a real good documentary. I thought it was going to be about this little town in Maine and it was about this filmmaker named Ken Burns, who I thought was a great filmmaker, but he had a problem. He had a bad script. He didn't have a story. And he tried to do a film about the town of Kittery, Maine and he couldn't write a story about Kitter. And that's what he did. He made a documentary and it made no sense at all, and it took him two years to make a movie about a town in a small town in America that was about 30 miles away from Kitter-y. It was a very bad documentary. And then the town, of course, was in the middle of nowhere. And the people are so stupid. They're just, you know, so stupid and they just don't know what's going on, and they don't realize that the world is different, that the rest of the world doesn't think like they do. And I think this movie is just one of many bad movies that Ken Burns made.  a lot of them have been made. And they all are awful. They all have problems. They have no understanding of the actual culture that they're trying to describe, what the people
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This is a fun movie, but it's so bad that it doesn't deserve any stars." There's not much more to say than that.  The movie is about a group of kids (mostly kids, mostly kids) that are on a school trip and are going to a zoo. They're going to see all the animals. There's a bear. There are a bunch of people in animal costumes and costumes and a bunch more costumes. There is a monkey. There was an actual monkey. And there were bears. And they all had a bunch in the middle. And the bears had a bear, and they all looked like a bear and it was just a bunch.  A couple of kids get kidnapped. There were some fights. There wasn't much else going on.  It was all about the bears.  The kids and the bears are the most interesting part.  There are about a dozen or so people in costumes that don't really look like them, that look like they're just some kid's costumes that they made out of cardboard and cardboard and a whole bunch of stuff.  You don't know who these people are.  They all look like kids, but they're all different kids. They don't look like real kids.  But it doesn' t matter because there's not a whole lot going on with the bear that's in the bear costume. It's just the bear in a bear costume and then he has to escape. The bear escapes, and he doesn't escape.  He's like a little boy and then all of a sudden he's a little bear and then there's a whole crowd of bears around him.  And he's like all the way out in the woods.  Then he's all in a line with his bear friends, and then at the end he has a buncha bears and he's running away.  This is a pretty good movie.  I mean, it was really bad.  If you watch it, I guarantee you'll laugh at all the bears and it will be kind of hilarious.  Don't watch it if you're looking for a good, well made movie.

A group of women is calling for a gender-swap of the Ghostbusters.   Watch Now     This week on The Daily Show, comedian Hasan Minhaj and The Daily Beast's Olivia Nuzzi call out Hollywood for the lack of female roles.   "We all agree that women are underrepresented in film and in television, but a boycott would be a terrible, terrible thing to do," Minhag said. "If you want to change the way Hollywood does business, why don't you make your own movie? And that's what I'm doing."  Minhaj, who's been on the show a few times, said he's been trying to get a female Ghostbusters remake off the ground for a while, but it's been a challenge.  He started filming his version in January, but the movie hasn't started filming yet, and it may never happen.  and there's a big question mark over whether it will ever happen. "There's a lot of pressure to do this. A lot of people are working on it, but nobody's making a movie right now," Minaj said.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________  I'll start with this: I have not seen any of these films. Not even the ones that I have seen, and some that I didn't even know existed. I was told that they were good, that they told stories of great characters, and were a fun watch. I am going to be honest here and tell you that I did not believe a word of it.   I have seen these films and read the reviews. These are all terrible films. This is a movie that has ruined my life, my children's lives, my wife's life, and the lives of many other people. The characters are pathetic, the dialogue is atrocious, and this movie is a horror movie.   in the beginning the characters are good. The only problem is that they are all a little annoying. I can't even remember who was who in these scenes. It seems that all the characters have a backstory that they need to fill in. The bad guy is the bad guy, and every single one of the characters that is a good guy or has good intentions are all wrong. Even the good guys that are portrayed as villains are so evil and stupid that they do not seem to be even trying. I just want to know how they could have gotten away with it. It was bad enough that I am embarrassed to even show my kids it, and I am sure that I will not be able to talk to them about it for years.  ....   The plot of this movie was that it takes place in a small town and in this town is a place called "Hell". There is a group of people in this small town that believe in a place in Hell called Hell where the dead people are burned. One day the towns people come to the town to help them fight the bad guys. The towns people are very nice and they all do their job. The town does not really believe in Hell, but they believe that it exists. When they go to Hell they find out that Hell is not really what it seems. Hell is an amusement park where people go and spend their time in Hell. There is an attraction at Hell called the Devil's Carnival. The people in Hell get very excited when they are told about the carnival, and they go and visit the carnivals. When the people that visit the Carnival see the people in hell, they start to believe that Hell really exists. The next morning they all go to their local police station to

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________  I think this film was a total mess. First of all the script was horrible and I'm still trying to figure out why. Why they didn't just make the movie about a group of men going to a wedding and the wedding is ruined by a zombie apocalypse (which is never mentioned once) I don't know but it was an awful idea. The whole movie is kind of like a sci-fi horror version of The Wizard of Oz but it has a really bad ending that's just bad. The only thing I really liked about the movie is that the special effects were good and they do an amazing job of making a zombie that looks like a giant rat. The movie had a really strange ending that really messed with my head. If you're looking for a good zombie movie then you have to check out "The Wrecking Crew".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Godfather: Part II (1972) (The first part of the Godfather series. The sequels are:  The Godfather Part III (1974) (aka "The Godless") (aka  "The Last Temptation of Christ" )  (The last part of a trilogy that also included The Godson:  The Last Crusade  (1993) (aka The Crusades), and The Godless: (1992) ("The Last Judgment")). It's not bad, but it's a little too long, and the story is pretty lame. It has a good cast of actors, and there's some decent action scenes, but the film itself is just a little boring.  I liked the second part of this trilogy.  I've watched the original trilogy (and the sequel) countless times.  This is the scene where Michael Corleone makes his famous "Don't Tread on Me" speech. This was the first movie where I was reminded of the "Lord of the Rings" films, because of the way the director cuts to shots of the main character running. This is also the first time I got to watch an actor's face during a long run, so I really enjoyed that scene. The film is set in New York City in the late 60's, so the streets look a little dirty.  Also, there are some really good shots of New York, which is a huge draw.   The movie has an epic battle scene.  The action scenes are pretty good, but I wouldn't say that the film has a great score.  As far as plot goes, it's pretty standard, but that's not a bad thing.  This movie is one of those movies that you can't really say that much about.  It's pretty generic.  There's nothing that stands out about this movie.  I'd recommend this to any fans of the movies.  You may not like the movie, but you won't hate it either.  Overall:   5.0/10

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ Why did this movie have to suck so bad? It starts off so well, with the two main characters, but they really don't get any development until the last 10 minutes or so. They are basically just thrown together and thrown off into the world of sex and violence, but the way they are treated is pretty gross. The lead character is just a horrible person. He thinks he is the best guy ever and is so excited about everything, but he has such a disgusting, filthy mouth and looks like he could eat a baby. I don't know what kind of mind he had to create these characters, it was horrible. The rest of the cast was just as bad, but it is a little harder to find. They just sort of appear out of nowhere and act like a bunch of losers, but I guess that's the point. I guess it is all pretty much the same, except for the girls, but that's just too bad because they looked really hot. They have some of the most beautiful bodies I've ever seen in a movie, but in this case, it just doesn't work. I think they should have cast someone better. There was a scene where the lead character got a blowjob, but there was no penetration. The girl was just there, and it was not good. The way they show this in the movie is horrible. They show the guy getting fucked, but you don't really see anything. I thought the guy was going to cum but he just didn't, but maybe it was because I was watching this movie for the first time. It was still a horrible movie and the sex scenes are just horrible. I can't recommend this movie to anyone. I'd give it a 0. I just couldn't stand the way it was done. I'll be watching the other 2 sequels instead.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ***********I got this film in a box with a CD with some old music. It is very short and just like a "movie trailer" with a lot of "talking". I was expecting a movie of about the same quality as the "Hollywood" movies. I was disappointed with it. The movie has nothing to do with the other "H.H. Holmes" movies or "The Hound of the Baskervilles" as a whole. It just has a lot "talking" to do. And the music was the worst. I don't know what it was about the music that made it sound "funny". It was just very bad. If you have a copy of this movie, don't waste your money on it. I am going to give this a one star rating.

I bought this movie on Blu-ray and the picture quality is fantastic. The action scenes are great and it doesn't matter if it's a kid or a grown man. The story is soooo funny. The main character is so dumb and he thinks he is cool and brave. It was really funny when the bad guys did their special move and he was like "Dang, I'm so cool." The main girl is sooooo cute and she is not too bad. The other characters were all good and I liked them. The only thing I didn't like is when they did the fight scene where the bad guy was on top of the good guys and they are trying to push the bad man down. It looks a little weird because he's on top but it is so funny. I think it was because they did it with a camera or something. Overall this is a great movie and I recommend it to anyone who loves action movies.  Reviewed by A.W. from New York City I bought the DVD of this movie from my local video store for $3.50. The picture quality of the DVD is excellent and the DVD itself is a good size and holds up. I have only seen this movie in the theater. I had no trouble watching it on the big screen and I am sure that this movie will be just as entertaining when you see it in a theater. The movie is set in a post-apocalyptic world where a few survivors were able to survive in the aftermath of a nuclear war. They find refuge in the city of New York, which is now a ghost town. When the town is threatened by a virus, the survivors begin to flee to the countryside and start a new life. But the virus spreads and as the population of New Yorkers dwindles, a new group of survivors begins to emerge. It is a very good movie and worth checking out. It has a lot of action and is a must see for action lovers. , written by Brian Taylor and directed by Stephen

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ The worst movie of all time. I was in a theatre watching this movie and i saw the first 15 seconds of this movie. This movie was bad, it was a horrible movie, the whole film was so cheesy. I mean, I understand the story of the movie, but when you watch this movie, you won't like it, I thought that it was going to be a good movie, it had some good parts, it's a little long, but if you watch the whole movie, then you'll probably like it. It's a horrible, horrible movie. I saw this movie at the cinema with my friend and it was horrible. The actors did not have a good acting skills, it wasn't funny at all, I mean they had no idea how to act, it didn't have a point, the ending was a bit confusing. I guess that the movie is made to make people who are fans of the original series laugh, so that's what they did, but the fans of this series won't enjoy this movie either. If you're a fan of this show, you're going to enjoy this, but don't watch it. If it's something you like, then watch it, but watch it with a group of people and try to get a group together to watch this, because this is a bad idea. If your not a fan, then don't, it doesn't deserve your time.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Don't make me laugh! Don't make my ears bleed!" So, you see, I think that "The Hangover Part II" is a movie that should be watched by a group of people that is just to be watched together. That way, if you are the one that's laughing and having fun in the movie, you won't think to yourself that you're laughing at a joke. But if you're a person who is watching this movie with other people that are laughing at it too, you might just find yourself saying to yourself "Haha! This is really funny. This movie is good! I like it!" That's my point. "The Giver" is probably my favorite film of all time and I don't think that it's any different for the "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" movie. This is the first time that I really felt that the film had a story to tell. I'm not sure that the story will be so important for most people but it is something that I did feel. I feel like that this is going to be a movie where I'm going to feel the movie was telling me something. I really hope that it will be one of those movies that you'll watch and think "This movie really should be on the list of the best movies ever made." It's just that good! It's so good! What do you think? Will you be watching this film with your group of friends? Or is it something that you will probably watch with a group that will be just for you? Do you like "The Mitty"? Do you have any other favorite movies that should also be on this list? I'll leave you with a final thought from "The Canyons" in which I wonder what the movie "The Lighthouse" would have been like if it was made by "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer." That's all for now. See you next time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ This is a terrible movie and has a great plot. I would have never watched this movie if it wasn't for my cousin and her friend. They showed me this movie in the early 80's and I thought it was good at the time. My cousin and I have a lot of the same taste and they showed us this movie at my cousin's house when we were little. I remember it was a black and white movie with a bunch of kids and they were all talking. It was all pretty boring and it seemed like it was going nowhere. I can still remember my cousin trying to be funny by saying that she had a friend named "Buddy". That was not funny at all. I thought this movie was awful. It's not like anything I've ever seen before. This is the worst movie I've seen. I really don't know how it is that anyone can see this movie and think that it is something to laugh about. I think the only people who would enjoy this movie are people who really don`t like anything about the 80's. I just wish the movie was actually funny.

I don' t understand why the father was so stupid. I think his name was George and that he had a daughter named George. His father was an evil guy and also a very stupid person. I really like the fact that this movie was made for kids. The first time I saw this movie, I really liked it. But, after I watched this movie again, I hated it. I hated the movie so much, that my dad bought me a DVD. I love my dad, but I think I'm going to give him a hard time when he's at work, because I'm not going to be a good person when I get home.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.  "The Big Lebowski" is a movie that is made for a wide audience. But it seems like a lot of people are not getting it. This movie was released in 1995 and is still available on video. It is a very funny movie, and I am sure it was well received at the time. However, there is a lot to be said about the film that has not been said. The movie is about a guy who is going through a divorce. He has been living with his estranged wife, and she has moved in with her boyfriend. Their relationship is not as close as they would like. It seems that they are having trouble falling in love. The Big Lebowksi has come to the rescue of the couple and tells them that their love is strong enough to overcome all of the difficulties. I loved this movie. It has a great story, and it is funny. There is a scene where a guy comes to a bar and tells a waitress, "I just got the biggest present I have ever gotten in my life. It's a beautiful woman. She was in a car accident, but she is a survivor, and now she's in my arms."  If you like a movie with lots of great moments, and a good cast of characters, and funny dialogue, then "The Big LoBowski" will be right up your alley. It will make you laugh and will make your heart melt. This is a must see movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. You have to be willing to admit that it's a crappy movie. I was hoping for a movie that would give me a new understanding of how my life would be different, or at least a new perspective. It doesn't do either. It's just a story that happens to have some real drama in it. There are some really interesting characters, but it's really hard to care about them or care about the plot. You are just supposed to be in it for the ride. You don't care who is killed. You just want to watch the main character do all of the crazy things he does. He just makes everyone's lives worse. And, of course, it's about time he dies. That's the entire point. He's a loser and he just wants to be left alone. It was a pretty crappy movie that I could do without.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It has to be good to be worth talking about.  The reason that I can talk about it is that I watched it, and I enjoyed it.    This movie has a few great scenes and great characters.  This is an underrated movie, but it is definitely worth watching if you're in the mood for a good action movie.  The action scenes are very good and the action is pretty great.  I loved the way the characters acted, they all looked so real.  For a film that's about a terrorist, I found the action scenes to be realistic.  It was very difficult to pull the trigger on the terrorists, but they did.  One of the best things about this film is that it's not about the action, it's about the characters.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ It's like an hour and a half of the same movie with a couple of different characters. It's a pretty lame movie, but it's not a bad one. I think the plot is fairly bad, but not bad enough to ruin the movie. The acting was great though. The music was pretty good as well.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't good, it's not bad, it just sucks. It's a movie where you are not supposed to like the main character, but you don't even want to be near her. She's a cold bitch who is constantly getting pissed at everyone for no reason. This film is a real train wreck, and it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. It is a train wreck from start to finish, and the characters are as one-dimensional as the plot.  The acting in this movie is terrible, it was terrible. It was like they were trying to act like they're in a movie and they couldn't do it. I have never seen a film with a more horrible acting than this. The only reason the characters even have personalities in this film is because they are being filmed for the camera. It didn't work at all. I am a fan of David Tennant as a lead, but he couldn't act in this. He acted like a robot.  I found the plot to be extremely stupid. They are filming a documentary about a murder case and they want to figure out who did it, so they hire a private detective to figure that out. This private detective is called "Detective Harry Lime" and he has a friend named "Det. John C. Lime". Harry Lime and John C Lime have a history, and John has to make the case that Harry Lime is the killer. This is a very stupid plot. It doesn't make sense. It isn't even funny. It makes no sense. I could have made the same argument about the movie as I did about the book. The characters are like characters in a book and the plot is like a book. It made no sense, and I can't explain how stupid it was. This movie was made by a man who is a fan and knows the book, but didn't even try to understand the book's story. This was a movie made by someone who didn't read a book in a while and doesn't know how to read. It wasn't even entertaining. This isn't bad. This doesn't even deserve a 2/10. This deserves a 1.5/10 because this is a film made by people who have never read the book or know the characters. This makes the movie much worse than it should have been. I don't recommend this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________ If you love bad movies and you hate the movie you're about to watch, this review is for you. I hope you enjoy it. I've never really had a favorite movie, but there were a few movies I always wanted to watch and had a hard time deciding on them. I liked this movie because it's funny, well written and, most of all, has a great soundtrack. If you're a fan of the comedy genre, I'm sure you'll like it. The movie was filmed on location in the desert, and it was shot in a way that's almost as if the filmmakers tried to make it look like a real desert scene. It was the desert of the movie, with a few desert plants. The scene where the two guys get lost in the middle of the desert was especially interesting. I would definitely recommend this movie for those who enjoy a good laugh and a good story. The soundtrack is also great. It's not a great score, but it's definitely the best score for a bad horror movie I've ever heard. The ending was just a little too cheesy for my taste, but I guess it could have been an ending to a very good movie. It just made it seem like the movie was a little rushed. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who loves a good horror movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not saying that I wouldn't give this movie a chance.  My friends had a blast at it and I'm sure there are some cool kids in there.  It's one of those movies where you want to laugh and then be pissed at it for being so awful.  It's like when you're sitting on the couch and the neighbor starts yelling at you about his dog that keeps barking.  If I were in his shoes, I'd be yelling back at him, "Hey!   I want a picture with you!"  I think the movie was really good and I think it would be a great summer movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ This is a very long movie. I thought the plot was very good, with a great cast of characters. It was really hard for me to decide whether to like the movie or not. The acting was so bad that it really felt like the director wanted the film to be about a real person rather than a "movie". The movie is supposed to be a real life story but the way they were acting made it seem like they were trying to get a laugh from the audience. The scenes in the park and in the restaurant were just too short. They are in this park and they are not even talking to each other. It just felt so phony. The only thing I liked about this movie was the ending. It gave me a sense of hope and made me feel sorry for these kids. If I was there and I had to do it over again, I would have taken the same attitude and acted like a child instead of being an adult.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Do yourself a favor and don't read a bad review. Read some good reviews of bad movies and you will be better for it.   -Maurice Chevalier   The only reason to watch this movie is for the scenes where they drive up in a helicopter and make a bomb.   The movie has some good action scenes. The best action scene was the helicopter scene where they are driving up to a building and they blow it up.   and for the love of God, don't watch this after you have eaten or drunk. It has a lot of people drinking and eating and driving, so if you don't have a car, you might have to walk.  ...   "I don't want to be a hero anymore. I want to just be me."   If you want a good movie about a girl and a boy trying to make it, this movie has a good ending.   I would recommend this to a younger audience and also if you love action movies. It is a good action movie. It does have a little bit of a sexual subplot. It also has some pretty good acting.   "What the hell is this movie about?"   It is about a young girl and her boyfriend trying to survive in the world of drugs.  , March 25, 2005; 4:55 PM,

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ The first movie I saw was a great horror film. The second movie I watched was a terrible piece of crap that took me out of the film completely. This is the third movie in the series, and it has the potential to be a good movie. It has some great acting, and a great script. The main problem is that it is completely unnecessary. The ending is very unsatisfying. The movie has been made to make a big point about the Holocaust, but this movie does not give a shit about the real history. It is a big cheap action movie that could have been great if it was in a good story. It was not, and instead I felt that the film was just a cheap rip off of The Sixth Sense. I was really expecting a good film here, but instead I got a waste of time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ The film is a collection of clips that show various aspects of life on the moon. In one clip we see astronauts sitting in a room with a table, a big black hole in the middle, and the moon in the background. I'm not going to give it much credit because it's just a clip but it still looks interesting. The clip ends with the words "The best time we ever had". This one really struck a chord with me because it shows the life that astronauts have on the planet, and how it's very hard for them to do things on the space station, and we have no idea how long they will be there. The astronauts are in their comfort zone, and they get to enjoy their life a little. I didn't care for the other clips that were in the film, but this clip was very interesting. The next clip is of a test rocket that was being built. In the background we see a bunch of people talking about how good the rockets were. I think the rockets really are great. In this clip we hear the words: "The rocket will take you up to the moon, and you will come back down on Earth." The people in the scene are talking about what they are going to do with the rockets. I really like the line "It will take us back to our planet". This clip is one of my favorites. This is what we would see on Earth if we were to go to the Moon. The rocket takes off, and as it reaches its top speed, we see the Earth moving away from it, and into the sky. I like the fact that they are talking so much about what will happen if we go to Moon. If we do, I hope that we'll see the real thing. I'd also like to see some of the other Earth-bound rockets being made, or at least a small scale model. Another clip shows a little girl playing in the sand with a toy rocket. I was not a fan of this clip. I thought it was boring. I mean, she is playing with a rocket. The only reason she has the rocket is because she can't find a rocket to play with, but that does not make it a very good clip. There is another clip where we see several people in a group talking about space. We see them laughing and joking about how cool it is to be on the Moon, and then we see them looking at a little planet with a big ball. They

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________.   You've probably seen it, or heard of it, at one point or another. But I still love the movie. The movie is called "The Last Temptation of Christ", and it's a pretty damn good movie. It stars Tom Hanks as a preacher who goes to a "Christian" conference. The preacher goes to hell, but in the movie, the hell is hell. And when the preacher's son (the titular "Christ") returns home and tells his dad that the guy he knows as his father is in hell, the dad decides that he is going to hell too. He decides to find a way to get his son to hell. He finds an old book of prayers from the time of Christ, and he goes and reads them, and then he says these words:   "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as you will."   It turns out that the "Christ" is his own son, and that his dad has made a deal with the devil to get him back to heaven. And that's what the movie is about. This movie is the first of a series of movies called "Last Temptations", and the movie's plot is a lot like the plot of "The Da Vinci Code". I'm sure that many of you have seen that movie, and if you haven't, I hope that you have. It's a good movie, but the "Last" movies have a more spiritual and Christ-like feel to them. And the " Last Tasks" are no exception.  -   The Last Testament of Christ (1991) is another movie about a preacher going to a conference on a mission trip. But this time, the preacher has a problem. He is trying to get a kid to hell because his dad got him drunk one time. The kid has a pretty good personality. The only problem is that his brother, the kid's friend, doesn't think the kid is really all that great. The "Last Testament" is about how a Christian is supposed to deal with those kinds of issues. It starts off with a Christian father (the movie's "Christ", who's name is actually Michael) saying that he was "lucky" because his kid was a nice kid. The father tells his son that he should go and "suck it up" and get drunk and "live the life of a drunk
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can only imagine the frustration of a moviegoer when he/she is looking forward to a movie, only to see that it is the complete opposite.  You are waiting for the movie to start and then it happens.   But not this movie.  This movie is so much better than expected.  It does not have the same feel of The Matrix or any other movie of that nature.  The movie does not make you feel so much as you should when you watch it.  In the beginning you think it is just going to be the same old Matrix with a different name.  But it does not happen.  They did a good job of creating this movie and it is not just like any other Hollywood movie. I have seen this movie 3 times.  I have been in the theater 3 times and I have not had the same feeling like I did the first time.  There is more action and action than any movie that has been made in the last few years.  A movie that I feel is going to change the way people think about movies.  To be honest this movie makes me want to watch a lot of other movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ (Spoilers) The worst thing I can say about this movie is that I didn't really like it at all. This movie is terrible. There is nothing good about it. There are so many horrible things in this movie that it makes it a shame that this movie was even made. I'm glad that people will find out about this film and not watch it again. There were so many things wrong with this movie. There was too much action and not enough plot. There's a big mistake that happens in the movie, which is why I didn;t like it. I was also really disappointed with the movie's characters. There wasn't anything about them that made me feel like I could care about them. There weren't any good characters in this film. The one good thing about this is that there are some scenes in the film that are really funny and you will enjoy them. I didn' t like how the character's were treated. I don't think the director really knows how to act. When the character was acting and he did something wrong, it was really hard to understand what he was thinking or what he meant. I think he should have gone more for the comedy and less for the acting. Also, there was something wrong with the film's music. There doesn't seem to be any good music in this. There didn't seem like there was any good sound effects. I guess I didn" t like the way that they used the music. Overall, this was a really bad movie. I really enjoyed watching this movie, but I don;t think that I will ever watch it ever again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________, and then you can say I'm a bad person for liking it. You're a sad sack. Don't let me talk you into watching this crap. I'll get to the good in a minute.   Here's the story: A little girl (Reeve Carney) falls off her bicycle and ends up in a world of magic, adventure, and danger. The story revolves around her as she learns about what it means to be a magical girl. She is a special person with powers of her own, and the power to become a hero and save the world. She learns that if she can get through a magical portal that exists in her house and save a young girl, she will become a magical hero as well. She's not the only one with powers though, and she meets other magical girls and they try to help her become a heroic girl of her world as well...   The art and animation are decent, but nothing to write home about. The backgrounds are a little on the boring side for a magical world, and not very well done in general. The music is forgettable, and I think the voice acting was pretty bad. I don't have any complaints about the art, but I do have a few complaints about how the story was written. The characters were so poorly developed that I was unable to sympathize with them. I had absolutely no clue who they were, and even when they were in a scene, it wasn't really explained why they were there. They were just there. There wasn't any real action, there was no real danger. They didn't really do anything, and it just felt like a drag to see them all go to work.  , and when I say "go to work", I mean they just sit there and do nothing. I can't remember a single fight scene, and they had to have had a lot of CGI to make that happen, and while I know that you're supposed to make the CGI look real, I just couldn't take it. The CGI looked too real, and made me feel as though it wasn  the CGI looked real, but it wasn: It was a little bit disappointing that the CG in this movie was very poor, and just seemed like they just couldn  t do anything right.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________  1- A few months back, I was driving to the mall with my wife and daughter to pick up a gift for my wife's birthday. We were in a hurry and I was having a very hard time staying focused on the road. At one point, I thought I saw a large, red truck behind us. The car I was in suddenly went from normal speed to 100 mph, and then I lost my sense of direction completely. I eventually realized I was going the wrong way on the highway and that the highway was in a tunnel. The truck was driving directly in front of me. I did not stop in time and my car hit a guardrail. I had to crawl out of the car and had to climb over a fence and then crawl under a guard rail in the next lane. It was very dark and I couldn't see the truck until it passed me. The passenger side was almost completely crushed and the windshield was smashed in. The entire passenger side of my car was crushed. It took a long time to get the damage repaired. The damage was not so bad, but it was quite expensive.   2- The night of my wedding, my wife is very allergic to cats. On our wedding day, she was crying and crying and sobbing. I took her out to the garage and she told me that a cat had bitten her, and that she was afraid she would not be able to get married. I told her I'd have to find a solution. I decided to find out if the cats at our neighbors had any allergies and if the neighbor's dogs were allergic. I walked the dog at the neighbor who had the cat. It had a strong allergic reaction to the dog and she screamed at me for letting the dog out. I knew I had a problem. I brought my wife in and asked her if she was OK. She said, "I don't want to go into the garage, but I'm OK." We called the neighbors and told them that the cat had bit her and that I had brought her in. They told me it was very serious and that my wife was having seizures. I was very worried and called my physician.  , I got the prescription. The cat had been neutered and had a rabies shot. The prescription was for an anti-fungal medicine, but they gave me a little bit of it to give to my wife. I asked my physician about anti-inflammatory medications. He said
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________" This movie has been terrible from the start, and as such I've avoided watching it, and the reason for that is that I'm a huge fan of movies and television shows that have great endings. I also tend to watch these things to see how the hero copes with the loss, and this movie has that ending in spades. However, it is only the second half of the movie that was great. The first half, though very good, was just not up to the mark. The main character is a terrible protagonist. He has no backstory, no motivation, no reason to want to save the woman he loves. He just wants to save her, and does it in the most stereotypical way. He makes no attempt to save anyone else and is just an idiot. I have nothing against his character, but this movie does not need a stupid main character. It has other good ones, and they should have been more prominent. The movie also has one of the worst and most annoying endings I've ever seen. The story is so badly done that I don't know where to begin. It was not very convincing at all. The whole movie was just a mess, with characters who are clearly written by writers who were too lazy to write a story with an actual plot. The ending was just so... stupid. I know that the writer is a fan of the Twilight movies, and if the ending was a Twilight movie, I'd be upset. However this is the worst Twilight movie ever, and I will not be watching it again. I hope the author gets fired and that this movie never sees the light of day. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  If a film doesn't entertain, it's not a good film.  In this case, it is. It is also a film that makes you wonder how anyone can watch it and not have some kind of visceral reaction.  the movie takes place at a military base and its premise is that a young man is sent to live in an isolated area to be trained in how to fight. The movie takes on a much more serious tone and is a much better movie than the first one. It has a good amount of action and is well-paced. It was also a great film to watch when you are bored or just need something to do.    The characters are the main ones that I liked. The kid is good, he really has a bad attitude, but he's the only one who can get his father to take him to a base that can train him. His father, however, is the one who trains the kids and doesn't seem to like him. He has an attitude of 'don't worry, it will be a great experience' and is very harsh with the kid. I thought it was a little harsh, especially considering that he had just seen a horrible incident with a soldier who was his best friend. I was not impressed by him at all.   This film also does a great job of showing what life is like in a military camp. The camp is surrounded by woods, so you don't see the real world very much. The scenes were pretty nice. I enjoyed the camp and the main character, especially since he had to learn to get along with others in such a hostile environment.   The other characters were pretty boring. There were not that many to begin with and most of them weren't that likable. The guy who killed his friend was probably my favorite character. His attitude was really the only thing I liked about him. The other one was annoying. He was the one I wanted to go out of the film with. I guess I'm not a fan of the 'bad boy' type of characters.   "It's only a matter of time before the bad guy wins." - Captain America   I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good action movie. It also has a very interesting plot and I hope to see more from this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  "The Last of the Mohicans"  I am a die-hard "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" fan and I have never seen the "Hobbit" trilogy. This movie is really well done, and very well acted by a number of actors, including Ian McKellen, Cate Blanchett, Sir Ian McKee and Alan Rickman.  It takes place in a future, when humans have been reduced to a single world and its two main cities, London and New York, have been separated. The city of New York has been destroyed, and it is now in ruins. The New York and London governments have agreed to have the Earth's only nuclear missile stationed on the moon and launch it at any planet that attacks New York or London. The two leaders, the President of New Zealand and the Prime Minister of England, are in London at a meeting when the nuclear launch is announced. The President is furious, as he is on his way to New York to attend the conference. The Prime Minister decides that it is time to make a deal with the President. He will give New Zealand an advantage in the negotiations and he will also allow New York a chance to attack. He offers New York some of its military technology, and the President accepts the offer. He also offers the Prime Minster the chance to resign, and New Zealand accepts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.  My boyfriend and I were about to watch "Babel" and "The Last Samurai". My boyfriend started to get really nervous. The last movie we watched was "The Big Lebowski" and we were so disappointed in it. We had never heard of this movie, but we thought it was a fun movie with a great script. My boyfriend and my sister and I sat down and got a seat. We didn't care about the movie, we were just here to watch a movie with my sister. My sister was very excited to see the movie. We both watched the first five minutes and I couldn't wait to see it. I don't know what it was about the last movie that made me nervous, but it was the last minute. After that first five minute the movie just seemed to slow down. There were only so many times it could happen before it was over. The actors started to fade into the background and it was just me, my sister, and the movie as it was being played out. It was sad. The ending was just as good as the beginning. I didn't think there was anything else to see, but my boyfriend told me to watch it anyway. We did. I have never seen a movie this bad before. It looked like someone took a movie that was great and cut it up so it was almost unrecognizable. The acting was terrible. There was not a single good or bad performance. Every actor was terrible and everyone else was so good it was hard to believe there was one good actor left. The only good thing was the music. The music was really good. I love the music in movies. It makes them so enjoyable. I've never seen anyone use that music for something else and use it so well. It really made this movie a disappointment. If you liked that music, you will like this movie. If not, you might like the movie but not the music and vice versa. I just don't understand why this movie was made. The director had a great idea, but made a bad one. The bad part was the acting. If there were good actors in the movie there would have been more action. If only the music was good, this movie would have ended right there. If it was good music, they could have made this into a good movie. Instead, they made it a bad, mediocre movie that people will hate and will never watch again. I thought this movie had potential. I was

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________________ This movie was really terrible and was a disappointment. The only reason this movie got a 4 is because it had great performances. This movie has a lot of problems and I am not even sure that the director thought it through before going for it. It is a very simple plot and a lot is happening on screen. The main problem I had with this movie was the bad acting. Most of the people that are in this movie are terrible and are trying to act like they are so great. Some of the actors that are playing these characters are also terrible. There is a lot that is wrong with this picture. The movie is a terrible idea, it is boring, the plot is wrong and there is very little character development. If this movie were made by a good director it would have been a much better film. The director was not even trying to make a good movie. He just did what he thought would be a good idea. He does not have a good script either. The actor that plays the character that is so great, the guy who plays the guy that is very smart, and the girl that plays so pretty. They all have no personality whatsoever. They just try to act cool and look so hot. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It should be in the trash. The reason it got a 3.5 is because I would have given it a 4 if I was rating it based on what I thought it should be. The acting is terrible and the plot just does not make any sense. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________  "So why do people like this?"   If you've ever watched a film that makes you feel a little uncomfortable, it's likely that this film is one of them. This movie was made by a very talented director, and he put a lot of effort into this movie. However, after a while, you start to see a lot more inconsistencies in his script. It doesn't matter if you're a die-hard film-lover, or a casual film-goer, you'll have a hard time watching this film without feeling a little sick.   One of the biggest problems I had with this film was the fact that the film made me want to give up on it. After watching the movie a second time, I can't say that I was a big fan of it. If you're looking for a good movie, then you should definitely go out and watch this film, but if you want to enjoy a movie with a good script and a good director, then this movie is not for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________  Story  I really don't understand the logic behind this movie. In a post-apocalyptic world, there is no need to be nice to each other. A lot of people are just cannibals, so you should just let them eat your brain if you're in danger. It also seems that the movie was written by someone who does not understand why people should stay nice to one another. There are no morals in the world and if you don't want to die, just don't kill someone. It's like watching a cartoon where the bad guys are always going to win. The only person who doesn't seem to care is a female doctor who is a scientist. It seems that she only cares about herself and her ego. It is kind of funny. But it was kind of a waste of time.

I hate that I was so caught up in the film that I didn't notice how bad it really was, and how the main characters were completely pointless. I really hate how some people get all excited about a movie and then when it's all over, they think it's one of their best ever.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why do you hate on a good movie? The fact that you hate it so much that you have to call it a "bad movie" and then write a review about how awful it is makes me think you're a moron, that you're not capable of seeing something good that's just not for you. The best way to describe this movie would be "Mud". The movie has no soul. It's a bland, boring, and uninteresting movie. There's a few nice things that happened in this movie, but they are not enough to save it from being a bland and boring mess. This movie is nothing more than a series of forgettable plot devices and lame characters. It would be funny if the plot didn't suck. The characters don't have a lot of depth, and they're all uninteresting. It all comes down to the fact that the movie doesn't have enough of a story to make up for the fact it's just a bunch of random, forgettable scenes. I'm not saying that this movie is bad because it's not. It is just a very boring movie, and it's very hard to watch, and I don't know why I even bothered to watch it.

You'd think it was the end of the world." _____________________________  There is a scene in "Sleeping with the Enemy" where we are shown the two lovers, Maud and Jean, kissing in a hotel. It's a very nice, romantic scene. The next day, Maitre Hulot, Mephistopheles' son, finds Jean in bed with a woman. He takes his mother aside, and she tells him that her son slept with a foreigner. Jean is outraged and leaves, and Maitres Hulots father says, "What a shame, this son is so selfish." __________________________________________  It seems that most people can only think about the sex, but in this movie, they also had to think about a lot of other things: _____________________________________________________________ "You were born a slave, Jean. It doesn't matter how much you learn. It always feels like a trap." _________________________________________________________________  My favorite part of the movie is when the two young lovers meet the two brothers of the king of the vampires. The first one tells them, "It's you, Jean-Paul, that I'm looking for." The second one says, "...I was born a vampire, but I'm still your slave." __________________  "In order to be a vampire you must feed on human blood. But, I've never tasted it myself." _____________ , by Jean-Luc Godard, was a film about two lovers who decide to steal a baby to raise it as their own. The movie was shot in Paris in 1971. It is one of the few movies to deal with vampires and the relationship between the lovers. This movie was so popular that the producer, Jean Renoir, sold a lot copies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. If you don't want to see it, don't go. If it were all bad movies, then this is what a bad film would look like. This film is full of all sorts of badness, and the writing in this film is atrocious. I found it hard to take a movie that is about a group of girls who go on a road trip to get a new dog and a new puppy. It doesn't have anything to do with that, except that it is about the girls, and is about their lives. So, the plot, the characters, the world they live in and the events that occur are the same. They are all girls in high school, but not in a normal high school. They don't have the normal school activities. Instead, they go out to the desert and try to raise a dog, a puppy, which they get in a truck and drive around. I didn't understand why they had to do this, but it is something they do, and it is not very successful. I am not sure why they did it, but I found this movie to be full of bad, awful things that they do. They also go on trips to the ocean and do swimming with sharks, and do something else they do that is totally unrealistic. The movie does not do anything that is believable. They do not really have the right kind of friends, or the right kinds of people, or they just don't care. The girls are all so uncoordinated and incompetent. There is no teamwork or coordination, and they have to make a lot of very stupid decisions. The plot is just stupid. I was just confused about the whole thing, and not a very good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Hilarious" is the best way I can describe this film.  The actors are very good, but the movie has a weak script, as well as some pretty poor acting.    "The guy who plays a super hero, is just a bad-ass.  His name is,  Bubba.  He is a really funny guy."   He's a funny guy who's so stupid and dumb that he can't even remember his own name.  The movie is about a guy who tries to save the world, but his plan goes awry.  So we have a hero who's super, but he can only fly, and his whole plan is to save his daughter.  But he gets himself in trouble.  This is the problem with all superhero movies.  You think you know what's going to happen, but then, you don't.  And, because they don't have a great script, the movie is kind of a mess.  My only other complaint is that it's a bit short.  It's only about an hour and a half.  If you really want to see a superhero movie, this is the movie for you.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ The biggest problem with this movie is that it's not a true story. It is based on a book written by a journalist and journalist-turned-author named John DeCamp who was a member of the "Deep Cover" CIA's MKULTRA program in the late 60's and early 70's. He was given the assignment of writing about it and wrote a book entitled "The Franklin Coverup: Child Abuse, Satanism, and Murder in Nebraska." That was published in 1988. He wrote that the CIA tried to cover up the existence of child abuse and Satanism among its ranks and to hide it from the public. The reason they did this was to hide the truth that America was being taken over by satanic cults and the Illuminati. DeCamp writes:  "For many years the Satanists had used various methods of mind control. Their techniques included hypnosis, drugs, hypnosis backed by drugs, electroshock, sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation, rape and cannibalism. These methods were used by the Illuminati on their victims. These satanic rituals were conducted in secret and on the victims' own accord." _____________________________________________________________________________________ The movie, though, tries to turn this into a true-life story about a cult that took over the United States and brainwashed the American public with Satanic and pedophile rituals. It uses all sorts of names to give it credibility: "Manchurian Candidates", "Project Monarch", "Freemasons", "Illuminati". This is a movie about a satanic/satanic cult, not about how America was taken over. The movie tries to present a false narrative of the history of the United Sates to give credence to the false allegations. I guess that's the idea behind the movie. The truth is that this is a fictionalized story. _________________________________________________________________________________________ If you're going to make a movie on the topic of Satanism and pedophilia, it should be called "Satanists". This movie was made with that title in mind. ______________________________________________ Satanic Ritual Abuse: A Nation Divided? was produced by David Jay Barash and is available for viewing on DVD at www.theworldoftheninewspaper.com. __________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________   The movie was alright, not great, but not bad. It was like a bad rip-off of a movie I have seen many times. This was a re-tread of the movie "Crimson Tide" that was based on a book by the same name. I remember seeing this movie in theaters when it was first released. The film did not have a good script and the acting was really poor. It is hard to believe that a movie like this was made when there were so many movies released in the 60's that were better.   I do not know if the movie was a flop because it was released in 1976 and it is really hard to find it on video, but I do not think that it was a huge hit. It does have some nice action scenes and the music was very good. However, the movie really lacked in a story. The characters were so poorly developed that you were never really sure what was going on. There was no emotional connection between the characters, no sense of the world that this character lived in, no feeling of how this character felt. The only character that was believable was the bad guy. The bad guy was a cold, unsympathetic character. The best part of the whole movie was the car chase scenes. They were awesome and the ending was great. The car chase was good and there were some awesome action scenes. I really liked the ending.  , September 25, 2011

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. If the movie is bad, you are the only person that is disappointed.  It is always a mistake to criticize movies before you see them. That is a big mistake. A movie doesn't need to be good to be great. You don't need an amazing story to make a great movie. The worst movie of all time would still be good if you didn't love it. I love movies like "Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi" and I think that the first one is the greatest movie of them all. And I think "The Matrix" was great too. I don't care if you like it or not, you will see something in it.  in case you didn`t read this far: I am not trying to be an asshole. I am just a fan of the movies. My favorite movies are all from the 80s and 90s. I also love the classic movies. I was very happy to read about the first "Star Wars" movie in my favorite magazine. I will have to admit that the "Star Trek" movies were a bit boring to me. They were too long. But that was in my youth. I loved "Indiana Jones" and then "Lord of the Rings". So for me the best movies of all times are "The Lord of the rings" (the first movie), "Indiana jones" and of course "Star wars".   This is not a review of the first movie. I really enjoyed it.   I was very disappointed by the second movie. In my opinion, it was way too long and too complicated. The characters were not interesting at all. They just stood there and did the same thing over and over again. The plot of the second one was also too complex. The special effects were also bad.   and now we come to the third movie. Now this movie was very good. I enjoyed the whole movie. This is why I liked the first two movies even though they were a little boring. The first two movie were too short and simple. The third movie was a bit longer than the first 2 movies and more complex than the second 2. But the plot was very similar to the first three movies. This made the first 3 movies less enjoyable.     The first two or 3 movies were good because the plot didn`ts get too complicated and I thought it was a good movie.   (If you want to watch the movies, here is

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This movie has no story whatsoever and doesn't even try to be interesting, the film is just another boring and generic "superhero" movie that takes a great idea and puts it to an extremely poor end.  The characters are very boring and they do not develop at all.    They all have the same personality which is why it seems like they are just there to do a job.  This is not a movie I would want to watch.  A bad idea with a bad story, not even worth my time." I'm going to start off by saying that this movie is actually pretty entertaining.  It has a lot of good action scenes and even some funny moments.  There are even some decent character moments.   The problem is that this is the most generic superhero movie I've ever seen and the script doesn't really work.  The characters have no personalities, no chemistry and no real back story.  They are just generic villains and nothing more.  You would think that a story with this many problems would make for a better film.  Why is this film bad?   It's not a bad film because it's a bad script.  Sure, the plot is bad and the characters are terrible but they are not the main problem.  If the story was done better the film could have been a decent film.   I have never seen a movie that makes you hate the people who are in the film. If you are going to read a review about the movie, you might as well read the review of the actual film. If you have never heard of this movie you should read this: " This is the sequel to the movie The Rocketeer, and I loved it.  I have no idea why it got so many bad reviews, but I'll tell you why.  When they made The Rockettier they didn't make a sequel to that movie, they made a movie about a different guy.  That's what they were going for.  But then when they started making the film they decided to add a villain to the mix.  And the villain in this movie isn't really a villain.  He's a hero.  His name is T.R.A.C.K.S.  In other words, he's a superhero that is a supervillain.  So he does bad things to people, but he does it for good reasons.  One of the reasons he does these bad
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ This is the worst movie ever made and the worst acting I have ever seen. I would like to point out a few things that I did not like about this movie. First of all, there was an alien who was supposed to be a good guy who had the ability to turn himself into a bird. Instead, he became a terrible human being. Also, when the aliens showed up, they showed up as a bunch of angry aliens. That is the only thing that I can say that was good about this film. If you're looking for a movie with good acting, good special effects, and good special effect work, then you should look elsewhere. ______________ The story is as follows: A group of alien freaks crash land on Earth and decide to live in a commune on the outskirts of a small town. One of them, a guy named B-Rabbit, decides that it is time to teach humans how to fight back. The humans are not very cooperative and they are scared and scared of him. One night, he attacks a small boy named John B. He tries to turn him into a human bird. The boy is scared and he flees. The freaks follow him and take him to a barn where they try to turn John into a man bird. John is able to escape and he runs back to the commune. There, he finds the others, who are scared too. One is a girl who is being held prisoner and she and John fight back together. B-rabbit decides that he needs to make the boy a man. He does this by turning John into B-Bunny and then into Boney. The girl has now become a man, but she is terrified and her parents are not happy about it. This is what makes this movie so bad. The ending is terrible. When the boy gets out of the barn and walks away, he is walking into a large open field. The alien freaked out and turns him into Boodle, and then Boney is chasing after the boy. The aliens take John and run off. John then goes back to his house and his parents are trying to find him. He is missing. John calls his brother, Bob, and his mother, Margo, and tells them what has happened. Bob and Margo call B-O-R-B-I-O. The other alien freak, B-T-ROO, then shows up and tells John to go to

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________ (The above is a fictional example, but I am fairly certain that it is not an isolated incident.)   (4/5) The story, character, and dialogue were enjoyable, though it had some plot holes and inconsistencies that were not resolved satisfactorily. I have heard people complain about the pacing of the movie, but for the most part, it was good. The music was nice and the special effects were quite good. But the real star of the show, in my opinion, was the acting. The acting was all over the place and it was all done with a naturalness and believability that made the actors seem like they were real. The one actor who I found really stood out was Bill Skarsgard as a detective who has a good amount of emotional depth and who did not seem to be playing the part of the "moody detective" that most people assumed he was. Another actor who really stood apart from the rest of the cast was Jeffrey Dean Morgan. His character was just so different than the others, and his acting was amazing. He was always trying to get in the right frame of mind for what he was saying and this made the movie a lot more interesting.   I would recommend this movie to people who like a good story and who enjoy good acting. It may not be for everyone, but if you like to see a good thriller with good acting, this movie is for you. If you want to see good acting with a good plot and good acting and you like a lot of plot holes that are quickly resolved, you may not like this movie. If that's what you are looking for, you will probably like it.

It was not the best I have ever seen, but it was not bad. I saw it at the film festival and was not expecting much. However, it was just not as good as the other two films. This movie had a lot of people complaining about it. This is a film that has been re-cut to make it seem like it is even more boring than it was. This was the first movie I have seen in a while that was not funny. I was disappointed by this movie and will probably never watch it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________  There is nothing wrong with the movie but it's just not good. The main character, who has a dark past, wants to have a normal life, but he still has to deal with his demons. So he does what every normal guy would do. He goes out for a girl, not knowing she is the one who killed his parents. Then he comes home and he finds out he is not the only one that has died. He also finds out that he is being watched. He is now being followed by a man that looks exactly like him. He has to find out who the man is and if he is still alive or not. It's a little boring to me. I don't think the film will hold your attention for too long. I found it very boring and I didn't find the ending as good as the rest of the movie. The movie ends with the guy killing himself. The ending was very rushed and I felt it was done so that you would see the movie again and not the actual ending. I would say it's a good movie for those who want to watch something that's not too hard to watch.

If you're a fan of The X-Files and you've watched all the movies that have been made of it, then you will appreciate the quality of this film.   2. The story is a bit confusing. Some things are shown, but they are just shown to make you think that Mulder and Scully are on the verge of discovering something so amazing, but in reality, they're not.   is a film that is about a guy who is searching for a missing woman. The whole film has the feeling that there are a lot of twists and turns in the plot, but it is a great story.  , but this film doesn't have that feeling of mystery. The film takes place in the year 2001 and it is not about what happened in the past, but about how Mulder gets into a certain situation. The movie starts with Mulder being a normal guy who has just moved in with a girl, Dana Scully, in her apartment. After Mulder meets Dana for the first time, he starts to suspect that he is being watched by something. The guy starts to follow him around, but Mulder doesn't want to give him any information about the girl. Mulder is searching around his apartment, and then he finds a tape that Dana taped herself while she was unconscious. After finding the tape, Mulder starts to get worried and tries to find a way to find out who is behind all the surveillance on him.The film then jumps back into the present day, and it seems that Mu  is a film about a man who is a good guy, and he has a girl in his apartment. The girl is a college student, and her name is Bethany. The man also has a son, who is about 8 years old. He is living with his wife and his daughter. His son's father is a doctor, and the two men have a good relationship. After they start to have problems, they start talking about the man and the girl, and after a while, the two start to argue.

They start to run from their apartment, but then Mulder decides to get help. He tries to talk to the cops, but the police don't believe him.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________ [A bit about the movie, from the trailer: The main character is a young man who is very good at a sport he is terrible at, but he is a genius at manipulating people around him. He gets very good friends who like him for his good-looking looks and for his ability to be so good at whatever he does.] I like this movie. I liked it a lot. It has a good plot. The story starts out very well. You get a good idea about what you are about to do, and what's going to happen. The guy is smart, and he knows what he wants, and that makes it more interesting. The thing is, the movie is really hard to watch. The first 10 minutes are great. The second 10 minutes get boring very fast. The movie gets very hard to keep watching. It's a very sad movie, and it's sad because it's so bad. I didn't like the ending, either. But this movie is pretty good. It got a little bad toward the end, but not that bad. The acting is good. The film is about as close as it gets to being good. I think it was a good movie to see, because you know there's a good chance it's going get bad at the end. I can't say that I recommend this movie to anyone. But I did like it a great deal. The worst part about this movie was that it was too bad. - February 13, 2004I saw this and it was good!

I don't care if you don't have a sense of humor, don't try to do comedy scenes that are like this. I mean seriously, there's too much going on. And the acting is terrible. The only actor that has a sense that they're being funny is the girl with the glasses. And even she doesn't know what's really going on, it's just a big stupid joke. It just goes on and on and makes no sense. The actors in this film just don't look right together. - December22, 2003not good at least

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not here to judge anyone's sexuality, so I don't want to discuss whether I personally like the idea of gay or bisexual people. I'm here to discuss what we as a community of LGBT people think about the film. I hope this is a useful place to start.  If you want to see a film that promotes the idea that gay and bisexual people are 'broken' and have 'chosen' to be homosexual, this is the film for you.  of course, you can see this film for free and watch it for your entertainment, but for me, the whole concept of this film was wrong. Yes, the premise is right; gay people are broken, and the film presents a positive message that gay people need to find their way back to straight, or to the heterosexual community. However, the message is just so wrong.  I don' t even want to get into all of the negative aspects of the film that it presents, but the whole 'homosexuality is a choice' concept was so far off-base. I really believe it was just a marketing ploy, and one that made the film look better than it really was. . It's just an idea that's so far removed from what actually goes on in real life. I believe it also paints a very dark picture of gay people. There are so many negative things that are portrayed in the film, and I have seen the film so many times, I can count the number of times I actually saw anything positive about gay people on one hand. If you want a film about gay and bi people that promotes a positive and accepting view of gay and lesbian relationships, this isn't it. The film portrays the idea, and it's all based on the fact that most gay men are attracted to women, and that's all there is to it. It's just a whole bunch of lies, that were perpetuated for the sole purpose of being able to get a huge box office. In the end, they were so focused on trying to get the film to work in that direction that they totally ignored the fact the film was never supposed to be about that. This movie also portrays a lot of the 'bisexual' community as being completely accepting of everyone. In fact, there's one scene that I remember so vividly, where the character that the film is portraying says 'yes, I am gay, and yes, I'm

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________   "The Godfather" (1972)   The only reason I could find to make a film about a crime family in this century is that this was the first film to show how a real crime family works. It is very different from the usual gangster films of the time and even the most brutal one. The most obvious thing that sets this apart is the fact that the main characters are not organized crime families. The protagonist is a drug dealer and the boss of a crime clan. The film is set in the seventies in Chicago, the scene is the neighborhood called "Pork Chop", and there is a very good reason for that. This was a city of drug addicts who were living in a ghetto. The gangs had been formed to help them and the drug dealers were a kind of social engineers. They were looking for ways to organize and to get their product to the people. It was a very dangerous time, and the gangs did not do things with a clear idea of what they were doing. It seems that their main goal was not to make money. They had to do whatever was needed to survive. The first one is not a traditional gangster film, in fact they are all quite conventional. They have a leader, a leader is not the main character in a traditional mafia movie, he is more like the general manager of a football club, he gets the players and coaches together, and they play a game with the rival gang. But it is very clear that there is something more behind this. I mean, the main player is a dealer, and not only a dealer. There is also a second dealer, a third one, a fourth and a fifth. The main character of the film is not one of the guys from the drug gang, he has a very close relationship with a girl from the same neighborhood. He has a close relationship, because they are both dealers, and a lot of people, including the girl, believe that the only way out of the poverty in the neighborhood is to be a drugdealer.   This is not my favorite film, it is definitely not my all-time favorite, but it is an important movie for me. It made me think about the relationship between the police and the community in the United States. When I read the script, I did not know that this film was going to be made. It seemed to me that this would be a very conventional movie. It started to make more sense, however

There were no surprises and the ending just didn't make any sense. I have not seen this movie before, but this time I will be more careful.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think it's a bad film.  It's a terrible piece of work.   I'm sorry but    the director doesn't deserve to be in the industry.   - I'm not sure what the best way to say it is, but I think the film doesn't have much to offer.  It's just a movie about a movie.  And I mean that in the most generic way possible.  I just feel like this movie could've been done a lot better.  The writing in this film is so generic.  No creativity whatsoever.  Everything is just written as if it's an advertisement for a new movie.    It's very obvious that the filmmakers just don't have the time or resources to create something interesting.  This movie should've been a short documentary about a guy who plays a video game for a living.  Instead it was a full-length feature film. That's why I say it's kind of a waste of time.  Because even though it's not good, it does have something to say.  If you're interested in video games and/or gaming, you might want to watch this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________ _______________  "The Big Lebowski" is a "funny" movie with a "great" script. The acting, writing and cinematography are all great. The movie is "f***ing funny", and there is a great musical number, too.

I don't know why, but I just found it a little boring. I guess I felt it was trying too hard to get some kind of emotional resonance, and the film doesn't quite succeed. But the good news is that it is not one of the worst films of all time. I loved it though.  The movie has a good cast and a really good story. If you have the time, I suggest watching it. It's a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.  I was going to write a negative but after reading the movie and hearing all the reviews I decided to give it a try and see what happened. It was pretty bad, but there was nothing bad about it. It looked great on the screen, and the acting was pretty good. The action was pretty well done and the whole movie was pretty fun to watch. There were a lot of good jokes and action scenes, and there were some great fight scenes. The only thing I thought was really annoying was when the bad guy was taking off his mask and the camera followed him. I was kind of annoyed by that, but I guess you can't please everybody. I would recommend this movie for a younger audience, and you can watch it as an adult. The plot and the characters are pretty good, and it has some good horror moments. The ending was pretty funny and made you think "what if?"

This is the age of "cinematic universes," where franchises like "The Avengers" and "Star Wars" can be expanded to accommodate new stories, characters and universes. The latest is the "Jurassic World," in which dinosaurs return to the big screen. But is there any way to make a "Jungle Book" sequel that would not simply be a copycat of "Jaws?"  This is the question that comes up again and again when discussing "J.R.R." The book, written by Louis Leterrier, was adapted into a film in 1974 by Mel Brooks, and its sequels are considered classics. Even as critics were raving about the original film, the film that would go on to win seven Academy Awards, Leterriers sequel was an unmitigated flop.  "J. R. R." is an epic, and it's a masterpiece. There is a reason that the book is still read and reread. But I'm afraid that the new film doesn't seem to have the same spark that made the original so successful.  the movie doesn't look like the book. pic.twitter.com/gRfP4nQxrX — darth (@darth) June 15, 2016  It's a good question. Is there any hope that this will turn out to be a good movie? And if so, what's the worst that can happen? Let's start with the film's first act. In the book, the boy (Alfred Molina) is taken to a world that is almost exactly like our own, but he soon discovers that he can use his mind to travel to the other side of the world and get his father back. In "Jungal," we learn that a man named Jareth (played by Jamie Foxx) has stolen the boy's memories, and he's holding him prisoner. After Jareth leaves, the young boy wakes up on his island and finds himself in a new world. His name is "Journey," and he learns that he has to use his "Joorish" (mind-based powers) to fight off the dinosaurs that have taken over the island. .@TheAgencyJK @DisneyTheMovie is a huge disappointment, a movie full of clichés

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I went out to dinner last night and after a couple of drinks she came home, took a shower, and told me she'd like to do it all over again, but now that she was in bed, the situation had become even more complicated. She was still in bed and I was sitting on the floor. We were in a position where I could have taken her to the bedroom but I didn't want to. I thought about it and asked her what she wanted and she said she wanted to be fucked. I knew that was a terrible decision but I thought I could still do it. It didn't take long for us to go back to the bed and start fucking again. At first I thought it was all about the sex but after about 10 minutes I thought that was about it. She asked me if I wanted to do something else, to go to the kitchen for a drink and to watch a movie. I was hesitant because I was still worried about her and the sex. I told her that I'd be back in the living room if she wanted. She started moaning and started rubbing my cock. After about 10-15 minutes I started to feel something different about this. I asked her if she was still enjoying herself and she told me that she really did. I just wanted to make her happy so I asked if she would like to watch the movie. She agreed and she started kissing me. It felt really good and I came at the end of the movie as she had a threesome with the two guys. She thanked me and asked if we could do it again. I said we'd have to see if we were comfortable. It wasn't long before we were back in bed. She got on top of me and started sucking my dick. It was nice to have a woman around. She moved her hips around and I moved my cock into her. We fucked for a while, she told him to put his pants on and he complied. We had a lot of fun but she told us to stop. She told me to lay back and told him I had to go. I had a great time with her and I really enjoyed our sex. She came up and said she had to leave. I wanted more but she said we didn't need more. I didn. It just didn't feel right. We went to our room and had a good talk. I went into the bathroom and went to the bathroom. It took me a

A young man named David (Bryce Dallas Howard) is about to get married and he is going to get his first tattoo. He is being guided by his girlfriend, Mia (Scarlett Johansson) who is also about to have a tattoo. As soon as he starts getting the tattoo, he is plagued by dreams of a strange woman who appears in his dreams. David starts to get very paranoid and thinks that she is coming after him. Soon enough, she appears in front of him and offers him a job to go on a job interview. While getting ready to go, he gets an odd phone call from a girl who seems to know him. After they meet, he finds out that she works for a big corporation. She is a woman with a very mysterious past. He also finds out a lot about her and is shocked by her appearance. When she is kidnapped by the corporation, David goes after her and they have a bit of an adventure that is pretty crazy. The film really begins to develop when David and Mia are on a train ride and Mia falls down a trapdoor and David saves her. Soon after, they are separated. David goes off and starts looking for her. After that, they go to a hospital, where they meet the CEO of the corporation. He reveals to David that he is not the only one who has had visions of a woman. Mia is also one of those people and they go into a fight where David gets a glimpse of the woman's past. After David is shot in the leg, Mia helps him out and he gets back to Mia.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ How about a good movie? _________   I was a huge fan of the first two movies, and it was hard not to be when they both ended up being really good, although I didn't know it then. I loved the story and characters.   The story is about a group of teenagers who move in with their parents, and have to live together in their house until they're 18. It's a pretty simple concept, but they all have their own unique personalities and quirks.   the characters are great. They're all funny, but at the same time there's a real amount of depth to each of them. They all have some serious problems with them, and they all seem to get through their problems. The relationships are also handled really well. They get through things together, and sometimes it's not even about the sex. It could be about their parents and their lives.   is probably my favorite of the two. I liked the character development. I was very impressed with how they handled the relationship between the boys and the girls. They handled it with such grace, and a lot of love. The chemistry between the three of them is very interesting. They really develop a lot, and you can see that they really love each other. They always have fun together, it's just that they don't always have sex. There are a few scenes with the girls that are very sexy, but it's really just a few times in the movie. They are all very funny, and even the guys seem to be a lot funnier than the girls in the beginning.  , which was released about two years after, was the worst of the three. It was a very different movie, and I was disappointed that it was so bad. I like the first movie more, but this one really hurt. It had way too much sex, and the characters weren't developed. They just kept trying to be more sexual. There were also a lot more scenes that didn't make much sense. It got very repetitive, and by the end it just felt like a bad parody of a bad teen movie. I felt like it was a movie about a teen who wanted to have sex with every girl he could. He wanted to get the girl he wanted, and he was also trying to avoid sex with his mother. It just got ridiculous at some point, and not in a good way.  I don't know if I would watch it again. The characters are interesting

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I had a great time at the movie, but the bad movies I've seen this year are the worst I've ever seen. The acting was bad, the plot was bad and the directing was bad. This movie is so bad I can't even remember who played who. The film is based on a book that had to have been written after a group of guys went out in the woods in the middle of the winter. The book tells the story of the boys who went and shot a bear. It's just like a movie in that the bears don't even move, they just stand there, waiting for the boys to shoot them. Then when the boys finally shoot the bear they have to wait for it to bleed out. The movie doesn't have a whole lot of plot. The first two acts are just a bunch of guys in the trees shooting a bear, but as the movie goes on the bears start to act more like real bears. Then they get into the woods and kill the wolves, which is just another set piece. They don't go back and get the bear or the wolves to give them the medicine they need to go back to the town to get some help. Instead they get the medicine from the medicine man who is in the forest with them. They are forced to go to the medicine men house to get medicine, because the medicine woman says she doesn't know where they got the medicine. They have to go through a series of traps, traps that the bear have set up, and they go through an old man's house to try and find him. The last act is just a set piece where the boy's mom is shot and killed and the boy is trying to get help from a girl in the village. The girl's name is Miss Munchausen and she has been pretending to be sick so the boys can have a chance to get the magic medicine. The boy's brother is shot in the leg and the girl gets killed, and the boys get shot and kill all the bears and then they leave the bear house to take the medicine back to town. They get to town, but there's nothing there. The boys get out of town, and find a house where they think they can find a medicine man. They find him and he doesn't give them any medicine, but he says he has a little girl who needs the medicine, so they go back home and bring the girl back home. The girls name is Nancy and the movie ends.

In the beginning of the film, the man was happy because he was able to carry her around the world. After he dies, he was left alone, and he had to carry around a little child. The end of this film is a sad ending, because the little daughter of the man is now alone. I have no idea how the film is supposed to end.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This is a horror movie that takes itself very seriously, but it has a pretty silly plot." "Horror movie."  (This is what they call a 'good' movie.  If you watch it and get a laugh out of it, it's a good movie, but if you are thinking of using it as a reference for your own horror movie, you're a moron.   That's what we're doing here.)    "The movie has a fairly serious plot, with a lot of heavy-handed religious overtones and even a couple of jokes that could be considered inappropriate.  But the movie is funny, in a very campy way."   This is the quote you'll see on the front of this movie poster.  I am sorry that it's on the movie poster, but I feel like it is very accurate.  The story follows a man named Joe (who's name, by the way, is not J.B. Bickerstaff, the guy who played B.J. in the original "A Nightmare On Elm Street").  He lives with his parents (the movie is set in 1960's America) and has to go to church every Sunday, but he never gets into it.  He is an atheist, but because of a tragic family accident, he's never had any contact with God.  One day, Joe is sent to a mental hospital because his father is crazy and doesn't know that his daughter (who he has never seen or talked to) has died.  This doesn't really matter to Joe, though.  When Joe is released, he starts out by getting his girlfriend to go with him on a trip to a carnival, and when they arrive, they find a large, frightening carnival in the middle of nowhere.  In fact, there is no real location in the movie, it is all in the mind of Joe.  After going through the carnival and seeing all of the "horror" things there, Joe starts to freak out and thinks that his friends are being held against their will in some dark, scary place.  They eventually find their way out of the carnage, and all is well until Joe finds that the girls from the previous night were actually in the carnivean.  Joe then goes to find out what happened and finds out that the carnivery was just a joke.  Once again, Joe's friends are still in
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________   The movie "Barely Lethal" is a horrible film. It is one of those films that is meant to be a satire on the military and the government. The story is ridiculous, there is a lot of comedy thrown in there, and there is also a strong and strong female character. It seems that the military has been making movies like this for the last 20 years and the movies always make the same mistakes.   I'm not going to go into too much detail about the story because I can see the people who have seen the movie will get the joke and won't have to be explained to. If you are one of the people that has never seen a military movie before this is a good movie for you. You will learn a lot about the military as well as some really funny jokes. I found the characters and their reactions hilarious. The movie is filled with great acting and great acting is why it gets a 4 star.  , The main character, is an officer in the army who is stationed in the Middle East. The military is trying to recruit the locals to do work and help the military. The problem is that the people are just as stupid as the people in the movies. They are too busy trying to make a living and they have no concept of what the military is. This is a story about the stupidity of people who do not understand that there is real world consequences.   on to the actual plot of the movie:   When the movie started I thought it was a parody of military movies, but it quickly turns out that there are some real world problems that are going on in the military (this is a satire). The military starts to send out a group of soldiers to teach the locals some things about the world. They teach them about the US, about how they are different from the rest of the world and how the military makes the world a better place. When the local leaders see how good things are going they decide that they want to help the people so they start a rebellion against the military forces.   is there a problem with this movie? No. It just makes a lot more sense than other military movies that I have seen. The people in this movie are so much more interesting. There are a few people who seem to be doing it for the money and it is not too bad. The rest of them are just so much smarter and more interesting than any military movies I have ever seen.   the movie also has a

The only thing I liked about this movie was the sound. I know you don't have a choice when it comes to movies and you have to sit through this to get your money's worth, but I would recommend skipping it." The plot of this film is fairly simple, but its execution is so bad that it makes me question if they actually watched the movie. The premise of the film is that a group of kids are forced to live in a bunker underground and must hide from a monster they never saw in the first place.  The film is pretty much just a series of flashbacks, with the main story being the kids trying to survive in a new world. The pacing of the story is incredibly rushed, with every major character falling into a situation that they never needed to be in.  The film does an excellent job at making us feel like we're in the kids' shoes, but the fact that they're so insistent on showing us all of their flaws and shortcomings really makes you wonder why they even made this movie in the  first place. I've never seen a film that is so completely bad that I can't even watch it, but here we are. This film is not for everyone, but it's definitely worth watching if you're into horror movies, or if you just want to see the actors playing their parts in a horrible way.

He does not even believe in his religion but believes that he can do anything he wants in his life. It was like watching a film made by someone who had seen a horrible death. The film showed all the things that go on in the mind of this man, and how they lead to his actions. I think that I would not want to have been in the shoes of this sick man.

K. ___________________________________________________________________________________________  You've probably seen this movie before. The idea is a sick, twisted, cult-like religious cult that makes people believe that it is the only way to be happy and happy to be alive. The people involved in the film seem to be all mentally ill or suffering from a mental disorder. The leader of the film is a mentally ill man who believes that if he kills people who don't believe in him, then he will be saved. As the movie progresses, the film seems to have more and more horrific elements. At the end of the movie, there are some scenes that have you wondering if the people in the movie are actually dying. This film was so disturbing that it was banned in many countries and many people have had problems with it, especially people who have mental illnesses.   This film has some really sick, sick, and twisted parts to it. It has a lot of graphic violence and disgusting parts to the movie. If you watch this movie and have a mental illness, I would advise you to watch it with a friend who can help you understand what is going on. I would also advise you not to watch this with your kids. The violence in this movie is very disturbing and very graphic and it really makes you feel bad. I can only imagine what the families of these people went through to make the movie so sick. If a child watches this movie, he will probably have nightmares for the rest of his life and this will probably lead to other mental problems as well. I
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********  I'm sure you have seen the movie. You know that it is bad. You've seen the trailers. You even watched it, at the cinema, at some point. What you may not know is that there are some interesting points that make the movie good. Let me start by saying that this movie is not for everyone. It is not a film for children. It does not appeal to the young. It has adult themes. The plot twists, the violence, and the themes are not for the squeamish. This is a very serious movie, which means that the characters are very well written and believable. The movie is good at times, and you can enjoy some of the action scenes. There are some funny moments in this movie, and some action sequences are pretty good. There is a lot of blood and violence in this film. If you can watch this movie without disturbing the audience, then you will have a good time. If the film is too violent for you, then this is not the movie for you. It would be better to skip this movie. It's a hard movie to watch and you may even cry. It will probably leave you disgusted and with some bad memories.

Emma's mother, Margo (Beth Riesgraf), is sick, and her father, Charles (Billy Bob Thornton), is an alcoholic. Laura's mother has a secret life in her job at a nearby grocery store, so she can earn money to send to her father. At first, the two families don't get along, and Charles and Margo don't see eye to eye. Laura and Ben, however, get along great, and become friends. Charles and Emma's relationship isn't quite as nice. Charles seems to have forgotten that Emma is his daughter. Charles doesn't know Laura well, and he can't stand her. But Charles doesn t care that Laura has a boyfriend, and doesn t even care about her being poor. He just wants her to leave. Charles's father-in-law, a woman named Mrs. Harkness (Kathryn Hahn), is very jealous of Emma and Charles. She has a very jealous temper and she hates Emma. Margo, on the other hand, is very loving to Emma, but Emma always seems to be in trouble with Margo. She often has to go to her boss to get her money. Emma is always so embarrassed about what she does, and when Margo catches Emma cheating on her, Marge threatens Emma. Emma eventually falls in love with Ben, and is about to leave Margo for Ben when she finds out that Margo is really Emma's mistress. Emma and Ben's friendship is ruined. In the meantime, Moomin is making a huge mistake. One of the characters is a very silly and childish character named Sissi (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). Moomins don't talk, and Sissie tries to be

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. Don't hate me, but it's not a very good movie and it's a pity to see a film that has a lot of potential to be something much better.  ___________________________________________  This is a movie that I am glad that I did not have to see. In fact, this movie is such a piece of trash that I have to say that I do not even like horror movies. And that's why I have never really been into them. I do, however, have a very strong dislike of horror movies that are not very good. Even though this movie was a very poor adaptation of a book, that is not what makes it so terrible. That is not even what I can blame on the movie. No, I blame the movie for being what it is. It is just bad, and I don't like it. It's a bad, bad movie that is just filled with bad acting, and it lacks any kind of humor that could make it even tolerable. It just feels so very much like a bad comedy that is so bad it's good. "The House on the Fourth of July" is the name of a story about a man who returns to his old home to help his father and his wife who has recently passed away. This is all the more so since it is on a July 4th. There are some good things about this movie. First of all, the acting is quite good. The acting is good. Some of the actors were really good in this movie, including Bruce Greenwood. The movie itself is also a very enjoyable and entertaining movie. It has a good cast, and they all do a good job. The only problem I had with this movie that made me hate it is the acting. It feels like the people who play the people in this story were acting out a scene in a bad film. The character's names were funny, but the lines they were saying were just so stupid and the way they said them were so awful that they were making me hate the movie as well. So much so that I found myself watching the movie to find out who said what to who, and then I watched the movie again to find who did it, and who did not, and so on. It was just so boring. And the characters themselves were not as interesting as they should be. They were just cardboard cutouts. The story was also very silly, but in a good way. I don`t know if

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________ __________ _________ _________________   If you want to know what happens when you put a movie that is supposed to be a horror film with a really bad script (and yes I said script) and put a bunch of people in it, and make it a comedy, and don't give a damn about the story or anything. Well, it doesn't happen, but you get to see it anyway, with a bunch that is either dead, dying or a mix of both.   I thought this movie would be funny. I thought it would be scary. I had no idea what was going to happen. The only thing that I remember about it was that I didn't like the music that was in it. I mean, it was kinda cheesy. I can't really remember why. It just was. I think they were playing a song called "I'm Not Sorry" by the Black Eyed Peas and the lyrics of it were, "I know I'm a bad girl, but I'm not sorry." I was never a big fan of the Black-Eyed Pea, but it did make me laugh. I guess it just had a weird song that was funny, but not something that I would really relate to. It wasn't even a bad song. I didn' t know what I was getting myself into. I don't think I even knew that this was supposed to happen, and I think that makes it even worse.   of course, I wasn't expecting to like it. This movie had a bad script, I mean really bad. There is no story. You never really learn anything about anything. There are no characters, no dialogue. There's a lot of people being killed and you never really find out who they are or why they're being killed. It's just all a big pile of gore and some explosions and people flying into the air. There was a scene in there where a guy is running out of a house and he is about to be shot. And he doesn't stop running, he keeps running. And then the gun shoots through a window and it just goes straight through his head and into his brain. He falls down and then he is gone. And there is just blood everywhere. And the whole thing was just very bloody. I am not sure if it was done on purpose or not, but they shot this movie at a cemetery in Ohio. So, I guess that means
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________ "This is a fun movie to watch and even if you're not a huge fan of horror films you might enjoy it as it is an interesting idea. If you are a fan of the genre, I would not recommend this movie to you. I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. I really liked the idea and the movie did have a bit of a dark feel to it but the execution was very poor. This is a bad film with very bad writing. The acting is not great. This movie was directed by a really bad actor. I mean this is the guy who played "Lucky" in "The Twilight Zone". He does not have much acting skills. This guy is really good at the role of "Rudy" but this is not the character that is in this movie. The actor playing "Lonely Larry" is a really good actor. The other guy who is playing "Mr. Moseley" is not a good actor but the rest of the cast were decent actors. If this guy were in the movie he would be a great actor. This film was directed and acted by a guy who does not know how to write. There are no original ideas in this film. This would have been a better movie if it was written by a real writer. The only thing I liked about this movie was that I was able to laugh out loud at the end of the movie. If I were a horror fan I would watch this movie over and over again.

It's just because I've been in the business for a while, and in the industry you get to be around a lot of crap, so I don't really have much perspective on it.

The story seemed to be a rehash of a movie I had seen a long time ago, and that movie was about a woman who was having an affair with a doctor. The only difference is that the doctor was a married man. That's it. _______. I would give this movie 3/10 if it wasn't so boring. I was so bored by it that I thought I would check out some of the reviews of it online. Well, I thought that I'd give it a try, and I am so disappointed. _____.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Good Dinosaur" is a dinosaur-based family movie about a boy named Alan who discovers that a small dinosaur named Spot is alive, and it's up to Alan to save him. The film is loosely based on the book "The Dinosaur Chronicles," and it has a similar theme of man and nature. However, it's not a good film. It's a mediocre, boring, boring movie that tries to be something it isn't. The story is just too predictable and the characters are so one-dimensional that I wanted to punch them in the face.

"My name is ___________"   "I'm not sure why they are playing this song at this time"  You need to be very specific about why you think it's a good time.   There's a great line that goes "I'm so happy I found you, I'm so sad I never got to meet you".  So if they want to get some of that, why don't they have the characters meet up in person and talk about it?  If they are going to make a movie like this, they might as well try and write a good movie.   the best part of the movie is the soundtrack  that's not too bad either. .  a good film that I'd recommend. I just wish they had tried a little harder.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________________________________________________________________ (4/5) The film takes place in a futuristic society where a geneticist has created a serum that gives the wearer super strength. This is an example of how the world has become a more dangerous place than it was a few decades ago. It starts off with a group of criminals who are trying to break into a government building to steal the serum. When they do, the guards stop them and the soldiers open fire on them. The soldiers then start to shoot at everyone around them as they are running. This all leads up to a shootout in a crowded mall and all of the bullets from the guns fired by the soldiers ricochet off of the concrete and into innocent people. The film does an excellent job of showing just how dangerous the world is. It also shows the world's society and how things have changed over the years. I enjoyed watching this film. It was very entertaining and I enjoyed the characters and the plot. The ending was very cool and it made me feel that I was really in the middle of a huge battle.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ Write a positive review about bad movie or no movie _______________________________ You can rate this movie as 5 stars, 4 stars, 3 stars, 2 stars, 1 star or even 0 stars. Just don't forget that this movie is a remake of the classic movie of the same name. The first movie has been re-made in 2011. The movie looks exactly the same. I guess this movie was meant to be a remake for all people who like the first movie. I like the remake, but it is too short. There are no new characters and only few of the old characters are still in the movie. You could see some of the characters in the first film. I think the director wanted to have a remake in order to make the money, but the story was really bad. It is the same story as the first. It takes place in the same place, but has no new scenes and characters. There is no good and bad guy. The main character is the only one who is a good guy in the whole movie. There isn't any plot or any twists. There just is a bad guy who tries to kill the main character. He is not a bad person. The whole movie is just a re-make of the first one. I really liked the first and this movie had no problem with the first movies. The only problem with this movie, is the fact that it has too many similarities to the first story. But that is a problem that has to be addressed, as it is really good movie and has some of it's own plot.

The protagonist is a boy named K-O, a boy who is sent to the capital city of a large country to fulfill a certain destiny. He finds himself in a battle between the country and a mysterious organization called the "Acolytes" led by an evil queen. As the film progresses, K-0 grows stronger as he becomes more confident in his abilities. However, at the same time, his skills and abilities are being used against him by the queen and her followers. The story is quite short and doesn't go anywhere. It starts off with K-1, K2 and K3 going to an alien city and K-3 ends up being captured by an enemy alien organization. K-2 manages to escape and gets K-4, K5 and K6 to join him to rescue K-5. The rest of the story is filled with pointless side characters. They do nothing but act as nothing but a distraction from the main plot. The main characters are pretty weak. K1 is a very typical hero with his strong determination to protect those he loves. K2 is more of a normal male with his naivety and love for K-A. K3 is the most normal out of the bunch. He doesn't act much different from the rest of them. They all seem to be the same. I found K-F to be very well done. He has a very well defined personality and I could easily identify with him. The two aliens are pretty cool as well. They are very unique. The music is pretty well done as well, although I don't know how it would have worked with this story. It's a pretty good soundtrack though. The art is also good. I really enjoyed the art in this movie. It was really interesting to see all the different species in action. I was surprised how realistic the aliens seemed. The only thing I don�t like about the art is that it looks very cartoony. The CGI wasn't as great as I would have liked it to be. I think the CGI could have been a little better. The acting is pretty decent. Most of the actors do a good job. There aren't many actors that can play multiple characters well

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ If you can't say something nice about a movie, don't say anything at all. That's the only way to be a good critic, the only answer you'll ever get. If you want to talk about how bad a movie is, that's fine. But don't go around saying things that are so obviously untrue or ridiculous that they are almost comical. No matter what, no matter what you say, no one is going to take you seriously.

I just don't get the "I know a lot about film, but I have no idea what I'm talking about" thing. It's just too lazy. "I'm a film critic, so I'm a master at everything!" is the same as "I have a PhD in English Literature, so all my opinions are right!" It's a waste of everyone's time. The movie industry doesn't need critics who know so much about film; the industry needs people who can tell you about the actual film. In the past, we were told that "critics" were just "people who know stuff". That was a good time, then. Today, the "know stuff" attitude has been replaced with the "just say something" attitude. It is the worst thing that's happened to movie criticism. It used to be that if you wrote a review, you could give an opinion. Now, if you write a review about an actual film, you're just going to get called a "hater". It's like people who are obsessed with their cars. If they are a good driver, they will be considered a good person. If someone tells them to give up their car, then they will. It was once okay for people to have opinions about movies. People who had opinions about films were called "reviewers". "Reviewers" used to mean something good, now it means "Haters".  I have always found the "critic" thing very annoying. It seems like a very small thing, but when you think about it, it's really not. It has a huge impact on the way movies are made, and it's a terrible thing. I have watched a lot of movies, and I am not the only one
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* I was at a theater with my two young children, the two youngest are still babies, so I can't tell you if they would have liked this film. It was not what I expected. I have to say it is not as bad as it sounds, and it does have its moments. But it was not enjoyable for me, and not even the actors could make it entertaining. It's a shame because it's a very entertaining movie, but it is too slow. The film seems to be on autopilot for a good part of the time. I guess it's supposed to be suspenseful, but the pacing and tension is just too slow and the film has too many scenes that have nothing to do with the story, or the plot. The dialogue was very funny at times, but there is not much to say about it. Overall, I would only recommend this movie to a few people.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If I had to sum it up in one word, it would be "sick."  It is a film about a young boy named Billy who is a victim of rape by his father, a pedophile.  The film shows us how his father rapes him in the bathtub in his own home, then brutally murders him by smashing his head in with a rock.  In a flashback, we see Billy as a boy, playing with his friends.   This is where we learn that he is the victim of sexual abuse by his own father.  When Billy sees his father raping a young girl, Billy tries to get away but he cannot run because he is a child.  His father forces him to take a bath in a tub full of his own semen.  After this, Billy sees him father beating a young woman who has been kidnapped.  This was a good way to end the film.  It was sad but realistic.  There were some pretty brutal scenes but it was done with a sense of humor.  The movie was not great.  But, it was good and it made you think.  What I liked the most about this film was how it showed us the true horror of rape and pedophilia.  I wish more movies showed the horrors of these crimes, like this one.

We were enjoying a meal when I decided to watch a movie with my kids. I asked my wife if she wanted to watch "Jurassic Park". She said she did, but I would have to pay for it since it was not on DVD. I then asked if she would like to see "Jaws" because she liked "Journey to the Center of the Earth". She agreed, but she didn't want to watch it since her kids were still asleep. The movie went by pretty fast, but my wife said it was okay. She was enjoying the movie as I sat there with my hands behind my back and the kids watching the action in the dark. We sat in silence, waiting for the movie to finish. I went to go watch the kid's game while my wife watched the movie with the kids.

I was in high school in the 90s and loved that movie.  I think it has the potential to be great.  The plot is not that good and the actors are pretty bad.  This movie could have been great if it was released in the 80s and if it wasn't for the stupid casting of George Clooney and Matt Damon.  If they had cast a better actor, this movie would have been perfect.  In the end, I think this movie is just too boring.  There was nothing great about it.  It was just a cheap rip off of "The Fly".   It is sad that a movie that was so good in the past has been ruined.  The Fly Movie Review: _______________

The acting was bad. The plot was bad and the whole movie felt like it was shot with a 1.5-2.5 lens. The story felt like a poorly executed screenplay. I really don't think the director could have directed this movie better. I just don't understand how a movie can get made and get a wide release with such poor performances.

It has some great set pieces and a really good plot. It is also a really fast paced movie. This movie is also great at keeping you on the edge of your seat. The plot and action are the main reason to watch this movie, but the other characters are pretty great too. I really think the movie could have been better if the plot had been more fleshed out. It does have a good beginning, but it really could have used more development and more development of the characters.   ___________________________________________________   The movie starts off with a girl named Marlene (Sharlto Copley). She is a teenager who is being raised by her abusive, alcoholic father (Tom Hardy). Marlene has been sexually abused by her father since she was a little girl and he has always had an attraction to her. He tries to get her to have an abortion, but she refuses and he begins to beat her regularly.  : I don't know about you, but I hate my father. : I really liked this movie! The action scenes were really good. I loved the fact that this movie had a good amount of sex scenes. I like how the movie has a lot of sex and nudity in it. I liked how it didn't just have the sex scenes, but also had a lot more action. I didn't care about the plot of this movie at all. It was all action and violence. The movie didn't really have any emotional scenes. This was a great action/horror movie.This movie was so good, I was really sad when it was over. I wasn't upset about the ending, but more about the fact I had seen the movie once and I really didn't enjoy it. The reason why I liked it so much was because of Tom Hardy. I love him in this movie because he was so awesome. I was so into Tom Hardy in this film. I'm sure he was really into the role of a man who is trying to take a girl's virginity and it was so much fun to watch him. I also really enjoyed how this movie was fast paced. I don 't think I have ever seen a movie with this much action in it before. The action and action scenes really made this movie a lot better.The movie has some amazing action scenes in it, but that doesn't mean that
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________.  It is a classic of the genre. I am glad that the studio did not want to make a sequel, since I think that it was the best part of the movie. The story is about a father, who lost his son in the war and has been trying to find the son ever since. It is a great film and a great performance from all the actors.  and there's one more thing. this is a movie about the american soldiers during the war. it shows the brutality, and the atrocities committed by americans against the enemy. and the english subtitles in the movie, are great, and they show a lot of the action, so you can feel the horror that these american people are going through. this movie is worth watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this one, a female student at a college in Texas (a state that, as you'll see, I'm not fond of) is in a relationship with a boy, and she has been doing some pretty messed up things with her boyfriend. She's been seeing a guy who is a little bit on the sleazy side, and her mom thinks this is a bad thing, and that it's making her feel bad about herself. She is pretty sure that he's having an affair with another girl. They meet in a seedy hotel room, and he does everything he can to make her feel like she's special. She can't handle it. When she tells her mom, her mom goes into an asexual rage, and accuses her of having a secret, and tells her that she's no longer welcome at the college, and if she ever comes back she'd better do her homework, and then she'll be welcome back. The guy in this movie, by the way, is a very attractive guy, but his name is George, and not only is he a bit sleazy and a little too enthusiastic in what he says, he's also pretty well known around the school as a "bitch."  And so, of course, the movie ends with the woman having to go back home and face the consequences of her actions. This is the whole point of this movie: to show the consequences that come from living in a world that tells women they're too good for men, that they're never really worthy of love. And it doesn't work.

Then, one night, he has a horrible dream where he's in a cave, surrounded by a crowd of monsters and they all want to kill him. He wakes up in the morning, and then, one day, he is in a mall, in the middle of a crowd. The scene is so bad that you can't see the movie and you can hardly breathe, and you know it's going to be bad. The movie is just so bad, that I can't believe it's in theaters. The monsters are not scary at all, and they're just there for the sake of having the monster, and the movie tries to make the monsters scary, but they're not scary. They're just kind of like animals, but with teeth and claws. I hate to say it, but it's a bad, bad movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________________ My friend and I decided to go to this movie and I just felt so bad for the people in it. I saw it with my husband and we both hated it. It was a terrible movie that is so bad it was almost funny. This movie was made with kids in mind, and the kids were not in any way good. They all had their parents in them and I found it a little creepy. The acting was terrible, the kids looked like they were made of rubber and had no emotions, they were not a good group of people. I am sure that if this movie was to get a release today it would be terrible and I can guarantee that a child will die if they watch this movie. It is a horrible movie and it should never be seen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't get over how terrible this movie is. It's just awful, and there is no hope that it will ever get released on DVD or on Netflix. The only way you'll be able to watch this terrible film is if you are a collector of low budget horror. I don't recommend you watch this movie at all. I mean, who the heck thinks it's a good idea to make a movie about the Devil, but also has to go through a boring story of a guy who is trying to save his girlfriend from the Devil? I'm not saying this movie was bad, but this was not what I was expecting. The worst thing about this movie, is that the movie doesn't have an ending. I can't wait for the DVD/Netflix release of this horrible movie. I hope that this bad movie will never be released on the internet.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________  "Don't you have something better to do? Don't you want to be a movie star?" I was asked at a friend's party, after watching a movie that I hated. "Oh, you're not one of those people," I told him, "that's what they say when you hate a movie."  I was right. And, more importantly, I was also right that there was no way to know which of my friends were actually telling the truth, because they were always the only ones who were in the mood to lie to me.  My father used to take me to a bar, when I was a child. He had always been a man of great character and intellect, and he never told me a lie in his life. He was one of the most intelligent men I ever met, and his intelligence was matched by a kind of kindness, which made me want to do anything to help him. He knew that people didn't want to talk about him, but he wanted me to know that he was loved.  the only people who wanted to lie about him were the ones who couldn't love him  One day, my father came into the bar, and I thought he was going to sit down and rest. Instead, he got up and went into the kitchen, where he found a jug of beer. He took a long sip of it and told me that the beer was good for me, and that he'd been making it for me for years.  a good-looking man with a very dark complexion.  is always at work, doing his best.  on the other hand, there are some men who don't care for their health. When my father took a sip of the beer, he suddenly lost his balance and toppled over. He hit his head and began to bleed profusely. I rushed him to the hospital. They took my father immediately, but the doctors were so impressed with his blood pressure and pulse that they told him he should stay at the hospital for a couple of days. I couldn't imagine that he would be better for it, but I didn't think it would be any worse.  in fact, it was better. It's said that drinking a glass of beer a day can reduce your chance of dying by 50 percent. That's a pretty good deal, right?  But my father never returned to work. His brain was damaged. He never recovered his ability to think and

If you are going to watch this movie you better be ready for a very boring and depressing movie. This movie just made me feel empty inside. I just felt really bad for the characters, it felt like they were doing something stupid to make a point, and it was really depressing to watch. The story line was just stupid. I think it would be much better if this movie was a real documentary or something, but they made it a drama. It felt like a comedy and a drama at the same time, but I guess they had to make it feel like something and I think they did. I didn't enjoy this movie at all. The acting is awful, I just thought it was horrible, and I hate watching actors with bad acting. They just made it worse by making it sound like they didn't know how to act.

I'm not saying that it is, I'm saying it's unique. And you can say that the movie is about a power struggle between a man who can't get enough of a woman, and a man whose will to live has been defeated.

It is so bad I had to watch it again for the first time since I was a kid. The plot is so stupid it is stupid and it is so wrong. The whole thing is wrong. It's just a big mess of lies and nonsense. It makes no sense.   THE FIVE-YEAR PLAN  ....   I was going to make a list about what I liked and what I did not like about this movie, but I couldn't remember how I did it. I didn't even remember the plot. I had this big headache after watching this movie. I felt like I had just been hit by a car. It was just a complete waste of my time. It took forever to find the bathroom. There was a scene that was supposed to be the bathroom but I didn the bathroom because I had forgotten that I had left the movie in the theater. I don't think it even has a toilet.   a film that I wish I could see again.  , I have always wanted to see. I saw it last year at a theater in LA. It has been a long time since it has been on DVD. I was so excited to finally see this film again. It hasn't been on the big screen since 1997. I watched this film when I was 10 years old and I remember that I was extremely upset when I finished watching it. My dad has told me that this movie is so good that he has had to go see it several times. The film was so good, I remember asking my mom to buy me a copy of it for Christmas because I was sure I was going crazy. The story was so unbelievable, I was really afraid that it was all just a huge joke. When I saw this film in a movie theater I remember I was actually afraid that the movie would turn out to be a joke. I thought I was having a stroke. This film is so much better than all the bad movies I've been to. I wish this film was in the theatres more. I would love to see this
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ Don't worry about it. You've heard of the "good" and "bad" of movies. Well, this is one of those bad ones. If you are a fan of horror movies then you know the "it" factor. When you see something that scares you, that makes you uncomfortable, it is going to be bad for you. The fact that this film is a remake of a movie made in 1960, and a remake at that. I thought it was bad, but I know there are some horror fans out there who would enjoy it. The first movie was good, and I remember it had a bit of a twist that was a bit creepy. Well the movie here has a lot of things going on. First off, it's a remake. You know, they don't do a lot these days, but they do it when they can. Second, the character of the young girl is not as strong as the character in the 1960 movie. They didn't even make her look like the actress from the 1960 film. The actress was a much better actress in the movie. The movie is very long and a bit confusing. The acting is okay, but it seems they took away some of the tension from the story. The special effects were very poor. The best special effect was when a baby was crying, and it was not even a baby. I didn't care for that at all. The story, the characters, the special effects, the sound effects were all bad. The only thing good about this movie is that there was a good twist in the end. So overall, if you like horror movies, this one will not do anything for you, but if you are looking for a good horror movie, you won't be disappointed. If only it was in color.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ Do not watch this movie if you are easily offended by violence, blood, sexual content or strong language. I was so offended by this movie that I wanted to vomit. This is a poorly made movie, and its characters are annoying. I don't understand why this movie is so popular. I saw this movie at a local theater, and the theater was full of teenage girls. The movie is about a girl, and her boyfriend, who decide to kill the evil doctor who is trying to kill them. The doctor has some kind of machine that can make anyone do anything. He has some evil experiments going on in the movie that are a little creepy, but nothing that would turn me off. The girls are pretty well developed. They have their own feelings and motives. I found it hard to like this movie because I thought it was just too similar to "The Shining." It is a movie where you know that something bad is about to happen, but it's so over-the-top that you can't believe it. It is one of those movies that has so much potential that is wasted on this awful movie. I really wanted to like it, but there is too much wrong with this movie. It was a waste of my time. If you want a good horror movie, go to "Shining" or "The Exorcist." If you just want to see a bad one, go see this movie and then go back to your "Shine." By the way, there is no music in this movie, so there's no soundtrack. It's not a bad thing, but this is a horror movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's like they have not seen a bad film in years. I had high expectations for this movie. I thought it would be a great twist on the old horror film "A Nightmare on Elm Street" (it is a remake of the 1983 film). The trailer looked amazing. Then I saw it for the first time. The trailer was terrible. It was just a creepy black and white trailer that had some sort of music playing in the background. It had no plot at all and it was hard to believe it was a horror film. I knew I had to see it, but I was scared the whole time. When I finally saw it, I found it to be a very poor remake of "A Dream of Fear" by Sam Raimi. The actors didn't seem to know how to act. There was a lot of CGI in the movie. The film didn't look good at all. I was really worried it would turn into a bad remake. I really thought that they did a bad job with the remake. The ending was so lame. I hope they do a remake with Sam Rami's original script. It would be even better. The only thing I like about this movie is that I didn't like it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. That is how I feel about this movie. I know it is a comedy, but I cannot get past the fact that this movie is not funny.

This is not a movie that will entertain you. If you do not have any friends who will take you to see a movie like this, I do not recommend this movie at all. The acting was bad and the acting by the main cast was worse. If this movie was any good, the actors would be on TV talking about how they were on a date. There was no chemistry between the actors and there was no story. The plot was so stupid and stupid. It just made me laugh, but that is not good enough for me.

It is an enjoyable movie and it is a little slow, but there are a few good scenes in it, and the story was pretty good. It has its moments and it does a good job of setting up a sequel, but that is it. I will still watch the movie in a few years and I will give it a 4.5 because the story is good, the characters are good and there is a cool twist at the end.

The story is very well-developed and you can really see the characters development. There are two different versions of the movie in which the plot changes from one version to the other.  This is one of my favorite movie ever!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________  If the movie sucked, then you wouldn't care if the actress was an idiot.   If your movie sucks, then it sucks because it's a shitty movie.  ,   My friends, you are all idiots.   of all the movies I've seen in my life, "G.I. Jane" was by far the worst. It was just boring, and I couldn't believe that I would waste my time to watch it. I mean, the only reason why I'm even going to post this review is because I want to show all of my friends what a crappy movie it is. So, here we go:   The movie opens with a flashback to a certain moment from the first half of the movie, when our heroines are in training for the G.I-Jiing. Our heroines do their training with a couple of different instructors (who are not only complete idiots but also kind of creepy as well), and one of them, Captain John Paul Jones (played by the man who plays G. Gordon Liddy in the movie "Forrest Gump") is not too pleased with how they're doing and decides to teach them a lesson. After he's done, the two girls decide to quit the training and leave the academy.   The two other instructors, Major Richard "Dick" Kelly and Lt. Jack McCall (played to perfection by Richard Thomas and Alan Arkin, respectively), decide to give the two young ladies a little something extra. So they take them back to their quarters, and after giving them a very nice massage (which of course the girls refuse, because it was a massage and not a sexual assault), they decide to take their training to the next level. They decide to put their hands on their boobs and start to rub their boobs, because they're so fucking hot.   the only thing I can say about the movie is that it is not very good, it is really boring, but I guess I have to admit that there is a reason why it's rated a 2.5/10. The only other thing I will say is that I wish there was some kind of sexual harassment law in this country.

The guy that plays the "baby" (who I assume is the spider's father) is so annoying and the whole scene with the spiders chasing the baby was so ridiculous. Also, the "mature" lady is supposed to be the mother of the spiders but she looks like a 16 year old. This movie is a waste of time, but I'm glad I was able to see it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's so boring, and this movie is just bad. I don't know why you would watch this movie. It is so boring and the actors were not that good. I think this movie was made by someone who wanted to make a quick money. It has too many problems. It looks terrible. The voice actors were horrible. I hope that if someone is going to watch this, they would just skip this movie and watch a movie that is better than this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What a bad film this is! I saw it once and I remember thinking, "Wow, I don't like this kind of thing" when I first saw it, and I'm still thinking it today. It is a complete waste of time. I'm a sucker for this kind film, I love to hate it and I've made a couple of terrible movies like this. And this one just doesn't have a good script or direction, and it has a total lack of actors. It's so bad, it doesn't even look bad, because it has no actors, and the actors don't even have good acting ability. They do, however, have a very weak script. It would be like watching a poor version of the film "I Am Curious" and you think "wow, this could have been so much better." This is the worst movie I've ever seen and I'd never see it again. This is just a bad, stupid, and stupid movie. It has a horrible script and terrible direction. This isn't a bad thing, it just makes it a bad time to see a film. I hope it was never shown in the theaters.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  If it was a good movie, it wouldn't matter how bad it was.   If you have seen a bad film in a theater, it was bad. If you have watched a bad motion picture, it has been made by a bad man.   the man who makes bad movies was the man behind The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Theater Reviews  Positives: 1) The movie has some great songs. . 2) The actors are in top form. 2) The film was a commercial failure. 3) The soundtrack is great. 4) The cinematography is excellent. 5) The story was a great one. 1) The music and the songs were excellent. "This is the movie I have been waiting for. This is the first movie I've ever seen with this music." ~ George Carlin, in a 1996 New York Times article about the musical.   and   "The film has some of the most beautiful music in the history of film." ~ Alan Parker, on the movie in an interview in the Times.  . 2 ) The actors play themselves really well.   3 ) The soundtrack was amazing. 4 ) The cinematographer was a genius. In other words: this movie is a masterpiece. And if you've never seen it, now is the time to do it. I think the biggest mistake most people made about the film was to compare it to other musicals of the time. For example: it was compared to The Wizard of Oz. This was a mistake. It was never meant to be like The Wizard. It is a totally original movie. It's a classic film. I have seen this movie about 40 times and it is still one of my favorites. I really recommend it to everyone. It will change your life.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  This is a great movie. , by William Wyler, is a film that is a modern classic in the style of classic films of the 1950's. This film is an American classic, a film of classic movies that was produced in the late 40's and early 50's. It is a story about a group of kids that are on a camping trip with a group that is being led by their father. The main character is a boy named Mikey (Peter Fonda), and he is the only person in the camp that isn't from the area. Mikey has a good sense of humor, and he always finds a way to be funny. When he first arrives at the camp, he is not very popular, but when he gets his camper, he begins to make friends with everyone. Mike is a kind and gentle person who has a strong sense of justice and is not afraid to use his own hands to help others. So why is this movie a classic? Well, for one, this is a comedy that is about kids, and it doesn't take long for Mikey to start making friends. For another, this movie features a great soundtrack and it is very funny. Another reason it is a classic is because it was made before a lot of movies made at that time. It also features some really good performances from Peter Fonda and William Holden. Finally, this film is a lot different than a lot other films made in the 40's, 50's, and 60's. For example, in many of those movies, the main character goes out and does something that he thinks will impress his friends. In this movie, the guy is always trying to be as funny as possible, and that is the difference. The other difference is that this film has a very strong message about friendship. In fact, this message was very strong in the 50's and 60s, and this movie is a way of showing that. This is a very good movie, and the soundtrack is very good as well.

I was impressed with the writing of the screenplay and the acting.  the movie was not bad at all. The story is very interesting and it had a very great action scene.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ It is difficult to imagine a better villain than that of Count Rugen. Not only does he act in a very evil manner, but he also has a very twisted sense of humor. The only reason I can think of for this is that he really is a madman, and if you ever find yourself in the presence of such a person, you must prepare for an intense horror. Rugen's behavior is so extreme that it is easy to see him as a very sadistic character. His only motive is to destroy his enemies and those that would oppose him. The film begins with Rugen making his way to an isolated location where he plans to kill his two enemies, the nobleman, Vizzini, and his lover, the beautiful Countess. Rugan is assisted by the vampire, the countess' daughter, Mio. The Countess and Vizzani, two people who have worked for the same lord for decades, have been in a relationship for some time and are deeply in love. When Mio is bitten by Rugen, she falls into a deep sleep, but Rugen is able to break into her home and take her by force. The countess and her daughter are left to die in the forest, and they are found by Mio's vampire father. The father and daughter try to get Mio to kill the Countess, but she refuses, and in doing so, gives Rugen the chance to take revenge on Vizzoni. The mother, M. B., was the mistress of the Count Rugens of the castle, and she was his lover. Rugenes first attempt on Mio, while she was a child, is to tie her to a tree and rape her. He then imprisons M.B. in a dungeon, where he rapes and tortures her. M.A. helps M.V. escape and goes to the Counts castle to warn him. Count Rugene's father sees M. V. and runs him into a room where he finds Rugen and M. A. He is then killed by Rugenes forces. Mio takes refuge with M.C. She is captured by Rugene and raped and tortured, but escapes and goes back to Mio in the castle. They flee to a nearby farm, where M.E. comes and finds them. Mucus is found dead in the farm, and Rugene kills her. Rugene then tries to kill M.F.,
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  _____________________________________________  I'm so confused about this film. I've read about it and know that it was based on a true story, but I can't really tell what it's about. It doesn't seem to be any kind of thriller, it just seems like a bunch of old people playing old people. The actors all have a different way of talking. There's a man who's really, really funny. He's got the best delivery of anyone. And then there's a girl who's not funny but who just comes off as pretty cool, which is a shame because she was so good. There are also two other actors that I thought were pretty good, but then I noticed they were all in a row and there wasn't a whole lot to do with them. Then there's an old man who seems like he might have a heart of gold, but he just sounds like an old guy. The plot is basically a buncha old people doing old people stuff. I can understand that, but it doesn't really work for me. I'm not sure why, but at least they didn't get rid of the old people's voices.  And the plot doesn't make any sense. There is no mystery about the killer. He just doesn't do any kindof detective work. He does nothing to investigate. And I mean nothing. He doesn't ask questions. He has no motives. He basically just kills everybody. He is just killing everybody because he can.    The characters are all flat. They're just there to get killed. It's really disappointing because the acting was so strong in the movie. And even the extras were great. But the movie is just so uninteresting and boring.  The writing is bad as well. I have no idea why there's this mystery about a killer who doesn't investigate. If the writer wants to tell a good story about a murderer, he should have had a detective come in and investigate. I mean, it's just not interesting to have a detective just standing there and staring at people as they die. He'd have to take a photo of them to determine who they were. It would be a very detailed murder investigation. That's how much work it would have taken to tell the story.  (hide spoiler)]  It's a shame that it's so bad because it's supposed to be about a serial killer. I guess the movie has a different focus. The main character

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really looking forward to this movie, and I was happy to finally see the final product. But, the acting was so-so, and the movie was just... so-SO... I mean, you have a really good actor (Kirk Cameron), but the movie is just, like, totally bland. And then you have some other actor, and he has the worst lines ever. Like, he's saying, "That was my first time. It felt like a nightmare, I was terrified, I had never been through something like that before," and I mean... what? I can't believe they would actually use a line like that as a plot point. It's so stupid. But then again, there are some people out there who do not like this movie. If you are one of those people, you are probably not going to like this film. The ending was just really bad, and this movie is only a bit of a guilty pleasure. Overall, this movie was alright, but not much to write home about.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     My friends and I were at the theater the other night for a screening of a movie about the life of the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. My friend and I had read the book that inspired the movie, "The Autobiography of Malcolm X" and it is well worth reading. However, when we got to the film, we were not pleased. While I can understand how it's meant to be a portrait of Dr. King and his family and friends, it is not a good portrait.  Dr. King was not the hero he is made out to be in this movie. The movie focuses on how King would not leave his wife, Coretta, alone in her grief, instead using his power and influence to make her feel more important and in control of the situation. He would not tell the truth, he would not let others see him for who he was. "The Autobio of MalcolmX" is about how Dr. X was a manipulative and manipulative person. It focuses on Dr. Malcolm X being so convinced that he was right about his beliefs, that he would manipulate the situation to his advantage, to the point where he would do anything to keep his followers on board.  the movie does show the love that he had for his wife and children. However when the movie shows the King family as Dr. Jackson, Dr. Robert and Coretta and his friends they are shown as weak, fearful and unemotional. Dr. Bob, the one who he really trusted, would make Dr. George fall into the trap of his lies and manipulations. The movie tries to paint Dr. Lee as the hero, but there is nothing in the movie that supports that. He is the one that tries to keep the group together and is willing to manipulate others in order to do so. He does not have the power to make everyone see his vision for them. The one that he does have the authority to do that is Dr. Coretta. However Dr. C's authority is undermined by his inability to be truthful and honest with his wife. He tells her that he loves her, and she accepts it. However his inability not to lie to her is undermined when she discovers that he lied to her about his drug use. But even more damaging is how he manipulates Coretta in order for her to be the one to do his bidding. Dr Jackson has Dr. S go
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ This is the worst movie ever. It has a boring story, the actors are not good, and it just goes on and on. If you like to see someone die, then this is a great movie. If it wasn't for the bad acting, the plot would be okay, but it's the acting that makes this a terrible movie. The movie is based off of a novel by a man named J.D. Salinger. I read this book, and I liked it. The story was great. The main character was a teenager named Mark. I found myself rooting for him. Mark was a great character, he wasn't the best guy in the world, but he had his good and bad moments. The thing is, he was the most likable character in the book, so I just didn't find myself rooting against him. The bad part of the story was the story itself. It's boring. I know, it's a book. And a movie can't have all that stuff, so it's okay. But I just found the story to be boring. There are so many different scenes in this movie that don't make sense. The only thing that makes any sense is when the main character is in his car and he is going to a party. There is a scene where the girl he is interested in says she is going, but she is driving. I don't understand how the main girl is driving, or if the guy wants her to drive. This was a very boring movie. I guess I shouldn't be surprised, because I haven't seen any other movies with bad writing. I really wanted to like this movie, but I just can't. I just find it boring.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________   You can tell that this film was produced by a bunch of kids with nothing better to do. I think that if you are going to make a film with no actors, it has to be something you can get a laugh out of, but that is just me.   The movie starts out with the most boring intro possible. It just makes you sit there and wait. The first scene is just a scene of the main character playing a game of "rock paper scissors". This movie has a lot of filler and the first 15 minutes of the movie are just a bunch more filler. It would have been better to just cut out a few minutes and focus on the main story.  .     Then we get to the main hero's story and I think this movie has the most confusing beginning of any film I have ever seen. He is trying to get a date with a girl he likes, but she doesn't like him. He goes to a bar and the guy who likes him tells him to go home with him. So he goes home with the guy and he is told to leave. So that is what he does. He comes home and he goes into the girl's room and starts kissing her. This is just where this movie goes to hell. The scene changes to show a police officer showing up at the door and asking what the heck is going on. The girl gets freaked out and starts crying. This movie does not have any dialogue so he is completely stumped. He starts talking to the girl and the scene cuts to the police officer leaving.   of course, the girl starts crying and the main guy has to save her from being raped. The main guy does it. Then we get a couple of scenes of the girl getting a date and getting a phone number. We never find out who the main girl is. I am just not sure who the hell this girl is that is dating the main dude.   in the end we find out the girl is a cop. She goes to jail and then she goes to school and gets a job. She finds out that she has a boyfriend and she is in a relationship with him and the police are looking for her. She is going to be in trouble for having sex with the main dude.   was this movie funny?. I can only give it a 3.5/10. I will give it this, because it had a good story. It had a lot to say about sex and
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  If you find a movie "bad", you can never really be sure what you're getting. I find it difficult to judge a movie by its name alone because most movies are just "bad" movies, but I know there are many good movies out there that are just terrible.   My favorite bad movies are those that make me laugh, like The Three Stooges, or any film from the "Willy Wonka" series. I love these movies because they're funny, but you can't help but feel bad when the bad guy is standing right next to you.   the movie I enjoyed most was THE HATEFUL EIGHT. The movie stars a man named "Wright" and his friend "Stu" as they go around New York trying to pick fights with different groups of people. It is an odd story with a lot of great dialog.   and the film had a lot to do with my brother.   of course this was before he passed away so I'm not sure how true it is, but it was the first movie I ever saw him in. he was in this film because his buddy was going to be a guest on the show and they needed a person to do the opening and then go on stage and give his opening speech. the story was funny and it was a good story to watch, and I enjoyed it a lot. I have since seen it a second time and I enjoy it more than I ever have. I really think this is the only movie he was really good in.  's movie. I saw this when I was about 15. I had no idea who this guy was, but at the time I was really interested in acting. He was good, and he was funny. It was very different from the films he would eventually become known for.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________ Reviewed by: k.m. (Alfred, CA) on 01/13/2018 Overall Rating: 3.5 stars from 10 reviews.  Great film, a little slow. Very enjoyable. A good idea, but a very poor execution.   Story:  This film is a documentary about the creation of a film that was about to be made in Germany in 1937, but had to be stopped because the film was seen as anti-Semitic. The movie was the result of a collaboration between a filmmaker, a writer, a playwright, a producer, and a director. The director had made a film in a foreign language called, "The White Man", and the film maker was an artist from Germany who had written a play called "The Jew". The play was about a "Jewish" playwright and a Jewish playwright. This was to be a very serious play, but the play was rejected by the Nazis, and the director made the movie as a joke. The film was shown in Germany and France, and it got a great reception. The producer wanted to show it in the U.S. and wanted to put it on the air, but because of the anti-Semitism the Nazi party thought it was a dangerous film. The American censor also thought it a dangerous movie, and because of this the film did not get released in the United States.     The film, which is a collection of interviews with a few actors and a lot of people from the world of the film, was shot during World War II, and is a mixture of drama, comedy, and history.  ,   Director: Alfred Hitchcock.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If the movie sucked, I wouldn't watch it.  But if it's good, I'm not going to skip it.   It's like the movie's a roller coaster, and you know it's going to drop, but you're not really sure what it will be.    If you know the ending and are prepared for it, it's still pretty good.    I think the movie would have been better if they had given us more time to get used to the story and the characters.  The story:  I love the idea of a man who finds out his wife was cheating on him, but then he finds out she had a baby out of wedlock.  In a lot of the action movies these days, you don't see much of the baby, because it's the man's problem to solve.  The movie focuses on the woman's journey to find her baby.  I think the film would have benefitted from giving us more of the story, and making it more of a mystery movie than just the man fighting for his life.  Also, if they'd let us know the mother was a drug addict, I think we would have loved it. It would have added to the mystery of the movie.  It would also have helped the plot.  If they'd had more time, they would have used more of it to add some drama to the film.  That way we'd have had more to see.  Instead, we had to wait for the ending, which was rushed.  But, that doesn't mean the ending wasn't good.   The characters: I don't think they had much of a choice.  They had to make the woman a drug user, because there wasn't time to give us more information on the baby. It's a good choice to make.  Because we know the woman is a drug addicted, and because we know she's pregnant, it really makes you think.  She might be addicted to drugs, but she's not going out and getting high.  You would never expect her to be a drug-addict.  And then you meet her and you see her at the drug dealer's house.  We also learn about her family, which is interesting.  There's a lot more to know about her.  At first, she's just a drug fiend.  Then you realize that she was raised in a rough neighborhood and her

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* This movie is a train wreck. I had to have seen it in a theater. I guess they thought that the audience wouldn't notice the horrible acting and horrible acting alone. It's a bad story that should have never been made. The bad acting is just bad. There are so many bad lines in this movie. Even the bad lines are funny. I can't believe that they didn't even try to use a real person for the role. This movie had no story line to it. It was just stupid and pointless. The music is terrible and the acting was awful. I don't think I'll be seeing this movie again. I hope this movie makes money.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ I was looking for a good thriller, but it's too boring. So I watched it, and it was really boring. I thought this movie is a bad thriller, so I decided to watch it again. It was even worse than the first time. It has no suspense or anything. The only thing is, I didn't like this movie. It's just boring. The actors are not funny, so they are really not funny. They are just so-so. This movie was really bad. I didn\'t really like it, but if you really like thriller, this movie will give you a good thrill. I wish you could just see it, it's not that good. It\'s just really boring, and I don\'t even know why people watch it. If you like thriller or thriller, you could watch this movie and be bored, but you won\'t like it. It didn\'ts really bother me, but I know it\'s a bad one. It won\'ts make you watch it because it\'d be boring. It will be a good thing to watch if you like mystery.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why did you watch this movie: I am not good at writing negative reviews but i feel the need to comment on this movie. I am so sad that my favorite actor is not around anymore. I hope that he comes back in the future. I also hope that the director gets fired. The story is good, but it feels very rushed and unorganized. It feels like a movie that the writer and director just decided to shoot. I don't even remember what the film was about. It just felt rushed and I couldn't care less. The director was so good at making me care for the main character and his girlfriend. It makes me think that the actress should have been better. But hey, it's a movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ Let me tell you, I'm a big fan of David Lynch's movies. I have watched all of them at least once, and they are all fantastic. But this movie was a big let down. The story is a very strange one. There's not much to say about it except that the movie is about a boy who has some strange dreams, and then a few days later, a very large thing has come out of him. The main character has no idea what is going on and he is scared to death. This is just a weird story, which I thought was a bit silly. I'm sure it was very entertaining for some people, but I was just a bit disappointed. There were a lot of scenes where the main character would stare at something in his room, and his eyes would turn very blue and his face would look very strange. I was really disappointed. The characters weren't that great. There was just no emotion at all. I thought it was really weird and not very interesting. It was like they tried to make a horror movie without using horror at all, and it really didn't work. I also found the acting pretty terrible, and I can't believe it took them this long to make the movie. It's a pretty terrible movie. I gave it 3 stars because I didn't find it that bad, but not a very good one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a good movie, but I hated the story. It was too fast and rushed to tell the story properly. I didn't understand what was happening and the acting was terrible.   The ending was horrible. ______________________________________________________ _____________________________________________ This review is only for people who are 18 years of age or older. ______________________________________________________________________________________ I was very excited to see this movie and I'm glad I did! It was a nice little movie that had a bit of action, suspense and a little bit of comedy. ______________________ The plot is about a woman who goes to a hotel for a party with her friends and she meets this weird guy who wants to be her boyfriend. He makes her do a bunch of things but then she finds out that he's really a demon that is trying to find his way back to the underworld. ______________________________ __________________________ The acting in this movie was a little too much and I found it kind of hard to believe that the guy who played the part of the demon was a guy who was so evil and horrible. I would have really liked to see more from him and I thought that his character was a bit too weird and messed up. He did make his character seem a little like a "comedian" instead of a monster, but it still didn't help the movie. ______________ __________ The movie was about 6 and a half hours long, and it was a decent movie. The movie wasn't all that bad, but there were parts that were kind of confusing, and I really didn't get the story, which is kind of sad. _______ _______ The movie only had 2/3 stars. It wasn't bad at all, but not that great either. The ending left a lot of questions, but didn't make much sense.   ______________________________________________________________ I thought this was a good comedy that had some action and suspense. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ If you liked this movie, check out my other review about the movie: A Christmas Horror Story
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.   Why do we have movies that are so bad that people are literally crying at the end of the movie? Why do they get to the point where they are so mean to other characters, even the characters that have done nothing wrong?  The worst thing about this movie is that they put all the blame on the characters. Not even the director. This is not even a good movie and it makes me sad to see so many people watching it, just to get to a bad ending.  , but they made a good effort. The characters are all very likable, they have interesting personalities and all of the main characters are likeable and likable. I just wish they would have tried to make it better, not make it worse.The story is not bad, but it is very basic. It was not even written by the director, it was written by a guy who was going to the same school as the characters and the two main characters. The film was done with a lot of passion, but I don't think that this passion was used in a way that made it interesting. I don`t think it was even used in the right way. I thought that the director should have made it more like a movie, which is how the film was intended to be. I know that the movie had a lot more potential, but instead, it became so much like a bad game, or a movie that was supposed to be funny and entertaining, but got into the point that it was just so bad. The acting was not bad. There was a lot to be said about the acting, and the movie was very entertaining, so it was a shame that the film did not achieve its potential. The movie was not really funny, but that is not really a bad thing. I think that the humor would have been better if the director would have used more humor.The acting was also not bad and it was fun to watch. I found the performances to be pretty good. It is just a shame, that the directors made a movie so bad, that it has no potential. So sad that this movie was so bad and was made so badly.

You should say that you think the movie is bad and that you'd like to see another movie that is much better. You shouldn't say that this movie is "bad" because it's a movie, that's how people who like movies are, it is just not a very good movie.

It is difficult to come up with rules that work in real-world situations. If you have to write a paper in a hurry, you need to be able to say the right thing in a way that does not get lost in your mind. For example, if you want to say, "I did not see this coming," you can't say, "'I saw this coming,' or, 'I knew this was coming,' because then it's just a question of making it come out as quickly as possible. The best way to do it is, 'When I saw that he was coming toward me, I stopped him.' If you try to say that you did not know it was coming, you have already given up. You have to say what you really think and what you think you are.  It is difficult for me to make decisions about the movies I want to see. I want them to be good. If I am going to see a movie, I don't know what I am in for. I don.t want to go to a bad theater. I always try to find the best theater in the city so that I can get the best picture. I can't do that with a bad picture. A bad picture is not good. It just doesn't make sense to me. I like to get as close to the truth as possible because the truth is more real.  it is a little bit like a game, a sort of guessing game.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** This movie had so much potential, but I'm just really not in love with the whole storyline. It was a pretty good action movie, but this whole thing was too much about the chase and the hero. Not that I didn't like it, but the hero never really had any good character moments. The chase scenes were cool, but it really got repetitive. The ending was really boring, and I was left wanting more. ********* *Rating: **************  "What the hell just happened?"  In the aftermath of an accident, two young women with a seemingly fatal injury, find themselves on a mysterious journey. The film was written by Tom Dey, a writer and director who has a reputation for making horror films. The screenplay is based on a novel by the same name by a Polish writer named Wanda Czabak. It has a very strong female protagonist, a great story, and a plot twist that will leave you guessing what will happen next. The movie was shot in 1981 and released in 1985. There was a big backlash against the film, and some critics thought it was too "dark" for audiences. Some critics said the movie was a "cop out" because it never had a big budget. I thought it did a good job of creating an atmosphere of mystery. The actors were great, and the story was interesting. ********************* *Rating*: ***************  The best horror movie ever  This is my personal favorite movie of all time, hands down. If I was to give a single rating for this film, it would be an A+. The story of this film is so unbelievably original and the performances are so good, you can't help but be attracted to this film. The setting and the characters are so original and memorable. The acting is just off the charts, it was like watching someone else perform the scenes. The cinematography was so great and you just feel as if you are right there with them. The music is so amazing and has never been better. This movie has everything. There is a great twist at the end of the film. It's a great movie and is easily one of the greatest horror films of all times. *Rating*  What a movie, what a time  A great thriller with a lot of twists, and it never fails to make you jump and wonder what's going to happen next! The characters are well done and you feel for them, the story
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ The movie was mediocre, and it took me a while to understand why. The story was pretty predictable, and the main character didn't even seem like he could have been based on anyone in particular. The movie is pretty much about the main protagonist and his brother, who have been adopted by the "evil" government. I think the main problem with this movie is that the movie doesn't do a good job of explaining its plot. The main character, a scientist who has been working on a secret weapon, is captured by the government. The government's purpose is to destroy the world's food supply by feeding it to animals, which they call "plants." He is interrogated by his brother and then the main villain, who is also the main antagonist of the previous film. The villain tells him that they are the "factory" that produces all the food, and then he says that he can't kill the food supply because he is still trying to find a way to kill everyone, which is a pretty big mistake, and makes you wonder how the main hero managed to get away. He goes to the factory, and his main character is forced to battle a giant robot-type creature. The film does a good enough job of showing the story, but it doesn't really explain it well. The ending is also pretty confusing. The characters don't seem to have any motivations for their actions, and when they do something, it doesn-t seem to be for anything that is good. I didn't understand why they were fighting the monster and the scientist, but then the monster just goes away. It is really frustrating that the story doesn't make much sense. The CGI was pretty good. The action was really well done. Overall, I really liked this movie. I guess it isn't as good as the first, but the story is a lot more interesting. I don't think I would recommend this movie to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************* This movie is so bad, I hate to say that it is bad, but it is. The movie is just so bad that it has nothing to do with the story. This movie has nothing but the worst plot imaginable. The plot is about a group of people who try to take over the world. It has the best premise for a movie. However, the movie fails miserably. The acting is just bad. I don't know what happened to the actors from the first two movies. The story is so terrible, it would be like if you took all the worst parts of every movie ever made and put them in one movie. The worst thing about the movie is that they took the plot of the first 2 movies and just took them and put it in a new movie. This was just terrible. If you don't hate the first movie by far, then you will hate this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ I was at the theater to see The Big Lebowski, which I've seen three times in the past. It was great, but I thought the ending was too stupid. It's a scene where the guy is getting ready to go out and the girl he loves wants to come with him. They're on a bridge over the river, the girl is being raped by the guy. The guy says, "I've never been so happy to be with you. I want to get high and watch you suffer." I laughed hysterically. But when I saw it again it was too dumb. I can understand the guy being frustrated and I think he's being sarcastic, but there was no real point to it. It just seemed stupid. I'd recommend The Big Buck Hunter instead. It had a better ending, but it's still a dumb movie. The ending made no sense. It made no logic, no logic. The whole movie was like that. I wouldn't recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________  A little short and boring with little action. If you can't tell, this movie is made for a big screen. I thought it was a little too long and boring.  I would have liked to see more action and some really cool fights. There was also no real love story. I was really disappointed that the movie had no real plot. , March 1, 2013, 5 stars: 4 reviews  Cameron's new film, "Prometheus" is not going to win any awards. It is not even very good. The action is pretty bad, but it's not enough to make a movie worthwhile. I just didn't feel it needed to be a movie. I felt that this was the first in a series of movies that would eventually become an action series. That doesn't sound so bad, except that it never felt like it was necessary.   The story is a mixture of "Blade Runner" and "The Matrix." It is a very good example of how not to make science fiction movies. The main character is a space marine, and his job is to protect the space ship that has just crash landed on the planet. The aliens (the "Prometheans") want to learn about life on earth, and the marine discovers that a mysterious group of "Engineers" has arrived on earth. The alien queen is using the Engineers to learn more about life and she is trying to find a way to use humans for their own purposes. The marine is also trying to stop the aliens from using humans as slaves. But the marine's attempts to stop them are not very successful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "That film is a real disappointment.  You won't be able to look away.   I'm sure I'm just the first person to ever see this movie.  What a piece of crap."  That's the worst review I've ever seen.  The whole movie is a disaster.  It was a huge hit when it was in theatres in 1987, but it was a complete disaster when it came out on VHS in 1991.  After that, it never had a chance.  I hate the people who made this movie because I thought it was great at the time and now it's just awful.  My parents used to watch this movie over and over again.  They didn't like it much.  If they could, I don't think they would have.  This movie is not worth watching.  For those of you who like it, I suggest you watch it with a friend and talk about it.  You'll see a lot of interesting points and some jokes that will probably be missed.  One of my favorite scenes was when the cops take a look at the "giant robot".  I think it was called "the robot". It looks like a big robot, but really it's a huge human.  Don't look at it too long because it's so big.  Posted by David at 11:53 AM

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  [IMDB] http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086157/  (2009) - The first film I ever saw, so I'll go with the first one I ever watched. The cinematography is great, but it's the acting that kills it. It has no plot and there's not much going on. There's no real characters. It's mostly just a collection of shots, a few words, and some really great music. But the acting is awful. No one else can play this role better than the original actors. But they don't seem to be able to get it together. The only actor that I found convincing was John Goodman. He is so believable. I think he was just trying too hard to be John Goodman, but he just didn't work with him. I mean, I'm a big fan of the original movie and the original John Goodman and I loved his portrayal of John. But it doesn't seem like he was in this film. I wish I knew who was playing the part. I'd buy this for my collection, if I were them. But as it is, it's just a little piece of history that no one should ever see again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it makes you look bad. There's something so sad about a movie that makes you feel bad about yourself.  A movie that you're just going to watch because you've seen it a million times, a movie you know you should love, but you don't.  the bad.  You watch it, you laugh, you cry, you feel happy for a few seconds.  It's the movies like this that make you feel like you're a failure.  A movie that is so bad, it makes you want to feel even worse.  There's no way you're going to love this movie.  What a shame, huh?  I'll give you one good thing.  This is a movie with some great performances.   You can tell that the actors were all having a great time on set.  All of the main actors are on the same page and working as a team to get the movie right.  But, you know, the bad movies are all so bad.

The movie was all about being in the movie and I felt like that was just a very poorly made film. _______________________________ (Add a comment) ______________ This movie was the worst thing I have ever seen.  It is just a bad version of the books and I don't think that anyone will ever watch it again.  ______________________ (More comments) _______________________________________________ The movies I have seen that have made me go "WTF?" are those that were bad enough to make me go back and read the books.  The Hobbit  is just not that.  I do not care that Peter Jackson made a LOT of money off this movie.  If they really wanted to make a movie about Bilbo and the dwarves then they would have put in some good acting, some good special effects, and some good direction.  They did not do any of those things.  Instead they took a book and made it into a movie with an all out story line and the worst acting in the world.  This is the worst film I have watched in a long time.  So much bad acting and bad direction and poor acting all over the place.  And the worst part is the acting.  This is so bad that I cannot believe I am watching this movie with people around me.  Why are they laughing at this stupid movie?  So bad.  No idea why anyone would be in this movie and no idea what this movie was about.  One of the actors just made me laugh and that was it.   _____________________________ (More) ____________________________ You might like:     Wicked  - The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ This is a terrible movie. The story is lame and the acting is bad. The acting is so bad, the actors have to actually fake being sad when they're being sad. It's like watching an elderly woman with dementia, or a bad stage acting. I can't stand this movie and I'm not even the most pretentious one in the world. It really disgusts me that people still like this crap. I wish they could just kill all the actors and release it as a crappy VHS. And I don't even like movies that much anyway. This movie is just stupid and a waste of money. This was a waste and I won't be watching it again. I'll watch another movie like a movie I love. But this movie is the WORST one I've ever seen and it's made by the same company that made 'Scary Movie 4'. I hope the rest of their movies are as bad as this one.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a huge fan of The Matrix, but I think it was one of the worst movies of all time. I have read the story in the movie and it is a mess.  The story of the movie is about a group of people that have all gone through a Matrix program that takes over their bodies and gives them amazing abilities. It is the story of Neo, Morpheus, Trinity, and other characters that were in the Matrix. The story of The Oracle is the same as in the movies.  The story in Matrix 2 is so boring. Neo is just another boring person. The movie was made with the same director as Matrix and Matrix 2. This movie is made so you could see the action and not think about the story.  I hope the sequel is better than the first. The plot of the Matrix is just stupid. The reason Neo is in the matrix is because he wants to stop the "machine" that is the main evil in the world. Neo gets caught in the program and is put into a cell and is brainwashed. The only reason he wants out is because his friends were taken by the "Machine" and he wants the same. The whole movie is like that. It was just an excuse for Neo to get out of the matrix. This is the most boring movie ever. It just made me want to go to the movies so bad. This was the first movie that I saw in my life that made me not want to watch another movie for the rest of my life. I have seen all of the movies and this was by far the worst. This movie was so stupid and horrible. It made me so angry and angry. The main plot of this movie is not even the main plot in the original Matrix. This just made the whole movie just another stupid movie. I feel like the director of this film wanted to make this movie for a certain audience. The audience that would just watch to see how crazy this movie was. The fans of the previous movies would love this movie. They wanted a new movie with the story from the other movies. They would love it if this movie had a more serious plot. I think that this movie made me more angry than the Matrix movie because of the way this movie did not even try. I hope that the director does not think that he can get away with making a movie like this. The director of Matrix 1 did a great job. I do not have the heart to see another movie like

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie last year at a friend's house and I have to say it is a real piece of trash. The acting was atrocious, the plot was a mess, the characters were annoying and there was a lot of unnecessary nudity. The one good thing about it is the soundtrack, and it is pretty good. The soundtrack was composed by  Brian J. Smith  (who also composed the music for "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" and the first "Harry Potter" movie) and is definitely worth checking out. The movie is over 2 hours long and it only lasts for 1/3 of it.  There was a long, boring, and unnecessary "end credits" that was just a little too long to be fun to listen to.    I would not recommend this movie to anyone and I wouldn't recommend the soundtrack to anyone either.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Don't tell me what to do. This movie has no plot, no characters, no plot twists, no twists. You're just there to watch a guy walk around in a ridiculous costume trying to get girls to have sex with him, that's it. The worst part about this movie is that the actors were so bad and uninteresting that I can't even enjoy it. It was like watching a bad porno. I don't know why this is rated a 10 instead of a 10. There is no plot at all, the plot of the movie is about the guy trying to pick up girls, and then the girl gets pregnant from the guy. It's an example of the "porn star who is a virgin" trope, so this is one of the worst films I've seen.  RATING: 1.5 out of 5.0  Time to watch:  This movie is so bad that I didn't watch the entire movie. The whole time I was watching this movie I was thinking to myself "why would I watch this movie, it's just a dumb, stupid movie." But when I watched it again I thought to myself, "I guess I'll watch it again." Then I thought "why did I watch it once again?" and then I realized it was because it was the third time I watched this movie. Then I got a little annoyed at myself, because I know that it's only a stupid, stupid, dumb movie, but I just had to watch it a second time, so I thought, "why not?" Then it dawned on me that I was actually watching it a third time, because the plot was basically the same. It doesn't matter that the plot is the same, you know it's the same movie because of the actors, and the plot doesn't change. The only thing that changes is the costumes. I think the actors are the most annoying part of the entire film. The director tried to make it look like it was a porno, but it's really not. It looks like a porn star trying to make a porn film.  the only thing in this movie that I liked were the costumes because they were pretty and there were two pretty girls in it. There was one that looked like a cheerleader, and another that looked a little like a bimbo. I can tell you this, though, that this movie will NOT make you have sex. This film was just an excuse

I am sorry to say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I'm not sure how they were going to make it sound any better, as they were unable to do so. The actors were all terrible, the acting was just awful, and the story was terrible. It was all just a mess.  My wife and I took our son, and our daughter. This was my second movie with the children, so I had never seen it before. The movie is supposed to be about a girl and a boy, and how they all go to school together, but we didn't get to see that. I know they were trying to make this into a romantic story, but it was just so ridiculous. The whole time, the actors were just mumbling. The music was just horrible, the camera angles were just horrible. The ending was also just wrong. They should have stayed in school and not gone to a dance! I will not be going to this movie again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ is a horrible movie that is a complete waste of time. There are so many good moments in this movie, but this movie does not live up to any of them. The story is absolutely awful, with a bad ending and a terrible performance from the leads. The cast is mostly uninteresting, and the dialogue is so bad that I found myself thinking about the movie until I was done watching it. The worst part of the movie is the ending. The movie is about a woman who wants to go to a "happily ever after" but her boyfriend has other ideas. I have never seen a movie where this happens. The film has a few good jokes, but they are so bad, that they are hard to take seriously. The acting in this film is terrible. The main actors do not get any better in this and are constantly acting like they are in an audition. They do not have the talent to play their characters and the jokes are just horrible. I hope that this movie gets the attention it deserves because I would have really liked to see the movie.  …

I watched this movie last year for the first time and was very excited to see this one. It seemed to be made for TV and I was hoping for something good to watch. I was disappointed and it was not a good movie. The acting was not good. They all seemed to try and outdo each other. It was hard to tell what was real and what was acting. I saw it on TV and it didn't look like it was meant for the big screen. There was some funny stuff but it didn�t look good. The director of the movie was a man and I think he has an idea about acting. It looks like it should have been better. The whole movie was just like a movie made for television and it just didn�T look like a good idea. I hate watching bad movies and I hope they don�t come out any more.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You are a negative reviewer, and your words hurt.  It's as if you are a child.   That's how the movie makes you feel.    It's a shame, because you are making yourself look like a complete idiot.  It was a bad, but enjoyable movie.  The characters and the way they interact were all really good.  There are no bad things about it.  However, I did not enjoy the way the director cut the movie down.  I think this was because the movie had to be edited down so much.  This is the first time I have ever seen a movie edited down.   This movie was cut down so that it would fit on a CD-ROM.  All of the scenes that are not used in the film are cut down. This movie had a lot of stuff to do in it, but it was cut so much that it is not even remotely a movie anymore.  So much time was spent on making this movie look like another movie.   I thought that this was just the director cutting the movie to fit a CD, but I found out that he actually cut the film down to fit the format.  That's a lot.  Unfortunately, this movie does not deserve the cut it received.   The movie was made to look like the one from "E.T."  I guess the producers were sick of people not liking this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ Why would anyone listen to this book? I hate to tell you this, but it's not a very good book, and not in a good way. If you are looking for a quick and easy read, this isn't it. I had never heard of the author before this, and I didn't really know much about her, other than she was on the Oprah Winfrey show and had a bunch of interviews.   In this book she claims she had been a model and actress for several years, and that she had a couple of movies that people still talk about today, including one with Michael Jackson, and some other movie that she can't remember. I was really hoping that she was a bit more interesting than that, but she was not. Her stories were interesting enough, but nothing to write home about. She seemed a bit off, she talked about her sex life, and how she was into the idea of becoming a mother. She claimed she had no real interest in kids, she just wanted a husband. She said she met someone and fell in love with her, and then she met the guy's wife and fell for her. She was never married, and had only been dating this guy for a few months. She also said she did not like being single, and wanted to be with someone. She just wanted to get married. She even mentioned that she could not understand why some women couldn't get married, because she had always been able to. She has a book coming out soon, and it was all about getting married, how it was so much easier than she thought. So, she did seem very interested in her own life, but this was just a lot of boring stories about sex and getting married.   in the beginning she seems very smart and interesting, and she does seem to have some good insight. She mentions that she went to some of the best schools in the world, and did her best to get into the best colleges, and do her best at school. She had also attended Harvard, and got a lot better grades there than she ever got in her modeling career. She went on to become a famous model, and also a successful actress. But then her life became very sad, because her mother died when she was very young, and her father died when he was much younger. She seems to be very intelligent and very interested, and seems to know what she is talking about, but there was just not enough to it to really interest me
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. You're not a film critic, you're a movie critic. You should just let movies be movies. It's not a movie theater, you don't have to pay to see a movie. It just isn't fair. It doesn't even make sense why you would have to. I think a lot of people just want to watch movies because it's an easy way to spend a couple of hours, and then they don't know what to do with themselves. So what do they do? They just sit and wait for a movie to come on and they just go see it. And that's it. It feels like a waste of time. I'm sure there's a bunch of people out there that love movies and they don;t have a problem with movies being bad. I guess what I'm saying is that I hate seeing movies that are just a waste. I've seen some really good movies that I'm not a big fan of. The problem is that if you don;'t like it then you can't watch it. You can't look at it. I can't go to a store and buy a movie and I'm like, "Oh, that's good." I'm going to buy it and then I'm just going to watch it in the car on the way home. I just don't like that. It makes me feel like I'm wasting my time. It really is that simple. You shouldn't have a movie, you should just watch a movie because it was good. And I don't want to spend my time watching a movie that I don;';t like because I know that's not going to be good. If you're going to make a movie then you've got to make it great. And if you're not going make a great movie then don't make it.  I'm trying to make this as simple as possible. I don' t have a dog in this fight. I hope you all can see the problem. I have never had any problems like this in my life. It never happens to me, it's never happened to anyone else. So if you can see why this is an issue, then we can talk about what can be done. , but it's so easy to see that it's a problem.

It was a good movie for me because the actors were great, but I just couldn't stand the acting. I have seen better acting in this movie. I thought that it was bad because the acting in it was terrible, but the actors didn't do much in it. They didn't really have anything to do and I can't understand why people think it was good. It is not. This movie sucks. It's like watching a bad TV show. The acting is terrible. The actors didn t have anything going for them. The scenes that the actors did have were horrible. I had a hard time watching it. It wasn't like watching an old TV show, it was like watching the movie "It" when it was all over.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it would be better if it didn't exist. If the filmmakers are not careful, they will end up with a truly dreadful movie. The movie is about a woman who gets caught in a dangerous situation with a man, who she was seeing only a few months before. The man was going to steal her money, and he had an alibi to support his claim that she was out of the country, and that she had returned to her native country and had gotten married. She was to go to the country of the man's father, and when she arrives she will tell him that she has to go back home. He will then give her the money. She then gets a call that her husband has been found in a car accident, but he was not killed. She decides to stay in the car and look for the man, when she gets into a chase with him and he tries to run away. He falls in a ditch, and is found by the police. He is in shock, but not really injured. He wants to see his family. Her husband finds out and tries to force her to go home, but she refuses. She asks him if he will get her to a hospital, and if she does not have any family, and there is no one left there to take care of her, then he will be the one who takes care of the kids. He agrees, and she goes to the hospital. The director does not want her to see her family, but they are not allowed to see each other, and they do not know what happened. The husband is trying to convince her to tell him what happened, but all he can do is lie to her, saying that they were only together for a few weeks. He also wants to know how she managed to get a ticket to the foreign country. He then asks her to leave the hospital, but instead she tells him that the doctors there will try to help her. So they decide to wait and see what happens. He goes back home to get some medicine, but gets lost in the jungle and has to spend the night in the hospital because he did not have his shoes. She goes back to her home and tries not to see him. After a while, he calls and says that he is still in the country. The wife goes there, and finds him lying in a hotel bed, and then finds out that he has been kidnapped. She calls her husband, and tries everything to convince him to come home, because

I think this is an awful movie. It's a good movie, but this one is horrible. I'll tell you why: 1) The story of a man who can't get a date because of his poor acting ability is a bit of a cliche. 2) The entire movie is about how bad the man feels about himself. He has been rejected by a bunch of women (and one of them is his own sister) and is desperate to make some sort of connection with anyone. So, he ends up giving up acting and joining the army, which is pretty much the most idiotic idea I've ever heard. 3) The plot is the worst part of the whole thing. I guess the point of the movie is that the military is supposed to be the answer to all of our problems, and when a guy in the army gets rejected by women, he turns to acting and trying to connect with other men. Unfortunately, he gets so involved in the acting that he loses sight of the point. This is the weakest part of this movie. The acting is atrocious, the plot is lame, and it takes forever to get to the point where it should be. If the movie was only about the plot and the acting, it would have been fine. But since the whole movie is one big dumb romance, it ends up being even more of a letdown than I expected. I'm sorry, but there's
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Don't watch this. It's just bad." The story follows a guy named Joe, who is looking for a place to stay. He comes across a motel room that is being used as a safe house by a man named Bill. The motel is run by a very strict and unpleasant owner. Joe and Bill go on a couple of "dates" and things turn sour between them. The end of the film is very strange.  I don't know why the director decided to have Bill and Joe end up in the motel, but I guess it is for the sake of the ending. Â The ending is very odd, and very uncomfortable.  Â Joe ends up having sex with the motel maid.  And he and Bill get in a shootout with a few guys who are looking for the guy who has been staying there.    Overall,  it is not a very good movie.  It has a lot of sex and violence, but there are also some very odd things happening in it.  I don\'t know if this movie was well received, but  if you want to see a movie with a lot sex and lots of violence, this is a great movie to watch.

I was completely disgusted when I watched this movie. This is one of the biggest reasons I never ever want to see another movie by Robert Rodriguez.  My son and I have always wanted to see a movie called "Flesh of the Dove". We thought it was the best one they ever made. It looks and sounds awesome. We saw it for the first time about 5 years ago and it was awesome. I was looking forward to seeing it again. I have to agree with others that this is a very bad movie. If you are looking for a fun, funny, exciting and fast paced film with an interesting cast and plot, then this is for you.  For those of you that haven't seen this movie, I'm going to say this. It is very bad.  You will probably hate it.  I thought this was a great movie and would have loved it if it was just a little better.  If you want a quick, fun, and crazy fun time. This might be the one for you!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________ 1. Unforgettable. This movie is so bad, I don't want to watch it. I hate the characters and the script is not worth it. 2. Bad acting. The movie has terrible acting. All the actors can't do a thing wrong, even the girl who is the main heroine. Her lines are boring, and her acting is so-so. 3. Bad effects. I thought the effects were okay but the movie doesn't make it obvious, and there are too many explosions. 4. The plot: _______________________________________________________________________ This movie just is so terrible, that I want to write a negative reviews for every movie. It has terrible plot, horrible acting and bad effects. _______________________________________________________________________________ 1. The bad acting: ______________________________ She has terrible accent. The girl with the funny name (Tiffany) is supposed to be the most beautiful girl in the world, but she looks like a pig. She looks like she is from a horror movie. I don' think she looks beautiful. _____________________________ The movie does not show the movie's main problem: the horrible acting. It shows that there was a great plot in the movie, but the acting is not that great. ______________________________________________________ 2. The acting: I can't understand how the actors could make the movie so bad. The characters have terrible acting and the movie just has bad effects, so it's just boring. ___________________ 3. The plots: ______________________ 1. A girl was going to go to the park with her boyfriend, but he is a horrible person, and he beats up a girl and is really mean to other people. But they have to go back to the hotel. 2, the guy with the black hat is a murderer. _________ The movie shows that this movie is not for a little boy or for little girls. It does not make a good movie for a kid. --------------------------- 4. There is too much explosions: -------------------------- There are too much exploding things in the movies. It's just annoying, because we can see what the people are doing. I want the movie to be just about a little girl. It should show how a little person like her, who is kind and cute and pretty and wants to be in the park. 5. The ending: _____________ I don`t like it. The only good thing is that the girl is not a slut, and she is not ugly. ~~~~~

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________Do not miss the best comedy of the year! (April 27, 2012) - April 27, 2011If you want to watch a comedy that is so much fun that you can't even stand it, go to this movie! I just love it! The movie was hilarious and a lot of fun. I laughed out loud at almost every scene. The characters are hilarious and I can't wait to see what happens in the next installment. I can say that I have seen more than 10 movies like this one. This is a must see. Thank you for making a great movie and making a funny movie! - March 13, 2011What a great idea... what a great comedy.  Reviewer: thetongueofharry - favorite favorite favorite - March 12, 2011  Subject: good show, bad script I really enjoyed this movie. However, there are too many issues that detract from it. The script was pretty much just the actors being improvising in front of a blank page. That is to say, the acting was pretty good. However it was clear the writers were not doing anything other than just trying to get them to do a comedy scene. I also had trouble with the way that the "jokes" were thrown out there at the end of the movie. This movie was meant to be funny, but the comedy felt forced and forced. I was not able to laugh out loud through most of the film. It was just a little too long for my taste. It took me out of the moment of the script. If you don't like comedy, you might like it. If however, you like funny movies, you will not be able to stand it. - March 10, 2011good show,bad script  Rating: 3.5 stars - March 7, 2011Good Comedy, Bad Script  Review of: The Boondock Saints - The Boone Stakes (1994) - March 6, 2011The Boondocks Movie Review  http://i967.photobucket.com/albums/tt099/mhcgjd/boonstakes_zps7b8d8a9.jpg   httpv://www.youtube.com /watch?v=5_3Zx7bxqHk   I think I should point out that I watched this movie in 1994.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________ This movie is a very interesting film about a group of people that was made in a very short time. The story of the movie is about two brothers who have been friends for a long time, they meet one day and start to play with each other. But one of them start to act strange and starts to believe in the devil. He starts to act like a child and his parents start to suspect him and so they lock him in a closet. But the evil child starts to kill and he begins to do evil things, until one of his brother starts to do the same thing and the two brothers start to fight. The only way for them to escape is by going to a house and finding out that the man who live there are vampires. When they find the house they find that it has been turned into a vampire castle. So they have to go and kill the vampires in the vampire castle and save the people who live in the house. This movie has a great plot and some very interesting characters. The movie has some great action scenes and the music is very good and I think that the movie would be really good if you watch it with a group to talk about it. I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend this movie to everyone. The actors that are in the movie were great and it is a great movie to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ I've seen it. This movie sucks. It's like some sort of movie that a kid would watch for the first time and they all thought it was terrible and the writer was a retard. But then he thought it would be funny to make a movie about the movie and he's still a retard but he's writing a book on it so I'm thinking he's making some money out of it. So why do I give it a 3.5. It was funny in the beginning and then it got to the end. I don't know if I was supposed to laugh at it or cry. And I guess I just don't like bad movies. So I guess it's a 4.5 out of 5 for me. I will say I have watched many worse movies in my life than this one.

I have never seen a movie like this. I mean, I was expecting something funny, but this is nothing like a movie you would see in a movie theater. If you are thinking of getting a good laugh, this is not the movie for you. I was laughing out loud from beginning to end. So, you might as well skip this one. The rating was 7.8, and I think it's a waste of time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ The following are all true: "He had a bad attitude toward his mother." "She was so old-fashioned." "His mother was very good-looking." "He didn't like the movie." "I was glad I got out of there." "The movie was very bad." "It's a very bad movie." I'd like to point out that the above comments were written by my own children. My daughter wrote a similar statement, but she did so with a smile on her face. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. This is a terrible movie. I've seen several bad movies over the years, and I have to say that this is the worst I have ever seen. It's hard to describe the way I feel when I see a movie like this. There is a definite "wow" factor to this movie. The "wow factor" is what makes this movie so horrible. If you are in any way familiar with the original "Indiana Jones" movies, then this movie is not for you. It doesn't even feel like the same movie. It looks like a completely different movie. This movie is a horrible, terrible movie that will leave you feeling disgust and sadness. The story is absolutely horrible. The main character, Harrison Ford, is a poor, dumb, and disgusting person. He's not a very nice person. I don't want to say too much about his character because he does not have a very good character. He is a bad, bad person. The movie opens with Harrison Ford running away from a group of people in a desert. The first thing he does is to break a bottle on a rock and throw it at a group. The bottle then breaks on a tree, which causes the tree to fall on a group who are playing basketball. Harrison Ford's character then runs into a cave and is chased by the cavemen. He then runs through a mountain and into a giant pit. He has no choice but to hide in the cave. The people in the movie then decide to go search for him. They find the cave and Harrison Ford is hiding in it. Harrison is then attacked by some nasty things in the woods. He loses his shirt and a piece of wood. The group goes back to the cave to get Harrison. After that, Harrison is completely alone. The cave is filled with nasty things that want to eat him. The bad things have the ability to turn into animals. The other bad things in this movie have the

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________ 1) The movie opens with a very loud, almost disturbing, song that is played over and over and the dialogue is really awkward. The movie also doesn't make much sense. They just jump around in time, making it seem like they were watching a TV show. The actors are not funny and their acting is very bad. 2) The character who was supposed to be a good guy was just a huge prick. He was not only an asshole, but he had a very negative outlook on life. 3) The story line was also very weird. 4) The final act was very strange. 5) The last shot was very confusing and was just kind of out of place. This movie was so weird that I am not sure what to think of it. ___________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I want to be a man. -Marilyn Monroe I've been to enough horror flicks to know how to read between the lines, and I know this movie's about a guy that goes on a trip to see his old lover. This guy has been a jerk for the past few years, but he's finally ready to get over it. But he doesn't want to talk about it, so his friend and he take a little vacation, and while they're out, they go on a killing spree. It turns out that he's the killer, and he wants to get revenge on all of the people that screwed him over, because he was the one that made them fall for him in the first place. He was the perfect guy for them, and they took advantage of him. I have a lot of sympathy for this guy. He's had a lot to deal with in his life. But then again, he was also a victim, so I'm glad he's at least going through it now.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________________________________________________________________   "I know, I know. It was the worst movie I've ever seen. I mean, really bad. I just...I don't know. There's just no redeeming qualities to this movie at all. It's just a bunch of dumb people having a bad time, no depth or substance to it whatsoever. And it is a bunch, because it was a bunch in my opinion, but not in the best way. I'm sorry. I feel really bad for you, but...there was nothing to enjoy in this movie. Just a bunch people having fun. No life. No anything. I think I'll go sit on a cliff, and watch the ocean."   It wasn't like I disliked the movie. I didn't even hate it. It wasn't a horrible movie. It just wasn't very good. It did get the job done, though. The movie was pretty long, but that's because it took me a lot of time to get through it. If it were all one shot it would have been good, but it was pretty much one long thing. The only time I enjoyed it was during the part where it was just the main characters having a good time. They were actually really funny. There was a lot more humor in this one than in the rest of the movies I've seen, but I don't think that's really a bad thing. I do enjoy a lot in movies where they have a lot less and more humor.   I think it was okay. It got the job accomplished, but just didn't make me want to see the rest.   to top   (This review is not an affiliate link, I just like to make money)

The script was horrible too. The dialogue was horrible as well. The pacing was terrible and the plot was horrible and made no sense. The worst part was that the movie was over in 2.5 hours. No movie is ever going to live up to this one. I was just sad that I wasted my time watching it. I can not wait to see it again because it was a total waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. I'm not talking about the good movie that you saw, but about the bad movie that someone else told you about, like in a school report. The movie had a bad rating on the box office, but in the reviews that I read it had a good rating.  I'm not saying that this movie is bad. I saw it once and had a pretty good time. But the ratings were not only bad, they were misleading. And people who saw it didn't know what they were talking about. They didn't even know that the movie was about a man who had a son who was missing. They thought it was about another missing child in the area, like some missing child that was the focus of the movie. So, there are many more details than what they showed in the movie, but I don't want to bore you with them.  and you would be shocked to hear about the problems that are in this movie, the story is true. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Don't be a dick, you will only ruin your chances of a good review. I watched this movie at a friend's house and had no idea what to expect. I thought it was funny, but I didn't understand what the big deal was. I was kind of laughing but my friends were not. Then I got to the last few minutes and realized the movie was terrible. They had to use the word "dumb" so many times. If this movie was made by the kids from The Simpsons, it would be a total hit. I am a sucker for a good Simpsons movie and this one wasn't it. So many "dumbs" who didn't know when to stop. The worst part is how stupid they were. They were making fun of the dumbest person in the world, Santa Claus. They would say things like "He's the only one who can pull off a white suit, a red suit, and a white shirt in one day." And when they said this, it made me cringe. It's like they were trying to show how stupid Santa is. He was dressed up like he was going to a party and didn't have the time to dress himself. They should have made a parody of this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ (Don't say I didn't warn you)  "The movie is about the struggle between the male and female characters as they try to come to terms with each other in a world which is slowly falling apart. It's also about how society has changed since the 20th century and how it has left a legacy of hatred in the form of religion, sex and drugs."  - The Guardian  1. A man is forced to marry a girl he doesn't like.  2. A woman falls in love with a man and then loses him. .  the movie is a little predictable, as there is nothing in it to surprise the viewer. The plot was very predictable, the characters are predictable. The only thing that kept it from being a complete train wreck was the acting. I really liked the cast. I mean, you could watch a few of the people in the movie and not care about them, but the actors all bring a lot of energy to the roles they play. "This is a good movie, and very funny, but there are a few inconsistencies, such as the fact that the guy falls inlove with the girl he wants to kill. It isn't a big deal, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It would be better if the movie made more sense." "I liked this movie. It has a good script, and the actors really do their best to bring their characters to life. I thought it was funny. The acting was a little repetitive, but that's to be expected from a movie like this." , The Guardian,  . "The movie was very funny. But I can't really say it was all that interesting. The ending was a bit of a letdown."  a lot was made of the fact the girl didn't really know her brother was in love. The movie is so predictable and cliched that I'm not sure that is the best thing to be said about it. It wasn't that it wasn't true or that it was boring, it was just a movie that people loved and that made a lot more money than it should have. The main character, John Wayne, played by Robert Mitchum, is a classic case of what not to do when you are trying to make a movie about love and loss.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ The biggest disappointment of my childhood was this movie. It is a movie I never saw until about a year ago and it completely blew my mind. It was my first exposure to the great Peter Weir, and it is a brilliant story. The characters are wonderful. It's a little slow, but I didn't mind. I was hooked. I love this movie so much that I am going to write a book about it. It had a lot of great things in it, but the story doesn't have much of a payoff. The ending is a bit of a let down. I'm a huge fan of the movie, but this is a great movie and I am so glad I didn'  I'm not sure what happened to my friend's mother, but she looks like she's been to a funeral. She is wearing a purple wig, and she has a bunch of flowers on her shoulders and neck. She has the head of a flower girl on her shoulder. She also has a black skirt and a pink blouse. She's sitting on a throne made of flowers. It looks so ridiculous and creepy. She sits there in her pink blouses and purple skirt. She says "Thank you" to the flowers. Then she gets down on her knees and looks at me and says "I want to kiss you." I say "Um... no?" Then she says "Yes." Then she kisses me. I said "NO! No, no, no!" She then starts making out with me. Then I said something to her and she got mad. I don't know what happened but she grabbed me and threw me down on the ground. She was so angry and angry that she was going to kill me. When she got to me she tried to get me to give her oral sex, but noooo. Then, she said she was so sorry for what she had done to me. She then threw a flower at me. After that I got up and left. When I went home I went into my room and closed the door. When my dad came into my bedroom he was mad and he was going in and out of my room. He found me on the floor. I could tell he was upset. I told him I didn"t want him to come in. He said, "Well, I'm going to have to tell your mom. I think she's going to be angry at you. I need to tell her that she needs to be more

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________  It's not that it's bad. It's not really that bad. What it is, is very badly written. The writing is so bad, that it makes the movie impossible to take seriously.   There are multiple scenes where the film makes the same mistakes over and over again. In the first scene, the lead character is talking to a man who is a policeman. The lead character, after explaining the story of the movie, is suddenly talking to this cop. The cop asks the lead to help him catch a man. The character is so confused about what he should do, that he runs out of the room, where he was supposed to be giving the police a description. The scene is so obviously contrived, that if this movie had been made by a five year old, it would have been a disaster. This is so obvious in fact, that the film ends with the lead running to catch a car that is speeding down a highway. In other words, he just ran from the movie he was making, and he did it in such a stupid way, that you can't take this movie seriously. What a dumb movie this is.  , and is actually a pretty good movie. It is a classic "cop movie" (the genre is not that popular these days), where the lead is the bad guy. The movie starts with the cop chasing a bad guy through the streets of Manhattan, where there are tons of crime scenes. He comes across a bunch of people, and asks them questions. They all answer in the same way, "I don't know, I'm so tired". When the cops get to the scene of the crime, they find the suspect dead, and the suspect's wife, and their two kids. All the suspects are killed by a single gunshot to the head. The cops, who have spent a lot of time and money, are totally baffled. The only clues they have are a pair of sunglasses, a piece of paper, and a note. The note is a series of drawings, and one of the drawings is of a "naked man". The police think this is a possible lead. The next scene shows the lead cop at the scene. He has come across the scene again, and now he has a piece a paper, that is the clue. The piece of the paper says "Do you have any clue? Do you have a clue?". The lead says that he doesn't know. The "nude

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ It was the best of the worst movies I've seen, and it was the worst of the best, and the worst is not worth watching, and there's no way that it was made for the first time, and they just needed a good old fashioned horror movie, and this is what they got. If you're going to have a movie about a murderer, why make it about a murderous killer? Why not make it an insane maniac, or a mentally ill person? And the acting was just awful. If they had just used a normal actor like Robert Englund or Richard Thomas, or even worse, a real person, I could have had a much better time. But the director, the screenwriter, and all of the other people involved in this movie, just sucked.

I know this movie was poorly written and there was a lot of bullshit that went into it. It was a big waste of time and I will not be watching this movie again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ What do you get when you mix horror, comedy, and a dash of the supernatural? This is what happens. This is a movie about a boy who was cursed and transformed into a monster that hunts humans for sport. The film was made by a French director named Lucio Fulci, who is best known for his movies like "Reservoir Dogs" and "Sansho the Bailiff". The film follows the boy who is played by Vincent Price as he has to find out why he was cursed. After he gets captured by some people he has no choice but to escape and he goes on a journey to find the monster that killed his family. While I didn't find the movie to be that bad, there are a few things that bothered me. One of them was the fact that he is a poor kid who has to go to a poor neighborhood. You think that he would have gotten something to eat, or at least a place to sleep. The other thing that bothered my head was the way he talked. He sounded like he was going through puberty, but it wasn't a bad thing because it made him look and sound a little bit more realistic. However, when the monster appears the guy goes nuts and is acting like a teenager and even goes to a nightclub. In the end he is still a boy and you can't help but think that his age was exaggerated because it didn't really fit his personality. In addition to the boy, there is a lot of violence that is used in the movie. It is used to great effect and when you are watching the film you will feel a sense of terror when you see a lot. But I must say that there were a few scenes that were quite annoying. I was particularly annoyed by the scene where a man has a knife and is trying to cut the kid. The knife looks so big and scary and you have to wonder why the knife isn't used on a human. In conclusion, "The Exorcist" is a really great movie that you should give a chance. However I would like to see more scenes like the one in the nightclub.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________ If you're thinking of seeing a movie or watching a show on cable TV, or if you're in a theater that is showing a movie that you don't want to watch or that you have no interest in watching, just find something else to do. I'm not saying that you should avoid movies, but I am saying that if you do have a specific reason to watch a movie, that's the only thing you should be looking at. Movies are like music. They have a genre, but every movie has a song or a song and a dance. You can't have it all, and you certainly can't expect everyone to like everything you like. _________________________________ If someone asks you why you're upset about the news, the reason you are upset is not because of the news. You were upset because the news was the first thing that came up in the news about your death, which you had no idea about. The only reason you were upset was because you were afraid that someone would die because of something that you had absolutely no idea that was going to happen. I know that you are very upset about it, but you have to think about your situation. _______________________________________________________________________ I was not upset about any of this stuff, I was just upset that I had no warning that something like this was going on. I had only heard about the shootings in Aurora and that there was a school shooting in Washington, but there was nothing about the Columbine thing. My friends and I had a lot of fun with the Columbines, and I was in my room when the shooting happened. We didn't know what was going in, we were all laughing and joking around, but that was it. No one was talking about that day. ________________________ I have no problem with this kind of thing, and my family was not planning on going to the mall, and if we were going to go, I think we would have done so after school. I can understand the frustration of those that did not go, and the feelings of those who did. __________________ I can't understand how anyone can think that a Columbine-style incident is something to be proud of. The news is now talking about Columbine as if this is the best thing since sliced bread. The fact is, Columbine is just another "gun" in the long list of "gun-related" incidents. Columbine was just another one of those incidents that you can never be certain is an isolated event.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ What do you think of when you hear "The Big Lebowski"? What do the "What's a Lebukki" and the "Kibbles" in the movie? Do you like that movie? You might like it, if you knew about it. The "Lebowski" is an American film by writer-director-producer-star-producers Joel and Ethan Coen. The film tells the story of a bowling alley owner (Jeff Bridges) and his eccentric brother-in-law (John Goodman) who live in a trailer and enjoy bowling. Jeff Bridges plays the bowling alley's owner, but Goodman plays the brother-of-the-nephew. The Coens are the real stars of this film. It's one of the few films where you can see how good their acting skills are. They have some really funny scenes and make a great movie. You don't know what's going to happen, and it's fun to see. I like that they take the time to make their characters, even if they are weird, like a real family. In this movie, you can tell that the Coens really love bowling. I really like the movie, and you should watch it if you haven't seen it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________"  This movie does not deserve a single negative review. It was made by a great director who knows how to tell a story, make the characters relatable, and has a great story. I love this movie and I highly recommend it. _________________________  The only thing that could've made this a better movie was if the two main characters were the same. I mean, they're both in the same film. But they're totally different characters. They have completely different personalities and stories, but they both feel a lot like siblings to me. It's a very sweet movie, but at the same time, it's very dark. If you're a fan of "Sucker Punch" and/or "The Ring", this is a must-watch. It has great plot and great acting. _____________________________________________________  If you're looking for a good old fashioned, slow burning psychological thriller, then you need to give this movie a look. I've never seen a movie with a story like this before. It may not be your cup of tea, but you'll definitely love this one. I don't know if it's the ending, the way the characters act, or the overall tone, but the story is so realistic that it's really disturbing. The ending was actually a little bit scary and very intense, and it left a bad taste in my mouth. It just made me sad. ______________________________________________________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________   _________  "This movie is just a bunch of lame, uninspired jokes, some with a little bit of originality (like the scene in which an animal tries to eat a human), but most are recycled, or worse, come from old movies. And the film just doesn't have any punch. The characters are all the same: the woman (Sandra Bullock), who gets a job as a prostitute, and the dog (Jake Gyllenhaal), who works as a janitor, so she can afford the rent; the two guys who want to have sex with her, and then get arrested when the cops come to the house to investigate; and the woman who wants to find a cure for her husband, who has been suffering from a terrible illness, but can't afford the medical bills. There is also a man (Jesse Eisenberg) who just wants to get out of his miserable marriage. And finally, there's the dog, who just is in the way of everything. The director, Martin Scorsese, does not have any original ideas, and just wants you to laugh at everything. There are a lot of clichés here, and you have to see the movie for yourself to know that."   - The Toronto Star   "A very boring, tedious and repetitive film. It's the same thing over and over again, with the same characters and same jokes. The movie is full of cheap shots, cheap sound effects, and even cheap music. It is a mess. The film has a lot to recommend it: it has a great cast, it's entertaining and has some good music.

The new version has a couple of scenes that are slightly more interesting than the original. But the original is still a very entertaining, if a bit over-the-top, movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Why not write a positive review about one that is good? The same thing goes for reviews of movies on IMDB. IMDB ratings are a great resource for people who want to know how good a movie is, but it is not a substitute for actually seeing the movie in the theater. The only reason IMDB has a movie rating system is to keep movie critics honest, and to give us a more accurate picture of a movie than a movie poster or a movie trailer. It is a way to find movies that people are actually interested in seeing. IMDb ratings are based on three factors: Criticism, Quality, and Movie. This is a great system, but they also allow for too many movies to be given a rating of 5.0 or even higher. For example, I recently saw The Hobbit and I have seen every movie made by Peter Jackson since The Lord of the Rings. So I am not even close to being a fan of The Hobbit. I would give it a 2.0 on the quality scale, but I would not give it 5.00. The Hobbit is a good movie, but not a great one. I don't think I will ever see it again. I could see a movie version of The Lord Of The Rings, but that would mean I have to watch an entire trilogy of movies and I don;t have the time for that. So my rating for The Hobbit would be a 2, but a 4.5 would be more realistic. I give it an overall rating of 3.5, but no lower than a 4, because I like a good film as much as the next person, but The Hobbit could have used some additional help. I do give it some credit though, it is the highest rated film by the time it is released. So that is something. It would have been nice if the studio had given the film a higher rating.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  -5.5 This is a movie that I've seen multiple times. I've never been particularly fond of it. The first time I saw it, I thought it was okay. The second time I watched it, it was even better. I can't say that I was a fan of this movie, but I did like it. It was fun. The story was fun, and the plot was fun too. The characters were fun, the special effects were fun. But I didn't like it, and I have been thinking about it for a long time. The main character, a high school boy named Mark, is a high-school dropout. He was kicked out of his house, and then had his car stolen. After that, he ended up going to a highschool called Beacon Hill, where he ended to have a very close relationship with one of the girls. He ended up having a girlfriend, but he can't keep a job. The girl is called Stephanie. After the movie, I got the impression that this girl was not a very attractive woman. There were two other girls in the movie. They were more attractive. And their names were Laura and Angela. And they both had a lot of sexual energy. The girls didn't seem to be interested in the main character. It would be a good movie if the main characters were attractive. But they were all the same. They just didn't look like real people. If you don't know how to watch a movie, just turn it off, and go home. And don't watch the DVD, unless you want to watch it with a bunch of your friends. The only good thing about this movie was that it was made by the same director as the "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory". I would have liked to see the "Chocolate Factory" version of this film, but that might be too expensive for your budget. I hope you will have fun with this movie. If this is your favorite movie, then you should see it, because it is a fun movie. The other things about this are not really important. If it wasn't for the sex and violence, this movie would have been good. I give this a -5. The last movie I'll discuss is one that I like very much. The movie is "Dirty Dancing". The story is about a guy named Nicky. He is a boy that lives with his mother, in a small town. He likes
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. _________. _____. _______. _________________.  The "Hollywood" and "Punk" of the early 80s  It was the end of the road for the early 1980s. It was a time of great uncertainty, and that was reflected in the music, movies, and other forms of entertainment that were being produced. It is interesting to note that in those days, punk was an underground sub-genre, whereas the "hollywood" scene was the mainstream. The early 1980's also brought the release of many more films, both foreign and American. The "Hip-Hop" scene exploded in the late 80s, with the emergence of many talented and well-known MC's, such as Kool Herc, Ice-T, and DJ Jazzy Jeff. These two sub-genres continued to grow and develop in the early 90s, while the mainstream of the music scene was going the way of the dinosaurs. It would be a few more years before a mainstream would emerge from the scene again, and it would be with the release by the late 90s of hip-hop's first great mainstream rock band, Pearl Jam.  the punk scene was dying out  But it would take a couple more years for the punk rock scene to die out. It took about ten years, but it would die out in the mid-90s. The scene was starting to get "tired", and it became difficult to find the energy to perform. The punk scene had a few very talented musicians that were very talented, but there were also a lot of talented people that were talented in a different way. The younger generation was not willing to put in the time and effort to learn to play a musical instrument, and many of these people were just not willing or not ready to work hard enough to get better. The music was becoming too "sad" and the lyrics were becoming too personal. It wasn't that the music was bad, but the lyrics and the music were no longer able to express the emotions that had been conveyed in the previous songs. There were many talented people in the scene, but they were not willing and not able to put the time in to learn how to play an instrument and they were unable to express those emotions through their music. The lyrics of these songs were beginning to become stale, and the emotions weren't as exciting as they had been before.  a lot has changed in

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie I have ever seen in my life. It was awful. It wasn't funny. It had terrible acting. It just made me want to kill myself. I hate it. It's the worst movie ever.  And I have seen so many bad movies in my lifetime. But, this one was bad, so bad that I was glad I didn't buy it or rent it because I know it's a rip off. It really isn't good at all.  The worst thing about this movie is that it is about an alien, a girl, and a guy who are trying to steal a spaceship that is guarded by a big monster. The movie is about how they find a way in. They steal a robot, and make a robot that they have to work with. They get in the spaceship, and it is guarded and they are trying not to get killed.   This movie is like a movie about two guys that go into a movie theater and they rob the movie and they have a robot in the movie theater to help them rob it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********** (1/10) ********* (1.5/10): I found the script a bit boring. The story was a bit simplistic, but at least the characters were interesting. The actors were great, and the movie was funny. I enjoyed the first 30 minutes of the movie, but I was tired of the story. After the first hour I was bored. It seemed to be just the same old story. The only good thing I found about the movie is that it showed a lot of different angles of a person who was so nice and gentle and always did what was right. I don't know what the producers thought they were going to do with this movie, and I really wish they had gone for something more interesting. ********** (4/10, very bad): This movie is so bad that it is almost worth watching. It has a really bad plot and a really terrible acting, but the actors are so good that it really doesn't matter. The acting is very bad and there is so much wrong with it. It was like they just decided to put a whole lot of actors on a stage, and then they had them act like animals. I hated the plot, and they never really told me why there was this horrible plague going on. I was not sure what was going on, and didn't care. The movie is terrible, and when I watch it I am going to hate it so much. It is not worth watching because the acting is so horrible. **************** (4.5-5/5, good): This was a very interesting movie. I liked how it was made. It had an interesting plot, it was funny, and there were some great actors. The director and the actors were wonderful. The ending was great, but it was not very exciting. *************** (5/50, very good): I have never watched a movie that I was so scared to watch, but this one made me so scared. The plot was really strange, and it was so strange that I had no idea what was happening. This movie was good for a laugh, but for a horror movie it was awful. The bad acting was bad, and some of the characters seemed to act like they were insane. The last 20 minutes of this movie was just awful. I loved it when it was making fun of the actors, but when it got into the real horror stuff it was terrible. *** (7/10-9/10

The movie was about a guy who was in a relationship with a woman and had a hard time with it. When the movie started it was a bit cheesy but it got worse and worse. There were a lot of scenes where she was being angry and the guy was being all sad and she was just laughing at him. I found it very hard to listen to because it was just all about the relationship and there was no real chemistry between the two of them. I thought they could have cut it out but they kept going. The ending was not very good." "It was just a very sad story. It was about what happens when you break up with your boyfriend. The guy is sad about it and you get to hear his side of the story."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It was so hard to look at and the acting was just awful"  (Sidney Lumet, "Scent of a Woman") I am sure that most of you know that Sidney Lumet's "Sorcerer's Apprentice" was directed by George Stevens and starred Anthony Perkins and Joan Crawford, who is perhaps the greatest movie star of all time. But, if you haven't seen it, you really have to see it. It's a fantastic movie that I have never been able to stop watching since I first saw it on video in 1978. I loved it.  I also loved the fact that it was made by George Lucas and Lucasfilm. I didn't even know that there was a Star Wars movie until after this movie came out. The film follows a young man, Johnny Weissmuller, who becomes obsessed with a witch and is soon transformed into a werewolf.  I still remember the scene when the werewolf's head was removed: It was actually a pretty good werewolf movie.  The only real problem I have with this movie was the dialogue. It was pretty lame and it was always used as a plot device.   The dialog in this movie is as bad as it gets.  As the werewolves in the movie get bigger and bigger, they start to sound more and more like each other.  But, this was George Lucas' first movie, and he did a lot of things wrong in this film. He had an extremely low budget, and I think he didn't know how to direct a film, which is really what this movie should have been. He did a great job, though.  I remember this movie being on a lot in my childhood.  When it came out in 1978, it was a huge hit, and the film went on to gross $22 million at the box office.  It also had a great soundtrack.  In this movie, you can actually hear the music on the movie!  I am actually going to give a special mention to a film that was released at the same time.  This was the original "Star Wars".  I really liked this movie. It stars Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, and it's about the time of the Death Star.  There are some really awesome scenes in this one.  What really makes this film really good is that it has an awesome soundtrack. You can hear the tracks on the sound system, and you really can

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________________  When the title says "Lone Survivor" what does it really mean? It means "Survive and Live" but the reality is, most of these people have not survived. I will never understand how some people can survive such horrific events and go on to live normal lives.   The film was shot on a budget of about $6 million dollars. This film does have its good points, but for some reason it just does not have any. The acting was okay and the film did have a nice cast, but I have no idea what they were trying to say or do. There is no plot, no real tension, no drama and just lots of pointless action and drama. It is so over the top and just ridiculous. The writing is a little weak and has some issues. For example, one of the main characters is a guy named Marko who is described as "a former member of the Bulgarian Army, and a mercenary for hire." This guy is supposed to be one of those tough guys who has survived in the mountains for years. But it's really not his job to survive, it is his job for hire to get other people to do it. What a joke! Why would anyone hire a guy who has never had a fight in his life? This is supposed make you believe he is the most badass person ever. But he is so much more than that.   I just found the whole movie to be ridiculous and just pointless.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ What can I say, it's a bad, bad movie. It is very, very, VERY badly made. Not to mention, it is extremely offensive and vulgar. It would be a lot more interesting to watch an art movie. This is not a movie for a mature audience. ____________ The film starts off with the narrator (Bruce Willis) going to the desert. The camera follows him and he walks around in the desert and is shocked at how he can't even get a nice view of the sunset. He walks around the area for a while and is walking by some random desert critters (that I guess are desert critter critters) and he says that he wants to go back to the city but the narrator thinks that he is going to hell. So the narrator takes his camera and walks down to the sand dunes and he starts shooting. The narrator goes to some random area and finds a bunch of desert crits (probably some of the desert crit crits from the previous movie). He picks one up and he goes to see what kind of critter he is. He turns it over and it turns out to be a scorpion. So he looks at it and the scorpion gets mad at him because the narrator made a mistake. He then jumps on him and starts choking him. So then the narrator is getting mad at the scorpions and then he turns the scorpioes on the narrator. So this time he is getting beaten up and is about to be killed but then a mysterious guy comes and takes the scorpios and leaves the narrator alive. Then the scorpia says to the narrator "You should get out of the way and let me kill you." The narrator looks at the guy and he is a very handsome man. So there you have it. This guy is the most handsome man in the whole world. This man is Bruce Willis. The next day the narrator shows up at the city and he has some trouble finding his way around. Then he sees some people in a car and he tries to ask for directions and he gets turned down. The guys in the car tell him that they know where he is and that he shouldn't worry about it. The guy in the passenger seat tells the narrator to relax and get comfortable. Then there is a lot of screaming going on and then there is this girl with her mouth hanging out. The girls says "If you are a good boy and listen, I will show you a good time." So the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just the worst.  I'm not a big fan of horror movies and this was just a terrible movie.    I had to put the movie down after 15 minutes because I just didn't enjoy it.    It's got nothing going for it other than the fact that it's about a guy that lives in a small town and the local girl that he meets.  It just felt like a bad remake of a horror movie I saw years ago.  Rating:   I can't believe how bad this movie is.  I guess they used a bad script and made a really bad movie. A couple of things I really liked about this movie:   The girl is very attractive and she looks like she would be fun to hang out with.  She also looks very well dressed and well made.  The guys are cute and the movie even has a cute dog in it.   I'm sure it was a lot of fun to watch this movie, but it was not very good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  (A) was great.  I like horror. I like to think I'm more than just a zombie. I don't mind watching bad movies, because I know there are good ones. I've never thought I was a great movie-lover. It's always been more the "I just want to see something bad". And I was pretty damn impressed. I didn't see that coming at all. I was in. And the worst part was that the first half of the movie, the one where they get in the car and the kids go out to eat pizza, was just so stupid. It was like watching a bad daytime talk show, where a bunch of people are standing around doing nothing but talking. And then at the end of the show, when the host says, "So, now I've been to the movies twice now. One is really good and one is really bad", it's like watching someone try to make a point about something, but not be able to. It just falls apart. I wish I could say this movie was good because it was so good, but it was just plain bad. Not bad enough to be considered a masterpiece. I'm not going to watch it again. It didn't do anything new. And that's a shame, because it should have been a movie I would want to watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  A few years ago I was in a serious car accident and was sent home with a broken arm.  While I was waiting for my replacement arm to arrive, I got to thinking about my life, and about life in general.   I had a friend who got a job at a big corporation and decided to move out of her apartment. She did so with a lot of reluctance. She hated her apartment, and her roommate hated her. When she left, they said they would "never see each other again".  I have a pretty good memory, but when I was telling my friend this, she laughed and said she didn't really care, and she was just glad she got a new apartment.   The guy I had been living with had a really shitty apartment and he was not a nice person. I thought about all the people he'd hurt by leaving and wondered if I would have gotten the same reaction.  I told my friend I was going to take the elevator up to the penthouse. When I got there, I found a young girl sitting on the couch. I sat down next to her, and the next thing I knew, she was kissing me.    "This isn't weird at all," I thought to myself. I started to move my hands up her dress, and found that her dress was wet and slippery. I put my hand under it, and discovered that she was wet too. She must have had her shower in, and hadn't washed her hair.   "Do you want me to wash your hair?" I asked. So we went to her room and I washed her. After I washed my own hair, I sat next to the girl. She asked if I could do her makeup. I said I could.   This is how we met. The next day I saw her on the elevator and we talked for a few minutes. Then I told her I was leaving. I had to get back to my apartment, so she agreed to go with me. When we got there I told the girl I was heading back upstairs to my room. She said she had to go too. I asked her if she had a phone, and if she could call me. She started to say no, but I said "OK, let's go then."  As we were walking to my place, I noticed my apartment was unlocked. She took her clothes off and took my keys. She opened my door

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. You're not going to like it, and you'll feel bad about it after you've seen it. That's what makes it such a joy. _____________. But it's the opposite of the bad movie. It's a great movie, but you can't put it in a box and call it a day. You have to be there to appreciate it.  A good movie is one you'll have the time to see over and over. A bad movie is a movie that you'll never want to see again. This one will never be a good movie. But you don't have to have seen it to appreciate the brilliance of this film. In a world where everyone wants to be an action star, this movie shows that even a quiet actor can be an amazing one. The film was written by John Ford, who made the classic western "Stagecoach". The script is one of the most underrated films ever made. In this film, Ford was so interested in making a movie about a quiet, humble character, that he even wrote it on a napkin. And what a beautiful napkin it is. The movie is set in the early 1900's and takes place in a small town, which is not the most interesting place. The town is run by the mayor, who is a man of few words. But this town has a special beauty that the film doesn't show. The beauty of the town is what makes the movie so special. The people of this town have a deep sense of justice. They live with honor and integrity. There is nothing more beautiful than a town where justice is not just a word. That's what this movie is about. Justice, not just in a legal sense. Justice is a feeling. A deep, strong sense of righteousness. And the people of Stagecoach are the embodiment of this justice. When they are called upon to defend their town, they will do whatever is necessary. The way they do it is different from the way we do it, but they do the same thing. And I love that. A movie is not always about what's happening on the screen. You need to be involved with the people who are acting in the movie to see the beauty. That is the beauty of this movie. When you see this movie, you see the characters in a way that you never see them before. And even though we know who they are, they still make you feel like you are in the
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ What a bad film. It was shot at a very cheap studio in California with a crappy soundtrack and very poor acting.  The film opens with a couple of women in a motel room (who later turn out to be the wife and mother of the main character) discussing what to do with their two children. The woman tells her husband to leave them, and he leaves her.    The scene is set-up for a movie about "The Baby-sitters Club."   Later on, a new mother has to take care of her two children while her husband works and the mother goes out to have sex with a man she met online.  When the husband returns, he finds that the children are all fine.  But, he is still very upset about the affair.  So, he decides to leave the family.  It is not clear how this was supposed to end.  I didn't like the movie and would have rather just watched the original.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Sep 20, 2017 12:32 PM by  The Last Starfighter   Loading...  A Star Wars story, of course, is not meant to be read as a novel, but rather as a series of films. If you've never seen the movies, I would highly recommend watching them first, especially if you're a big Star Wars fan. But, as a book, the first Star Wars book in particular doesn't hold up too well, and is mostly a retelling of the films. This book, which I've never read before, is set between Episodes IV and V, so it's more a rehash than a stand-alone novel. And while it's still good, the main problem with this book is that it doesn't have the depth or feel of the movies. The characters are all very flat and don't grow much in this novel. The book is mostly about Yoda and Obi-Wan talking about how they need to train the next generation of Jedi Knights. This is fine as an introduction to the book, but it doesn�t provide much background for what's going on with the characters. In the book Yoda is a completely different character, and the focus of the story shifts to Anakin and Padme. It's like watching the first two films in a different order. In a book about Luke and Leia's training, it's strange that we get no background about Anakin or Obi-wan. In this book we're just supposed to believe that Obi- Wan is a great teacher and Yoda isn�t, but then Yoda turns out to be a bad teacher and Obi Wan turns out not to be very good at all. The problem is that we're never given any insight into who these Jedi are, and it makes it hard to care about these characters. Even with this problem, I really enjoyed this book. It was a fun retelling, and I felt like I was getting a lot of information from this book that I wasn't getting in the movies themselves. I also really liked the introduction to Yoda. In my opinion, it was the best part of the book. And I didn't think it had any flaws, which is really amazing considering the other things this book had. It has some great ideas and some interesting character interactions. It also has some very nice action scenes, which makes up for the flat characters. But overall,

If you are looking for a good horror movie that's not cheesy, then give this a try.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.  A movie about the "universe of Star Wars" is not a bad idea. But it is a movie about what it means to be a Jedi (or Sith).   It is also a movie that tries to be everything. But when it is trying to be all at once it loses itself. I understand that this movie is about Star Wars and it should be about that. But what is the story here about the Force and Jedi and the galaxy and Jedi's? I can not imagine a story like that.   The movie should be all about Obi Wan Kenobi. He is the one who is trying hard to be the "Master of the Force". He is trying very hard and it pays off. But he is not able to fully master the Force. He just is a good teacher and he teaches us a few things about the power of the force. But there are more important things in this movie than just what Obi Wan can teach us. There are many things that this "Star Wars" movie needs to be about, but the movie is not about them.  the movie should have been about the characters.  of course, there is Obi Wan. There is also the "young" Anakin. And there are many more characters who have their own storyline and they are all important and important for their own stories. But the main character in this "movie" is Obiwan. So he is the main person to be taken in this story. And it is not the best to take a story that is about a person (which is more interesting than a movie like this) and take it to a place where the person does not have a storyline. But that is exactly what is happening here. This movie is more about Obiwan than the characters in it. The story should have not been about Obi-Wan. It should have be about the Jedi and what they are and what makes them good or evil.   He should have shown us how they do their thing. How they can use the Force to fight. How Jedi can use it to fight evil. This would have been much more interesting for the story.   What about the other characters? They should have had their own storylines. And I guess that they would have had them very good.    The movie tries to have it all. It tries to show how the force works. It is not just a Force that a Jedi has. The Force is in the minds of all Jedi. It

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________  "I will never watch a movie again because of this guy"  The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that it was too long. It would be shorter if there wasn't a long explanation about the world of the movie, but that's a different problem. The movie's plot was very simple. The whole movie is about a girl and a guy who meet in a park and start a romance. It's really boring and repetitive. It takes about 6 minutes of the film to show the girl's past and how she met the guy, and it's not really interesting. The girl's only motivation was to get to the park because her boyfriend was in it, and he left a message for her. She wants to go to the movie because it will be her last movie date. The main guy doesn't show any feelings for the girl, and just wants to be friends with her. The only character who is a little interesting is the guy's sister, who is very intelligent. The rest of the characters are just boring. The guy's family also don't do anything important. The plot of the story is also very simple, but the movie didn't need to be. It had all the scenes you need to know about. The story was a great way to teach people about love and life. I recommend this movie for people who are interested in watching a movie with a very short plot. The characters are all very cute and interesting. I liked how the girl wanted to meet the guy who always had a nice smile and she even told him she was interested. It was nice that the movie wasn't overbearing, because I really wanted to see more of the love story. If you want to watch a good romantic movie, I would recommend this one.

I've never been a book reader that is interested in discussing the book with people who are not interested in the book. There are so many different ways to read a story, so I've always wanted to be more involved in the story, but I never thought I would be so excited about a book I was reading. I was excited about this book from the very beginning, but it took me a little while to figure out how to approach the book, and how to write about it. I don't know why, but for whatever reason, I never knew that the first time I read a novel would be my last time reading one. But I can't wait to find out what happens next.  The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly  This is an interesting novel. I loved it from beginning to end. The writing is superb, and there are so much happening in the novel. This is definitely a book you will want to re-read, especially the last half. You will be hooked from page one. , and this book is the reason. This book is not just a good novel, but an interesting one. This story follows three men, each with a very different and unique backstory. Two of them are in the military, and one is a retired cop. One of the men in the army is in a romantic relationship with a woman he's never met. The first man has an abusive childhood, and is trying to get over it. The second man has PTSD and is attempting to stay alive. The third man is in prison for a murder he committed. The story is about these three men attempting to find a way out of their own pasts, and to do so, they are going to have to make some very difficult choices. I enjoyed every bit of this book.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* I have to say that The Avengers was an interesting film and the actors were great. I was very surprised how much I enjoyed it, but it was very predictable and I did not like how they did the first fight scene. I also found it annoying that all the people in the Avengers were supposed to be different people. There were more people than expected and none of them were recognizable. I really did not want to see the sequel. ******** The next film that I saw was The Matrix. It was a very interesting movie and the ending was awesome. I enjoyed the movie and even though I have only seen it once, I still recommend this movie. I would love to see a follow up film with the same cast. It would be great if they would take the movie in a different direction and give it a good plot. "It's been said that time is the greatest teacher but it's also the worst.

It's like watching a guy who was a huge fan of a movie and then got a chance to work with them on a big screen. The production was terrible. The sound was terrible and the costumes were awful. It was all poorly acted. It would be fun to see this movie with the right director, the right actors and a proper budget. This is not a bad film by any means, but there is no reason to spend $5.00 to go see it." -James P. _____________________________________________________ "Well, I can see how this film would appeal to some people - it looks great and the film has the best ending of any movie I've seen. But if you like this type of movie, you won't enjoy this film. The acting is very stiff and you can tell the director doesn't care at all about the film. You can tell that he wasn't really paying attention to what he was doing and this is a shame. It seems to me the film would have been better if the director had stayed with the characters and not acted out all the dialogue. I mean, there's not a lot of dialog in this film and the actors were terrible. If this was a commercial film and it was directed by someone who really cared about the movie, it would have made a much better film. This film has nothing going for it." --Joe G. ____________________
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************* This movie is terrible. I did not want to see this movie, but after seeing it for the second time, I was so angry. I have never seen a movie with such horrible acting and so many bad choices that could have been avoided. A girl and a boy fall in love, but her boyfriend is a jerk, so the girl ends up breaking up with him. After a long time of looking for him, the girl meets a boy who seems to know her and they go on a trip together. The movie has this romantic feel, but you could tell that it was shot by a low budget. The characters were very unlikable, and most of the acting was so bad, you couldn't see how bad they were. If I was in their shoes, I would have made the same choice that the girl did. It was a waste of time. If you are looking for a romance with a happy ending, look elsewhere. The acting is so bad and the plot was so stupid, I couldn't watch this movie again. The only good thing about it is that it's rated R, but if you want to laugh at a movie, I can't recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ The Story: The story of this movie is simple. A group of friends from the same small town are being invited to an outdoor party. They are all really excited to go, but when they arrive they find out that it's a trap. A few of the guys are really upset at the party, but one of them is in love with the girl. The others try to make him feel better by making him believe that he's the only one who loves the girl, but all that does is make him more sad. The girl in love, on the other hand, doesn't care at all about the others. She doesn't give a shit about anything but her love for him. They get into a fight with one of the other guys, and he ends up killing the guy. The group of guys all start crying and telling the story of the guy who was killed, and how the girl killed him. The guys are so pissed that they end up breaking into the girl's house, where they find her naked on the bed. They tell the girl that she killed him, and she says "Well, I'm not a killer, you guys. I just wanted to kill you for me." The guys tell her they'll kill her if she ever does anything like that again, but she's too scared to tell them that she loves him. So they do what they can to get revenge on her, and when they've killed her, they're all in tears. But the girl is too far gone to do anything about it. She just lays there and cries for the rest of the night. When they wake up the next morning they find that the girl had died, and the guys find out how she died. The movie was really bad, but it did have some good parts. The music in the movie was very cheesy. The editing was also bad. The scene in which the guys come up to the girl and start talking to her was great. I can't remember which scene it was, but I think it was the one where they were holding her by the arm. It was funny, and really made me laugh. The whole movie was like that, and it's really hard to find a good part. I think this movie was made to make money, but the story was so bad that I think the movie would have made less money had it not been for the stupid plot. The ending was also kinda stupid. The guy who tried to kill the girl was supposed to

"It has everything you want from a thriller, and it has everything that you don't want from it. It's one of those movies that, if you think about it, you think it's good. You think about the characters, and you think of what you think the movie should be. And then you watch it and you go, 'I wish I'd written that.' It's that weird mix of good and bad, and I think you have to look at that in a good way."  The movie centers on two men: Richard (Patrick Fugit), a former Marine, who is suffering from PTSD after being deployed in Iraq, and James (Patrick Wilson), a retired New York detective. Richard, who once saw people killed by his own troops, has become a recluse and has been living with his mother, who seems to care more about him than he does about himself. When he meets James, who had a wife and a child when he was in the Marine Corps, he thinks he might be able to help him, but the two quickly become obsessed with each other.  When James and Richard's families find out that they are dating, their families get involved. The family dynamics and the emotional dynamics are what make it so compelling.  of the two men.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I had fun, I laughed, but this movie ruined my life." A bad movie is not a movie you should watch.  Bad movies are movies that don't make you feel anything. ______________________________________________________ So I guess I should address the main thing I like about the movie: it is funny.    It is funny because of the characters, the story, the comedy.  The movie is a little over five minutes long, so it has a lot of room to make you laugh.  If you like a story that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, it is a fun watch. As I was watching this movie, I was thinking that the main problem with this movie is that it is so bad.  The characters don't seem like they are having fun and they don't even have an idea of what they are doing.  It has the most horrible dialogue in the movie, and I would like to see a good ending.  That's all I can say about this movie.  I can't even remember what happens.  For the most part I was just bored by this movie and it didn't really do much for me.  But if you like bad movies and you don't mind the terrible dialogue, you should give this movie a try.

I thought this movie had a lot of potential. I'm sorry it didn't come off as much as it could have. I felt like I was watching a movie, not a movie. The acting was good, but I'm not sure why they were acting at the beginning. If they could have just let it go at the end of the movie, that would have been a lot better. It was interesting to see a different perspective on things and that's all it really needed. I think I'll just go watch something else.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "the actors are all shit, the action is boring and the story is bullshit." (I'm not saying it's bad. Just the same way I didn't give a shit about a movie called "Pitch Black" and a movie about a black guy named "Mack" because they weren't as good as the last movie. It was the last one and that movie sucked.) "A lot of people are going to hate it." (This movie is bad. It's just bad. That's all.) It's about a man who is trying to get away from his past, a man whose past is the reason for all the bad things he's going through. A man who tries to get past his past and live a life that he can be happy. The movie follows a man as he tries to do so. It isn't easy. It doesn't end well. It is a slow burn. It takes its time and has a lot of plot holes, it isn't the best film to watch when you want a happy ending and it doesn't have a satisfying ending. However, I still enjoyed it. It does give you the idea of what is going on with this guy. It makes you think. The story is also interesting and the acting is pretty good. It also isn't very hard to follow. The film isn't exactly deep but it's not so simple that you can get lost. The ending, however, was a complete let down. It seems like there's a trend going on in horror movies, a trend of movies where the movie just isn't interesting enough. A movie that you'd have a hard time getting invested in. A film that you don't really care about. I don't want a movie that is boring. I want a good movie. That has a great plot. That is filled with great acting. A great story. That will make me want to see the movie more. That won't make me have to force myself to watch it. I think that's the problem. That we expect to see more horror movies that are so bad they are good. I mean, look at "The Purge" or "Insidious" or anything by James Wan. These movies aren't great movies but they're great movies. The fact that they are so horrible is why they are great. I hate that. I know I have to admit that I don I was really hoping for a sequel. It would have been nice

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________ I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, because it was based on a book that was a really good one. The book was called "The Boy Who Cried Wolf" and it was the story of a boy that went missing, and later he was found. In this book, the boy, the wolf, and the boy's mom went on a journey to find the wolf. It was really good and I was looking forward for this movie to be as good as the book. The movie was pretty good but I did have a few problems. First, the movie was all in black and white. This was a big problem because it made it really hard to see. But the movie did give me a better idea about what was happening. The wolf was all gray. It looked like a gray wolf and the wolf was the big bad guy. I didn't like how the wolf had a bad attitude and was not a nice guy. The boy was always in a bad mood, and he was always yelling at the wolf which made me think that he was crazy. The girl in the movie also didn't seem to be in a good mood because she didn't smile at the wolves and she didn t seem to get along with the wolf at all. This movie made me wonder if the wolf did really get the boy and the girl. I was also wondering if the wolves really did get them. I'm not sure. All in all, I'm a little disappointed because this movie didn't really have a good story. I think it would have been a good movie to watch but it was a little boring to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. I have read that there are people who are not satisfied with a bad film. I am one of them. The last time I saw "The Green Mile" it was the worst movie I have ever seen. The only reason I watched it was because the theater was crowded and my friend and I had to watch it with him. It was bad. So why am I still watching it? Well, because it's fun! The best part about it is the action scenes! I think this is the only way to watch this movie. In the end, I still had fun. My only complaint about this movie was that it did not end on a good note. There are many people who would have loved to see this movie to end. I feel sorry for them. This movie is a great example of a "cult classic". I would recommend this movie just for the fun of it.

This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. It's all just about making fun of bad movies. The writing is atrocious. The film was very long, but it only took about 2 hours to watch the movie. The story of the movie was so bad that I actually don't remember the plot line. I just remember that the film ended with a lame ending. If you're going to watch this film, I suggest that you skip this movie. I wouldn't waste my time watching this, and I'm sorry for the poor review.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not just that the movie isn't good, but that it's not bad at all.  The story is simple enough.    A boy and his dog are living a peaceful life in the mountains.  The boy and dog have no problem living together.  But a group of men and women are constantly coming to the boy and the dog and stealing the food.  One day the group finds a girl with no clothes.  When the boy sees her he starts to think of himself as a girl.  So he changes his name to a girl, gets her a new name and a new home.  After a few weeks the man who changed the boy's name comes back to the house and finds out that the girl was changed back to a boy and now he is her brother.  He tries to talk to the girl to find out what happened to her.  At the end of the movie we learn that the boy was really a boy that got changed into a girl by a man and he is now trying to figure out how to become a real boy again.  It's a very simple story, but it is good because it shows us the human condition and it is a very relatable story.  This movie made me really think about the problems we as human beings face.  As humans we live in a world that is constantly trying to make us think of something else than what we are.  In this movie we see a boy who is living a very comfortable life in a beautiful place.  This movie made a huge impact on me because I have a lot of family that is from the same town in which the movie was made.  I was able to talk about my parents and my friends and I found that I was actually able to get a lot out of this movie.    I don't know what made me watch it again, but I wanted to read more about this movie and see what was going on in the world.  Now that we are done with this movie, we are left with a question:  What is the answer to this movie?   I really want to know what happens in this movie because I would love to know.

The thing is, I don't actually want to see a movie that I'm going to hate.  It just doesn't make any sense to me that someone would say that they couldn't watch this movie.    I'm not saying that the movie is perfect.  The story and writing is just bad, but at the same time it does manage to make you feel sympathy for the character.  But at the end of the day, this movie doesn't have anything to say.  It just has bad story, bad acting, and bad writing.  I wouldn't say that this movie is a bad flick.  No, it has a lot of flaws, but for what it is, it's a really bad flick.  I mean, that is why I have to keep my rating at 2.  And for me, I think it deserves a 2.5  I don.t think that I can say that I was completely entertained, but what I was entertained by was the fact that I have this little thought in my head that was just like "What the heck is going on here?"   A bit of a different take on the same story, I guess.  Oh yeah, and the ending was really cheesy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ The movie is great, but the plot was awful. It was about a guy who goes to Japan for some reason, then has to deal with an alien invasion. It had a bunch of cool scenes that just never went anywhere. This movie was really boring. The plot was lame, and the characters were lame. They had so many cliches and stupid dialogues. They were all in love, and then they get married and then have kids and then the alien invasion starts, and they are all like, "oh no, the aliens are here again, we have to kill them". It was so lame. I'm sure the director wanted to make a big movie about aliens and the war and everything, but he just wanted to show all of these different aliens and aliens trying to kill each other and having these huge battles. It's like watching a crappy soap opera, but with aliens. I know they made this movie, but it was just a bunch-o' cliched movies. The ending was stupid, and I think that's why they didn't end the movie. It would have been much better if they had just ended it. It wasn't really a good movie.

The actors are so terrible that you'd swear they were playing themselves. The story was also so bad, that I can't even remember the plot. And the acting was so bad that you wonder how they can be expected to do anything but act like complete assholes. I thought this movie was going to be about a group of friends who just happen to have a giant robot in their basement, but it was more about how they all got a hold of this thing, and it just got out of control. But even though this movie had a ton of problems, I still think it's worth checking out. If you can stomach a lot of bad acting, then I'd say that this movie will be for you.

"One of my favorite characters is Roland," King said of the new character, played by Idris Elba. "Idris is great. He's got the right attitude. He does everything right. He is a hero, a protector, and he is good at what he does."  in the second film, he said he was able to create a new character. "With this movie, I was able just to make a new guy," he joked. "In the first book, Roland is not really a new person. I was going to make him a new man, but I thought, 'No, that wouldn't be as good. That would be kind of boring.'"  King said that he hopes his movie will become a cult hit. "If the movie

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ My rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars ____________________________ What do you expect from a movie that was supposed to be a satire about the film industry? This film is all about the director. What a total douchebag! I'm not gonna spoil it for you because I'm pretty sure it's obvious but this film was a disaster. I'm sorry but this guy has no talent at all and it shows. The only reason this film is any good is because the director was really talented and really wanted to make a funny movie and it all fell apart. He wanted to do a spoof on The Godfather but this movie was all about him and how he would make it all about himself. His characters were just made out to be idiots. The one scene in the movie that I really enjoyed was the scene where the director and his girlfriend are on their first date. They get into an argument and the director gets so upset that he can't even talk. He says that he's so nervous and his nerves are through the roof because he doesn't know what to say and it's all because of his girlfriend. So, what's he gonna do when his girlfriend comes in? He has to make up some lame excuse and that's exactly what he does. What's worse is the fact that this film doesn't even have a good plot! It's just a big goof that you should watch if you don't want to see any good acting in a movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A new movie comes out this month. It has a nice plot, some decent acting, and some cool music. But, if you're not into sci-fi or are just looking for a cheap action flick, you might be disappointed.  The movie is titled "Black Rock." It's about a small group of people living in a post-apocalyptic world. A lot of them have some sort of alien disease and their skin turns black and they are called "BlackRock." They live in a bunker underground and try to live out their days in an underground city.  of course, there's some bad guys who want to take over this underground city, and they do a lot of crazy stuff to try and get their way. The movie was made in 2001 and stars a lot more black people than you would expect, and a lot less Asian people. The most interesting part of the movie is when the black people are talking to the white people and they're talking about how cool the city is, and how cool they are. It's so cool and you can't imagine a world without it. The music in this movie is nice, but it's really not much to write home about. It does sound cool though, and if you like the music, then you might like it. - March 31, 2004Movie rating:

I thought the director was funny, the cast was really nice and the ending was a good end to a good movie.  The only problem was the sound, I didn't really like the sound of the movie, it was just loud and not nice.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________ The movie is so bad that I can't even tell you how bad it is. It has a lot of problems, but the worst one is that it's basically just the same thing over and over. The movie starts off by having the main character getting abducted by aliens, then the story goes into the space shuttle, then into the ship, then back to the main characters, then to another alien spaceship, then more space shuttle action, and so on. I can go on and on about the problems with this movie, but I won't. The only thing I can tell you is that there is only one really good thing about this movie. If you're a Star Wars fan, you probably will like it. If not, you will probably hate it. The characters are so stupid and obnoxious that they make the movie almost unbearable. At one point in the movie, a character says "What's so wrong about that?", then another character says, "What about that?". The movie has such bad dialogue that it makes you want to punch people in the face. For instance, a friend of mine told me that there was a scene where a character was talking to the guy on the ship about the main ship. The main ship was just sitting there, and the character was telling him that he couldn't find anything to do with it, and then the guy says, in a high voice, "It's too small, it doesn't work, I'll never use it, there's no room for anything in here, I don't want to sit in here." I couldn't believe it. It's like watching a drunk walk around a room talking to himself. If this movie was about anything, it would be about the bad writing. It would be the same movie with a different ending. I just hope that Star Wars fans don't go to this movie thinking it's some sort of Star Wars ripoff. I really hope that the writers and directors of this movie will read this review, because they'll probably learn something from it. I give this movie a D. The Worst.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________  The movie starts out pretty much like a standard superhero film but once the action starts it all falls apart. The movie goes to a whole new level when the villain, a villain that's so over the top that he's a joke, shows up. The villain gets a whole load of new powers and weapons and gets a girl (Diana Rigg) to get him through his trials. The main villain in this movie is a really lame villain. It's not like he's bad and doesn't get his moments, but his scenes are too few and far between. He has a lot of trouble getting any chemistry with his co-stars and I didn't even care for his character. The only thing that he has going for him is his costume which was really cool but was way over thetop and just too much for this movie. The best thing about this movie was the story which was good but was just kind of dragged out and dragged out to the point where you'd get bored and go home. I wasn't really into the main villain, the bad guys were pretty lame. This movie was just an absolute train wreck that could have been made better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________ _________ ______________________________________________ I was very intrigued by the movie 'The Mummy' (2005). The poster and trailer promised a "big movie, big budget, big special effects." And so I sat and waited, hoping for some magic to happen. And boy was I wrong! This movie was a disappointment. The movie was boring, not even exciting at all. The cast of characters were all cliched, and the movie's story and characters are not only cliches but are also boring. The most entertaining part of this movie was the "monster" the hero (played by Tom Cruise) fought against, and that's it. The action scenes were boring as well. And what's the point of this film? To tell a story about the Ancient Egyptians? Well, it wasn't very good at telling that story. The plot and characters were completely unnecessary, and I felt cheated out of any emotional connection with the characters. There was not even a reason for the character to go on a journey, and there was no need for an "evil" evil scientist. The only thing the film had going for it was the big budget and the special effects. There is no way I can watch this movie again, especially after all the hype it got. The story of this poor movie was very disappointing, and a waste of money and resources. The actors, director, and producers of this stupid movie could have made a good movie out of it, but they did not, and they should be ashamed of themselves.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ I have not seen any of the films on this list, so I have no idea what it's about. The "I'm so glad it's over" ending is the worst ending a movie can have, and the whole movie is about the loss of a person. _______________________________________________________________________________________ I'll take a bit of criticism for this one, but I think it has some good points. The movie does a great job of portraying the aftermath of the bombing, and I thought it had a lot of the right ideas about dealing with trauma and the importance of supporting one's family. _________________________________________________ The movie was about a man who lost his wife and children in a bombing in a small town. When his wife died in the bombing of his town, he was unable to live without her. After being unable to come to terms with what happened, he decided to stay in his house and raise his two daughters by himself. I found the movie to be very interesting. It has some of the same issues that many other movies do, and there were some really interesting ideas, but the ending was very frustrating. _________________________ I didn't find this one to be a good movie. The pacing is a little off, the ending seemed a little rushed, and it felt like a film that was rushed into production. I'm not sure why it was made. ____________________ A few people on a plane.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is terrible.  It's one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.  The story is so boring.    You watch it once.  It starts out with an interesting premise.  The movie has a girl named Michelle who has a lot of issues and has been in the hospital for a few days.    She's got a little brother and he needs her help and she goes into the hospital to see if she can do something for him.  She goes in and has to deal with a bunch of crazy people and then she gets some crazy things done to her.  Then she goes back to her apartment and goes to sleep.  That's all it is.  This is the only way the movie makes sense.  Michelle goes back and she has some weird dreams and things that happen and she wakes up in the morning.  I'm not going to give any spoilers because this movie is not a good movie.  In the beginning of the movie there are some people talking about this new virus that's been spreading and how it's going to wipe out the world.  And then at the end they say it's not really the virus.  After all the virus is like a virus but it doesn't have a name.  So then we go back to Michelle's apartment.  Now we find out that Michelle was trying to get away from her mother because she's sick and it wasn't going to be a good situation.  But she didn't realize the house was on fire.  How?  Because she was asleep and the fire woke her up.  There's nothing about this that's exciting.  We learn that Michelle's mother is not really her mother.  What?  She's not actually her mother, but she thinks she is. And her mother is also an alien.  A big one.  Why are the aliens in this movie?  They're like a race of aliens that come to Earth.  They live on a planet called Aridia.  At first I thought they were going to come to earth but they didn't.  Aridia is one of those planets that you don't really need a spaceship to get there.  Because you can fly there from the planet itself.  Anyway, Michelle is getting sicker and sicker, and she's not going into the coma that the doctors said she would.  Maybe it's because of this virus or something.  When she wakes

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ I have seen many bad movies in my life. I thought this movie was bad from the beginning. The acting was terrible, and the acting of the two main characters was the worst I have ever seen. I do not know why it took me so long to watch this movie, and I'm glad I finally did. The film was like watching a train wreck. The actors were unprofessional and the script was not funny. There was no plot, no story, and nothing to keep the movie entertaining. I have read some reviews that said this movie is based on a true story, but I have never heard of that. I can't believe the director did not do a good job. The story was very confusing and the characters were ridiculous. I would have never thought that I would like these people.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________   "You can't be a great artist if you're only doing one thing. You have to do all the things, but it has to be a lot of things. That's the secret of art." -Albert Camus   The plot of "The Dark Knight" is a simple one: Batman, the Caped Crusader, has retired from the force and is living a quiet life in Gotham City, but when he hears of a high-profile case involving a killer who targets the rich and famous, he decides to return to the profession to take down the villain.   It's hard to judge the movie for what it is. The first few scenes are all the action we've come to expect from a comic book film: Batman fights a few thugs, fights a couple of bad guys, and uses a lot more weapons than a typical comic book movie. However, it's not until the film's second half that the film really kicks in, and it does so in a very satisfying way.   and the action starts to get very intense. It doesn't really have much of a beginning and end, but what's left in it is really satisfying, and if you've never seen a comic-book film, you owe it to yourself to see it. The action in this film is incredible, and the effects are really good. The only problem I have is that the first few hours of the film are very repetitive, and you can see a pattern forming that will be present in the rest of the movie. It really gets boring after a while, and that's when it begins to get a little annoying. But other than that, the movie is fantastic, and for me it's one of the best comic book films.   "The Avengers" was another Marvel movie that I saw and enjoyed, but unlike "The Hobbit," "The Incredible Hulk," and "X-Men: Days of Future Past," "Iron Man 3" is not a sequel to any other Marvel movie, and so that means that "The Iron Man 3: The Winter Soldier" is very much a new film. This is a movie that will take you to another place in time, and a new world. It's set in the 30th century, but we don't see much of the present, instead focusing on the Cold War, and in this way it can be thought of as a Cold War-set action film. The plot revolves around Tony Stark, who is a billionaire inventor

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ If you hate this movie and you have a weak stomach, you will hate this review, too. It is the most disgusting movie ever made. A woman (who looks like an evil witch) is walking down a street, wearing only a pair of panties. The camera focuses on her and she is covered in blood. Then a guy comes out of a house, wearing nothing but a pair. He is so evil and evil looking. I thought it was an alien and wanted to kill him. Then he looks up at her and he is covered with blood. And then he turns into a werewolf. That was the first time I've ever seen a were wolf look so human. I wish I could take this film and burn it with me to make a camp fire. This movie is so bad. You will not be able to watch it and not have your stomach turn. This film will give you nightmares. It's just so wrong. It looks so fake. It feels so real. And the werewolf thing was so fake, too, too! And it was just a man in a suit. You're going to get sick from this one. It was just awful.

The movie was just stupid and the characters were ridiculous. The actors were all horrible. I could see why the people who made the movie wanted to make it like a "cage fight" movie, and then the people in the movie decided to make them into stupid and annoying people. The writing was just bad, and the acting was not bad, it was bad. The story was stupid, and I think it was just a bad idea. The worst thing about this movie is that they were trying to make the main characters look like idiots, and they failed at that. Also the main character was so stupid and his actions made no sense at all. There was no motivation behind the main guy, and no one in the whole movie was good. There were no bad guys in this movie. The only one that was a good character was the girl, and she was annoying. The whole movie just sucked, and this movie really should have never been made. I hate this movie and I hate the people that made it. I really hope the people involved in making this movie never work again. It was stupid and it was a bad joke to people, and to me. I will never watch it ever again, and never recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________   "I had never seen a movie quite like this one, not only in its content, but in its audacity of expression. I saw it with the idea that I would be impressed by the sheer number of special effects it had and that I should be impressed because of its director, but I was surprised to find the movie so weak and so bad that I found it laughable. The actors were all average at best and the scenes were so repetitive that they began to make me sick. In the movie there is one scene where a girl is walking along with her mother who is also walking, and there are no other people in the scene, so there is nothing else to do except stare at them. I couldn't help thinking that the woman was having an affair with her son, and in the end we learn that she is having an abortion. But even though this scene was very silly, it was very touching because the mother was so sweet and she wanted her daughter to grow up with a loving father who loves her and would never hurt her. The mother was a wonderful and convincing actress who did an excellent job."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.   I hate the "star-powered" movies, the ones where a bunch of "stars" have to be in them to get the job done. There are too many cases of "the star" playing a supporting role. But, if it is an interesting role and the star does a good job, I'm all for it. But for most of the times I have seen them, they are not interesting, they just are.   and I don't think that most of these stars are even "star power". And there are even times when the director/producer is not even the star. I mean, I don\'t think that any of these people can really sing.   a few of the "stars", like in "M*A*S*H", are really talented. But the rest of them, are just "stars".   And the worst thing is that most movies with "star" in the title are crap. They are always a bad experience for the audience. But this time, the movie is a big disappointment.   of course, the director (Peter Jackson) is a famous director, but the movie never is interesting. It is always dull and it is just a long story of a group of men.  , the actors are not very good, I mean they have nothing to do. Even the "villains" are weak, there is no real villain. The story is just too boring. The way they handle the story is not very clever and not very original.   the story of "The Lord of the Rings" and the way they were told was much better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********  A bad movie is a film that tries too hard, is too long, tries to be too clever or too much, is a bad story, too many characters, too much dialogue, too "dramatic" and tries to have a message (i.e. "don't judge a book by its cover"), or has characters that don't do anything but act.  ********* (1940, US) (Director: Charles Vidor)  The film opens with a scene that is the most over-the-top and absurd, with an alien in a wheelchair and a little girl who's talking to him. The girl is saying that she is going to see a movie, but she doesn't tell what it is. In the movie, the little girl is a princess, and her father wants to get her to the theater. The little girl's father tries to get a ticket for her, but the ticket inspector doesn't want to sell it because it is a children's film. The father tells him to tell the inspector what it's about. The inspector doesn. "It's about a princess who falls in love with a prince." The father tries everything to get the ticket. He buys the ticket, then sells it for more money, and finally he takes his daughter to the ticket window to try to get his money back. The ticket inspector takes a ticket from his pocket, and tells the father to buy a ticket himself, but he says no. The mother then tells the inspector that she needs a ticket, but says that she can't go with her daughter. The dad then asks her to go with him, but when she asks why, he says that his daughter is not old enough. He says that they should go together, but in a carriage. The daughter then asks why they should take a carriage, and the father replies that they are going to go to the theatre. When she asks if it's a play, he responds that it's not a play. The film is so stupid, but I can't blame the director because the whole film is about him trying to get money, his daughter's feelings, and his mother's feelings. I guess he really tried to make a good film, but it just didn't work. (The "tickets" for the carriage were only $1.00. A $1 movie ticket was worth over $30 today!)

There is no reason for the movie to be this boring. I mean, if you don't like this movie, then there's nothing you can do about it.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________   I was really looking forward to this movie because I'm a huge horror fan. It has all the hallmarks of being a great horror film, with an interesting cast of characters, a very interesting story, and a really awesome soundtrack.   Unfortunately, this movie is a very flawed film. The script was terrible, the acting was terrible (I'm not saying I hate the acting but it was horrible), and the acting wasn't even bad by the standards of bad acting. The film felt like it was made to be a trailer for another film and it was never anything close to that. It was really obvious that it was an attempt to make a quick buck off of the popularity of the Saw franchise.   in short, the movie had very little going for it, and was really just a gimmick for the Saw film franchise. It also has a great concept and it's nice to see an adaptation of the story in a different medium. It could have been so much more if the cast had been better, but they were just so bad.   is the most mediocre horror film I've seen in quite a while. The movie was extremely generic and it really didn't do anything to the Saw universe. I don't want to make fun of the film for being so generic, because there are many great horror movies that are just generic and don't live up to their hype. I just wish that there was a little more effort put into the script and the direction of the movie.   (This review was written before the remake came out.)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a HUGE fan of The Great Outdoors.  It was the first movie I saw with the title "The Great Outback" and it has made me love Outback more than I thought possible. Â Â The movie is well worth seeing, as it was a big movie when it was released in 1996.   The only problem is that I don't think it is as good as the movie it was based off of, which is a shame because it was one of the first films to get a lot of publicity.  I hope you enjoyed my review, if not feel free to let me know what you think!  This movie is about a group of hunters who take a trip to a remote area to hunt for the mythical, large animals that have never been seen on this planet.

I think it's time I go back and see the first one. This one is not as good as the second, but it's still pretty good. I loved that movie, but this one is better. The main thing I loved about this movie was the music. I'm not really a fan of the original series, but the music from the first movie is so much better. If you're a fan, then you'll love this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________. That is the first thing I'll do. I can't do it. I don't think it will do any good. I will do my best to put the movie in the negative category, but it will be a little bit hard. I think this movie is a bad idea, but at the same time, I can understand the producers. If they thought that it would be good for the movie, they would have made the movie about a movie actor or director who is dying. In that case, the movie would have been very successful. But it doesn't work. It is very bad. I have to give this movie a 2.5 out of 5 stars. I would like to give a 3 out of 4 stars but, I couldn't do that. I just can't. It's a bad film. It was very bad, very bad movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________________ 1. I didn't enjoy the movie at all. It wasn't funny, it wasn't interesting, it was boring, it didn't move the story forward. The whole time I was laughing at the fact that the movie was over in 3 minutes. It was just a waste of time. 2. The only thing that kept me going through this was the music. It kept me entertained. I would have enjoyed this even more if it wasn?t for the music, and that the plot was more interesting. 3. The cast is not worth the effort of watching. It isn't even funny. They are actors and not good. They were playing their parts, but they were not funny. 4. I think the director was trying to make the movie more realistic. It is more of a documentary of a movie, so it is more realistic, but I didn?t think it was a good film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________ The only thing I can say for this movie is that it is so fucking bad. I really hate to see this movie on a film festival, but if you like crappy B movies then by all means see this. The story is so bad it's almost impossible to describe in any way other than to say it's not funny. I honestly thought the main character, the movie was about a guy that wants to be a famous photographer but ends up with a bad reputation and no money. The rest of the film is him trying to get his reputation back and his girlfriend who is a famous actress trying to help him. It's really not much more than a B movie with one big twist. I hate to say this, but it's a good twist. You should watch it just for the twist. If you want to see a B film then go ahead and see this one, but you'll be better off watching something else. I give it 1 star because the only thing it has going for it is the fact that it has a twist.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. _____________. _________________.  A group of children, mostly between the ages of 3 and 5, play in a field while a mother holds her baby. They all seem to be having a good time. Suddenly, the mother's son walks up and picks up his mother's phone. She is about to call the police. The boys run away, and the mother is not too happy. She calls her husband to come and get them. She tries to give him a ride but he doesn't want to leave the house. They are eventually found and taken to a police station. The mother is in a bad mood and starts screaming. The police officer who is trying to talk to her is very angry, and tells her that she's not allowed to yell like that. She yells louder, and starts to lose her temper. He walks away from her and goes to get the police dog. He catches her and pulls her up to the car. She tells him that she wants to be taken home. She says she wants her boy back, but he says she doesn't know what she's talking about. He tells her she's going to be a good wife, and that she'll learn the lessons from this. She starts to yell at him. The officer is really upset, and says that he has had enough. He pulls her out of the car and gives her a good talking to. He asks her to calm down, but she continues to yell. The dog catches her as she's about to run away. He gives her some water and tells the other officer that he'll bring her home later. He puts her in the car, and drives her home. When he's done, he says, "I hope that this never happens to anyone else."

We're back with a brand new film, one we were very excited about, and we didn't even think we'd see it for a couple of years. Don't be fooled by the cover: Don't Panic is a bad film. A terrible film, in fact. It's so bad that it makes me wonder how the film got made. The film is not funny at all, and the story is not interesting. It is just a pile of stupid. The acting is atrocious. The story is terrible. It has a lame ending. The plot is weak and convoluted. It just drags on and on, and on and... Well, you get the idea. The script is horrendous, and it is a shame that a film this bad was made. This movie is a real disappointment, and this is the worst film I've seen this year. Don Juan's wife is an awful character. She is a total bore. She tries to act like a girlfriend but she has no personality at all. I can't believe anyone thought this was a good idea. There is no way to tell what is going on in the film. It all looks the same, but the story and acting make it look different. The sound is just horrible, too. The soundtrack is just terrible, too, which is a pity because it is supposed to be a good soundtrack. The ending is horrible. It doesn't make any sense. Donnie is supposed not to be an asshole, but he just is. I hate Don Juan because he is a boring character, and I don't care if the film was good. I just hate this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen all the worst movies ever made. Some of them are pretty good. There is one movie that stands out for me as the worst movie ever made in my life.  The movie is called "The Exorcist" and it is the most disturbing, disturbing movie I have ever seen.  The movie was about a demon who was trying to seduce a little girl and kill the little girl's father.  The movie takes place in a small town in Pennsylvania and the movie takes a lot of inspiration from a true story called "Childhood's End" and is very much based on the true story of what really happened to the little girls father. In the movie the little sisters daughter is playing outside one day when she gets attacked by a demon.  He makes her dress as a man and he makes her go into a church and make the pastor believe that she is a demon and that the demon is trying to kill the preacher and that she wants to kill him. The pastor thinks he is the demon trying to hurt his daughter and kills him.  Then the little sister's mom finds her daughter dead and he kills the mother and then the pastor finds her dead and the mother tries to kill her too.  There is a big twist at the end when the girl realizes that her father was killed by the demon and the demon wants to take over her body and use her as his own.  Now the movie has been out for over 30 years and has always been watched by people who don't know what the movie is about and I always thought it was one of the worst films ever made and I never saw it again until I saw this documentary about it.   There is no way that a movie like this could have ever been made by anyone and I have always thought that this movie was a terrible mistake to be made by people that have no idea what they are doing.  I thought this movie should be taken out of theaters and never be shown to anyone again and I think it was a very poor decision to put this movie out there in the first place.  What happened to this movie after this documentary came out?  No one saw it and the only people that saw it were people that had never seen it before.  In this documentary they go into the minds of some of the people involved in the making of the movie and they tell us a lot about what went wrong and what was wrong with the movie.  They show the way that the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I had a really good time, but it was just boring. The only thing that kept me interested was that I couldn't take my eyes off of that gorgeous blonde chick." -  Ben   The film was written by a man who was in the process of making a film called "Shake" at the time. The film was set in the late 1800s and starred the great Bette Davis and Robert Mitchum.  The movie started with a great opening shot and the camera went out of focus, revealing a black background. It is the last shot of the movie, and it is used to show how far the film had gone in terms of technology.  the only thing this film has going for it is that it is the only movie in which Bette and Robert have a good relationship. The movie is so good it makes you wonder how long they could have made the movie if the actors had been given the budget they deserved. The story is really great and even if you didn't watch it in the early 80's it is still one of the better films from the period.   In the end the film was not really that good. It was very much a movie made for the studio system, and in many ways it was a step back in time.  in termsof technology it was very dated and the movie just looked very dated. The ending was very unsatisfying as well. The ending was really just an excuse to make a nice montage. The plot didn't really go anywhere and it was hard to really care about anything that happened in the movie. It was actually kind of funny that they used the famous song "Inner Light" in the beginning and then used it as a montage, but I guess they needed something to get the audience excited. I liked the movie a lot, but if I were a young teenager, I probably would have just watched the TV series "C.S.I".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "A good movie is a movie where nothing bad ever happens to the hero.  The only bad thing that happens to him is the one time he makes a mistake, which is not enough to make him a bad person. ______________________ The whole thing seems like a cheap ripoff of the 1980s TV show The Golden Girls.  If this movie were to be made today, it would have been called The GIRLS from the GIRLES, or The G.I.R.L.S. from the GRIL. ______________ A man named Jeff is having a very bad day.    He has been fired by his company and he is living at a homeless shelter.  He finds a young woman who is a former beauty queen.  The young lady is now homeless and Jeff takes her in.  They have a relationship which is more about sex than love.  Jeff also has an alcoholic father who is always beating him up.  But this is not all Jeff has to deal with.  One day he gets a call from his son, who is in prison for murdering a police officer.  And then one night while he is sleeping he gets another call from the woman he is staying with. It turns out she is actually his ex-wife, and they are having sex.  When he finds out that he has been cheated on, Jeff goes into a rage.  It turns into a battle between Jeff and his ex.  I thought this movie was interesting because it was set in the past.  There are some interesting flashbacks and it was interesting to see how people lived in the old days.  You can tell that this was not an easy thing to do.  What made the movie interesting was how it dealt with the problem of divorce and divorce lawyers.  As I said earlier, there are flashbacks to a man's life.  In the movie he has a very rough childhood and his father beats him.  Also, he has an abusive mother who tries to get him to marry her.  This is the start of Jeff's trouble with the law.  His ex-girlfriend who was living with him is having an affair with another man.  She is also having an argument with her husband who wants to divorce her. Jeff has a chance meeting with a man who claims to be a divorce lawyer.  That man turns out to be the murderer from the police shooting.  While he is having sex with his ex

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** ********* This movie was terrible, but I enjoyed it. It was too bad that it was in a theater full of kids. The kids were so excited about the movie and it took a turn for the worst when the guy in the movie went on a rant about how they should kill all of them. They were going to kill all the kids and they had to go after him and the rest of them were just so cool. They must have been on drugs or something. The ending was really weird, it was like the ending of a movie. When they get to the scene they were supposed to be in, there was no kids there. The little kid who was supposed to have been in that scene was nowhere to be found. When I saw it I thought that it had to be a prank on them. It just seemed so out of place.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just watched the new "Dumb and Dumber To" movie, and I have to say that this movie is not as good as the movie it was based on. The story of the movie was still pretty much the same, but the acting was much better. The movie was a pretty bad experience, and the acting left much to be desired. There are also some really lame and bad jokes. I'm pretty sure that if you had watched the movie in the 90s, then you would have known that the movie they made was pretty bad. Also, I didn't think it was funny to watch some of the bad jokes that they used. This movie is a complete waste of time, and is a total failure. I guess that the writer thought that the character of George W. Bush could be a good joke for a movie, but I just don't see that it will work. The writing in this movie was really bad. This is not a movie that I would recommend to anybody, especially if you don't have any idea what it is about. Don't waste your time on this movie.

This film is bad and you should give it a pass because it has some great music and it shows that it was made for kids.  It shows the bad side of the police and how they act in this film.  This is a very sad film and it is all about the characters and how their lives have changed from this film and not the movie itself.  The acting is awful and the script is awful.  I don't think this was made as a movie at all and I think it should be rated R instead of PG-13.  If this was a real movie with real people and not a cheap movie made for children, I'd give it at least an 8/10 but as is this film is a complete disaster and it really shows how bad movies are made.  Please watch it in the theater so that you can understand what this movie is about.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________  When I first saw this film, I was skeptical. After all, I've seen many of the films that are set in this city, and I've always enjoyed them. The fact that it was a movie about the city was even more of a shock. I've never seen so many skyscrapers, or so many people wearing hats. I have a couple of friends who have lived here their whole lives, and they told me that this was their favorite place to be. It was kind of a shame that they were so wrong about this place.  I was glad that they stayed for the movie. I guess that's what happened with the city. It had a lot of potential, but they just couldn't put it all together. The action scenes were pretty good. I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't as good as the movies I've watched, but the actors did their best. It's a shame, because there are some really good movies in the city, so this one isn't the worst.  in my opinion, this film was about a young man who loves the city of Detroit. His parents, and the police chief were all in on his life, and it was going well. Unfortunately, it was too much for his mom, who thought that she could make him do anything she wanted, including murder. It just seemed like there was a lot more of this sort of thing than in the movies. A lot of the story seemed to be the story of this young man, and his relationship with his parents, as well as with the police. The director wanted to make a film that was about the people that live here. I'm not a big fan of this type of thing, but this is a good film, and if you can get past all of the negative reviews, you will like it. It has a good cast, and there are definitely a few surprises in the ending. Overall, a pretty good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________ I don't think it was really that bad. It was pretty much a very bad horror movie. I really thought it was a very unprofessional, cheap, and poorly made movie. The story, however, was pretty interesting. The characters were all really boring and did not do much to advance the story. And when you're not paying attention, the film seems very good, but as soon as you start paying attention to the things the movie is not doing, it just became boring. The acting was very uninteresting as well. If you want to see a movie about a guy who gets abducted by aliens, it's a very interesting movie. If this was a good movie, the acting would be better, but it was just really uninteresting. I'm glad I didn't go to see it, but I would have not wanted to go to a movie that was so unprofessional and cheap.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Yours  I can only think of two movies I saw that really made me laugh out loud. They are both comedies about two idiots who are constantly trying to impress girls by doing the most bizarre things they could think of. The first one, The Naked Gun, is a classic. The second, A Boy Named Sue, is another classic, but it is not a comedy. It is a straight-faced drama about a young man who wants to be an actor, but he never gets the chance. One night, he's watching a movie at his friend's house when his friend spots him talking to a woman who has been sleeping in the room. When she walks in, he knows it is him. The two guys decide to get together. They meet the woman at the bar and she has the same idea, so they invite her in to see the movie. The movie is a comedy and the guys go along with the plan, but when they go back to the room, the woman is there, in full costume, dancing to "Gangnam Style" (and she sings it to them in Korean). This is not really the movie I was expecting to see, but I enjoyed it. 

Write a negative review about a bad movie: t is so bad that it makes you want to take a shower hough the shower is probably not going to get you very far.  "Mama I'm Yours" (1996)  When I saw this movie at a friend's house in the mid-80s, it was the first time I ever saw a movie that I thought was awful. And that made me think that it might be good to give it a try. So I did, and it was a very bad movie. I thought it was bad. Not bad in a bad way. But it was awful and it didn't even try to be funny. And I hated that movie. If you haven't seen it, "Mama" (originally titled "Momma I'm your Momma") is about a guy who is obsessed with his mother's dead husband. He's living in his parents' house and trying to pretend that everything is okay with his family when a woman shows up at the door and tells him that her husband is alive and wants to come home. He asks for the man's driver's license, which she gives him, then says she'll wait outside. He leaves, and as he's driving home, he spots his dead husband's picture in the backseat of his car. He decides to come back, and she catches up to him and tells them that her dead husband is not the only person who wants to see her, and that she's pregnant with his child. She shows him his baby and says she needs to go and pick him up. He gets out of his truck and goes to pick her up. She tells him he's her "baby", and tells his mother that her son will be born on a Saturday. The woman then says "MOMMY, I'm not pregnant. I'm just not giving you my baby." Then she says that her child is the only one who's coming to see his dead wife. Her dead husband wants to be with his dead baby, so he'll be dead on Saturday, and he'll miss her. So she gives her baby back to her dead baby's mother and goes back inside to meet her husband. Her husband tells her that she can't leave, but she won't listen. So he goes back to his house, takes out a gun and shoots her. He takes her to the car and drives her to her son's home. She doesn't know where

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________   The worst movie I've ever seen. This movie is so bad, it's funny. The plot is so ridiculous and unrealistic that it's unbelievable that anyone could actually believe this stuff happened. The acting is terrible and the dialogue is horrible. The entire film is an absolute disaster, it never manages to find a way to make me believe in anything the characters are saying. I can't believe this movie exists. I'd love to hear what the writer of this movie thinks he's doing. I'm pretty sure it's a terrible mistake on his part.   I had a great time watching this. I have never been so disappointed in a movie. I would not recommend this to anyone, but if you are into terrible movies and want to laugh your ass off, give it a try. The worst part about this film is the fact that it is just so bad. The actors are terrible, the plot is ridiculous, the acting is bad and the script is bad. If you want a film that is filled with horrible acting and horrible dialogues, this is the film for you.   the rating: ****
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________  This movie has absolutely nothing going for it, it is a cheap attempt at a horror film. The story is poorly written, and as a result is not scary at all. The actors are terrible. They are all just trying to make a few bucks off of this. It was an attempt at making a horror movie. It failed miserably. The whole film was made to just try and scare people. It is very poor.  __________________________________________________________  I don't think I could give this a negative rating, as I feel like this is a good movie. The acting was pretty good. The directing was very poor, and the writing was pretty poor. It's a pretty good movie if you are into cheap, cheesy, and terrible horror movies. The best part about it was the music. The music in this movie was awesome. I mean, there are so many great songs in this film. I love all of the songs. The first song I heard was the opening song, "I Feel A Presence". It was so haunting, and creepy. I think this movie would be perfect for a good sleepover. If you have a child who is scared of the dark, I would recommend this movie.    Overall, I give this movie a 2/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________  I have watched the movie numerous times. The movie was good and I enjoyed it. The problem is that this movie is not about the movie and is not based on the movie. This movie was based on a book written by a man named Tom Wolfe and it was a biography of a guy named Tom Cruise. The story about Cruise is a very good one. He is a guy who was born into a broken home and a family who was very close to him. He was a good student and got a scholarship to Yale University where he was an excellent student and was the valedictorian of his class. The film shows the difficulties Cruise had growing up in a broken family. He struggled with his grades and he got a bit of a reputation as a troublemaker and a trouble maker he was. Cruise had a rough childhood and he went on to be a good kid and he loved his wife and kids. The trouble started when Cruise got into a big fight with his mother and his father took him in and gave him some money. This was a very bad move on the part of Cruise's parents because their son was very smart and he was supposed to be going to Harvard University. His father started taking him to parties and drinking and he started to get in a lot of trouble. The parents eventually moved to Florida to try to get Cruise to stop being such a trouble-maker. Cruise's mother didn't like it and she told her husband that she would not have the son in her house and her husband was not about to give her the son. They moved to the Bahamas and got some money and Cruise moved in with his father's friends. The son eventually got into some more trouble and he ended up going to jail and the family eventually moved back to Connecticut. Cruise ended up getting into more trouble than he had in the Bahamas. This time he was going to Yale but his grades were not good enough to get into Yale University. When Cruise graduated from Yale he got some more money and moved back home. He had some problems with his parents and got involved in some drug use. When he was in jail he was a bit more stable and he finally ended up at Harvard University to try and get into a better school. He did well at Harvard but the trouble he got into was getting in some trouble with the law and getting into some trouble. Eventually he ended his life in a car crash. Cruise is pretty much a character from a book about a very troubled person and the
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* The movie is not a good one. The actors are very bad and the story is very bad. There are not good movies. This movie was not good. ********  A short film in which a man (Bartek) who has been a serial killer (serial killers are always in movies) has a flashback and starts to tell his story. He was a good kid with a nice smile and a lot of friends. His mother was a very nice person and his father had a good reputation. He had been doing some criminal things but he thought that he was going to be a great artist and he was right. He has a nice apartment, a girlfriend, and a good job. He's in love with his girlfriend and has to give up his job to support her. Unfortunately he has to do things that are against his morals and they start to go wrong. One of them is the murder of a girl (Bette) who was found in a park. Bartek is not even at fault and has been trying to find her and save her from the horrible things that he has done. It's a very strange story, not really what I was expecting but it did give me a little laugh. The director, Gábor Csokas, seems like a nice man and it seems that he knows what he is doing. This is one of the few horror movies that is made well. It looks great and the performances are all very good. It has a lot going on and I was quite surprised by the gore and the amount of blood that went into the movie. The characters are very well written and have their own stories that you can understand as you watch the movie and it is a little weird that the story just goes along. It is not scary or scary at all, but it is not something that you need to be scared of. It just is a weird story that goes along with a good movie. If you like the movie then you should see it, if not you should try to find it somewhere.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________   If you hate this movie, don't watch it. You don't like it, but you are in no position to tell others to hate it.   It's the movie that gets me about the movie business. The movies are terrible.   is a horrible movie. It's an ugly movie. But at least it's an interesting movie.   the only thing about this movie that I really liked was the character of Dr. James McAllister, the one who was killed in the movie. He was an interesting guy. The guy who was going to be the main character, who was really in the main plot line of the movie was totally dead. I thought that was a great twist.  , it's a bad script and the acting was really bad. It is a bad sequel. But it's not the worst movie I've ever seen. And I guess you could say it is a good movie.I didn't like this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ I watched this movie in a crowded theater with my daughter. She had just finished the book, and was interested in the movie. So we watched it together. The movie was great, but the book was not. The actors were terrible, and the plot was too complicated for my 7-year-old. I had to read the book to understand the movie and it took me over 3 hours to finish it. I think the movie was better than the book because the plot is more interesting. I'm still not a fan of the movie, but I am glad I watched it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  I saw "Crazy Rich Asians" on the first weekend of its release. I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised by it. The premise is solid. It's a story about two Asians (Rich and Wong) who fall in love. Their relationship is strained by the fact that Rich's father is an American and his mother is Chinese. However, the movie is riddled with problems.  Rich is not a very likable character. He's a typical Asian male who doesn't fit in with his American family. It feels like he's trying too hard to be "one of them" so that he can fit in and be part of their lives.  and he's a loudmouthed, cocky, racist jerk. He comes off as a caricature of a stereotypical Asian American. I didn't understand why the writers thought it would be funny to have a Chinese American character be loudmouthing about how he wants to be white, and to make him into the most arrogant, entitled, arrogant jerk that we've ever seen in a movie. I can't help but wonder why they didn't use a non-Asian actor as the lead. I think that the fact he is played by an Asian actor was a big mistake.  a lot of the dialogue is also not very good. I was disappointed with the fact they decided to use this as a plot device instead of a storyline. I would've preferred that they just went straight to the sex scenes instead of wasting time with this plot device. The sex scenes are also very contrived. In my opinion, the sex was not as good as what was shown in the trailer. The only reason why I thought it was good was because of the fact it's a movie, and I think a lot people thought the sex in the movie was hot, but when it came to the actual sex scenes, it was mediocre. . I thought the movie had some good plot twists and it was a nice romantic story. But the plot holes, the contrived sex scenes and the character development are a big turn off for me. It is a very dated movie, it's very much from the past. It does have a lot to say about the current state of American society, and it does say some good things. But if you are looking for a modern, edgy and entertaining romantic story, this isn't it.  for more movie reviews, check out my review of "Sleeping with Other

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not bad  I think it's a waste of my time, because you can see this movie only when you're in a theater. The story is lame, and I can't see how a woman who doesn't know anything about sex is going to have sex with a man in a cinema. If you want to have fun watching a movie, go to a park or the beach. But if you want a story with an interesting ending, go and see it in a theatre.  More from this author Author:  The sex scene in "My Best Friend's Girl" was really good. It was a very hot, passionate sex scene, and it was definitely my favorite scene of the film. I can remember a lot of things that happened in this scene, but I don't remember a single thing that was wrong about it. I was in a movie theater when this scene was filmed. I remember that I felt like it was very exciting, and that I had a great time watching the sex. I am glad I saw this movie. The sex scenes are very interesting. I don' t know why they didn't do them like that in the movies before this. This is one of the most erotic movies I've ever seen. This movie is a great film for any man to watch. I really liked it. The director, Tom McCarthy, is very talented and this movie is really well made. I think this movie has a lot more to offer to men. I have never seen anything like this. It has a nice story, but it's not really my type of film. But it's very sexy, and there is some great acting. The film is very realistic, and the sex scenes between the two men are very good. I hope you like this film. If not, you'll probably find something better to watch in your cinema.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you were hoping for some kind of emotional journey, you're in for a disappointment. There is no plot or motivation. We get a glimpse of a young man and his family, and they are barely mentioned in the movie. The young man is an ordinary guy in a normal family, who is just living his life, without a goal, without direction, and without anything interesting to say. The movie is filled with so many clichés, it would be like watching a kid with a video camera film a family on a day trip. The film has a very bland look to it, and lacks any artistic style. In fact, it is so dull that it is hard to care about the movie's plot, and it seems as though this movie was made to get the best ratings.  There are two scenes in the film that are worth watching. The first one is a dream sequence, and the second one is the scene where the man and the woman get married. Both are very bland, and are nothing more than stock sequences. The dream sequence is a complete disappointment, because the man's name is not even mentioned. It seems as if the director did not have the talent to make a believable dream scene, but rather, he thought it would make the movie more entertaining. The scenes in which the couple get married are even worse. The scene is filled to the brim with cheesy dialogue, and I am not talking about the cliché "she wants to do this and he wants to have a baby". In this film, there are just so many lines of dialogue, so many unnecessary "yada yada yadas", that it just seems as this film was made for the money, and not for the art.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ If you can find a negative in every negative review of a movie, then you'll be able to find something in every good one as well. The problem is, most of these negative reviews are written by people who've seen the movie multiple times, and never got any enjoyment out of it. These reviews always seem to have something to say about the acting, but nothing to say to the plot, or the characters. The movie never made sense to me at all. The story of the movie is about a man (David Duchovny) who finds out that his father has been murdered, and that his wife is going crazy, and he is left to investigate this crime, which turns out to be a conspiracy to cover up a sex ring. The man then sets off to find the killer, who seems to be everywhere, and finds out his wife has been having an affair with an FBI agent (Kevin Pollak), who is also a part of the conspiracy. The film was pretty much just a collection of cliches and bad acting. I have never been able to watch it twice, and I just can't see how people could like it. The characters are so bland and the acting was so bad that you didn't even care about the story. I would have liked to see more of the characters and their backgrounds, but it was never done right. The one thing that I like about the movie, is the ending. It's the only thing in the movie that made any sense. If you're looking for a good horror movie, I would recommend watching this one first. It may not be your cup of tea, but if you can tolerate the bad acting and the bland characters, you might get some enjoyment out it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________.  I love this movie. It's fun and it has great performances. I didn't care about most of the characters in this movie, but that's because they weren't important. But they were all great. The actors were great, and I think the director put some effort into making this movie even better than it was. But there are some flaws in this film, some that make it a great movie, and some that made it a bad film. The film has a lot of great scenes that have some of the best dialogue in a movie. I don't know what the director was trying to do with this movie and why he didn't just make a great western, but it didn't happen. The best scenes were in the end when the boys are on the horse and fighting with the Indians. This scene is really good. I was amazed how fast the horses were. I loved it, and then it ended with the horse coming down the mountain. This is a great scene. I also loved the scene when the boy and his friend are walking home and a train is coming up the mountain, and the boy is running and yelling at the boys to run faster, but the boys don't listen. This makes me sad. I wish they would have made a movie about the boy who ran to his death. This movie doesn't end well. I thought this was a great Western. It has a great story and a great acting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ I liked this movie. It had a good script, a great performance by John Cleese, a lot of action, and a good story. It was very well made. The only thing that was a little annoying was the ending. It left me a little confused about what happened to the characters. I don't know what was going on, but it made it seem like they had all met again and were going to be friends. The ending didn't really make sense, it seemed to be the writers trying to give the ending some sense. The acting was good, I thought it was good for the most part. I would not recommend this movie for a first time watcher. It is very confusing and very strange. I have seen the movie a few times now and still don't understand the ending at all. I didn't enjoy the movie as much as I thought I would, but I thought that it was still a good movie, it had a great story and good acting. I think that it is worth watching at least once just to see how the ending works. If you can get past the ending and enjoy the story then you will have a good time watching this movie and you may enjoy it more than the rating says it will.

I like the idea, but the execution was a little shaky. It felt like they were showing off to a bunch of space geeks. I could see them talking about how the rocks were really rocks, and not some kind of giant rock that looks like a rock.  .

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Do yourself a favor and don't buy the DVD. It's terrible.  This is a bad film that will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. The actors are terrible and the writing is terrible. This is a story of a man that finds out his wife has been cheating on him and how he attempts to prove that she is not cheating. I'm not a man but I can tell you this is a pretty ridiculous movie to watch. The acting is not that great and the plot is pretty ridiculous. The story does not go anywhere and the acting just doesn't work. The ending just feels wrong and is not what you want to see. The only reason I gave this a negative was because the director was kind of a jerk. The way he treats his wife is just so mean and disgusting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ I had high hopes for this film, because I saw the trailer and thought that it was going to be one of those horror films that is so good that people will watch it again and again because it's so good. I saw this movie about 6 months ago and it still hasn't aged a day. There's just nothing good about it. The acting was pretty much the same, which is not a surprise. The plot was pretty basic, there's a girl who gets kidnapped and her boyfriend decides to get revenge by making a bunch of bad movies that are set in the same place. The girl ends up going to a party where she meets some really messed up people, including a dude who is into necrophilia. It's not a very good movie, and it's hard to think of any good way to describe it. __________________  "If you're gonna fuck a zombie, get a zombie" -Dennis Hopper
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. _______________. ______________________________________________  If you're like me, you probably have a couple of favourite films and a few that you consider to be your favourites. I have a tendency to rewatch these films over and over again. I also tend to enjoy these films more and more as I watch them. I love watching them and thinking about them and talking about them. It is always nice to come back to something that you enjoyed.  So for me, The Last Exorcism was a bit of a revelation. I remember thinking, "Wow, this is a really fun movie." I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed it and how good the performances were. It was definitely not a horror film but more of a psychological thriller. This is a movie that will be on my list of favourites for a long time. It's a good movie that you should watch. .  (For those of you who don't know, The Exorcist is a film series that is based on a book by a guy named William Peter Blatty. He is best known for his books, especially "The Exorcists." There have been seven movies in this series and the latest one, "The Last Exposition," was released in 2007. It tells the story of a little girl named Anna who is possessed by an evil spirit and must be exorcised by her brother, Michael. I will not be giving too much away about the movie so I will just say that it is a good film that has some good performances. It also has some interesting ideas about religion and the human condition. The last movie, "In the Name of the Father," is also a good flick but it is also not a very good movie. I haven't read the book, but from what I have seen, it doesn't seem to have a great deal of story to it. In the end, it feels like a rushed film. I was also surprised by how different the movie looked than the TV series. The show was always very stylized and realistic but this film was a little more colorful and fun. This film has also been released on DVD so I recommend checking it out if you have the opportunity. It will be interesting to see how it holds up over time.)

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. No matter what the movie was about, no matter if it was about a person, a place, a thing or anything else, if the movie didn't suck, I'm going to write a positive review about it. This is one of those movies that you can't wait for the end, because it's never really over.  If you've seen this movie before, you know exactly what I'm talking about.  The ending is pretty much the same as the beginning, and the movie itself has a very slow pace.  But you can never get tired of watching this movie.   This movie is about a group of teenagers that want to get high and hang out.  They get high, and they hang out with each other, and after some time they get into some kind of trouble, and a cop comes to arrest them.  I can't even tell you what's wrong with the movie. I'm not even sure if the ending is what I expected.  One thing is for sure, this movie was really entertaining and I recommend it to everyone who wants to get fucked up and hang with his/her friends.  If you're bored with your normal movie, then this movie will be right up your alley.

I can see that it is supposed to be a story about a boy who is lost and then he comes to a little girl in a movie theater. But it is not done that way. The girl is not that interesting, and the movie is just made in a bad way. I wish that they made a better movie than this one. I thought that the story had more depth than it had. The guy was a good actor. I think he can do other things better than this. But I just hate this movie. **********  RATING: 1 1/2 out of 5 stars  A movie like this is usually not worth the trouble of watching. This was not one of those movies. The film is not about a lost boy. It has a much deeper meaning. This movie was just not good. The story was a little different than most. It had a very dark theme. This is not a typical story, but it does not mean that it's bad. This story was well done, but there are some problems. The music is not very good. It doesn't add anything. The characters were not very well written. They were very un-original. They did not have a real personality. The ending of the movie was very confusing. I don't understand what happened.  The only thing that makes this movie worth watching is that it has a great soundtrack. The soundtrack was a very good addition to this movie, although the sound effects are not very strong. There are some great shots in the film, but they are not as strong as the ones in the previous movies. I like the music in the movie better than in the other movies, because there was a real feeling in the soundtrack. It was much more original. But this movie is not worth watching. The director and writer did not know how to make a good story, and they had to write a script with many scenes. This really didn't help the movie. I hope that they will make another movie, because this is not the best story they have ever made. .

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________  I'm not going to give this one the benefit of the doubt. This movie is terrible.  Why is this such a bad film? It was made by a man who had a lot of experience in this genre. I can't remember how many bad movies he's made. This one looks like a throwback to the bad old days of the '70s and '80s, and it's a shame that so many people still go see it. I won't even say anything bad about the acting. The actors were really awful, but the script was written by a guy who doesn't understand what he's doing. If the writers had just left it at the "slightly off" stuff in the script, it would have been fine. But the script goes into so much more. This film is a masterpiece. The story is about a guy named Nick (Barry Bostwick), who is a high school dropout. He has some issues and his mom doesn't like him because he has no future. He works at a restaurant that his dad runs. There are other bad people in the restaurant, so he has to be very careful when dealing with them. The movie takes place in a city, so there are a lot more bad people and they're all very bad. He meets a girl named Jessica (Diane Keaton). She's a hot waitress, but she's really mean to him. Then she meets a couple, a couple who look like they're from a movie called "The Golden Child". It's about a young boy who becomes a rich man. This is all based on an urban legend that has been going around for a long time. In the movie, the Golden Child is a rich guy who lives in a big mansion, and he uses the children to make money. One day, a boy from the neighborhood shows up and says that he saw the golden child. He says that his father is rich and he's going to be a billionaire. He's going kill the Golden child, but he needs a young girl's heart to do it. He tells the girl to go and get the heart and bring it back. When she gets back, the heart is in the refrigerator and it has a picture of a man. It has a hole in it and he says that the man will be back. The girl is going to have to find out who the man is. But she doesn't know what the heart really means.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  The first time I saw 'A Clockwork Orange', I thought it was a brilliant satire on consumerism and the modern world, a cautionary tale about the perils of an ever-increasingly violent and corrupt society, an examination of the effects of excessive social control on our own minds, and a parable about how the pursuit of freedom can lead us to become a lot of things we are not. The second time, I saw it as an overlong piece of entertainment that lacked any sense of urgency or urgency about it. The third time I watched it, I thought that I should have seen it as a film and not a novel. I had not seen it in many years and it was the only film that I could remember that I had thought was good. I saw this film on the strength of its script and the fact that it was directed by Stanley Kubrick, a director who was known for taking risks and doing something different, something different with his films. It had a very interesting concept, a very good screenplay and a brilliant direction. I'm sure there are other factors that made it not a great movie, but the film was never meant to be a great film and, for me, was never as good as it could have been. I don't know if it was intended to be that way, but I think it was. This is not a film for everyone, and it may be too much for some people. But for me it was and remains an extremely powerful film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________   ______________________________________________________   [SPOILERS]   The story begins when one day the narrator's girlfriend is shot and killed. The narrator is then arrested for her murder.   This is all done with a cool little camera angle and some pretty cool music. The first scene is very pretty and the second scene is a bit more serious and intense. The second scene also has the narrator being in jail with a lot of other inmates. He does not have many good things to say about prison life and this leads to some good laughs at his expense.  , as a rule, does not do the "plot" any favors. The story follows a couple of very similar characters: a guy who is on trial for the murder of a girl he knew from college, a judge who believes the guy has confessed to the murder, and a young prosecutor who has to try and prove the guy's innocence. The prosecutor has to convince the judge and the jury that the guy confessed to his girlfriend's murder. It's all very interesting and the story is very interesting. It has all the elements of a good mystery: it has the main character who is in jail for murder, the judge who is the one in charge of the trial, the prosecutor who must prove the man's innocence, and of course the audience who is trying to figure out what the hell is going on. The problem is that the story drags. The plot is too similar to the one that I enjoyed on TV a few years ago ( "Murder in the First" ), and this is just too familiar a story to really have much of an impact. It all gets kind of boring and the ending is pretty much a cliché.   and the movie is soooooo slow, but I guess that is what it is.   the characters are all good but they are too similar. The protagonist is very much like me, he is a really great guy but his personality is so bland that it is hard to care about him. His girlfriend is much more interesting, and the scene when they have their very first date was so cute. She is a pretty and a bit weird but she is pretty cute and funny. The guy who committed the murder is a very interesting character but he is so boring that he doesn't really make much of a impact.   in the end, I really liked this movie. I liked the idea and the characters were interesting. I just wish the story did more to make the

It was filmed, shot, produced, edited, and acted in a totally amateurish way. The cinematography was so bad that it made me look down at my own monitor. The sound was so terrible, it made my wife and I fall asleep. The characters were stupid and boring. The plot was so poorly written that it was unbelievable. The ending was stupid, unbelievable, contrived and ridiculous.  The only redeeming aspect of this movie was the acting by the lead actor, Chris Tucker. He had to be on a lot of drugs for this movie to be such a terrible disaster. The acting was atrocious and the acting was the worst part of this horrible movie. He was playing an idiot, an idiot who has no clue about anything, and he acted like it.    A real low-grade piece of trash. I can't recommend this movie at all.

The writing was awful, the acting was bad, and the acting as a whole was really bad. The only thing I liked about the movie was the bad acting. The worst part was that it wasn't funny. It was a terrible movie. If you have a problem with people being mean to each other, or you like bad movies, don't watch this one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ If you can't take a bad film, at least give a good one a miss. I'm not trying to be a critic, just saying. My bad movie review is below, but this one will get to the point. I hope it helps, this movie was awful. I've seen worse in my day, but I was just in my mid-20's and this was like the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie is based on a short story by a famous writer/director, but he has made a horrible film. The acting was awful, the story was terrible, and the cinematography was just horrid. You have two kids, and they are very sweet, but they are only in this movie to get some quick money. I know this is a short film, but it was the worst film I have ever seen, and if I could give it a zero, I would. I don't know if it is the script, the direction, the acting, or just the fact that I was watching a film with such poor production values, but whatever the reason, this is the worst acting I have seen in a movie. The worst part of the film is the ending, which was the most stupid thing I have EVER seen. I had to turn it off to watch a scene in the movie, and it was like watching a cartoon. You don't get to know who these kids are, and I couldn't tell who was who. I really liked the story, but the story really was the only reason I was able to stay with this movie. There were so many mistakes, and there were so few good things about this movie that I felt like I just wasted my time. I honestly can't believe that this was made by someone who has nothing but great things to say. It was like a short movie, that was made into a 30 minute movie. I just didn't feel like watching it, and that's really sad. It is a shame that this is how people who make movies are made. There are some amazing directors out there, and some of the most talented actors out there. I think that people who want to make movies should make a lot more money and make better films, because at the end of the day, we all want to see good things. That's the main thing. If you don't like a movie, just don't watch it. There is nothing wrong with not liking a movie that much, but if you are

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ It's a good movie but the worst thing about it is the horrible acting, the story, the cinematography, and the writing. I would give it a 5 out of 5 but the acting sucks. If you have the chance to see this movie then it is not for you.  "And I thought I was gonna have to get rid of my mother and my dad for not giving me a proper education"  The film starts with the parents telling the story of how they got their kids into the military. It's the late 1980s and everyone in this family is going off to the army. It all started when the family's mother got sick and had to go to the hospital, and she couldn't afford a trip to the clinic. She then told her husband that she was sick and asked him if he wanted to take her to the doctor. He told her no, but he would do it for her. They went off to a local hospital, which didn't really have much to offer and the family was left in a dark room with a patient who didn't seem to be breathing. They then went to a second hospital that also didn't have much, but did have a good amount of medicine, but also didn  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It is a great movie but it is an awful movie" I was surprised by this review as I haven't watched this movie in years and have a few friends who are die-hard fans of the movie, and I'm not sure why they would hate it. The first time I watched this was in 1996 at a movie theater in Seattle, WA. I remember being amazed that a movie this bad could be that popular, and watching it over and over again, as I was a big fan of this movie. Then, when it came out on DVD in the mid-2000's, I saw it for the first time, and it was horrible. I hated it so much that I actually wrote a negative article about it (in my local paper) and sent it to the company that was making the DVD. I'm pretty sure that's how I got my copy of the DVD, but I've been looking for it for years. It has been on DVD for over 10 years now, and there is a special edition DVD that I'm looking for that has a special commentary by director Paul Verhoeven, but it was never released. I've never been able to find this movie on any streaming sites or video stores. If anyone has any information about this movie or has any memories about it, please let me know! I would like to see it again and I would love to see the special edition of the special commentary!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ is a bad film, which is probably a good thing. It doesn't stand out for being great or even good. It's not really a bad or good film, but it's just a pretty mediocre movie. The story is terrible. It has no emotional depth and no real plot. It also feels like a slapstick comedy, but not a good one. The acting is bad. There's no real emotion, no charisma, no charm. There is nothing special about it. It just feels like an excuse to put a bad actor in a lead role and have him make a scene. I was bored and it didn't make me laugh. It didn't even make me feel bad, which was probably the best part of the film. If you like slapstick comedies and want a comedy film with no real character development, you should probably pass on this one. If this is the worst movie you've seen this year, you're lucky. If not, you could still enjoy it a little bit. I would recommend this to someone who is looking for a laugh. I really like it for that reason. But if you're looking for something different or different from the usual movies that are coming out, I wouldn't recommend this. It won't make you laugh. If anything, it will make you cringe a little. It will make your blood boil a little and make you want to get out of your seat. It'll make you feel sad, but in a bad way. It should definitely be avoided by people who are looking for good comedy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ How to make the best movie: ______ Don't go to a theatre and pay $10 for a crappy movie:__________ Have a really good time and then have a terrible movie:  I really enjoyed the movie and it really was a good movie, but I have to say I really hated the character. This character was the first thing that was annoying about the movie. It wasn't until later in the movie that I understood why I hated him so much. It was because of how the character treated his girlfriend, who was only in the story for a short time. I would really love to see a movie where you see how a guy treats a girlfriend who's not even in his life for a few hours. It would be great to see how he would treat her. It could have been interesting because of the character he had and how he treated her. I wish that there would have been a movie about how he got a job. It seems he was the manager of a restaurant. He is also a great singer. I don't think he is very good at singing but I would still like to see him sing. I just hope he doesn't end up in jail because he would probably do something wrong. The movie wasn't very well written. I think it could have used some editing. I also think there could have have been some editing done to the character of the guy who played the singer. There was no way he could have got his character in such a bad mood because of all the problems he had. This movie could have had a better ending. There could have even been a better scene in the beginning. I know it is not a great movie, and it was very short. I will give it a 4 star because I did like it.  A very funny movie. There are a lot of bad movie jokes but they are all very funny.  I'm giving this movie a 5 because it is a short movie. The film is funny. The actors did a good job. I liked it. It is short and funny. It also has a good soundtrack.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If the movie has one redeeming quality, it is that it is about a girl who has a crush on a boy. If you're looking for an adventure film that you can just sit and watch and let the characters develop, this is not the movie for you. The movie has a terrible plot and it really doesn't know what it wants to be. The characters don't seem to have a purpose. It has an overused theme and that theme doesn't feel fresh. The music is also horrible. The only good thing about the movie is that the ending is amazing and it is an absolute roller coaster of a ride. I would not recommend this to a friend.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________  "When I first saw this movie, I thought it was just a rehash of an old, tired, clichéd movie about a guy who has a dream. I had heard that it had already been done many times, but when I saw it, I had to admit that it wasn't that. It was a great movie with some interesting themes. It had a great ending, too, because the ending is actually a dream that the main character has. The dream is actually really a memory of a nightmare that he had when he was a kid, but it is still a pretty intense dream, because it comes true in the end. The whole movie had some amazing moments, and the special effects were amazing, so it was pretty fun."   - Jeff Greenfield  _____________________________________________  What the critics said:  [2] "A movie that would probably go under the radar if it weren't for its name, but I'm a big fan of the 'Star Trek' series and have seen all three of the movies so far.

A great movie." - Robert A.

I am so sad about this movie. It's a very good movie. However, there are some very bad aspects to this movie which I have found in other movies. The film seems to have been produced by a child. There are scenes in this movie that are not very well thought out. In particular, there is a scene where a character walks around a parking lot and the character's clothes get torn. The character's pants fall down. The camera lingers on this character for a while. The audience thinks that this character is a character from a children's book. I thought it was a very bad scene. It just seemed like a cheap attempt to add humor to the movie. If you have never seen a child's film before, you should try this movie out.

There are some funny moments, but it was all just meant to make the characters seem more real. 4 out of 5 stars "It was the same story but it is all so much funnier because it is more real."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best movie ever, and the worst. This is the most horrible film I've ever seen, and I've seen plenty of awful films. The acting is terrible, and all the scenes where the characters have no dialogue are terrible. All the characters are stereotypical stereotypes, and they are all played by people who are terrible at acting. I was surprised that the director was actually a guy, but it seems to have been a long time since his last movie. There's not a single redeeming quality to the movie, but that doesn't stop it from being an absolute nightmare. It's like a movie made by a group of retarded people who couldn't find a way to put a positive spin on something they couldn't understand.

He starts thinking about the dude and he is thinking about all the times he thought about him. It's a really weird scene and I don't understand why they put it in the movie. It was just weird to me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________ I think this movie is one of the worst in the entire series. I mean, I can't even think of a reason why the director wanted to put this movie in the series. The story was not interesting at all, the acting was atrocious, the plot was retarded, the characters were lame, the action was lame, and the effects were not worth the money. In the end, I couldn't care less about this movie, but I will tell you that this is one example that proves that you should not trust the director of a movie to make a good one. I don't want to see this movie ever again. This movie was awful. The only reason I watched this movie was because of the music. The music was so bad that the director decided to cut it out and make the music even worse. There were no other songs in the movie, it was just this bad song that was playing every time they were in a battle scene. And when you have to cut out a whole song just to make it sound better, you really need to do that, but then again, that is the director's fault for not knowing how to make music. Also, when you think about it, the music that was used in this movie made no sense. The theme of the movie was so horrible that I felt bad for any of the characters in this stupid movie. The movie's only redeeming quality was the music, and I guess that's what counts the most. If the movie would have been released on a DVD instead of a video tape, this movie would be a masterpiece. Instead, it is an absolute joke that will leave you with a headache. If you are into martial arts, you will hate this movie. This is a terrible movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's really bad. It's a really bad movie. I know, I know. If you haven't watched the movie, go watch it right now. But this is not a review of the movie.  This is a review about the way the movie is made.  It has a script that's too vague and vague.   You get the idea that the movie will be a good movie, but it never is.  For the most part it's just a movie that is made to promote a TV show that doesn't even exist.  It is a movie about a couple of kids that go on a camping trip in the middle of nowhere.  They get trapped by a man who says that he is the god of the area.  The guy says that they can come and stay with him and his wife, but they can't touch the land.  At first, they don't believe him.  But then he brings them to his wife's house and there is a campfire going on.  Then, the man gets a bunch of snakes that come out of the ground and he makes a fire and then starts to kill all the snakes.  All the kids just stand around and watch this guy.  One of the kids says that this is the most crazy thing they've ever seen.  Another kid says that it was really weird.  After this, the kids go on their way.  You think they're really safe, but then he sends the man's wife to go to her sister's house.  This doesn't happen until after the kids are gone.  And the reason this doesn't occur until later is because they're trapped in a TV screen and the movie just keeps going and going.  Eventually the husband and his family are all killed by the snakes and then the woman gets eaten.  Once the woman is dead, the husband says that she's a good person.  We later find out that she was a snake hunter.  There's no way that this woman is the best person. So the movie isn't bad.  However, the way it's made is bad.   It's made like it's a movie and not a TV series.  When the TV show is not going on, the movie has a whole different feel.  So you'll be wondering if this is a TV movie or a movie made to advertise the TV series that didn't happen.  Some of the

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The last third of the movie is great, but I don't think it's really a horror movie. It doesn't feel like a horror film at all. It's more like a "comedy" movie. There are some really funny moments, but they're not really funny. The characters are pretty flat. They don't have much personality and they don't really have any motivation to go out and do anything. They have no real reason to get into trouble. They get into a situation, do what they're told, and then they're done. It gets old really fast. I don.t think I could have seen the last third if they'd have just put in some scares or some things that would make you think, "Oh, no. Something bad is going to happen." __________________________________________________________________________________

I loved it when I saw it but I can't imagine how someone else could love it as much as I did. The movie was based on a true story but it's so poorly made and the acting was so bad that it's almost funny. It also had a horrible ending and I hate to say it but it was kind of a cop out. I know it was meant to be a comedy but I guess it was a little too serious for the audience. There was so much more I wanted to say about the movie but I have to leave it here. It was a bad idea but it ended up being one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I'm glad I saw this movie but it ruined the rest of my life. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who loves a good laugh and a bad ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0989762/ _________________________  "The film is filled with some of the worst acting I have ever seen."  I had a conversation with this guy a few years back about a guy I knew who died in an auto accident. He asked me what he would be doing if he hadn't died. I replied that he would have been a director. "I wouldn't be a director today." I told him he was lucky he had been around at the time. He nodded his head in agreement. I guess the point is, the younger you are, the more luck you have. The old man was a good man, but the way he died was not. He was killed in a tragic accident. I never would have thought a film could cause such an emotional reaction, but this one did. A young man's life ended because he wasn't careful. This movie is a good example of how people can die for their country, but when they do, it's always for the wrong reasons.   "A lot of movies are like this. But that doesn't make them good." ...   It took a lot of courage to get to that part of the film. You have to watch it twice to understand why it's so upsetting. It's not just a movie about a young man dying; it's also a movie that makes you feel very much the way you would feel if you were in his position. It makes you wonder what would have happened if he had taken the road less traveled. This is a movie where you feel bad for the young man, who has to endure a life of hard work, but then the very next thing you know he is in a situation he would never have considered. He's in a car crash and it's obvious that it wasn't his fault. Then, as if out of nowhere, you see the movie make you feel terrible for him. You realize you are just as guilty as he is, even though he did what he thought was right. The way this film makes you look at life is through the eyes of the person you're watching. The whole thing is a sad story, but it doesn't come off as a tragedy.  , a young director who is about to shoot his next film, a movie based on the true story of a Vietnam war hero.

And you know, it is not easy to play a guy who has an addiction. It was not the easiest part for him to do, and I can see the frustration of him in this film. It made me feel bad about myself. He was not in the best of moods in this movie, but I feel sorry for him. He is a guy that is not always successful in his life. He has a lot of demons. The one that stands out for me is the one of his wife and his kid. His wife has left him, and he is now alone. The kid doesn't really like him. It makes me think that he has some problems in his personal life. I feel bad for the kids. I have seen them before. I know what they are going through. I am really sorry for all the people that have been hurt by this movie. It is a really good movie, and a good movie with a great cast. It doesn't hurt anybody.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________ 1.5 out of 5 stars I'll give this a 3.5 because it has some good moments. The movie has some of the most boring and uninspired writing ever. This movie is about a kid who is trying to save the world by being a superhero. The writer decided to make him a geek, but not one that could do anything. This kid has to learn how to fly, shoot guns, use his wits, etc...and he doesn't even get to use his powers for any of that. Instead, he spends all of his time learning how to kill people. There are a lot of scenes where he has to kill innocent people, or he has a plan to save a city and instead, he blows up the city with his powers. This is just an excuse for the writer to show off his powers to the audience. If you are into this kind of stuff, then go watch something else. Otherwise, you should just avoid this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ (If it's a good movie and you hate it, write something else)  The best and worst of a movie are often the same movie, and in the case of 'A Haunted House', this movie has a lot of the worst.  As an avid horror fan, I have seen every horror movie that was released in the 80's, and 'A Haunting', for all intents and purposes, is a movie I will never forget. It was my first experience with horror movies, and one that made me fall in love with the genre, as well as a movie that I can't help but think was ahead of its time.  the best of horror movies are always a surprise. the worst of horror is usually what you think is the worst, but actually, it's not.  and this is where 'A haunt' falls short. it's just too bad.  is there really a reason for the movie to exist? or is this just a cheap way to make money off of an 80's cult classic?  If you have never seen a horror movie before, I highly recommend you to go watch this movie, as you will not regret it.  for more information on the movie, check out this article on the horror movie:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Haunted_House  Advertisements

The negative review for this movie is a little bit different from the rest. It's not a bad review, but it's not the best one either.  The review is more like a "how to" book about a specific movie.    This review is for "I Am Love" The movie I am talking about is "I am love"      I am the love of your life.  But you hate me.  That's not my fault.  The first two acts of the movie are amazing.  You have a great main character in this movie.     The movie starts off with an amazing opening scene.  It's a great scene because it shows the love between the main character and the beautiful girl he loves.  This movie is all about the relationship between the characters.  They have a lot of chemistry between them.   But, the movie ends with the characters' breaking up and going their separate ways.  That's the second half of the film.   In the second act, we get a few more scenes that show the characters in a different light.  There are a few funny scenes, but nothing that really blew my mind.    There are no major emotional scenes in the second part of the story.  I just thought the second parts were a little too slow.  Again, it's a very slow movie. "I Am love" is a great movie for adults who enjoy a good rom-com movie. The story was good. The movie is slow paced. It doesn't get there too quickly.

The film's producer, Walter Hill, had sent his assistant director, a man named Robert "Chubby" Winkler, to be on hand to give him some pointers. I guess it was a good thing that Chubby was on hand because he was the one who decided that it was too funny to actually have a scene where a character had a bathtub filled with his own piss.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. The point of a review is to point out what is bad and not good about a movie. ____________. It is not good. It was a bad idea. It would have been better if it had been done by a director who had worked in the film business before. I would have watched it, but I am not going to waste my time on it. I am glad I got rid of it, and I will never see it again. I was really happy when it was over. I guess I was expecting something else. I don't know what to say. It's not a good movie, and it's not even a bad one. It just was not good in the slightest. I hope that people who like horror movies can understand that this one was not a film I would want to watch. I do not understand why they chose to make this film. It didn't have any good ideas. It looked like it was made by people who had never worked in a film studio. It took the place of a horror movie, but with a very bad plot. The director should have gotten a job working on a horror film instead. I hate to say it, because I like horror, but this movie was not funny. It wasn't funny at all. There were several jokes that were not funny at any level, and the jokes were not very good either. The acting was not very funny either. This movie is not even funny. I will give it one more star, but it was not worth it. ______________________________  I had this movie on VHS when I was in middle school, and even though it was terrible, it was still kind of interesting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ Let me be perfectly clear. This film is not a good movie. I'm not saying it's a bad film, but it is not an entertaining movie. It's not a film you will enjoy. It is an old fashioned movie that is nothing like the ones you used to watch. It reminds me of those movies where you would have the two kids in a tree, and the dad would have a gun and shoot the kid, but the kid would always be laughing at him, and then the kid goes up to the dad and says, "Daddy, how can I become a famous photographer?" And then the dad says, and this is the best part, "You'll be famous when you have a wife, and kids, and a great life." And the kid says, I wish I had a gun." I can see why people like this movie. They don't have to have a story. You just have to know what the main character is going through. The story is that of a young boy, who's getting to be the great photographer. But then, one day, his mom dies. And he goes into the tree to cry and cry. It turns out that his mother had been killed, and his dad is the great photo maker, who is not as nice as he was before. And the dad starts to shoot pictures. And as he shoots pictures, he's shooting his mom, and he's also shooting all the kids. And his mother keeps laughing at it, but he's not going to stop shooting pictures. I think people are going to be very entertained by this film. But the movie is terrible. And if you want to be entertained, go watch a good cartoon, or a good book. But don't watch this. It was terrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sorry but I don't give a fuck what you think of this movie.  The movie is bad and it shows.   This movie was just bad and no way it would be any good.  If you want a good movie then go watch a movie like The Departed, The Bourne Supremacy, and Taken.  I mean come on, this movie is a fucking train wreck.  And don't think that I don´t enjoy bad movies either, I watch a lot of bad movies so I can´t say that I'm too picky.  There is a reason that people like bad movies, because the bad movies have some value.  In this case, the value is zero.  The reason I don' t give a shit what you thought of this is because the movie has been out for a while now and I feel like this movie needs to be in theaters again so I don`t have to go through this.  This movie just doesn't have any redeeming qualities.  I'm just saying this because I want you guys to be aware of this.   If you don't know what I'm talking about then just wait till the end and you`ll see. Now I want to give the movie a 10 because this movie was pretty much the best movie I've ever seen.  It's one of the few movies that I can still remember and I can remember it clearly.  They should really make a new movie just like this one because this is still a good classic.  You can get this movie for around 50 bucks.  My only complaint is that the movie didn't end with some crazy ass ending, because if they had ended this movie like this I would have really hated this movie, because this should have been the end of this whole movie.   It`s like they threw in some more bad jokes to make this movie more entertaining.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. This is a great film, but there is a major problem that I see with it: The film is so incredibly cheesy and over the top, it's hard to take it seriously. I've been a big fan of the series, and I'm glad to see it in the hands of a director that isn't afraid to experiment. _________________________________________ The film follows an average American high school senior named Tatum (Jared Leto), who's looking to get out of a dead end job and get a taste of the life he'd always dreamed of, but when he finds out his mother is about to die, he decides to take the chance to go to Paris and take a trip to a nightclub. When he gets there, he gets into a fight with a young woman and falls into a coma. While he is comatose, the club's owner, Mr. Roque (Sylvester Stallone), comes in and offers to take him under his wing and make him into a professional dancer. Mr.Roque trains Tatum and then brings him on stage to perform for an audience of wealthy businessmen. The audience is amazed at the young man's dancing skills and then Tatum decides he wants to make a name for himself. He starts doing "tricks" in the clubs and is soon in demand. He meets a group of friends who also want to be in the limelight and they begin to work as a team. Tatum gets the chance of a lifetime when he meets a girl named Anissa (Michelle Rodriguez) and he falls in love with her. T.O.W. (Tatum, Leto, Rodriguez, Stallone) does well in his scenes as Tatum, and it is a shame that his character is never given more development. The other cast members were well done and I liked them all. The only thing that kept me from giving this film a higher rating is that I was disappointed with how the story was told. The film opens with a sequence that is supposed to set the tone for the entire film. The sequence starts out with Tatum getting into a car with some other people and then they leave for the club. It is in this scene that the film begins to take on the feel of a slasher film, and the only reason I can think of is because the camera angles are very tight. The rest of the film follows Tatum as he goes to the club and goes into the club, but I
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. It's a bad review for a movie. This one is not even good. I really don't want to review it, but I can't. It is a bad film. If you are going to review a bad thing you better at least give a reason why you are bad. I don't care how good the director is, or how good an actor is, it is a movie and they are there to be the audience. Not the actor. I mean I understand why you want to, but don't try and make it look like you are doing something special. If the director of the movie has never seen a bad horror movie he should know that a good horror movie can be a bad one. It can even be a good one. I have seen some good horror movies. A couple of them. I am not going to go into that. I also know that some of the actors are great. I know that. But I just think the acting was terrible. There was a couple of moments when the actors really showed how much they cared about the character and that was the problem. A lot of the time the actors were trying to show the audience how the character was acting. And the character wasn't acting. The character was just looking at a wall and yelling at a demon. I think the actors could have really shown how bad the demon looked. If I saw that movie and saw the actors just going through the motions I would say that was a bad job. So why did I even bother to review this movie. I had better things to do.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ The film begins with a scene in which a character (Miles Teller) is talking to his therapist (Ethan Hawke) about the film he has just watched. The therapist, who has recently been diagnosed with cancer, has seen many films but he is especially fond of The King's Speech. Miles starts to tell his therapist about the plot and the characters in the film. However, his therapist begins to get agitated and the scene cuts to a hospital room. This is where we meet Miles' mother (Julianne Moore). The mother of Miles Teller plays the role of a depressed mother who is watching the film with her son. She is watching his character, Michael Caine, give a speech about a speech he gave to the world about equality. The mother seems to be having a hard time understanding the movie. Her son, who is also watching the movie, doesn't seem to understand what is going on either. The scene continues and we see that there are people in the room who seem to be very disturbed by the movie and their behavior is not a good idea. We see a group of people walking up the stairs to their room and we hear a voice that sounds like "you have a beautiful face" and "you are a beautiful woman". Then we see a young woman who is walking up and down the stairs. She seems to have a very unhealthy obsession with Michael Cain. The young woman's behavior is very odd and we don't see why she would want to do such a thing. Finally, we see the young woman come down the steps and she is wearing a red nightgown. She then turns around and gives a speech to her friends. She turns to a woman sitting in the corner of the room and says "I want you to take off your nightgOWN, because I am tired of seeing the face of my baby brother". The woman then turns to Miles and says, "You are the man of my dreams". Miles Tller then turns towards his mother and says to her "she is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen". This is the end of the film and the young girl turns to her friend and says 'I love you' and she starts to walk out of the hospital. The woman starts to leave and then Miles says "That's right, you are the woman of my dream." The scene ends and we cut to a commercial. The film itself was really bad. The acting was really poor. The story line
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________  1.3/5  5/10  -1/5-   For a movie with an absolutely horrible cast and a poorly written script, I was really hoping that it would end on a high note. Unfortunately, the film did the exact opposite. After the end credits rolled, I realized that the movie had completely ruined my experience of watching a film. The entire film is nothing but a complete waste of time.   I started watching this movie after seeing the trailers and the title and was immediately confused by the title. "Wake Up Dead?" is a fairly obscure horror movie. It is a remake of the 1983 classic, "Wakes Up Dead", which stars Peter Cushing and John Hurt. The film opens with a group of college students playing poker. It soon turns out that a young man has been killed in a car accident and that his killer has not been found. This leads to the group taking up the case and trying to figure out who this person is. The plot of the film is very well done. The characters all seem to be on the same page and have very little conflict. This movie has a great cast and it is very easy to see who is who. The main problem with the film comes from the lack of story. There is very little story, especially since the film's story is very simplistic. The only thing that we do learn is that the victim is a student at a college and that he was killed after a car crash. This was followed by a few hours of nothing but random scenes of people talking about how horrible this person was and how bad his parents must be for letting him live with them.   a group college kids take up a murder case, with the lead character being a student, who they quickly find out is the main suspect. The character that we are introduced to is called Kevin. Kevin is a very boring character and is barely mentioned throughout the entire film. He has little to no story or motivation. I can see how someone could enjoy watching this film but there are better movies out there. If you want to see a movie where people die and are constantly talking about their lives, this is the film for you.  , I saw this movie because of the trailers. Unfortunately for this movie, it's not a very good film. It's very bad. The cast is terrible and the script is very poorly written. If this were the case, I would probably give this a 2
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________" (That is why I don't like the movies in the list below) I am a long time movie watcher and I like to watch movies, but sometimes they don't stay with me. I like the movie "Gravity" and I saw the movie again and again. The actors are good, but it is a film where the scenes are very simple and have no emotional impact. It is the most boring movie ever made. It was the same thing that was in the movie of the same name, which is a stupid movie about a dumb man who travels in space and tries to kill his girlfriend by using his gravity. This movie is only about the man who has to take a trip into space to kill a woman and that is all. I hope that someone made a better movie because there are so many other movies that are better than this one. I know the original film was about the astronaut going to space and he meets an alien girl, but in this movie he goes to space to die by falling. This is the worst movie ever. I am going to watch "Gravitrumpers" again and I hope this movie is better. The best thing about this movie, is that it is made by the director of "Alien." This is why "G-Force" is not the best movie of all time. "The Wicker Man" is also not a good movie because it is not about a boy who has a curse, but a man who goes to a haunted house. The movie "Candyman" is another movie made by Sam Raimi, but this time the movie is about a haunted doll. "Night of the Living Dead" is made from the same idea as "Grave" and "The Evil Dead." The movie is not very good, and I am not going to go into it, but the movie has a lot of scary scenes. I have watched all the movies that were released between the year of 1985 and 1991. The movies that I have seen are: "Alien," "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," "Friday the 13th," "Poltergeist," "Scream," "It", "Friday," "Return of the Monster," "Dawn of the Dead," "Dead Alive," "Tremors," "Alien 3," "Resident Evil," "Bio-Dome," "Predator," "Saw," "A Nightmare on Elm Street," "Cabin Fever," "I Know What
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ Let me tell you something: this movie sucks. This is my favorite movie of the year and I have seen every other film in the series, so I know this movie really sucks. I'm so glad they are going to release this movie on DVD. I want to see it again, but not in the theaters. This movie is terrible. It doesn't live up to the original series, and it takes a different direction than the series was going. I would never watch this movie again.  Rated 5 out of 5 by jgk16 from Great Movie!! I had a blast watching this movie. It's funny and sad and at the same time very emotional. It was a very special experience seeing the movie with my family. I thought it was a bit cheesy at times but still entertaining. I highly recommend this movie to all of you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "A horrible movie" I've seen it, and it was bad. It was really bad. I can't explain it, but there was something wrong with the movie. I don't know if it was a bad production or bad script or bad director, but it was the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting was bad, the writing was bad... and there was a lot of other things that just sucked. It just sucked! The ending was so bad, it was as if they just ran out of money and decided to do a crappy ending. It makes me feel like I'm watching a movie from the 80's. Not only that, the movie had the worst production values that I've seen on a movie in a long time. It looked bad, everything was done in a cheap way, and there were no props. I think it was made by a couple of people who are just lazy and didn't care about the movie they were making. The movie had a bad ending and a crappy movie. The ending, which I didn't like, made me feel sorry for the people in the movie because they all had horrible lives and it didn't matter to them. I'm glad I only saw it once, because otherwise I would have never seen it again. It's just a terrible movie that's made to make people sad. It doesn't even make me feel sad because the ending made me so mad! I guess I can say it was better than my last movie, but I didn.t want to watch that. What do you think? Should I watch it again? Is it a good movie?
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ I was excited to see this movie. I had heard a lot about it and read about it in a lot of other places, but it didn't really click with me until I saw it. I guess I had a preconceived idea about what I was going to like, but I was disappointed. It wasn't that the film was bad, it was that it wasn't good. I don't mean it's bad in the traditional sense, but in the way a bad film should be. It's kind of a let down. The acting was all right, I guess, but not great. The story was fine. I mean, it didn`t really take itself very seriously, but the characters were just... meh. It was kind of like watching a bad version of the movie "Romeo and Juliet" except instead of being Romeo, Juliet, or the ghost of Hamlet, it`s you and the ghost. The ghost has no personality and doesn't really do anything. There are some good bits, but overall, it wasn`t all that good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie and it is just plain bad. The movie is about an idiot who got the job and had to find out how to run a large restaurant. I can't tell you how many times he just goes in and starts ordering food and when he gets his food, he throws it on the floor. It was awful. If I had to give it a negative rating I would give it 4 stars. It's just a total waste of time and money.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________  "The world's best revenge is when you don't have to do anything at all." ~ George Costanza  Rating: _______. I will not give this movie a rating. I would rather see it and not have to sit through it. It's a sad movie, but I really feel bad for the characters, especially the young man, who was the main character of the movie. The other characters just don't do anything and the story isn't interesting. This movie is like a movie version of the book 'The Silence of the Lambs'. The only difference is the characters in this movie are not psychopaths, but are people with mental disorders. There are some scenes in this book that were so horrible and disturbing that it made me sick. I felt that this movie, however, was not as disturbing. In the book, there are so many horrific scenes, I thought my eyes would pop out of my head and I would start screaming. But, that was not the case. I was bored after about 3/4 of the way through the movie, which was disappointing. It was very sad, but there was nothing that really affected me. I don't think it's a bad book. The book was a very disturbing book, and I don.t want to watch a movie that is as disturbing as that book. I think it was made with the same director, so it could be a good movie. But I really didn't want to see it. The ending was really disturbing, and it made my stomach churn. If you want a movie about a young boy, go watch 'The Goonies'. If you don`t want a scary movie, then just leave it.  My rating: _____.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What I learned from this movie: I was going to be a lawyer, not a movie director. I learned: __________________  I was going into a very bad neighborhood, and it was only after I had been shot at that I realized it was a good neighborhood.  Babes in Arms (1928)  This was the first movie directed by Charles Vidor (who later went on to make the first "talkie"). It stars Mary Pickford as the head of a women's organization, which fights for women's suffrage in New York. The film also stars John Randolph and George Segal. The plot: A group of women go to Washington to lobby for the vote for women. They meet a couple of Republicans and their daughter, who are not exactly sympathetic to women's rights. The group then meets the president, who is sympathetic, but still won't give them the vote. They go back to Washington, where they meet a congressman, and a senator, who will not give them their vote. After meeting a group of people who are interested in women's right to vote, they leave, and are followed by the police. Eventually, they meet the man they had left behind, and his daughter, and they get their vote after the congressman decides to go ahead with the vote that was set for the next day.  of  The film was released the same year that MGM released its "sugar" pictures, which were just the same type of low-budget movies you'd see on television. It was made by a director named Irving Thalberg, who had a very short film career. It has some of the worst acting I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad acting in movies. The dialogue is terrible, and some of it is very bad. In the film, Thalburg is portrayed as a bad man. He is cold and arrogant, and you see him only through the eyes of the women. He treats them like objects. He never seems to understand them, and doesn't care about their feelings. Mary Pick was great, but she was a real, live person. She was not playing an actress. In fact, the women in the film didn't have to act; they just had to be themselves. Mary picked up a lot from Jane Russell, and in the movie she has to be herself too. She's a very strong woman, but there's something about her in the beginning

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________  I really enjoyed this movie. It's not a great movie by any means, but it was fun. I had a great time with it. The story is pretty basic, but you get the feeling you've been watching it all along. The acting was okay, but I can't say that it was good. They didn't have a lot of laughs in the movie. I found it hard to relate to the character. He seemed a bit boring and I wasn't really sure how he got to where he was. I guess I just didn't like him. I know it was a comedy, but the movie was really just a bunch of really funny scenes. I'd give it a 4/5.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________  A movie that is not good but is still worth watching for the sheer fact that its a pretty good movie about a really good guy.  This is a movie that you can watch if you have a lot of time, or if you want to see some good movies. It's got a great script, good acting and a good plot. There are a lot less moments of tension than you might expect, but its a good film, and I think it's pretty well-made.  a lot more drama than what we see in many other films. - I like the idea of a woman who is a thief. She steals from people who are nice and decent, but she gets what she wants in the end.  (I'm not sure how much more she could do but I'll leave that up to the viewers to decide)  - It's funny how it all comes together when you look at the final scene. . I like that they showed the thief's point of view, that's what you would expect in a movie like this.  the acting is really good. it was good for me to see the thief as a woman.  on the other hand I don't like the female thief. It seems to me that they are more interested in the male thief. And the way she looks at him is not very nice. It doesn't help that her eyes are big, it feels like she has no idea what she is doing.  "The thief and the thief" is a film about a guy who is very good and who steals from the bad guys. It also shows the other side of him and the things he does to keep his family and friends safe. It was also interesting to see a man with a lot in common with his female partner. The two of them are pretty good friends but at the same time they are quite different. The film was a bit sad in some parts. I think there was a lot that could have been left out. The film could have gone more in depth. There was some stuff that I felt should have been explored more, but the film did an OK job. Overall the film was not that bad, but I don´t think it is an A-movie, or that it will make you laugh. The ending was a little weird and I felt that the ending was forced. But still, it is a very good film. It has a good script and good acting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  The film was so bad, that I think I could have enjoyed it. The story was not good. The characters were not interesting. The actors did not have the right chemistry with each other. The movie was not well acted. The sound was not amazing. The lighting was not great. The cinematography was not very good. So I was hoping that they could make a good movie out of this, and that it would be better than I thought. But it was not. I was never bored or bored at all. But if I was looking for a good laugh, I could find it. But I was not laughing. I just had no fun at all in this movie. I have seen this movie a couple of times in the theater and it never gets any better. The last time I saw this, I just wanted to die. This movie will probably be in my top 10 list of worst movies ever made. I am so disappointed. It is so bad. It has everything that is bad about a movie. But there was a part in the movie that was good. But, it was the end. The ending was so stupid. I could not understand why they had to end the movie like this. I would have been more pleased if they would have not ended this way. I felt like they did not even want to make a movie out this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Is there anything that is bad in a bad film? I'll be honest, there is something I have never understood. It seems that no matter how bad a film is, it is always compared to a "bad" movie. I just find this so weird. In the end, if a film makes me laugh and smile, then it is a great film. I don't care how much I hated the movie or if it was a train wreck of bad decisions. There are some great scenes in this movie. But, I have to say, that a lot of them just didn't make me laugh or smile. There is one scene in this film where a kid is talking to a big man, and then the kid says "You're big, you're ugly, you are my father" and the big man says "I'm your father" And the kid just says "Yes, yes I am". I just think that in a film, you have to have fun and smile. And I think this movie failed in that department. I know that this movie was made in 1981, so it has to be considered "old", but I can't say that it was the best that it could have been. It didn't have enough of a story, and the acting just wasn't that good.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ The Movie: "The Crazies" is the first in a trilogy about three families who live in the woods. They have no jobs or money and they are living in their car with their two children. The main character is a man named John (John Wayne), who is the leader of the family. His wife Mary (Judy Garland) is a good mother and he has a beautiful daughter named Lizzie (Jean Harlow). His daughter is a troubled teen (Katherine Hepburn). The family has a secret but no one knows what it is. After a horrible car accident John's sister (Margaret Sullavan) leaves him and his wife and goes off with a guy named Joe (Roddy McDowall). The two families go to a local bar and they have a fight that John loses. Then Joe comes back to their house and tells John that Lizz is pregnant and she wants to leave him. John is not happy about it and he tells his wife about the pregnancy and she says she doesn't want to have an abortion. Then Mary tells her friends that she doesn`t want to go on a trip because John and Joe want to meet and she will see them. So John leaves his daughter with Joe and Lizz gets a ride home with John and Lizzy. As John is leaving his wife tells him that she knows he has had an affair. He doesn` t know why she tells him this. When John gets home he is in bed and Lizza comes in. She is very upset and John tells her to leave. She does but then she calls John to tell him that her mother is not feeling well and that he should go get a doctor. John goes into the house and finds a note from Lizzy. It reads "Dear John, I think I am pregnant and I have a doctor's appointment. You can come by anytime you want. I love you." John gets a phone call from Lizza and she tells John she has a bad headache. She tells him not to worry about it. She wants to go out for some pizza. So he goes out and buys some pizza and a beer. The movie ends with John's wife and his daughter crying. They are now thinking about how they will raise their daughter and how they are going to feed her. I think they should have kept this part of the movie because it would have made the movie much more interesting. The rest of the film is just a series of bad
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________"  "In all the excitement of watching this movie at the time, I forgot I was sitting in a movie theater with a lot of other people. There was a lot more excitement at the movies in the 80's than there is today. It wasn't just the movies that were bad, but also the movies with the poor acting and music. I just couldn't stand the cheesy music in most movies and I was always embarrassed when the audience laughed at a movie I thought was stupid. I never had any interest in watching movies. I have no idea why my parents got me into this but I can't say I enjoyed it very much."  I was a kid and I had never seen a movie that I really disliked until that time. I was a young teenager when I first saw the original Star Wars. The film was terrible. The music was terrible and the acting was terrible (by then I had grown up and it was too late). It was so bad, that I remember my friends were trying to convince me to stop watching it. They were convinced that it was going to kill my life. This was back in the early 80's when I was living in California and the movie was playing at the local movie theatre. It's a very funny movie and a great time was had by all, but it wasn't my kind of movie. The bad acting, the terrible music and the cheesy acting were so bad that I just wanted to stop the movie as soon as I saw it. But I couldn't and it ended up being one of my favorite films of all time. The last time I saw a movie with a bad acting and bad music was the first time I ever saw the movie The Empire Strikes Back. So I've always been kind of a Star Wars fan and I think it's a shame that they didn't make more movies.

The people who give these bad reviews are the ones that don't know how to give a good review. Don't be one of those people who doesn't give a bad review. Get a grip and go watch the movie! I'm sorry but the movie was so boring I didn't even want to finish it. I just sat there and watched it over and over again to see what happened to the characters. I don't care if it's a bad story. Just don't watch a bad bad movie.  I love this movie. It's just a really good movie. I'm not a fan of the James Bond series but this is my favorite one. The plot is really good, and there are some interesting and fun moments in the movie, although it does get kind of repetitive. I also like how they kept making the characters look different so you wouldn't get tired of seeing the same people. The movie isn't perfect, but I really liked it. It was a good movie, so don't be afraid to watch it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________ I liked this movie. I didn't really enjoy it though. It was okay. It wasn't bad. But I didn  I liked this one. I liked it better than some of the other movies that I've seen. I have to say that I'm a bit disappointed. This movie was so much better than the trailer made it seem. I think this movie has potential to be a good film, but it doesn't work for me. The characters are very boring and the plot is very simple. I just don't get it. I thought the trailer was so good, but I didn.t get it the same way. It just didn't work. I don't really like the style of the movie either. The film was shot in black and white and looked very interesting. But the colors just don t seem to go with the movie. The way the film is shot is very similar to an old silent movie. So much of the film looked very similar. The music is pretty bad. I never got a good sound effect for the gun shots, which was really bad. The acting is just ok. I really didn't get what was going on. I'm just going to say it again. The story is very bad. It's not a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________________  It's like someone in a coma, trying to hold a mirror to reality.   I really didn't think the film would live up to my expectations, I thought the film was going to be just a cheap horror film, but it was more of a cheap thriller. The main character is a young woman named Jessica who's found in a hotel room, she's got no memory of how she got there. The first thing she remembers is a dark room with a door that leads to a dead end. She hears a loud noise and a strange man standing over her.   is she going to die or is this some kind of prank? No, it's a prank and she's going to play the victim. It doesn't take long for her to realize the man has the power to turn people into zombies. I was surprised by the acting. Most of the actors are young kids with no acting experience, and it's pretty obvious how they came up with the movie's characters. The director tries to give the film a twist ending but I wasn't able to find it.     The writing is not very good. The film is just a horror movie, with some supernatural elements thrown in, so the writing doesn't need to be very good to be good. There are some nice twists and turns in the film, and I'm sure if the movie was a few years older, it would have aged well. However, as it is now, I can't recommend it.

I also felt that the cinematography wasn't that good either, it wasn't a very good movie to watch. The plot was boring, and I don't like to read spoilers.

I felt as if I was just watching the first 30 minutes of a show that had been edited and slowed down. The editing of this film makes it difficult to watch. I really liked this film, but not for what it pretends to be.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What movie?     No, it's not a joke. This movie, directed by Steven Soderbergh, is a truly awful film that I would never recommend. It's a truly bad movie, and that's not hyperbole. It will make you feel as if you're watching a bad reality show about some kids who do drugs, and have sex, and act stupid. It is the film equivalent of a high school boy who's a little too smart and knows too much about drugs and sex and does all of those things at the same time. It has some decent actors, but you can tell the actors were not paid very well to play such horrible roles. It was written by a guy who didn't understand how to write a good script, so he just wrote the movie in the way that he knew would make a good movie. He had no clue what would be good about it, or how to do it, so his film turned out to be terrible.  What's worse, this is a remake of a movie that I didn't like, so I had no interest in watching this remake. The actors are terrible, and the writing is even worse. This is the worst remake I have ever seen. It feels like an expensive movie with some cheap effects and poorly done acting. It really isn't a good film, and you should feel bad for spending your money on it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why do bad movies get made? _________ A movie like "Romeo Must Die" or "The Dark Knight" is a great story, but there are certain limitations with those kind of movies. They are not good at telling a story. They can tell a great part of a story, and they can tell it well, but they can't tell it in a way that is interesting, or that is going to be engaging to an audience that doesn't have a lot of experience with those kinds of stories. I think the problem with "The Mummy" is that the story is a little bit too simple. It's very straightforward, and the way they do it is very predictable. The story is pretty simple: There is a mummy. He's in a tomb, and he's going to die. But it's not like you have a great deal of depth to the story. It could have been told much better. The problem is, it is a very predictable story, which makes it boring, and also a very frustrating story to watch. The movie has a certain kind of excitement, but the excitement is very artificial. I just don't think the story was good enough. I'm not going to go into a lot more detail about it, but I can't get into it without giving a little too much away. If you're going to tell a story about a mummy, I think it should be told in a more interesting way, with a lot less predictability. That's one of the reasons why I was a little upset with it. I have to give credit to the writers for making a really great movie, but it doesn't live up to its potential.   On "Star Wars" films: __________________ I can think of one thing that "Star Trek" did that they're still going to have to look back on, and that's that they made a lot about the technology and the science fiction element, which is very important to them. They did a great job with the Star Trek movies, and I don't mean that in a bad way. I mean that they did a very good job with it, and made an interesting movie. That was their one advantage. They had the technology. I guess they didn't use it that well. I don the technology is something that has to be taken seriously, and it is used very well. It is used to show a lot. It doesn't really serve the story, I don

He makes no effort to tell us anything. He does not care what we think of the movie. He tries to make us believe that it is an original movie but it is not. It is crap and he should be ashamed of himself. He should have spent the money for the actors and hired the director that he thought would be a good match. Instead he chose a director that did not even have a clue what he was doing. This movie was bad from the start to the end.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ The most memorable scene in my opinion is in the first movie where I was in the back of the plane and we're taking off. The flight attendants are talking and the pilot says "I can't believe we're about to fly. It's going to be a great day. We're going to fly across the United States and over the ocean. I'll never forget it." Then he gets up and says "Let's go get some coffee" and goes to the bathroom and comes back and goes "There we go, the sun's out." I can't tell you how many times I have laughed out loud at that. I have heard that joke before but I have never heard it said like that. It is a real great movie, not just a good movie. The movie starts out a bit slow but then it picks up and you are going to see something amazing. It really is like a silent movie, you don't know what is going to happen. I would say the best part of the movie is when the helicopter crashes into the ocean and they go under and they have to walk down the shoreline. That was very moving and I loved it. I remember sitting down and watching it with my parents. I didn't think the helicopter would be in the water for that long. It was a beautiful scene. There was also a scene at the end of the airplane in which we all saw the airplane hit the water and it made such a big splash that it was very exciting. There were many other scenes that were just very good. The scenes of the characters that we saw in the movie were really good. I thought it was a good idea to make a movie about a helicopter crash. It made me think about how good of a helicopter pilot I was and how I would be so proud of my pilot when I heard that he was the first person to get his helicopter in the air. I think that would make me really proud. That would be one of the greatest things in the world. I guess that is why I wanted to do this movie. It would be a real honor to be the first to fly a helicopter in an ocean. It sounds really good and it would be something that I would love to do. I'm really glad that I took the chance and did this movie and I'm glad that it is making a lot of money. This movie is really worth it because I think it is going out to a lot more people. I really think it has something

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________"  __________ is one of the most popular movies of all time, and many people like it. But it was also one of those movies that had a very low budget and an underwhelming theatrical release. So in order to make a decent movie, you have to get a lot of money and cast some of the best actors of their day. And that is exactly what happens.  But the story is a bit thin, and the movie starts off a bit lame, but it quickly becomes entertaining as a whole. And there is one scene that I would recommend to every single person who is a fan of The Wire: "If you don't stop me now, I'm going to kill you." This line, when you think about it, is not even very clever, and is just an excuse for a murder. It does not really add anything to the plot, but at least it is memorable.  and the rest of the film is pretty decent. The actors all do a pretty good job, but there is just one problem with the movie: the music. I will never forget the opening song of the movie, it is so haunting and beautiful. But the ending song is just terrible. There is no music, just silence. And it is the same with the ending credits. I have heard this song so many times before in different movies, and yet there is nothing to it. .  The story itself is very interesting. There are lots of scenes where the main character tries to kill someone, but in every one of these situations, he is stopped by the police. And this is the problem: the police always end up getting killed. And why does he have to be killed? The police is supposed to be there to protect people. And the fact that the police is killed is very predictable and just adds to the boredom. In the end, it feels like a bad action movie.  the only thing that is really bad about the movie is the fact it is not that good. The plot is pretty interesting, but the characters are not that great. They are not all that original, and they are a bit predictable. It's not that I didn't like the movie. It is just that the whole thing feels a bit rushed and lacking in substance.

I'm not saying that you can't make a good movie with an interesting premise, but this one was clearly just thrown together.   I have to say, this is one of the worst movies I've seen.  I watched it because it had the word "LOST" in it. I don't know if it's just because of how long it's been since I saw Lost, or because of the fact that it was made in 1997, but I just can't stand this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  "Citizen Kane" (1941)  I like to think of myself as a fairly objective observer. When I was a kid, my father would often get mad at me when I watched "Citizen Tom" (which he saw in the theater) and say things like, "It's not a good movie." The only reason he ever got mad at us was because I couldn't name a single good line in it. I was pretty disappointed with the film.  The "Tom" of the title is a former Marine who has been left to die in a hospital in Los Angeles. When he gets to the hospital he finds out that the doctors are not treating him as they should. He goes home and has a fight with his wife who, as a result, is going to lose her job. He ends up killing her with a gun and goes back to the hotel. There he meets a young lady who calls herself Alice. She takes him on as her guest and takes care of him until the next day when she is found dead. The next morning, the young lady's brother, Tom (William Holden), who is also Tom's lover, visits him at the hotel and asks him to help with the case of Alice's murder.  and the rest, as they say, is history.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Is the movie bad?  Not really.  It's not as good as some of the other movies I saw this year, but it's good enough to be worth watching.   I didn't think it was going to be so good, but I was wrong.  There are a couple of things that are really missing from this movie.  I don't really see how this movie has any connection to the book at all.  Maybe it does.  What really bugs me is that there are no female characters.  Even though there is a female love interest, and a male character who is trying to get the girl, none of them are real.  This movie seems to have no concept of the fact that a woman's place is in the home.  The movie doesn't have any women at all, so why not?  Is there a point to this?  I just don't understand how a movie could make the woman's role to be that of a servant, when there are so many other roles in the world of fiction.  Why didn't the filmmakers make this movie with real women?

It didn't feel like the movie they showed me was a real movie. I was really disappointed. I wish I had stayed away from it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  "This movie has no redeeming value. It is one of the worst movies ever made."  - The Internet  It's a story of an ex-con turned bounty hunter who has the hots for a bounty hunter. The film has nothing going for it. It's a dull and uninteresting action movie that is devoid of anything memorable. The plot is convoluted and there are too many characters to mention. It has no heart. There is a girl who is an assassin who is not interested in being a bounty hunting and a woman who is a bounty who has no desire to kill a man who is only interested in the bounty hunter and a man with no conscience who is in love with a bounty. The bounty hunter in this film has no character. He is boring and dull. I thought it was a rip-off of "Tin Cup" and "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan" but I'm not sure it's the same. The Bounty Hunter is an evil guy. There are no redeemable characteristics in the film.  In conclusion, this is a terrible film that has no story and no heart at all. The movie is so dull and there is no suspense at all so the audience will be bored to death. The acting is atrocious and there were many inconsistencies. I cannot recommend this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________  I love that he's trying to make the movie seem realistic. I just wish that he would do it in a more interesting way. I mean the guy is just a big, fat, dumbass. The main problem was how he was portrayed. He was really just some sort of monster and I don't think that's really realistic.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* ********** ************* ******** ******** **** ********  (2) "Tears in Heaven"  I like this movie. I think it's funny, it's not so preachy. There are many good things about it, like the music, the cinematography and the performances. But this movie is a disaster. It's a complete disaster. The actors are not good at all. And the story is not good. The acting is terrible, the dialogues are bad and the whole thing is just too long. There is no logic in it, the plot is too long and there are too many characters in the movie, and all of them are completely useless and you don't care about them. The whole thing seems like a joke and it's a joke that the actors were not good enough to pull off. The movie is just a complete mess and you just don't want to see it.  It's not a good movie. . 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ This movie is the absolute worst I have ever seen. First of all, it is extremely dull, which is really no surprise since it's about a guy trying to go to college by taking a job at a high school, and it's the worst I've ever seen in the English language. The acting is atrocious, the music is boring, the plot is not interesting, the characters are stupid and stupid characters and the action scenes are just pointless and boring. The only redeeming factor is the art, which looks very good, although the backgrounds are quite plain. ______________________________ Update: This movie has received a remake (in the U.S.) with some decent action sequences, but the story remains the same. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody, but if you're a fan of action and just want to see a boring movie that doesn't actually add anything to the plot, you could try this out. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ If you liked this movie then you'll love...  -The acting-  There was a bit of a surprise with some of the acting but not so much. Some of the cast had some nice moments, but not as many as some of my favorite characters. I think it was because they didn't get a lot of screen time. They weren't used enough. I thought they were pretty good but the characters didn't really develop. Some actors had some good moments but some were too one-note.  The acting is very uneven. Some had great moments and some had the same scenes over and over. The main characters are great and you get to know them better, but they have a lot to learn before the end.  in this movie. So, if you liked the movie, you will enjoy the movie. If you didn't like it then you will like the movie better because the actors really made the movie great. , 5 stars
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  When I saw "The Sixth Sense" at the theater in Santa Monica, CA, I didn't know what to think. I was expecting to see a ghost movie. I did not know it was going to be a bad one. I watched the whole thing and was just horrified at what I saw. I couldn't believe how they managed to make a movie about a kid with the mind of a 7 year old. If I could go back in time and change anything about this movie, I would. It is not a movie that should be made today.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********** "Honeymoon" is a mediocre movie, but not the worst of the worst. It's a comedy. Not a particularly funny one. The movie is pretty short. It doesn't do much with its story. The characters are pretty one-dimensional. The plot is lame, but it's not bad. The acting is really bad. A few of the actors (including a lot of the cast) are very over the top. One character, Charlie, who plays a bad guy, is just a joke. And then you have to sit through a long, boring song. The music is awful. And the movie is made by a director who doesn't know how to direct a movie. And, like I said, the actors are just terrible. You could make a list of all the actors who were in this movie, and there is no one good in it. I wouldn't recommend this movie. It is a bad film. It does not deserve any sort of praise.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is set in Los Angeles. The director of the film is a young writer named Steve Coogan. His father is a priest and his mother is a nun. His uncle is a minister. His brother is a doctor. His sister is a lawyer. Steve's sister, Ann, is a nurse. Steve has a girlfriend named Linda (played by Emma Thompson). Steve has an interest in the occult and is intrigued by the idea of possessing people. Steve is in love with Linda, but she is interested in another man.  Steve's girlfriend, Ann is about to get a job at a hospital. Ann's sister works at a nursing home. Ann is upset at her boyfriend because he has had a hard time of it and is trying to pick up women. She is about two months pregnant with their child. Steve and Linda are in a hotel room with Linda's child. The baby is not moving, but Linda is having an orgasm. The father of the baby is there. The child is about 3 months old. Ann and the baby's father, the priest, have been having an affair.  is a story of incest, rape, and sexual abuse. Steve co-wrote the film with his brother. They were both 16 and 17 years old at the time of the production. : I read this book years ago and was shocked by the content. It was not a book I would recommend to anyone. I was also surprised that Steve Cooney had written a screenplay based on this book. I have a few questions about the book. The movie is based on a book written in the 1980s, but the book does not have a date of publication. Was this book written before the movie was made? Why did they make a movie out of a book that is over 30 years old? What about the movie being based on the author's experiences in a nursing facility? I would have thought that they would have had a script doctor come up with a more modern way of making this story. Was the movie made at the same time as the book? How come Steve Cooley was not aware of this book when he was making the movie? Was the script rewritten by a writer for the movie or was the script written after the movie took place? I'm hoping that some of these questions will be answered.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this film once, and I have a bad feeling about it now. It was just a piece of trash. I was so disappointed by the movie. The only reason why I'm giving it a 3 is because I had to see it once, but the fact is, this film has no redeeming qualities.  This movie was made in 1989, and the acting and acting performances are awful. This is a movie where a man (Trey) who is about to kill his wife (Mary Jo) takes her (Maggie) to the woods. They take the car and drive off. The husband is so sad that he tells his wife, "I love you, but I'm not going to kill you". The wife replies, "Don't kill me. I love you too." The husband, however, is a coward and shoots the wife in the face, killing her. Then, he drives to the nearby cemetery, and dumps her body. He returns home and finds his wife's body in his bed. Maggie's (Marlene) blood is on his sheets, as well as on the wall. In this scene, there is no dialogue, no emotions, no nothing. It's a horror movie. A bad movie. It makes me think of the films of Robert Rodat. Rodat's films are all bad, but there is something in Rodat that makes them more horrible than a good movie. There are no suspenseful scenes in this movie, and no plot is advanced. It is all mindless, pointless action. I don't know how a person can go into a movie expecting anything to happen, and not expect a horrible scene to occur, but if you did, you're a fool. The acting is terrible. The movie is shot in such a way that it seems to be an interview. It looks like a documentary, but it's actually a bad documentary. The cameraman keeps cutting between the husband and wife, so you don't see them at all. The editing is horrible. The film is just so terrible that it's hard to watch. I think the director of the film, Bill Gifford, probably thought he had created a movie that was so good that the audience wouldn't want to turn it off, but they didn't. The audience hated it. It didn't have anything in it to get them excited. My favorite scenes in the movie are the ones where the wife is lying in

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie I have ever seen. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It is a terrible movie with horrible acting, terrible acting, bad acting. I thought it was a horrible movie and I didn't have any fun watching it. This movie is a joke. I don't think anyone will enjoy this movie. I feel bad for anyone that actually enjoyed this movie because it was so bad. I had no fun watching this movie and it was not funny at all. It was very bad. What is the movie about? This movie was made to get a few bucks in the budget. It shows a lot of violence and has a very graphic sexual scene. I didn.t enjoy this very much. I was very bored by the entire movie. If you like rape, torture and murder then you will like this movie.. If you don't like those things then I don.t know why you would want to watch this movie! It is just a terrible terrible horrible movie. Where is the plot? I was not sure where the plot was going but there was a whole lot of fighting and I don' t know if I liked it. I really don't remember anything. I just remember some of the things in the movie. The violence was very extreme. I think this movie was so badly made that they actually needed to add a lot more violence. I know this movie is very graphic but it was very violent. I do not like violence. Any other thoughts about the movie? If you like torture, violence and rape you will probably like this horrible movie.. This movie really sucked me in because it did not take long for me to be entertained. I can understand why they made this movie but I just did not like it at all! It was just horrible! If you want to see a terrible horrible horrible movie then I would suggest you go to a bad bad bad movie store and try to find a decent movie. You will probably be disappointed.

The movie starts off very well but the movie doesn't get better after it starts. The film has a few great scenes and a few bad scenes. The acting in this movie is horrible and the plot doesn't work. The ending of the movie sucks and that is all the movie has. A movie needs to end. The best part of the film is the ending. The whole movie could have been cut out and a different ending could have had a better ending. Overall, this movie was a bad idea and it was poorly made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Jul 15, 2017 9:13 PM by Anonymous W. You will have a hard time finding a more ridiculous film that's been released in the past decade. A film that should never be made. What in the world was the point of this film. I guess it was all supposed to be about a group of women who want to be models in Paris, but then it turns out they're all just fucking whores who just want to have a good time while the other women are there to provide for them. They just hang out and have sex with guys and women they meet and fuck and then leave, leaving the other girls behind. They get their rocks off in a different city and they leave the next day. I mean, why make a film about this. It's ridiculous. It really is. The whole movie is based around this. All of it. Even the girls who are there and having sex with these guys are constantly talking about the other ladies. I thought it was just a porno at first, but it wasn't. It was all about how these girls were there for the guys to have sex and how they had sex with other girls in a hotel and then they left. It didn't matter if the girls were actually there. The guys just didn't care if the other chicks were there or not. It wasn't about the girls. It just turned into a porn movie. And it's so bad. The girls just weren't hot. They were all really pretty and they weren't bad looking, but they were just there to have fun and they didn't get anything out of it besides a few looks from the guys. It seemed like they were all just trying to get the guys for themselves. There were even a few times when they were having sex and then the guy left the room. It took me a while to realize that the guys were just getting off to it. They didn't actually care about the ladies and they only wanted to have the fun with the other guys. They weren't even trying to have an actual sexual relationship with the girls, they just had sex. It felt like a porn film. The only thing they were doing was having sex. They had no interest in what was happening. The actors didn't have any interest in doing their jobs. It all felt so fake and forced. They even had a bunch of guys in there who were there to try to take advantage of the girls but they didn;t

This is an updated version of a movie that was released in 1990. The movie itself is a very faithful adaptation of Crichtons novel and I would highly recommend this movie. However, I can't say the same about the director, David Fincher. Finchers film has been called "brutal" and "re-watchable", which sounds great but is actually not true. I find his film to be boring and he is unable to create anything new. His film is a re-hash of his previous work. While this movie was pretty bad, I still recommend watching it because it is an entertaining movie with some good special effects. If you are a fan of Crickons novel, you will like this movie even if you have already seen it.  Review written by: Sean K.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________ If you don't like a movie, then don't watch it. It's that simple. However, if you do like a bad, or even just mediocre movie, you might want to give it a chance. Just be aware that the movie might suck, and if it does, you should at least give it some decent feedback. The only bad movie I ever saw was, ironically, a bad comic book movie, the last one, Batman Forever. It was really good though, and it might have been even better if they had just made the movie a trilogy. I actually loved the movie, and I think if they hadn't made it a trilogy, it would have turned out much better. However I also think it is very likely that they could have made a better movie with more time and money, so I don't blame them for trying to do something new and different. However the movie didn't really work for me, and maybe if I had more time to really think about it, I might like it a bit better. If you like action movies, or really bad comic books, then you will probably like it. If not, then I wouldn't recommend it, unless you are an avid comic book fan.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________  A film that has to be seen to be believed. The way this movie has been shot is nothing short of spectacular. The cinematography is top notch. The actors all look great in this film. The soundtrack is really good too. This movie will not disappoint you. _______________________________________  This is a true story of two women that have been together for almost forty years. One of them, a beautiful, older woman, was so deeply in love with her husband that she could not see him without his approval. Her daughter was also in love, but she was far more interested in the world of the movies. One day, when her husband was away on a business trip, the wife left her daughter alone with her son. When the son saw his mother, he was deeply upset. He began to cry and began to tell his mother about how he was lonely and sad and needed her. He said that he was afraid to leave his room because he was so ashamed and ashamed of himself. His mother became enraged and told her daughter to go back and stay with him. When she returned, she found her husband gone and his daughter dead. Her husband then confessed that he had killed his daughter. He then killed himself and the daughter. The story was based on a true incident. _________________________________________________________________  There is a story in this movie that I would like to know. It is about a young woman that is going through her teenage years. She goes through a very dark time and eventually ends up in a mental hospital. She is not able to cope with the situation and she ends up committing suicide. It has a very strange ending. I was thinking about this story for some time and now I have a theory as to what happened. I think it is possible that her husband knew something about her that was going to happen. He may have had a history with her and possibly had something to do with it. He could have been aware of her depression and depression may have been a catalyst. Maybe she was depressed because of him. The only problem is that she was not depressed for a very long time. She just ended up killing herself. It makes no sense and it is a mystery to me. __________________  I am a huge fan of this film and would like you to know that I am.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* It was one of those movies that I had to see. I loved the first movie, and I was looking forward to seeing this one, so I was really excited to see it. It was an OK movie. It wasn't that great, but I guess it wasn't the worst movie I've seen in a long time. The ending was not a good idea. It seemed rushed and a little rushed. I just wish the movie would have ended a little bit sooner. The only thing that really bothered me was that it was so fast paced. It made it very difficult to follow. But that's a minor complaint. It's a very fun movie to watch, and it does have some nice effects. There is a scene where the characters were fighting in a big arena, and the movie kept cutting to a different part of the arena and then back to the characters. I guess the director thought that was going to make the movie a little more exciting. However, that scene was just a bunch of people fighting. It had nothing to do with the movie and was just distracting. I did enjoy it though.  Helpful just doesn't understand that they're in a movie. I think it's one of the biggest problems with this movie. The characters just don't seem real. It makes them look silly. There are a lot of silly parts in this movie, but it's still kind of funny. It seems like the movie was a lot longer than it was. Maybe it was the idea of making a movie that would be a half hour long and then it would be another half hour. They're just so busy in this one. It also doesn't help that the movie is only really funny when it's trying to be funny. I thought that it would have been funnier if they just kept it moving and kept adding more and more characters. This movie should have been a half an hour long. But it's too long, so it's a waste of time. I was so frustrated by this movie because of how long it took. This movie was okay. The story was okay, and some of the effects were okay. But I really don't think that it's worth seeing. It is worth seeing, but for the price, it would not be worth it.

If you don't know why you are going to watch this movie: It is a tale of revenge and redemption, of a man who has been given a second chance, of someone who was robbed of his chance. This movie was made during a time when revenge was not something we saw in movies, because it was too extreme. In order to avoid censorship it was made to be a PG-13. This movie is full of violence, so I'd warn you. It is not an easy movie to watch. . - It is based on a book, so there are some similarities in this movie. I hope you like it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. _________  "It was a very good movie, but not so good for me. I have a problem with people who say: "I wish it was better!" because that is their own way of avoiding their own personal problem. It's not about the movie. I am saying that the film itself is not good. There were many scenes that I don't like to see and that is not the fault of the director. The acting was not that good, not even a little bit. The scene in which a girl, who's a bad-mouthing and mocking person, and that's why I think the movie is so good, is not that well acted either. The girl in the movie, who is a bad, bad girl, I don`t like her. I like a good girl. But I am talking about the character and the director is not responsible for that. I don´t blame him because there are many directors who are good and bad. But when you see this kind of movie, then the director cannot be blamed." (Interview with Mihailos Sizas on Korydia)  It is a shame that this movie is never made in America. And even if it was, it would be an absolute travesty, because it would have been so different. The movie was so different from the other "Star Wars" films that I could see a whole new audience for it. I know a lot of people are against the prequels, but that is like the death of the original trilogy. If it was made today, I am sure it would sell very well.  I really wanted to like this movie. It is a great example of how not to make a movie, because everything that makes it so good is not in the film. If they would have cut out all the nonsense and just made the movie about a kid in the Star Wars universe, that would have made it great. The script is so bad that the only way to make it good is to do a good edit. It would be a much better movie. , from a review by Mihalis Sizis, on the movie website, was in favor of the film: "This movie, is just fantastic. It had a lot to offer and I think that many people will be pleased. A great adventure movie. There was a lot in it and I loved it."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* I was so excited to see the movie but it turned out to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I am a little disappointed as I have seen the movie before in the theaters. It was the same director and same actors who are always good in all the movies I saw it. It is a very bad movie. I think they had to cut a lot of scenes and the acting is terrible. I thought they could have had some fun with this movie but instead they just made it a bad film. I guess they want to sell more tickets to the theaters and it is all about the money. It will probably not be a hit at the box office but it is not worth a good time. I hope you do not waste your time on this film. This is the only thing I have to say about this movie. - August 19, 2008A bad movie  Reviewer: Kateri - favorite favorite favorite - April 29, 2008  Subject: Awful, Awful I was hoping to see a good movie. This movie is awful. The movie starts off good and it starts off with some pretty great music. Then we start to see scenes that were edited to be more embarrassing and more disturbing than they should have been. The plot is a total joke. And this is a movie made in 2004.   I was a fan of this movie before I saw the cut scenes. I remember that in the first scene the guy who is supposed to be the villain gets up on stage and does a dance that was supposed to look like he was having sex. I was like "no, he's not". The acting is horrible. The guy with the blacked out eyes just stands there and stares at the camera like he doesn't know what is happening.   of course the next scene he does a weird dance and says the same thing he did the first time. The other guy with his eyes covered in black was just standing there and looking confused.  ,I would not recommend this movie for the faint of heart. The acting was awful, and it made me want to throw up. - April 30, 2008Awful,awful

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What happened to the director of "The Crow" (2007)? He has gone and done a lot of movies in which he made no money. He even made "The Sixth Sense" (1999) for free. But "The Mummy" (2017) was his first big budget movie. He got $90 million to make this movie. I am sorry that he has lost his passion and is not working. He has not been able to make good movies for a long time. He is also not doing good movies. I hope he can recover. And I hope the director is making good movies again. - January 20, 2017An old film with a new face?  Reviewer: Taz - favorite favorite favorite - January 14, 2017  Subject: A fun time in Egypt If you want to go back to Egypt and have fun with a bunch of Egyptian tourists, then this is the film for you. The costumes are pretty cool, the sound is decent, and the music is catchy and fun.   The movie starts off a little slow, but as the movie progresses it picks up a lot and starts to become more entertaining. The film has a great villain (in my opinion), and it's pretty cool that the mummy has a voice.  , and that's pretty much it. The acting is very good and the cinematography is pretty great. The actors are great, the scenes are well acted, and there's a nice little ending. Overall this is a fun time, and if you are a fan of the movies, or if you just enjoy a nice time with Egyptian tourists and Egyptian movie fans then I would highly recommend this film. - December 13, 2016A fun time  Thank you for your feedback. We are sorry to hear that you were not pleased with the film. We always appreciate your feedback and will try to make it better.

It's a good movie but not worth the time it takes to watch.  This movie has everything it needs to be a hit. It has great music, the girls are attractive, the script is good and the story is fun. .  I'd love to know why the director had to add more scenes to this movie and what he thought was going to be the outcome of this movie. - This movie will definitely get your attention, it's going to keep you watching for the entire 2 hours and 20 minutes. 's  A great movie, but...  It's a great movie. But, it doesn't do what it needs too. For starters, there's a lot of pointless, silly and unnecessary scenes in this movie that I'm not even going to mention. It should have been split up into two movies. Also, if it had been split into two, it would have been even more fun.

The movie was based on a play, written by Stephen Sondheim and based on his play of the same name, which was based upon the play "The Little Foxes" by George Bernard Shaw. This movie was directed by Martin Scorsese and starred Robert De Niro, who was also the star in this film. In the movie, a married man (played by Robert DeNiro) moves to the suburbs to start a family with his wife (played in the movie by Barbara Stanwyck). Unfortunately, the couple has two kids (played here by DeNair's sons) that have a nasty habit of running away from home and then getting involved in criminal activity. DeNino's character (played Robert DeMarco) is very abusive towards his children, who then turn to crime themselves. This is a very depressing movie and if you haven't seen it, then this may be one of those movies you'll never see again. It was very successful at the box office at the beginning, but by the end, it's hard to see how this movie was any good. The ending is very unsatisfactory. This one was also remade in 1993 with a better ending, but that was not very good either. This was one of Scorsio's better films, and if it had been given a

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________________   I was expecting something good from this movie but instead, it's a very boring, uneventful, generic and lame movie. I've seen a few other movies that are a lot more entertaining than this. It has a very bad acting performance from Sam Jackson (and I know he's a great actor, I just feel he's not suited to the role), and a very cheesy story. This movie should be called "Pregnant". The first 15 minutes are pretty much boring, you see a bunch of people who look like they've been hit by a truck. Then they have to carry their baby, and you get a few more boring scenes. This is why the movie is called "Preggers", because the first part is a lot of "just follow this guy", "just carry this baby", "the guy is such a good guy" and "there's no way this guy can lose" type of movies. Then, it goes into the preggers part where they are still getting pregnant, and the actors were pretty much there for the scene that they were in. I was so annoyed, I was just watching the movie for the sake of being bored. And then there was a bit where a woman comes in to see how her baby is doing and she doesn't know who the father is. But the movie ends before we get to see that. The movie really has a lot to do with Sam Jackson, and if you think that he's too good to be in this movie, I don't know why you watched this. I don' remember seeing Sam Jackson in another movie before, and it was about a guy who is in love with a girl, so it doesn't seem right.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________________________________________________________________ The film is basically a series of flashbacks, each a different story, which we follow as a child, through our adult lives. The main story is that of a young boy named Alex (Matthew McConaughey), who discovers a secret about his past: he's an alien who was abducted by a race of aliens and raised in a small town. Alex has been sent to the village of Ocala, where he learns that the aliens have a problem with a group of local teenagers who are "alien spies." Alex is the only one who can help them. However, he's not the only person on their side: his alien friend, who he was born with, is also there, and he wants to use Alex to get revenge on the aliens. The film itself is pretty simple, though it tries to get a bit deeper as it goes along. It's also pretty predictable, as Alex goes on and on about how much he hates aliens, and the aliens never seem to be able to understand why they should be afraid of him. They are a very simple race, and this movie doesn't really offer much to them, other than the alien spy character. _____________________________________________________________________________ 8/10 I was really excited about this movie, and I think it turned out to be a really good movie. The special effects were decent, the acting was good, the music was great, and there were some really cool special effects. The movie was well-shot, the actors were great, the cinematography was great and the editing was excellent. The story was simple, and it was well paced, which was a bit disappointing. I was very disappointed with the way the ending was, as it was a very clichéd way to end a movie, in my opinion. ______________________________________________________ Watch this movie! It's a good movie!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. _________. _____. _______. _________________. I know it's easy to criticize a movie, but the movie is just bad and it doesn't get any better. I had a really hard time watching this movie because I kept thinking about the fact that this movie is based on the book, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, by Sergio Leone. The book is a great read, it's full of amazing characters and the action scenes are awesome. The movie has the same story, it just doesn't live up to the book. The only reason this movie isn't a total waste of time is because of how awesome Sergio Leone is. He's not one of the best action stars in history, but he is still one of my favorites and he does a great job with this movie. The acting was great and they even made it in 3D, which was pretty cool. I really hope the movie gets a Blu Ray release, because it's a real shame it's only available on DVD. Overall, I give this movie a C.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. It's not a negative at all. This movie is a masterpiece, a true classic. It is so good that the film is actually more popular than the author, and he is even considered a master by the Japanese. The reason I mention this is that in Japan, when you are trying to read a book that is so hard to read, they put the word "masterpiece" in front of the word that means "bad". This movie has that quality, but the story is so well done, it makes it seem that the movie was made by the same writer. I love the Japanese and they love Japanese movies. The story is great, it has a lot of twists and turns, but it's not as if the movie is really a mystery. I think the reason why this movie is so popular is because of how good the story of this movie really is. This is not a simple story, there are many hidden parts, some good and some bad. I have not seen a movie that made me cry like this. I don't know if you're watching this for the story or for the emotional impact, but I think it's more of the emotional effect. The best part about this movie, is that the story can be really scary at times. The characters are so believable and you feel like you're in their shoes, but there is no time to think about what they're feeling, just watch what happens. The ending is also a great way to close out the movie. It also leaves you with a great feeling, and I love that. The music is really great and makes the movie feel like a movie, not just a story. I highly recommend this movie. I know that it may be hard to watch this movie now, but when you've finished it, you'll be glad you did.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________. I was at the screening and was excited about the film, but I left disappointed by the script. I don't know how it ended up this way. The movie was fun for a bit and the action scenes were great, but as soon as the film went into slow-motion and the film didn't go on with the characters, it became a joke. I thought it was kind of lame that the hero was a big fat guy, but they made up a backstory for him that was so lame it's laughable. When the villain shows up and they have a conversation, you wonder if it was a one-scene gag or if they had a real relationship. The villain's motivations were so lame that I couldn't help but laugh at him. I think it's a shame that they had to give the movie a PG-13 rating, because it was more than enough to make it an R. I felt like I was watching a comedy, but a bad one at that. ______________. The bad reviews are coming from the movie itself. _______. I have to give it a thumbs-down because it is just not good. _______________________. This movie should have been called "B.I.G. and the Gang Finds a New Life." The movie's tagline is so funny because they don't even make sense. ___________________________. I gave this movie a negative because I thought the plot was lame. It felt like it was made by someone who watched some "Bad Boys" and some "Rocky III." _________________. If you're going to do a movie based on the characters of the movie "The Mummy," you better make sure that the actors are well trained. ______________________________________. If anyone wants to know more about the movie, check out the book by Kevin Reynolds called "The Curse of the Mummy" or watch this video by Kevin "The Kid" Reynolds.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  -Gus - October 12, 2014-  Reviewer: michielmiller - favorite favorite favorite - October 2, 2014  Subject: Too many things to say   As an old-timer who has seen many movies and attended many conventions, this movie just doesn't work for me.   First of all, I'm a huge fan of the original, so it's a little disheartening to see how many things about this new version I find wanting. I guess the most obvious thing is that the music is terrible. The original is just gorgeous. But this version has a completely different sound, which I can only describe as being a mix of the two original tracks, which sounds very amateurish. The voice-acting is also completely different, with the voices of the other characters sounding like they've been recorded through a $500 ear-mold.   a lot of people have mentioned that the movie is too much like a kids movie and I'm totally not going to argue. I love the original. But I can't help but think that the new version has more in common with a '90s-era Disney movie. I can also see that the plot is much less engaging than the original and the movie feels very rushed. I know I could be wrong about all this. I'm sure that this will be another case of people "loving" it, but ultimately hating it.   in the end, I just don't see why people would want to watch a movie like this. If the only reason you watched it was because you heard about it, I really don't think you're missing out. - October 02, 2014Too many things  Thank you for the kind words.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________  I was expecting a movie to be funny, but what I got was really depressing, and I didn't like that. The plot was so bad I don't even want to watch it again. I am going to write my review in Italian because I don´t want my english to be bad. I hope I can explain better.   A man named Antonio is trying to make a fortune in his job as a lawyer. Unfortunately he gets caught cheating on his wife, and is sentenced to prison. The only thing he has to do is to convince his cellmate that he is innocent and that he should be let out. Unfortunately, this person is a notorious gangster, and the first thing he tells him is that he can have Antonio for himself. He then gives him an important task to do: get the money of a woman named Rosina and deliver it to his father. This is going to be a tough task. He must infiltrate his cell mate's gangster group, find the money, and bring it back to the police. And since he is the only person in the prison who is not afraid of the gangs, this task is going take all his courage.  , directed by Luigi Cozzi, is about a gangster who is imprisoned in a maximum security prison for the murders of two police officers. It is a very sad movie, which I didn´t really enjoyed. There is no comedy in it, no action, no sex, no drugs, no music, nothing. It only has one thing: the character of Antonio, and that´s it. I don`t know why he is so hated by the other inmates. I guess he is too tough, too honest and too loyal. He doesn´t have a girlfriend, and he has no family, but his cell mates still despise him because he has killed two policemen. He is not the only one, because there are three others who have killed policemen in the past, but Antonio is the main target. He hates everybody, he is totally cold, but he does everything for money, for power and for revenge. He has a wife, a son, a daughter and a son-in-law, but they are all killed in a robbery, and in prison, so nobody knows who is the real Antonio. I think that the main problem of the movie is the bad acting of all the actors. They don´ t seem to know what they are doing, they don´s

If you have an issue with the movie, you can read a lot of good reviews, and if you do not, then you might be a "douche". But this movie is NOT for kids. _______________________________________________________________________________ I've never been a big fan of the Harry Potter series. But I do love the books, and I loved watching them when they were first published. So when I heard that they were making a movie based on the books that was based on an adaptation of the books. I was excited. It was based off the book series, so that was good, I thought. The book series is a fantasy series, but it's not like the fantasy series from Harry Potter. It's more like a fantasy version of the world of Harry Potter, so it's definitely more than just another fantasy movie. So I was pretty excited to see what would happen. I wasn't disappointed. This movie was fun, funny, exciting, and excitingly creepy. I just love this movie, it's just really fun to watch. So now I'm going to talk about the main thing that makes this movie so great. I've been a fan of horror movies since I was a kid, and so I've seen pretty much every type of horror movie, from slasher films to zombie films, but none have been as good as this movie. It has that feeling of "just don't watch this movie if you are afraid of things like vampires and werewolves". It has great characters, great monsters, great effects, and great effects. And I think that the reason it was so good is because the writer of the script, Chris Columbus, really knew what he was doing. He knows how to tell a good story. He wrote a great script, so I can't give too much away, but I just want to say that this movie was really well written. The best thing about this movie for me was the way that it was shot. I loved the way the movie was shot, the way it was edited, and the way they used sound in this movie to make it really creepy. If they would have used the music from the movies that were more like slasher movies, it would have just been a

A bad movie is one that tries to tell a story that has nothing to do with the real world. It is not about what happened to you and it is not a movie about what happens in the real-world. A bad film is one in which the story is about something completely fake. A movie about the death of a baby? A movie in which an alien is brought to earth and we are supposed to believe he is real? A film about a man who thinks he's a woman? A story about a world that is ruled by evil and in which all the characters are made to look evil? A fake story? Well, what else is there to say about that movie? Well. Let's take a look at a few examples of what I call bad movies: 1. Evil Dead (1981) 2. The Blair Witch Project (1999) 3.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ _______________________  "What's a bad film?" I have been asked that question quite a few times by my friends, coworkers and family. When I tell them that I think the film is a bad one, they usually give me a blank stare, shake their heads and walk away. I've come to the conclusion that this is a classic case of what I call "The Audience." I don't know if you remember the film that is often referred to as "The Bad Seed." This film is basically a remake of that film. If you have seen the original, then you know what I'm talking about. It was a pretty decent movie, and a great movie in my opinion. It had a really great cast that really captured the essence of the film. The only thing that really makes this film a "bad film" is the fact that it was made in 1974. I can't imagine what this film would be like today. That being said, this film was an epic, action packed and very memorable film. It is definitely worth a watch. The acting in this film is awesome. If anyone wants to see the film for themselves, then go watch it. It's a must watch for any film buff. It should be on any movie buff's list of "Must Watch Films".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The main character, a man who was shot by his father, is left to die in the hospital with no idea of what he has been through. He meets a woman who is a nurse, who takes him in and makes him a new life." (from the book) I really do hope that the writer got this right. I guess the best way to describe it would be a movie that has no plot, and the characters are just left to their own devices.  This is the kind of movie I would like to watch if I got the chance. The movie starts off with a very strange scene. Â I was in the middle of a conversation, and this man, who I didn't know was in my hospital, came in.    He was talking about his son, and how he was a good boy, and that he was very happy to see his dad again.  When he was asked about the incident, he just said that he had a gun pointed at him, and shot his father.  Then I realized that the hospital had cameras everywhere, so they could take pictures of everyone.  The next scene shows him sitting in a hospital room, and his mother, who is obviously trying to help him, sitting next to him.  But then we see a strange scene, as the camera is turned to a very close up on his face, and he is looking straight at us.  I was thinking "what the hell is this man thinking?  Is he trying to see how far we will go to help this man?"  I felt sorry for this man.  He has been left alone in a dark room for days, with nothing to do but try to survive.  We then see him going to the bathroom, and while he is taking a dump, a nurse comes in. She looks down on him, makes a comment about how he looks like he has lost his mind, and goes back out.  Now we see him being given some medication, and then the camera goes back to him standing in the dark room.    I know that it is a movie, but it still got me very upset.  After this he is given a bath, and is sent back to the room. After he has a few minutes he begins to speak, and says " I didn´t do anything wrong.  There was no reason for my dad to shoot me.  "   After the nurse leaves, we hear a noise,

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  -A young girl who was in a car crash.  This is the worst film i've seen so far, it is a story about a young girl in a tragic car crash that killed her father and stepmother. This film has so many problems that i have to give it one star. First of all this film is horrible, it makes me feel sick. It shows a young woman who was very young in a bad accident that killed two other people. The girl and her father are on the way to a funeral when the accident happens, then she sees a man who she believes is her father. She thinks that he is a nice person. When they arrive at the funeral, she finds out that she is mistaken, but she wants to keep him alive, and she starts to fight with the other mourners over this. She tries to kill him, but he escapes. She finds out the next day that she and her stepmother were killed. It was very strange, but it made me sick. The movie ends with a very bad twist, and this makes it even more horrible. This movie is so bad it makes my stomach turn. This is a horrible film, and i hate it, it's so bad that i would not recommend it to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I have ever seen.  It is a movie where everyone in the cast are terrible. Â I thought it was a terrible movie that is really only about the two main characters.   The other characters in the movie are awful.  My favorite characters in this movie were the three people in the garage.  I thought they were all terrible.   The story is a terrible one and the characters were awful.    I am just giving a 1 star because it was only a movie about two people.    It is a great movie though.  It was my favorite.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________   I went to see "Pete's Dragon" with my girlfriend. It was the first time I had seen the film. She was in it, and had a great time. I loved the movie. I saw it on a Wednesday afternoon, just before lunch, and was told to come right after lunch. The theater was pretty small, but we got a great view of the movie and the people watching. The movie was good. The actors were great. I thought it was great that the director and producers worked together on the movie, instead of going with a bunch of big names to save a few bucks. It's a good movie, with a good story.   The film is set in a small town, in which people are going crazy and killing each other. It begins in a bar, where Pete's parents are trying to get some sleep. The people watching are watching, too. The guy in the bar is having a really good time. He has a girl that he's dating, and they're both enjoying their time together. She comes in and says that she wants to leave with him. Pete's father tells her that he wants to talk to her, and the two get into a fight, and Pete's dad leaves. Pete leaves his parents, and his parents are killed. Pete runs out and looks for his dad, but his dad is gone, and he is in a world of his own. He's got a dragon, and it's taking over the town. He needs to find the man who killed his parents to take over the dragon.   is set up very well. You have a lot of action in this movie. It has lots of fights, and there are some really interesting scenes. The director and producer worked together to get a good cast. They cast great people. I liked that the movie had a good plot.  . I really liked the movie! It's got action, and lots of laughs. The story is good. I think it's good that the story is told in this way, instead it being told in a lot more action-filled way. It made it a lot better. I'm glad that the directors and producers are putting a lot into this movie, so that it has a good storyline, and a good ending. I like that it's not the typical fantasy movie.   a very good movie. My girlfriend and I really enjoyed the movie   It was okay. I guess. I don't
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109542/ Reviewed by: Matt Kaller, 7/6/2003 4.4/5 stars   For a horror movie, "The Devil's Candy" is a pretty good one. It has its share of creepy moments and scares, and is a good bit of action too. The story is good enough and is definitely worth a watch. The acting is good and is what you expect from the late 80's and early 90's. I found the story to be a bit too long though. The movie could have been shorter but I felt it would have made the movie worse. It's a shame that it's such a short movie as the ending could have had more impact.   Overall, a good movie with some good moments. Not one I'd recommend for fans of "Friday the 13th" or even "The Evil Dead". But, for fans or people who like a good, old fashioned, horror flick that's not overly long, "Devil's Candy' is a fun little romp.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.  Read more about the negative reviews of "Blackhat" below. -  "I'm so disappointed that a movie this bad will get any kind of release." -  - - - - "Blackhat is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. It's so bad, that you can only call it a'movie' because there's no story, no characters and no plot. The actors were awful and they all look like a bunch of retarded teenagers. I mean, there was a time when the actors in this movie were in school plays, not the biggest hits. The film was so bad that even though I saw it on a screen at a screening, I couldn't believe it. I was sickened to my stomach." - - "Black hat" is a horrible, mindless, and boring movie. It is not a movie to watch for entertainment, but to see how the bad movies get made in Hollywood. In my opinion, Black hat is a direct result of the movie "The Departed" (2004) which was based on the book "The Da Vinci Code" (2007). In the movie, an actor named Robert De Niro played a "CIA agent" named Jack Ryan who got involved with an international terrorism ring called the "Black Hat Group" which involved some of the most famous people in the world like the Pope, the Prime Minister of Japan, a billionaire who made his fortune through gambling, and the leader of a terrorist organization. The movie was so poorly written that it made you laugh so hard you would vomit, even though the movie was made in a studio in Hollywood and the director was a very successful Hollywood actor who made movies like "A Few Good Men" and "Tootsie". It also has a soundtrack which is full of cheesy music and cheesy actors. I guess the producers of the "A few good men" and the "T-1000" movie were inspired by this movie when they made their own version of the same thing. It seems that there's a movie every month, that is based on a book or a movie. And every time it gets worse. I have never seen a movie so bad. I can only say, "Get out of my house, don't go see this movie!"  You may also like:

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. __________. _______________________. __________________________________________________.  I'll do it now, since I've just finished a movie about a killer. This movie is a masterpiece. I just finished the movie about an extremely sick guy. He is a sociopathic psychopath who killed 5 people, one in cold blood. He has no remorse, and I believe he was the only killer who wasn't driven by a twisted obsession. He was simply a sadistic maniac. He even admits it. I won't give too much away because it would spoil the movie. I'm sure the people who liked the movie will be happy with this review, but if you don't like it, I don't know what to tell you. The movie doesn't give away too much. He tells you all about the murders, and you don a few details, but you never know what you are missing. The way they show it is very graphic. The camera stays on the murderer all the time. They don't give you much time to think about the crime, but instead focus on him and the murders. You have to watch this movie in a way that you become part of the story. The ending is very shocking, and it makes you realize that there are people in the world who will take what they want. As I said, it's a very hard movie to review. You really don't want to know how it ends, but I can't tell you that it's good. It's a masterpiece, but the way it was done was really off putting. I don' t know if you can call it a horror movie. The acting isn't very good, and the writing is very bad. It doesn't take much to ruin a good movie, so I really don' re recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________  My boyfriend and I went to the theater for a romantic date night. We got to the movie and the movie started and was slow, which was not what we expected. I asked if there was any action, and I was told there was, and there was a lot of it. We left, and it was clear that this was going to be an epic action movie, as there was so much blood and gore and explosions. I felt that it would be more of a "serious" movie than it is. It was really hard to sit through, and the story line was not very interesting. When the end credits started, the movie played, and when the credits came up, I couldn't even tell what happened because it was all so bloody. I left and walked out. It is a good movie, but I felt it was a waste of time and I could not stand it.

This is not one of the best movies to come out of the 70's and it's a shame to have such a great movie be so terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a real challenge to give a negative rating on a bad film. I think I've mentioned this before. But with a movie like this, I'm not sure what you can say about it other than it is a bad version of a great story. If you've ever read " The Chronicles of Narnia," it is essentially a story of the end of a world. Narnians were in the middle of a civil war and the last remnants of their society were trying to escape to the world of Oz where they had a kingdom and a king. The story starts in the Narnian desert where a girl named Lucy lives. Lucy has two brothers, Narnie and Maturin. She has never been to Oz and she's terrified of leaving her home. She wants to stay and make sure Narnon can come back. But her mother, Nantunia, is terrified and wants her to come back to Narnias with her. They are a tight family and it doesn't take long before Lucy is getting ready to run away with her brothers and escape. Nantnonia knows the story of Oz and believes that if Lucy can make it to Oz she will be a hero. Her friends are very concerned about her. Nance (a princess) and Cuthbert (a giant) go with Lucy to Oz. They see the way Lucy is growing and they think she has what it takes to be a great hero. Unfortunately, Lucy doesn't make it past the first stage of her journey to Oz (or to be honest, she makes it through half of the movie). She falls down a hole and she can't get up again. Nancy (Nantnony's older sister) goes in search of Lucy and comes back with her dead body. The Narnyans don't know how she died. They believe that she was eaten by a creature and that the creature must be destroyed in order for Lucy to come out of the hole. They find a magical sword that is capable of killing any creature and it's time for Nantony and Cuubert to leave Oz. Narmy and Cuddbert stay behind. Nanny's mother, Lulu, is in charge of the Nanny Club where they have their special time together. They live together and have a lot of fun. Narynnie, Nanny Narns's cousin, and her husband, Fred, have their own home. They have their babies

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ "I saw this movie on TV and was shocked when it ended. I don't think I'll ever watch a horror movie like this again. It was horrible. The acting was horrible and there were just too many people dying at the end. I didn't feel any fear or horror at all, just relief. It made me feel like I was in a bad nightmare and it made me angry at the horror movies for making me feel that way. The ending of the movie was terrible. There was a whole section where a few of the girls were lying on the ground with a zombie just about to attack them. I found it disgusting and it was the worst part of the whole movie. The last two scenes were very strange too. There were a couple of guys running up and down a hallway trying to find a way out. It just felt like something out of a horror film and I didn' t understand what was happening. There are several scenes where the camera is moving fast and you don't see what's going on. I think the director of this movie should be fired. I really liked it, but I wouldn't recommend it. _________________________  About the Author: David W.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________  The film follows a group of young girls in the suburbs who go to a special summer camp, but one girl, named Katie, gets separated from the group. Katie is a "possessed" child. The group goes looking for her and discover she has been abducted by a man, but they do not know that he is not human. This film was directed by Tom Holland and stars Cate Blanchett, Jessica Chastain, Michael Stuhlbarg, Haley Bennett, and Olivia Williams. I would recommend this movie for the horror, it's got a really creepy atmosphere and a very interesting story, but it is very dated. The actors are all great, but the movie is so dated, and has the same feel and feel to it. The plot is not that interesting, and you have to watch the movie twice. It's a very old movie, and that's what makes it a lot more interesting than it should be.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  That doesn't exist, no one has ever thought about it. It's an article about a movie, not a movie.  I'm sure there are some people out there that have seen a movie that was terrible, and they might have an opinion about it, but they aren't talking about a film that is being discussed in a movie review. ____________________ My Review  -  4 out of 10 This movie has the potential to be great.  It's a movie about a group of friends who are having a bad time of it.  The story isn't bad, and it's funny and entertaining.   The acting is good.  However, it has a lot of problems.  First, the script is bad.  There's a lot that goes on in this movie, and a lot is left unexplained.  Also, it's very cliche at times.  What do you expect from a movie where everyone thinks the other guy is gay?   Second, there's a scene where one of the guys is taking a piss, and he's getting pissed all over the place.  You'd think they'd cut that scene.  Third, it starts off with a bad rape joke.  Fourth, there is a scene that's supposed to be funny but really isn't.  Fifth, there are two people that seem to be trying to pass off as two people.  Sixth, there isn't really a plot.  Seventh, the movie makes no effort to make the plot interesting.  Eighth, the actors are just playing their roles.  Ninth, the story seems very generic.  Tenth, there seems to be a lot more dialogue than in a normal movie. I don't think any of these problems are really a problem in the movie, but the movie does seem like it was put together hastily.  I would like to see the movie again.  But if you want to see a movie with a good plot, a good acting, and great comedy, this movie is not for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________.  If I could change anything about the movie I would have given it a 4, instead of a 3. The movie is not that bad. I thought the movie was very well done, but there was a bit of a problem. The characters in this movie were not believable at all. The people who played them were either too stupid to be believable or they were just not that good actors. I think I know the answer to this one, they are just too stupid. If I ever met them I would tell them to get a real job and quit their acting career. And if I ever have children I will tell them not to be so stupid. The film's main character, a man named Frank (Holt McCallany) goes to prison for a crime he did not commit. The man who sentenced Frank to prison, named Mr. Stone (Gary Sinise) has also been convicted of a crime. Frank and Mr.Stone have a complicated relationship. He is Frank's former partner who is now the sheriff in this town and he has a strong hatred for Frank. The sheriff is a man who is only out to protect his town and Frank is his prey. The relationship between Frank and the sheriff is what makes this movie interesting. The main problem with the film is that it doesn't follow the book at all, and I think this is a mistake. The book was written by Robert Ludlum, who has also written other good books. If this film had been written by a writer who was more familiar with the book and the characters, it might have been better. This movie was great, but it could have been a lot better. I am very disappointed.

This one was pretty bad. The acting was pretty uninspired and I was never fully invested in the characters. It was like watching a lot of bad TV."  -A.  ___________________________________________  The first time I watched the movie, I thought it was about a girl that wanted to kill herself. I felt so sad and so sad that I couldn't finish the movie. I had to see it again to be sure. I think that the reason I was so affected by this movie was because of the characters I watched in it. I thought they were pretty stupid and annoying. I also thought that the movie was full of clichés. I mean, I saw it once and I still thought it sucked!  I liked this movie. It didn't blow me away like some other movies have. It is not a bad film but I did not feel like I could give it a positive review.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ This is a film that does not make me want to watch the other movies in the series. I know that the series has a lot of great scenes, but this film does not. It is not bad but it is not great. It does not hold up to the other films. The music and story lines are just not there. I have a feeling that this movie is just filler for the fans of the series who want to see the characters in action. There is nothing to see here, just a series of explosions, bad acting and bad acting. The only thing good about this film is that it is about a little boy who wants to become a real knight. I am not sure what kind of boy he is but I do not like it. It seems that he was supposed to be the main character but that does make it even worse. The film is over in about two minutes and I wish they could have had a little more to say about the plot. The ending is just horrible and the whole film is just a waste of time. I give this movie a C-. It is just not worth watching. If you like action and you want a little knight in armor then watch this movie. Otherwise, don't bother. I would have given this a B-.

They all have a scary story to tell and decide to film it. A strange creature comes out of the woods and goes straight for one of the kids, knocking him out. As he's unconscious, the monster starts eating his face. The group is now convinced that they must hide somewhere until the creature is defeated. The next day the kids are playing hide and seek. One of them comes across a huge boulder. They decide to hide under it and wait for the monster to leave. While waiting for it to leave they have a terrible fight. After a while the boulder collapses and they run into the woods. As they are running, they find a little girl in a tree. She's covered in berries and has a big stick in her hand. They are about to run away from the monster but are stopped by a big tree. As the kids look up, a huge creature appears. It grabs the little girl and chases the others away. The creature then proceeds to eat one of them and then starts eating another. The others decide that they have to find a way to defeat the monster. They find a big rock and start smashing it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This movie was bad. It was so bad that I was afraid I might not like it. I knew I would like it if I saw it in the theater, and I did, because I wanted to see the trailer. The movie was a bit of a mess from start to finish. The characters were a bit one-dimensional. I really didn't like any of them. The script was not good, and some of the scenes were really cheesy. I was disappointed that I had to watch this movie. It is not worth the time or money to watch. If you have not seen this movie, I recommend you to go to the theater and watch it. It's a movie that you could enjoy for 10 minutes, but you will not get the full experience from it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ The most memorable line from this movie is "It is not like a bird in the hand, is it?" I am sure that this was not the first time they tried to get people talking about this movie, but I doubt they could have done it any better. They even had to invent a new phrase to describe it, "the worst movie in the world" or something like that. The first time I saw this movie I was so excited to see the trailer that I went out to the mall and found it on video cassette. It was my favorite movie when I was a kid, and I remember the feeling of wanting to go to the theater to see it. I was about 10 or 11 at the time, and it looked like a really good movie. I watched the trailer for hours on end, but there were a few scenes that I could not get through. I think it is because I was too young to get it, and then I was just too tired to go again. The main character in this movie was so boring and stupid. The rest of the cast was even worse. I had a hard time believing that they had the same voice actors as in the other movies that I loved so much. This movie did not deserve to be in the movie theaters in the first place. It has nothing to do with the movies that this movie supposedly influenced. I really don't think that this is a good movie, and if it was the main character was a bit better. I wish I had never seen this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I would have rather spent my time watching a show with a cast of characters I would like. It is sad. I do not understand why the author was able to write a good plot with the actors he had. It was all wrong. The plot was boring and boring. It made no sense and I don't get what is going on. I understand the movie was about an alien who wants to come to Earth and kill us, but I really do not see how he could have come here to kill the entire planet. We are told that the aliens have the ability to control time, but they don't seem to have done this. If they could control time they would have killed us all a long time ago. The whole story was a complete joke and the actors are just not very good at all. I mean look at the actors in this movie. I think it is really funny to see a man in a trench coat holding a gun and pretending to shoot people. He is a total joke and is just a terrible actor. The other actors just looked terrible. I was laughing so hard at this movie, but it was not funny. The only actors that were funny were the women, who are really not very attractive. They were a lot of fun to watch though. The writing was bad. The story was terrible. The actors are not good. The characters were so boring and they did not have any development at all, which is one of the worst things in a movie. This is one bad movie. I give this movie 2 stars because it was a good laugh and I would still watch it if I was invited to a party.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  "I thought it was terrible. I'm glad they finally got it out."  - The Guardian  In 2009, the National Film Preservation Board released the final film footage from the production of The Lost Boys (1991). The final cut of the film, which was shot in Australia in 1989 and 1990, was the longest production that Disney had ever put on.  This was a huge gamble for the filmmakers, who had been working with a large crew on a limited budget to bring back their favorite children's characters from the past and present. The original idea was for The Lost Boy to be a four-hour film, but the film had to be cut down after it became clear that the actors would only be able to work for three or four hours at a time. After seeing the film in theaters, the directors decided to make a feature-length cut.  is a film that was in development for over three years. It had to have been a very difficult movie to film and to be released on the big screen in 2009. The film is a retelling of the classic fairy tale, about a little boy who goes on an adventure to save his sister from a curse and become a hero. Disney knew that the film would never be as successful as The Little Mermaid, but they hoped to create a new fairy tale that had never been told on the screen before. , which has become a cult classic, is a remake of the 1960 film, and the director of the original, Peter Pan, is the one that directed The Lost Brothers. In The Lost Brother, a small town boy becomes the hero of the town when he becomes the guardian of a little girl named Lillie. The two get married, and after they have a son, Lilliel, the townspeople start to look to Lillibelle for answers about the curse. But as Lilliam continues his journey, he finds out that he is not as innocent as he appears to be. He is, in fact, cursed and his journey will take him across many countries and continents. The movie was filmed in Australia. The actors were flown in from the United States and from across Europe to work with a small crew. Disney did not want to be known as a studio that just made fairy tales. They wanted to be seen as a creative studio that could make anything. The film was supposed to be the first film to be screened at the new Disney theme park in Shanghai.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________   [SPOILER ALERT]   "Sucker Punch" (2007)   This movie is a big waste of time and a big disappointment. I'm a fan of a few of these directors, like Wes Craven and John Carpenter, but this is the worst film by them all.   It has all the right ingredients to make a great film: a compelling plot, a well-acted story, great action, lots of great characters and some fantastic effects. However, the filmmakers made the mistake of using too many "cameo" characters that did not fit into the story at all, so it was impossible to identify with any of the characters. Some of them were clearly the product of an overly-laid plan, but they were so well-written and portrayed that they became boring and annoying as soon as the movie stopped being a thriller. The movie was more about the characters that were left in the wake of a disaster than it was about the victims. It's hard to tell which characters were the "good guys" and which ones were the real bad guys.   the movie tries to be "realistic" by showing a guy being sucked into a machine, but the movie fails to depict the actual machine itself, which would have been interesting.   it's clear that a lot of money was spent on this movie, but it is not entertaining.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ The movie is okay. It is a movie about the life of a group of women who live on the island of Puerto Rico and are in the business of prostitution. I didn't see this one coming, but it is a well made movie with a good story, and great acting. The film has a very realistic story that shows what it's like to live on an island like Puerto Rico. This movie was made on a budget of $4.00, but there are many scenes of extreme violence and blood. The movie starts out slow, but then it picks up as the plot moves. There are several scenes of rape, murder, and torture. There is a scene where a woman has a gang of men tie her up and then force her to have sex with them. She has to say no a few times, but they force her and force her with a gun. The only thing that really bothered me is that a lot of the violence in this movie is used to make the point that this is not just a Puerto Rican thing. It was made in 1970, and many of the characters are from the US. I was really surprised that they didn't use a lot more sex scenes in this film. It's not a bad film, it's just a little slow. If you're a fan of the '70s and are looking for something to watch on a lazy Sunday night, then this movie might be just what you're looking for. __________________________ Update: The movie has been removed from VHS and DVD. It can still be viewed on the internet.

Now that I have, I can't imagine having not seen it.  the story is about a Marine who is dating a girl who is a lot younger than him, but he still wants to be with her.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________   There are many films I love but don't think are worth watching. There are some films I have seen many times and enjoy, but I don't always think the same way about them. There is a lot of difference between liking a film and loving it. For example, a film is a film regardless of its quality. Some films are just plain great, and I would never consider them to be bad films. It's a matter of taste.   And I'll give you one example of a film I thought was good but ended up not being. The film is called, "A Fistful of Dollars" and it stars Clint Eastwood. I was in awe of Clint when I saw his performance in "Stagecoach." When I saw this film, I was just as awe-struck. But after watching the film a few more times, I realized it was a terrible film. It was so bad I was ashamed to be in the theater. I think it was the worst movie I've ever seen. It has the same plot as "StageCoach" but the characters are so stupid. The dialogue is the same, but the acting is worse. And the music is bad. I'm sure Clint Easton had a great time making the film. But the movie was just too bad to be good.  , a movie I enjoyed, is an excellent movie. I found it to be a wonderful and well made film. When I first saw it, I thought it was one of the best movies of all time. But I thought a few years later it was very poor. Then I saw it again and realized it had been really good. Then one day, I found a very old copy of the film and was so surprised to see the original quality of the picture. The original negatives were very clear and it was amazing to see how good it looked. I still have the original negatives and I've never seen the film the same since I saw the film when I was a little kid. When it was first released in the late 40's, it was considered one of those "lost classics." It was such a hit that the studio decided to make a sequel. And this was the second time they made a sequel to "A fistful of dollars." It's been said that the movie has a deeper meaning than what the writer intended. The sequel was so popular that they decided to do a third film. A movie I thoroughly enjoyed was, "."

The original one was alright, but it was good. This one is just as bad as the original one. I have not seen the original, but from what I have read about it, it was pretty good. It was also very good in the first movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film's main plot is that two friends, Michael and Ryan, discover that they're in love and are looking for a place to marry. But there's a problem: the only person they can talk to is the very man who's keeping them apart. The whole thing feels like a soap opera with a twist. The two men are a bit too much alike to be the same person and they spend most of the film arguing and bickering. They even seem to hate each other. They're not the real Michael and not the true Ryan, but it's the film's way of showing the audience that they really are. The script doesn't quite follow the plot line in any way, but that doesn't matter because it's not very good either. The acting is pretty bad, but the film is not a good one. It doesn't have any real tension. It's a movie that you will watch with a friend, because you won't be able to finish it. The movie also makes no sense. It starts out with two very nice guys looking for their true love. Then it goes back to the beginning, which is very odd, and it ends with a fake wedding and a couple of other pointless things. The characters are so unlikable that you won?t want to see the film again, and the actors do a poor job of acting. I'm not really a fan of movies that involve a love triangle. The story is too convoluted and the movie is too slow.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie had a bad start, when it became obvious that the film was only a sequel to an old TV show. It had a great start, however, when the film turned into a documentary about the movie. It didn't become too preachy, but did provide a good understanding of the story and the characters. It was a fun movie, but had its flaws.  2. The Godfather Part II  Directed by Francis Ford Coppola  This film is a must see. You'll love the story, the acting, and the soundtrack. I was very impressed by this film, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it as well. It has some of the best acting and a fantastic soundtrack, and is well worth the price of admission. If you're looking for a classic, you'll love this film. If your a fan of the movie, you might like it, too. ,
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________  This movie was so bad. I mean, I'm sure people will say that a movie can be so bad that it isn't even worth talking about, but this is so bad I really didn't want to talk about it. It's not that it was bad, it was just so bad it wasn't even funny. There were some really good jokes in it but it wasn a little too long for those jokes. This movie made me laugh but not in a good way. I really don't want any more movies like this, especially when I think of how many great movies they've made already.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I was a kid once.   A kid who grew up in the shadow of The Wizard of Oz, who was not allowed to watch the movie.   for those of you who don't know: this is a movie made by a movie producer (a guy named Frank Giustra), who was in a relationship with a girl from New York named Hillary Rodham. Hillary was not his first choice for a girlfriend, he was actually in a committed relationship with another girl named Dorothy Rodham (her sister) and that's why he met her.   The movie started with a bang: Dorothy and her friends (who had a band named the Good Time Boys, a very short-lived band that was pretty much the "hippie" scene in the movie) came to the U.S. and visited the house of the woman who owned the house where Dorothy and Frank lived and played at the pool. They danced to "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy" and the woman's mother came in to tell them that her daughter was going to be married. Her mother's name was Dorothy Rodham, she was also the sister of Hillary's father.  - So, we have a movie about a woman who has a boyfriend who she is very, very attracted to, but she has no idea of how to act, or what she is really attracted to. We have a girl who goes to New York and sees a house that her boyfriend has, but doesn't know that it belongs to her sister. We also have a man (the husband of Dorothy's sister) who doesn't really know that his wife is the sister-in-law of the man who he's trying to have a relationship and who is also in love with his wife, but he is also married to a woman that he's had a relationship already with.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  It was a cold November night, and the air was crisp and cold as I walked through the streets of the city. It was almost midnight when I entered a dimly lit nightclub called The Club. The club was very busy, but I didn't mind because I was there for the movie. I sat down at a table, and I noticed that the tables were scattered all over the club. The lights were on, and as I sat there, I noticed some people were dancing and talking in Spanish. I couldn't understand a word they were saying, but it seemed like the movie they were watching was a very good one. It had an amazing score, and it was one of the best movies I've seen so far. The lighting was great, and there were some great actors in it, like Steve McQueen and Paul Newman. The people in the movie were so cool and so cool-looking. The actors all looked so great, but they looked so much older than me, and so I couldn  e been in their same age group. I really liked the movie because of the plot, but my favorite part of it was when the movie ended, and they went on to the next scene. I thought it was really cool that they kept going on and on with the movie, instead of just stopping at the end. I would have liked to have seen a lot more of it. There was a lot of action in it. I just loved watching it, and then it ended. The ending was pretty awesome. I don't think I could have ever seen that movie again. The movie had a great score, the lighting was fantastic, and this movie is really great.

I will definitely be going back to see this movie.

The director does not even try to make the movie interesting. There are no action scenes. There is no tension. This is a slow and boring movie. I wish I would have seen this movie when I was younger. I guess I will never watch this movie. It was very boring. The only thing that kept me watching was the music. I could hear the music everytime they made a shot.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Don't read a review unless you have actually seen the movie. You should have read the book by then. In the novel you are in the middle of the action. There are many other books that take place during the time of the movie but the story in this book takes place before the events in the movie and is more focused on the life of the characters and what the world was like back then. I will say that I thought this book was better written than the movie because there are some very clever twists and turns that are written so well that you will not believe they are there. The story also makes a lot more sense and the ending is a lot better. This book is a must read for anyone who is a fan of the Lord of the Rings. It is the best book to read if you want to get into the world of the books and understand what went on. It will definitely make you want more of the world that Tolkien created. It has great characters, a beautiful story and is filled with many surprises. The first time I read this book I thought the author was being sarcastic about the book being written for children but as I re-read it it made more sense. There are many different ways that I can see this book being a good book. If you love the books, then this book will be for you. For the non-fans there are a lot of good points about the world and it will be a great read. Also, it will give you a new perspective on the world Tolkien created and it shows a side of it not shown in the movies. I also really enjoyed the illustrations of the book. I found it interesting that they did a very good job of showing how the culture and the people of the time looked. I was especially taken by the artwork of the artwork on the different pages. I have always been interested in history, mythology, and the world they lived in. Even if you don't love the Lord Of The Rings I would still recommend this book to you. If you are a fan then this is a good place to start.

There were no people around so I thought I would just wait it out. Then I was told the movie had already started and it started in the middle of the movie. Then the first five minutes were just a scene from the movie and then there was another five minutes where they cut out some scenes of the book and then the movie just kept going until it ended. I am so disgusted by this movie. I hope the movie does not get any awards for this horrible movie. Posted by Renea at 1:47 PM

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  If it's bad, it's so bad you don't even notice it.  This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It is a complete piece of crap. Not a single good part. It has no story. The main character, the only good one, is a loser. The entire plot is completely made up. The movie takes itself so seriously, and it comes across as if the director had to put on a fake smile to be funny. It's not funny at all. It just makes you want to vomit. The only reason it gets an "R" rating is because it is a "horror movie". It is nothing but a boring horror movie that makes no sense, and I mean that in the most positive way. The acting was horrible. The actors were so bad. It was hard to take them seriously. The one thing I didn't like was the title. It sounds like something out of a comic book, and that was the worst thing about the movie. I really wanted to give it a "C+". It was just so bad that I just couldn't stomach it. I don't recommend this movie to anyone.

I loved that movie. He was a great actor. And he still plays the guy. So great! The guy in the interview could barely talk. It's a shame he didn't live to see the film come out. I thought it was a good film. I think the whole movie could be done as a series of short films. It was such a weird movie. I mean, it was just one guy, and his wife, and a bunch of weird kids, and weird things happening to them. It wasn't a typical movie, but it still had some cool parts to it. It also made me wonder what would happen if you gave a bunch more people guns and gave them an open road. I know I've wanted to see that movie for a while.I'm happy that it came out in the 80's. It came out before the internet, and people didn't have access to much. The guy who did the interview is in his late 60's, and he has to have done a lot of traveling and acting since then. It must have been hard for him to travel back then. That's how long ago that was.It's been said before, but I just love that interview. It really captures the whole vibe of that movie, and I love the guy in it. He's so honest and real. And the way he talks about the movie is just so fascinating. I love that he's so positive about it. I wish more people would be like him.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  " I can't stand it." " It was just a complete waste of time."  I don't think you can get much more than that from a review of a film that was not even that good, but this is an exception. Rating: 1/2 (A mediocre movie that didn't even work. I had no idea what was going to happen and then it ended.  It was kind of disappointing.   The first part was just boring and the second part was boring and then the third part was really boring and I hated it.  I would never want to see a movie about people talking about their dreams.  So, that is my opinion.  The first part of this movie is really boring.  But I thought that they would add a bit more action in this movie.  If it was just about talking about the dream and what they were dreaming about it would have been better.  This movie was a complete disappointment.  It didn't have any substance or it was boring to watch.  I hope you liked it and I hope you can find something good about this movie in the future.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________________ The worst thing about this movie is that I really wanted to like it. I was really excited about this film when I heard it was a horror film and that the cast included the legendary horror icon Bruce Campbell, so it was pretty cool that I got to see this movie when it came out. I didn't really have high expectations going into it because the trailers didn't have much to get me excited. However, once the movie started I really enjoyed it. This movie is just a horror movie and it has all the right elements. The horror aspect of the movie really doesn't make much of a difference in this movie. It's just a creepy movie and I really liked it. There's a lot of action in this film, but I really don't think it's the main thing that draws me into this movie, which I think is what makes it so good. There is a lot going on in this horror movie, but it's not overbearing. The movie does a great job of telling a story and giving you a good scare, but nothing too overbearing in the movie. I really recommend this movie to people who like scary movies. It has a great cast of actors in it and they really did a great jobs of portraying the roles. I also really liked that it was an action/horror movie and not just a sci-fi movie, as I feel that sometimes sci-fis are really just horror movies that happen to take place in space.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Do you want a bad review about bad movies? ____________ It's been a long time since I've watched a movie this bad, and a long way since I was this disgusted. This is the best of the worst, a truly awful piece of entertainment. The first ten minutes of this movie were like watching a slow motion car crash. Then, all of a sudden, it dawned on me that this movie has been made by a bunch of middle-aged guys with no life experience, and they have no clue what's going on. I'm not sure how it happened, but it's the first time I've ever seen a movie that made me think "This could have been made with more care". It seems that the writer and director are completely unaware of what a comedy should be, and have decided to just make a movie where the funny part is the main character and not anything else. This movie's "story" is completely devoid of anything. It's like watching someone tell a long boring story with no action, where everyone's talking about how the main characters are the worst and they should be dead. The worst part of this is that the audience is completely unaware that this is a bad film, because they've seen it a thousand times and thought it was just like all the other bad movies they've already seen. The best part of it is that they've just given it a "fresh" title, because I'm sure they don't want people to know that it's been around for two decades. I guess it's not too late for someone to make a good movie like this one, because at least now we can all see how bad it is.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: I didn't like it at all. It was boring, and too much of a slasher movie to be a horror film. The killer was not scary at all, the killer was just a normal man with a very big knife and some other tools that he uses. It's just a generic slasher with no originality. If you like the slasher genre, you'll probably like it too. If not, you're not going to like it either. The only good thing was that the killer got his name wrong (He was named "Hans" instead of "Hannes") and that there was a nice ending. But this is a bad horror film, and you're better off not seeing it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: **********  1.1 / 5  Story: It's really interesting how this movie manages to capture a little of everything. It's a crime story, it's a drama, it can be a romance and a thriller, and it can also be a comedy and a horror. I'm sure you can think of all the genres that this movie could go in. I've watched all of them, and I love them all. However, this movie is not a horror movie. It does not have a creepy vibe or a killer vibe or an evil vibe. I thought it was pretty normal and light-hearted, and even though the movie does not do a good job at creating scares, it does not create anything too weird or too scary. It has it's moments, but it's not a movie that creates a lot of tension. I would give this movie a 7 out of 10. It was pretty fun, and at the same time I'm glad that it's been made. This movie could have been a masterpiece, but the producers wanted to make a sequel. I do think this movie was a little overrated. It wasn't that good of a movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________   A couple of years ago, a new horror movie called "The Blair Witch Project" came out. I was shocked, but not as shocked as I was when it turned out to be an awful movie. But it was a horrible movie, and I thought I had seen the worst movie of the year. It was a movie so bad, I have never seen anything that was even close to it. The plot was completely unbelievable, and the acting was so bad that I was completely in the dark about what was going on.   But I was not alone. Many people thought the movie was so awful, that it was actually scary! I was surprised to find out that many people thought it was really scary. And if you think that you will never be scared by a movie, you are wrong.   The movie was a very good movie, but it is also a really bad movie. The first 10 minutes were so good, that you forget that it is a horror movie, because the acting and the plot are so bad. But the movie quickly goes downhill, and as you start to understand what is going on, you find that it doesn't even make sense.  ....   It is really easy to see the movie as a horror. It starts out with an evil spirit that is stalking a little girl, and is trying to destroy her life. As it turns out, the little girl is a very special girl, who can see the spirit. When she goes to the woods, she sees a strange boy in a red sweater and black shoes, who is very strong, and who is trying very hard to get her to fall in love with him. He is really a good guy, but when the spirit sees him, it turns on him and starts to attack him.   a lot of people thought that it would be a good idea to make a movie out of this story. The only problem is that the movie turned out so bad it is impossible to make it scary.   and if you have seen "The Shining" (the movie that everyone loves to hate), you would probably think that it looks just like the movie, except that it has a more dark, scary, and mysterious look. The story of "The Blaww" is completely different from the movie.   the movie starts off with a kid and a woman in a forest. The little girl thinks that she is being followed by the spirit, and goes to investigate. As she
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________  _____________ would have been better without the scene with the kid  Would have been a better movie without the child actor  I would have preferred the ending with the dog instead of the dog's dad  The kid got stuck on the roof of a car  In the beginning the movie was boring, but later the ending was really nice  This movie is about an ex-con, and he gets caught stealing a car. The owner of the car has a dog that he really wants to own, but his wife says that they don't have any money, so he has to steal the car. It's an interesting movie, but it could have been great. But it wasn't. It wasn't a bad, boring movie, because it was supposed to be about a man who was caught stealing something that belonged to someone else, not about a dog.   The kids are great, and I like that they were young. The guy that stole the car is a good guy. He's got a lot of feelings about the way that he did things. The girl is very pretty, and you'd think she would be with a guy. The dog isn't a dog, and the dog didn't do anything wrong, it was just that it was on a car that belonged more to a man than to a dog!   If you want to watch this movie, I recommend it. If you like a movie that's a little bit too silly, and a little too much like a kid's movie, then I don't recommend this movie for you.  , 10/30/2004

The sound is horrible, the only thing I like about it is that the actors do not have to pretend they are talking to each other to make the movie. It is a very unoriginal movie that tries to make a point that there is no such thing as a good black man. It really makes me angry that a movie like this has a release because it was released when I was a little kid. I would never want to see it again, but if you do get a chance I would not recommend it. I also know there are other black people out there who would love this movie but it would be a waste of their time to watch it because it really makes a point to not be a good person.  …

The baby, however, has a horrible disease, and it's not going to get better. The mother, the father, and the baby are on the run from the cops.  the baby, for some reason, gets separated from the father and gets into the wrong hands. This isn't the first film by this director (he also directed the first movie of this series). This movie is not a masterpiece, but it's definitely worth seeing. It's a fast-paced movie with great characters, but I think the plot is pretty basic. I guess that's what the movie is trying to say, but the movie also has an ending, which is not too good, as well. The plot is actually quite well written, but this movie doesn't make the most of it. The movie has a lot of action, but a lot less depth. The story is good, but doesn't really reach the end. The special effects in this movie are also quite good. The CGI is very good and I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. The music is also quite nice, but again, not as good as the first one. The soundtrack is also a bit better, but not that great. I recommend this movie if you like action movies and you have a baby in the house. A quick note: I really like this movie, and I think it's one of the best action movies I've seen so far. I would recommend it if you love the first series, but don't have time to watch all the films. This movie isn't as good, and is definitely not as bad as the previous ones, but at least it's a bit different.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________. (If it wasn't a bad film, why would I say that?) I saw this in a movie theater, and was amazed by the poor production values and bad acting. The actors were terrible, the plot was pointless, and the plot didn't make any sense. A few of the dialogs and dialog lines were very cliche and cliched, which I found annoying. The film was pretty slow paced, and it never really got any better or progressed. The story is a very bad idea, and as it ends, it gets very silly. It was a good laugh, but it didn't really improve my moviegoing experience. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, and if I had to make a film criticism, it would be to watch this movie again in the theater. I'll let you know if I see any improvement.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "That was the only movie I ever saw with an alien as the main villain. " -TheMovieShopper.com This is a classic case of "You can't keep a good alien down".  A little over two decades after the original Star Wars was released, Lucas was already making a sequel, and he was already working on a concept for a third.  As we all know, he went for it with this one and it is one of the best films ever made.    This is a sequel to the original trilogy, but it does not feel like a sequel.  The story begins in a desert planet called Tatooine, which has been taken over by the ruthless gangster Jabba the Hutt, who is looking for a young slave called Luke Skywalker.  Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope opens with a group of rebels trying to steal a shipment of sensitive information from a Jawa sandcrawler.  Luke has been hired by Han Solo to help them.  He and Han meet Princess Leia, who he finds to be attractive.  Leia tells Luke that she knows he has a sister and a brother on the planet of Tatooina.  After a brief visit, the group is attacked by Jabba's goons.  The group escapes, and Luke is captured by Jafo.  However, Luke is saved when the sandcrawlers are released from Jabba.  In order to find Luke, Leia and Han are forced to go to the Mos Eisley spaceport to steal information from an Imperial droid called R2-D2.  R2 has a huge database of information about the Empire, including all of the secret Imperial weapons.  They get into an Imperial transport called a TIE fighter, and fly to Tatooin.  On Tatooini, Luke and Leia are being followed by Jawa raiders.  But they manage to outrun them.   The TIE fighters attack an Imperial Star Destroyer, and are destroyed.  This leads to Luke and his friends to search for the remaining droids.  One of the droids has a piece of the Death Star plans, but R2 is captured.  Now that Luke and company have the plans, they must find the Rebel leaders, Leia, Han, Chewie and C-3PO.  Han Solo and Chewiethe agree to join the crew, and the group heads to the planet Dag

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ******** I don't care if you have no idea what it's about. If you do, don't go in there. I have seen a few good horror movies that are better than this one. If it weren't for that, I wouldn't even be able to give it a 1 star. This is a really bad movie. The acting is horrible, the directing is terrible, and the story is stupid. I wish it was over so I could leave. I can't imagine what it would have been like if it wasn't about a girl with an unknown disease. I hope the girl dies and I wish her father would be a really smart man because I want to see him get his head handed to him.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. You can be a film critic. It just doesn't matter. The fact that the film is a complete shit doesn't mean that it was a bad film. Just that it is a bad picture. It has its moments but it isn't a great movie. If you like the original it's not like the movie is anything but a remake. There is no point to watching this movie because it doesn't do anything new. The movie doesn't make any sense. The characters are stupid. They have no personalities. It's like watching a stupid person with a mouth that doesn't move. You know what this movie does? It makes you want to see the original. It shows how a stupid people can become smarter. It proves that we are all stupid. It makes the audience think about how stupid people are and that we should look up to them. That's what it did. It made me look up.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* The film is full of good ideas and a great story but unfortunately it was all too short to be truly enjoyable. The ending felt a bit forced as if they wanted to make the film more cinematic but the story was so slow and drawn out that it felt like a slog. There were so many plot holes and continuity errors that it made it almost impossible to understand what the point of the film was. The movie was great as a sci-fi but it is very disappointing to see how they tried to shoehorn a "high octane action" film into the sci-Fi genre. I thought it would be a fun idea but unfortunately that idea was completely botched and ruined the film. - July 9, 2013A wasted opportunity  Reviewer: Dork_n_Tard - favorite favorite favorite - March 3, 2012  Subject: Bad Review?

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  "You will not find a better movie in this world." -Ralph Fiennes  I really like The Book Thief. I liked it a lot. I loved it. But I did not love it like I love the rest of his movies. I didn't love it in the way that I like The Fifth Element. I did love it because I didn' t have to wait for the end of the movie to understand what was going on. I could just sit back and relax. I was watching the movie with a little kid in my arms and he kept saying, "Daddy, it's too bad we can't see more of the book. We would have loved it."  In the end I don't think that I hated the movie because I did, I loved The Book. The Book is not a good movie. It is a great movie, but it is not The Book as it should have been.  It is The Book of a guy that is going to make a fortune and then he just falls apart. The movie is about this guy, he is an accountant, he just does what he does and it works for him. He is living the American dream. He's married and he has a kid. Then one day he is trying to do the right thing and it's all going fine and then it's like, "Hey, man, we got a bunch of bad guys here. What are we doing? We're running a business. If we get into a war with the Russians, we could be bankrupt and no one would give us any business." So he makes a deal with a bank to be allowed to stay in the bank, so that he can give back the money that he is missing. The bank wants to give him a big bonus and he is like, 'You are going to pay me back but you are not going to give me the bonus. You are going tell me to go to hell.' He gets fired and he gets a job with a drug cartel. .  the movie does not have the ending you think it should. In the end he is supposed to get back the $40 million but instead he gets caught and is sent to prison. He ends up making a deal and getting out and then the bank pays him back and he just keeps making the deal. He gets out of jail and then this other guy from the bank gets hired to make the deal, and the guy ends up getting caught,

I really hope this movie never gets released. It was such a waste of time. I will never watch this movie again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. I love this movie so much. I think it is the most entertaining movie I have seen in a while. The acting is so funny. The way the character is portrayed is so well done. It really shows how little they really know about each other and what they are really thinking. It shows how different their opinions are on certain things. The story is very good. It is also a good action movie. It has all the action scenes you can imagine. The film shows you a little bit of the life of a guy named "Ricky" and his little girl "Dorothy". It shows you what their lives were like. It also shows you how Ricky's family will react if something goes wrong in the family. It will be good for you to see this movie and see how much you really do know about Ricky. I don't really know anything about Ricky or Dorothy. I am just going to say it is a very good movie and I hope that you will like it. It might not be as good as "Tremors" but I think you will enjoy it a lot more. I give it a rating of 9/10

I mean, you can't be that bad to be good."I mean, I thought it looked like the "Scream" of the 80's, but it wasn't. The makeup and costume looked old and tired. The characters were unoriginal and didn't have any sort of "edge." It felt like a "Scare" from the 80s with the "scream" as the "kick." I can't even remember the last time I saw a movie that was more boring and lifeless than this one. I have never seen a movie this boring and unoriginal, and I have seen a lot of bad movies. I am really disappointed in this movie. It was like a poor man's version of "Scary Movie". I have been looking for a good horror movie in the last year or so and this movie just didn't deliver.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________.   If you are not familiar with the subject, I will give you a little background. In late August of 2013, a friend of mine, who was a nurse in a hospital in Boston, called me. He was very distraught, and his voice was cracking. He said he had just been called in to treat an old man, and the old man was dead. The old man had been sick for many years, and it was clear that he had a tumor. The doctors had been trying to remove the tumor for years, but they couldn't do it. The patient was on the verge of death, but the doctors kept trying to make him sicker. The man was a very old man (over 100), and had a terminal illness. His family was devastated. The nurse said the man had never left his bed, and had never taken any medication, and he had no family or friends. He had only one friend who came to visit him once a month. The nurses said that the man never left the bedside, and that it was obvious that he did not enjoy life. The woman was a good nurse, and she was the only one who was able to keep the old person from killing himself. The medical staff was not able to find the cause of the man's terminal illness, and there were no records of his illness. When the man died, he was lying on his bed in a pool of blood. The hospital had been doing everything they could to save the man, but it was hopeless. The family was furious. A couple of months later, a man who was in the hospital for a kidney stone was admitted to the ICU. The staff at the IC unit was horrified when they saw that he was dead, and they told the staff at home. The doctor came into the room and said "I told you so." When they got the news, they all burst into tears, and said, "I was so worried, and now I'm going to hell."  So, what is wrong with movies like this? First, it is not a movie. The main character in this movie is a man. He has a terminal disease, and this is a movie about a man dying. The movie doesn't give the patient a voice. The characters in this film are all actors, and none of them had ever had a job like this. In real life, it would be like having a patient in the middle of a heart transplant who is

The movie is actually one of the funniest of all time. It's the perfect blend of old and new. There's a lot of comedy, but it's also not afraid to tackle serious subjects like religion, politics, and sexuality. The story is interesting and the animation is very good. It takes a long time to get to the good part, but the movie is worth it. The only bad part is the sound. It was very annoying when they made this movie. It just sounds like someone just screaming.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. If you've ever watched a bad film, you know what it feels like. It's like being sick, only you don't have the right medication to make it go away. So it goes. It hurts. But you don?t want to stop watching. You have to keep watching. But after a while, it?s a little harder to deal with. You want to leave. But when you watch the movie, you realize how much you really enjoyed it. You don?ve learned a few things, maybe even a few laughs. You?ve seen how much fun it can be. Maybe that?s why it?d be a great movie. Maybe you?d even laugh out loud. Maybe even cry. The sad thing is, you might just have been a little more sensitive to the film?s issues. The people in the movie are struggling. The movie is about their struggles. The way they?re trying to survive. It?s about the struggles of being human. The problem with movies like this is that they only focus on the negative and never look at the positives. That?s where the real pain comes in. If the movie was more positive, maybe it would have been more enjoyable. It could have been something that you could have grown to love. But I don?d much care for a movie that never looked at the good things in the world. If that?d been the case, the film would have made me laugh, cry, or at least have some kind of emotional reaction. It was just a bad story with bad acting, which is no excuse. If it had been a movie I enjoyed, then I wouldn?t care. But it?ll be a movie you never forget. It will stay in your mind forever.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why would you watch this? It's just boring and stupid. Don't waste your time with it.  Why would you pay for this? No. Why would anybody pay for it?  This is a movie from the 80's? I'm surprised you're surprised by this movie. It's a movie where the main character (the lead) does a lot of talking. There's a lot to talk about and I guess that's the reason why it's not a masterpiece. The film's main theme is the theme of the 70's. The whole thing just goes downhill from the beginning to the end. The director (a director by the name of Peter Fonda) doesn't understand what he's doing. He's a director who makes cheesy 80's movies. The cast isn't funny, there's no good action scenes, the actors are awful, the acting isn't believable, the music is cheesy and the cinematography is atrocious. The only thing that the film has going for it is the soundtrack. This film is just so bad that I don't even want to watch it. I guess it's because of the soundtrack that the movie is more enjoyable than it actually is. I'm sure that some people like this movie because of its music. I just don't. The music is so bad it's painful to listen to. It is cheesy, lame, uninspired, and uninspiring. This movie should have been called "This is the music that Peter Fondle was making in the 1980's." It's terrible. A lot of people enjoy this movie but I don´t really understand why they enjoy it. It doesn't deserve the "WOW" factor it got. If you are a fan of PeterFondle movies, then by all means enjoy this one. If not, don't waste time on it. Don´t buy it. This one's for the kids. The adults will be disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Jan 12, 2017 1:01 AM by   It is impossible to imagine that there are people in the world who are so easily swayed by a film. If we can imagine such people, we must also admit that the majority of us are no different. As long as it's an attractive movie, we will watch it no matter what.  "The Hunger Games" is the most successful and popular of all time, a billion dollar franchise that has produced more than 15 films and has yet to show any signs of slowing down. With its blockbuster marketing campaign, it has made its money back, while simultaneously creating a culture that will keep people coming back for more. - Advertisement -  But does "The Hunger Game" actually reflect a real world that exists in any real way? Let's look at a couple of relevant statistics.  the United States' incarcerated population is 2.3 million people, or one in every 113 adults. The United States has more people in prison than the combined populations of every country on Earth. In the United Kingdom, the prison population is almost half that of the United State's, and the UK has an incarceration rate that is one of the highest in the Western world. In addition, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reports that 1.3% of the global population is estimated to have been arrested in 2015.  to be clear, these are only estimates. They do not take into account all the arrests, detentions and deaths that are never recorded. "Hunger Games" may be a fiction, but we are all living in it. The most obvious aspect of "The Passion of the Christ" is that it was inspired by the life and death of Jesus. It is the ultimate movie about sin and redemption. It has been a part of the world's culture for over two decades. In fact, the film was released just as the world was getting ready to celebrate Jesus' birth. It's not surprising then that many people have been inspired to follow Jesus in his wake. There are many who claim to be following the footsteps of Jesus in "The Lord of the Rings," but are they really following the steps of Jesus?

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________  A couple of days ago, I went to the theatre to see a comedy film called "The Devil's Backbone". It was a movie about the life of a witch in Salem. I was expecting to see some good performances and a good movie. I wasn't really expecting anything more than a comedy. I guess I was wrong about that. This movie was a complete and total nightmare. The story is so bad that I can't even remember what it was about. I couldn't even stand up during the movie. All the actors were really bad. I didn't like any of them. The only one that made me laugh was the girl in the red dress. She was so cute and funny. When I was done laughing, I couldn the audience to keep laughing as long as possible. I felt like I had seen the movie before. I have never seen a movie like this before. It was so bad and so boring. I just wanted to go home after watching this movie. This isn't even a bad film. This is a bad and boring movie.

The idea of a movie about the lives of people living in the big city was pretty cool, but the movie really sucked. The actors who were supposed to be living the lives were mostly just sitting around, drinking coffee and not doing anything. The movie just felt like it was trying too hard. The script didn't even feel like it had any direction. There was some funny moments, but it was pretty much just a series of random events. I don't know why the director even thought this was a good idea, it just didn't work. There's no real reason for the movie to be in New York City. I can't imagine there being many tourists who would go to this movie, or anyone else who would be interested in it. It was a waste of time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* I'm not going to review this because I don't know if it's good or bad. It's not terrible, but I'm disappointed in the acting. It doesn't help that the film is not very good. There is no dialogue, no sound effects, and no music. And the acting is terrible. The people playing the characters are pretty much just yelling the lines they were given, and I think that adds to the feeling of being lost. And of course the people playing these characters are all terrible. I don's see any of the actors have a real voice. They're just loud, uninspired, and really annoying. I know there is a reason the film was made, but it doesn't make this movie any better. And I'm sorry for the poor review, but you have to be honest about what you're reviewing. And this is a terrible movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________.  "This is one of the best movies of all time." - Christopher Nolan  - IMDb user reviews for This Is the End: 8.6/10  I would have given it a 10. It is one the best horror films of the year and one of my favorite films of all times. , which is a horror film in the same vein as this film, also features a strong female lead character. The story follows the character, whose life is turned upside down after the death of her husband. She has no way of knowing that her husband was not murdered but was abducted by a killer who was following her.The film was a hit and it also was very well received. I'm not a big fan of horror but this was a film that really caught my attention and scared me. This film is about the most unbelievable events that I have ever seen in a film. The film was made for one purpose: To scare you. The characters are really believable and they all have a unique personality. The way they are portrayed in the film is very disturbing. The most terrifying scene is when a woman is raped and murdered in a pool. There is a good reason that the director, Jonathan Demme, wanted to keep the audience guessing the whole time. The movie has no dialogue but the atmosphere and the way the characters are portrayed by the actors really adds to the effect. There were scenes that are just amazing. The sound was very good and the effects really make the atmosphere even scarier. I will definitely recommend this film to all the horror fans out there.This Is the end is a film you will surely want to see.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. ______________. _____... _____ _____ ______ _____...  _____ __ __.. (_______) _____ ___.. ____ ____ __ ____.. I think that this movie is a perfect example of what we as humans do. We have all the same traits and tendencies. We like to believe that we are better than other people. We believe that people are just as bad as us. And we are all so stupid and stupid to believe this. Why? Because it is so easy to believe it. If we are so stupid to be this way we must be more intelligent than people who are actually this stupid. We must be smarter than the people who make this movie. This is just so wrong. This movie shows us what is wrong with us. The movie is about the relationship between two people. One of them is the stupidest person on earth. The other one is the smartest person on Earth. And it is only because they are both in love that they get along and can find happiness in each other. But the movie shows how stupid the person who is in love with the stupid person is. The dumb person is really so stupid. When they are not in love they are just a terrible person. It is just the stupid people who have the problems. They are the ones that need help. They need to be taken care of. But if the smart person were to get into a relationship with the dumb person, that relationship would end up being so awful. And if the dumb people did not love the smart people, then the smarts would leave. It will never be good. And that is the whole point of this movie: it is the dumbs that need to love each other and be happy. And this stupid person needs to love the stupid, so that they can live happily together. I am so tired of the stupid. The more stupid I am, the happier I am. I want to be stupid all the time. I love to laugh at stupid people. I would laugh so hard if I were stupid. I think it is a good thing to laugh a lot. I always laugh when I see stupid people get in trouble. I don't laugh when people do dumb things. I laugh at the people that are really dumb. I can't help it. They make me laugh so much. I really enjoy seeing people get hurt and get hurt bad. It makes me so happy. I
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________  "I really like the first act. It's like a bad version of an early film version of A Clockwork Orange. The plot is great, but the dialogue is stupid and the plot is a mess. I thought the film was going to be a satire of the film industry, and I was really looking forward to seeing a new director. Instead, this is a film about a young man who wants to go to the moon and the consequences that come with it. It is a good film, but it is very forgettable and boring. The ending is just as bad. I have no idea what was going on with the plot, and there is no payoff. The first half of the movie is so bad, that I am disappointed. It will be better the second time around. This is one of those movies where you want to skip the first half and just watch the second half. It was a good idea to use a young actor and I thought that was a smart move. This would have been a great film if it was released as an R-rated film. The violence is excessive, but that is the point of the story. The script is terrible, and the acting is terrible. It would have made a great movie with a good script, but there are no actors to speak for the poor dialogue. The story is really bad, and it is not a good movie. The second half of this film is the best half of a bad film."

I'm glad I saw this movie before it was released on DVD. The violence was just too much for me to watch and I feel like this movie was a waste of money and time.

It is a cheesy horror movie, and it shows.  But I can't complain because the film was made by a team of people who knew what they were doing.   I'm not going to give away any plot twists, but it is a film that will give you nightmares, and leave you feeling dirty and disgusted.  This review is a little long, but the story of this movie is very good.  A group of friends are having a party when they all get killed by a serial killer.  This movie is really weird and not for everyone.  If you want a quick horror film that won't leave you wanting for more, then watch this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  If the plot sucks, there is no need to give a bad review about the movie. I am not saying that there are no good movies, but this movie was just awful. The movie was about a boy, who was a good person, who accidentally kills a girl. He was just doing a good thing. The boy is in prison. After that, he was just trying to get out of prison. But after that, there was something weird that happened. He is the main character. So, he is trying to figure out what was really going on with this whole thing. He doesn't know why the girl died, but he doesn't really care. So what does he do? He just keeps trying to keep the girl alive. This movie was really awful. I would never watch this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________"  What do you say to a fan of the original who says "This is an abomination, a gross travesty and a shameful waste of a talent"? The answer is: "Yeah. And I agree. What was the point of the movie?" The original was a cult classic. It was an entertaining film, but not one I've ever seen the characters act out in any other way. They just go about their business, talk to people, have a good time, and generally act like real people would. This movie is a direct sequel to the first movie, with one or two new characters, some new scenery, and a few new jokes. I have to say I'm disappointed that they decided to not just remake the original, but try to re-write the script. The movie's not as funny or as entertaining as the original. And it's not nearly as clever, either. The writers should have stuck with the original script and just made a different movie. There's a lot to be said for the original premise and story, but it was too over the top for the time.  - January 16, 2007The Movie Is A Waste Of Time

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. It's a cliché, but it's true. You don't get many chances to review a movie that isn't good. I got lucky. This one wasn't so bad that I could see where they were going with it. And if you've ever seen any of their other movies, you will understand that it wasn't all that bad. The action scenes were pretty cool. I thought it was kind of odd that they put the two of them in the same room at the same time. Maybe they could have made it a three way and had the third guy play the other guy. It would have been a lot more interesting. But yeah, the two characters were pretty similar. The bad guy is a real dickhead and he takes a lot of liberties with women. The woman who he was going after was one of the most beautiful women I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. The only problem is that he didn't even seem to care about her. He was really just looking for a quick blowjob. She was so pretty and she was so sweet, that he just wanted to take her back to his hotel room. She didn't seem to mind. He made her feel really comfortable. The ending was kind confusing. The movie ended with a little black screen. When I pressed play I saw a little girl with her back toward the camera. She is crying. It was really sad. I couldn't figure out what was happening. I guess she got into a car accident and she got out and found a way to get back in. I don't know what happened to her. But I felt bad for her. I think it was a really sad ending. It seemed that the director just couldn't write a good ending for the movie. Maybe he would have made the two meet in a bar and have a beer. I hope that this movie doesn't come out on VHS. I really want to watch it again. I just don't think I would like it. I am sure that it will be good in a few years.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ Do not watch this movie if you are under 18, because this movie is full of sexual innuendos and some of the things said in the movie are offensive to women and some women feel violated. This movie is about a man who is addicted to sex. His mother dies and he lives with his father. His father thinks his son is gay and that he has feelings for another man. He is in love with the man and when the man gets a new girlfriend, he starts to masturbate again. The man wants to get married to the woman, but her parents do not want their daughter to marry the man. So he tells the father that he wants to be married to a woman. The father says that he doesn't care about the son and that there is no way he can marry a woman and then the son asks if he can be married and the father says yes. He gets married to this woman and she is very beautiful. He lives with her and he does not want to leave her. They start having sex every day and the son thinks that she will never leave him and that she is the only woman he can ever be with. But they soon realize that they are not together and they end up breaking up. The son has a hard time adjusting to living with his new step mother and he starts hanging out with a bunch of young kids. One day he sees a girl who is older than him and he likes her and wants to talk to her. She tells him that she has a boyfriend and that her boyfriend will never love her. When the son meets her boyfriend, he wants her and the boyfriend does not care for the son. He makes fun of him and makes fun out of him. The boy gets depressed and he tries to kill himself. When he wakes up he has to tell his stepmother about what he did. The stepmother thinks that the boyfriend is gay because of the way the son acted toward her and that the boy is really a boy in a dress. The boyfriend's family doesn't want to see him. So the boyfriend and the boy end up in a relationship. The movie is very good. I gave it a 7 because there were a lot of gay jokes and there was a lot that was very sexual. The sex scenes were very good and the sex scenes with the boyfriends were very well done. I think that this movie was written by a gay man because there are a lot gay jokes in this movie.

The Big Sleep (1939) I don't have a problem with a classic film. A classic is something you look back on years after it has passed. I have never seen a classic movie in the theatre, I have seen them on television. A good classic is an old film, a movie you can watch with a good soundtrack, with a decent story. A great classic is a movie that you would want to watch again and again. It would be great to watch this movie in a movie theater with a full orchestra. If the movie was a great classic, then it would make you feel that you're in a dream. And it would give you a feeling of happiness. This movie is a great film. I don´ve seen it twice in a theater, and I haven't seen it again.  The Big sleep is a film about a man and a woman in a small hotel in New Orleans. The woman, Marion, is sick. The man, James, is a hotel worker. He lives with his wife in the hotel. The two of them meet in a restaurant, and go back to their room together. Then a storm comes and the roof of the hotel falls on the hotel and destroys it. The hotel is still standing, but in ruins. But in the meantime, James starts to dream about the hotel, and he wants to rebuild it. He starts to see a vision of his wife, Marion.  But, he´s not alone. He has Marion's daughter, who is also sick, but also a dreamer. But she´s dreaming about her mother, Marion again. In the meantime Marion is in the hospital. She doesn´t remember anything.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  "You think that you know the man? You don't know the real man." – Tom Wolfe, The Bonfire of the Vanities  What I don't like about this movie is that it doesn't really know how to start. There's a prologue with a woman who is about to start her job at a big accounting firm, and that's where it really picks up. The movie then jumps into a few different flashbacks, all of which seem to have been shot in the same place, and all of them focusing on the same woman. We learn a lot about her, her husband, and their son, and we see her doing a good job.  There's just one problem: The movie doesn't start like it wants to. . , it's a very typical Hollywood film, so I wasn't surprised to find that it starts with an exposition scene. It's just the standard exposition scene: a character gives a bunch of exposition about the world and some stuff about the characters and what they're doing, then we cut to a scene where a character is talking to a couple of strangers. We then see a flashback, and then the next scene is from a third-person point of view. The same scene, but this time from the woman's point of perspective. The only thing that changes in the movie is the length of the exposition scenes. They all still feel the same length, but because of how they're shot, they feel shorter than they actually are. It feels like we're being led along to a destination, not allowed to stop and enjoy the scenery. (The first movie, the one I was expecting to hate, was a very different movie from the second. I thought it was a good movie and it was one of my favorites in the whole series, but I thought the second movie would be better, even though I knew it was going to be bad.)  , I didn't even know what the film was about before I saw it. So I was very happy to see that it's about a woman's experience with Alzheimer's. There are some good characters in this film: a woman with Alzheimer who tries to keep her memory by talking to her husband; a lawyer who's trying to prove that his client's Alzheimer's is not a condition that is fatal; a man who's about to retire and needs to find a wife; and a woman in her early 40s who's had a difficult relationship

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________   "Dawn of the Dead" is a film that is more of a horror movie than a horror film. It is a zombie film that features a great cast. There is not a lot of gore in the film but it is there. It features the zombies that are zombies. The zombies are in fact, very smart zombies. They make decisions as to where to move and where not to move. They move very carefully. One of the things I like about this film is that it is set in the future and there are people in this future that have gone into a zombie apocalypse. This is an older, wiser, and more developed cast of zombies than most zombie films. They are not just zombies. It has been said that the zombies are like the dinosaurs of the past, but it was not as easy to watch the film as I thought it would be. The acting is good. The zombie sequences were interesting and well done. The story is good but it does get a little confusing at times. I really enjoyed the film. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes zombie films or is into zombie movies. It really is a good film.

Her mom goes into her daughter's house. The daughter is going crazy with rage and decides to kill her mom. The mom tries to protect her daughter. It's a very well made movie and I thought it was really good. The movie has a great ending. It was very shocking. But, the movie was a mess. It should have been a great movie. I know that my daughter didn't want to watch it. But it was a great experience and I enjoyed it. I thought my daughter was a good actress. If she had been in 'My Boy' she would have won an Oscar. The girl was so much prettier. I think the movie could have been better if it was edited. I was not too happy about the ending. If the movie had been a better movie, I would have loved it. This movie is a mess and I don't think that it's worth your time.  Rated 5 out of 5 by jasonc12 from Great movie!! I love this movie. It is very interesting and has a lot of great action scenes. It also has a good storyline. My only complaint is that it is a little too long. It could have made it a lot better by cutting some of the action scenes out. Overall I recommend this movie to anyone who is into action movies and has an interest in religion. .  is a great story with a great message.

One minute it was very serious and the next minute it is totally silly. The story line was quite intriguing but the execution was very poor. The only good part of this movie is the soundtrack. The music was really good and it was really funny when the people were singing about how ridiculous the movie was. The bad part of the movie is that the film ends too soon. There is a little too much of the old jokes and it ends too abruptly. _______________________________________________________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________  The best bad movie ever  By L.C.W. on May 13, 2009 Byon May 13. This is by far the best bad movies out there. The special effects are great and it was a pretty good film with a good story. I recommend watching this film with friends and maybe even with a group of people. I would have loved to see more of the villains but I suppose this is the end of them. You'll never be bored and there are some great moments to be found in this film. The music was great and the movie had a great ending.  Boring  So boring.  for the most part. I was pretty bored with this film as it went on for so long. But the special effects were amazing. The best I've seen for sure. I liked the ending. The plot was pretty bland. And it was too long for me. I felt like it should have been cut down to about an hour.  in my opinion. It had great special effects and was pretty good, but it was just a boring movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  This is not a film about the Holocaust, although I did read that the story is based on true events. This is a film with no connection to the Holocaust. This film is about a real life person, who was not a Nazi, who did not kill Jews. This person was a German officer who was captured and executed for desertion, and then he is given the opportunity to return to his home and see the horrors that have occurred. He doesn't return. And he gets to the end and sees what has happened. It is a wonderful film that is not about the Nazi genocide, which is the focus of the movie. It was an interesting film, which gave me a chance to see what the Holocaust would have been like in Germany in the late 1940s. I really enjoyed this movie and I think it should be seen by everyone, especially the people of the world who want to see the truth.

So it should come as no surprise that this film is an attempt to manipulate and control me as well. The plot is poorly thought out and executed. The characters are extremely stereotypical. And the actors are so uninteresting that it's hard to care about them. The special effects are a let down. If this film was a real movie, it would not be funny.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched the film twice.  The first time I watched it was in the theater.  I felt that the movie was way too long.   I felt that it was way to long. This movie is so bad.  And you know why?    Because it's made by a  person who doesn't have a clue what to do with the plot.  The movie was so bad I felt like my life was over.  This movie is like a video game.  It was boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie itself is terrible. The script, the acting, the writing, the direction, the directing, the cinematography. The movie has nothing good about it. The film is one big disaster. There are no laughs. The acting is terrible and you can tell. The only time it feels like something good happens is when it is showing the good stuff. That is not the case with this movie. The bad parts of the movie are so over the top and stupid. There is no way they would make something this stupid and bad. There's just no way. It is a train wreck. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________ I saw this movie on TV about 5 years ago and the review I remember was from a critic who said it was a great film but the acting was so terrible it was really hard to watch. This film was awful! I've never seen so many people getting all angry at someone else's stupidity before! The acting was horrendous and not a word out of place! I think I can agree with the director of this film. They should have done a film called "The Miserable Deeds of a Man" and made a comedy out of the whole experience! - January 29, 2005I remember that one...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The Bad Batch (2017)  If you're looking for an old-school gangster movie that is definitely not for the faint of heart, then you might want to check out this movie, which is one of the best movies to come out of the 1980s.  I loved this movie because I felt the character was the most realistic of the whole movie. His motivation to become a drug dealer was real. He was driven by greed, and wanted to make as much money as he could. He also had a very complex backstory. He had been a victim of domestic abuse and had been through a lot of different lives. I loved his relationship with the girlfriend that he cheated on her with, as well as how he tried to protect her and help her. .    The bad guy of the movie, known only as the "Goon", was also a very real character. He played the role of a tough, cold-hearted, psychopath. He would kill anyone who got in his way, even if he had to use extreme violence. This guy was the true bad guy, and I love it when a movie has a true bad man as the main antagonist. The Bad Bitch (2017), is another gangster film, and is a bit of a remake of the film "The Bad Lieutenant" from 1982. The main difference between the two movies is that The Bad Lieutenant is about a tough cop, while this movie is about an ex-con, who is a hit man for hire. The bad guy in this movie was much more fun to watch, as he was portrayed by a very likable character. I also liked that the film is very dark, and very realistic. The story revolves around a drug lord who had the money, but had no morals. He took a bunch of people and had them killed, and the money that was left was used to fund his new drug operation. I can imagine how the character would react to being caught. It was interesting to see how he would react when he was caught, and how the audience would react. It made the movie even more interesting.  The Bad Seed (2014) is a documentary film about the rise of the drug known as "Shabu". The film takes a look at the drug, and takes a deep look at what is going on in our world with the use of this drug. The Bad Seeds were the result of
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________________________________________________________The first half of the movie is very boring and repetitive, especially in the beginning. It is just very similar to the first half in the way that the main character does everything for the sake of getting closer to his wife. He wants to see her in a bikini, but in the end he is more concerned about how to make his wife happy. It's like the movie has no life or purpose. At least with the first movie it was very exciting because it was a story about a man trying to find his wife, and in the second half it's the same old boring stuff. I was really bored by the whole movie. The ending was very predictable and very annoying. I don't know what the point was of the ending, but I didn't like it. I feel like it was rushed and a waste of time. The only good thing about the movie was that I was so surprised by the ending that I found it a very nice surprise. However, I can't say that it is a very good movie, because the movie didn't live up to the hype. I think that it should have ended earlier, but it didn't. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It doesn't make sense and it didn a bad job.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________  The last scene of the film was a complete disappointment. It had been a long time since I had watched a good horror movie and it was one that I wanted to see again. I didn't want to give this film another chance because of the terrible ending but the final scene just made it so much worse. This film was supposed to be a dark and mysterious story about a girl who lives in a small town. When a girl goes missing in the town she has to look for her. There are many other towns in the area so she must explore and find clues to find out where her daughter has gone. This was supposed be a creepy story that would creep you out. It was not. It seemed that this movie wanted to be funny but it really was not funny at all. The film just seemed to be trying too hard to be scary and I just felt bored by the whole thing. It didn't make me scared but I did feel bored by it. If you are looking for a film that is a little bit different from the typical horror movies out there, then give this a shot. It is definitely a movie that you should watch but I would definitely give this one a 2/10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The entire movie was horrible. I am not sure how they managed to make a movie about a black girl who just wants to get a job and has a boyfriend and not have her get beaten up and killed." That is an absolute and complete lie. The movie is about the relationship between a black woman and her black boyfriend and how she tries to get him to leave her. The only problem is that they can't get a date to a white girl who is a nurse. She is just so hot and sexy. It is also the first time the main character has a job.  They are both struggling to get to the top of their profession. The black woman is still struggling to overcome the racism that she had to endure from her childhood, but she eventually makes it and is making a good name for herself in the world. The white girl, on the other hand, is stuck in the position of a black girlfriend. She struggles to make up for all the wrongs she did to her. It's a very good movie. It isn't perfect, but it's a good movie and the actors do a great job.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________." If that seems harsh, then you're in good company. The vast majority of films are not bad, but a great many are really, really bad. The worst movies are so bad that they actually turn out to be good, but they are so poor that they really do turn out awful. Some of these movies can be funny. But not even a comic book movie has the capacity to make a joke out of its own story. Even the most outrageous jokes in a comedy are so far removed from the real life story of what was happening to those people that they become just another thing to laugh at. Even when a movie is so badly made that it has no plot or character development, there is always something funny in it. It's not so much that a film can be good because of a joke, but that it's so bad it makes a joke that much better.   The only way that this movie gets a higher score than it really deserves is because of its "bad" reputation. But even then, the score it deserves is so low that it is hardly worth a comment. If you're looking for something good, you might as well turn to a documentary on the Holocaust or a history of the Battle of the Bulge. If it was that good, it would be on a list of the 100 best movies ever made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ***********  It's like the bad ones are being released in a pack: ************  *********  A great movie. The best horror movie since Halloween. This movie makes you cry. It's one of those movies where everything is done right and every detail is done to perfection. There is not a single bad scene in this movie. You won't believe it until you see it for yourself. It takes place in a small college town in a place that is very close to me. I saw this movie in a theater in San Jose, California. The movie is very well done. It doesn't look like a big budget movie. It looks like something that is done on a college budget. I thought that it would have been a little harder to make this movie, because it is a smaller town. I guess that is why it's so well done, because you don't expect to see a college town movie on a major studio movie. I'm so glad that they did this. I am glad that it was a student movie, and I know that it had a lot of students in it. I loved that it takes place on a night that is full of surprises. The main character is very realistic. I liked the whole cast. I especially liked the characters of the girl and the guy. I also loved the sound track, the music was great. I was really surprised when I saw it on my big screen, because I didn't expect it to be so well made. I know there is a remake of this movie that is being made, and it will probably be released on DVD in the future. I hope that it will be a good movie.

And I thought we were done here! I hope we can just be done with him and not talk about this garbage. I hope this is the end of his nonsense! I'll just finish up here. I have one more thing to say about Logan's World. Logan was an incredibly bad movie, and I really don't care. I was really hoping that he would make another movie like this.

If you've ever felt like this, then it's possible you're not alone. But the thing is, it's usually just a lie. If you want to know the truth, just listen to a movie. In this case, you're about to learn about a movie called The Thing, and what really went wrong with it. ____________________________ If you thought this movie was terrible, you can't be the only one. This film is a remake of the film from 1958, The Thing From Another World, but the remake was much worse.  The Thing From Beyond The Wall is a film about a group of scientists who try to create a device to help them survive in a world that is dying from an alien invasion. This isn't a science fiction movie. It is a horror movie, with a lot of gore and gore effects. The Thing from Beyond The wall is very bad, and is about as bad as it gets. There is nothing new about the film, it is just recycled from the original film. The only thing that makes it good is that it is remade with the same crew. __________ The first thing I noticed about this movie is that the sound quality is terrible. The sound effects in this movie are really bad. If I were to ask you to listen to the movie, I would probably say that it sounds like a 1980s version of a horror film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________"The movie was just a bunch of characters sitting around waiting for a fight. The action scenes weren't even all that great. It was very boring and repetitive. The characters just sat around for the entire movie and talked about nothing for 10 hours.""I have a hard time liking the movie and it was very un-original."I don't think I'm being too harsh. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. The plot is stupid, the characters are stupid, and the plot doesn't work. This movie was made to appeal to the fans of The Matrix, and it does. The movie doesn't have much of a story to begin with. It's about Neo being a super-soldier who has to battle an evil organization known as the System. The villain is a hologram of himself, and he wants to create an army of machines. Neo is fighting him in a holographic war and they have to battle other holograms. I was so bored by the movie. I didn't really care if Neo and Morpheus were in the fight. They're there to look cool and be in the movie, but they're pretty much useless. This whole movie is about this guy named Morpheus (I can't remember his name). He's just there to be a cool guy, and we all know he doesn't give a fuck. The whole movie was about Neo and Neo just keeps fighting and fighting and never accomplishes anything. The only time he does anything is when Morpheus comes to save him and we get to see Morpheus's face. When Morpheus saves Neo, he just says "Neo! It's okay! We've got each other's backs. You can't die now. You're a fighter." It doesn't even have a point. He's there just to be there and to look at. The fight scenes are just boring and slow. They take forever. There's never a really good fight. If they were trying to do a real fight they would have just filmed it with real people. Then the Matrix would have been much better.The Matrix is a series of computer programs. It all started with a video tape. Neo was a special soldier created by the System who was sent into the future to fight machines. The problem was that he was programmed to fight robots and not humans. He was only programmed to defeat a few machines and he just had no idea how to defeat the big bad robots. Neo

There are some great fight scenes in this movie. I know the movie has some issues with some of the story lines, but it is still an enjoyable movie. There isn't really a bad thing about it. There's nothing really bad about this movie at all.  and a good plot. The main character, Johnny, was really interesting to watch. He wasn't your typical Bond villain. He was a nice guy. He had a very good storyline. I didn't really feel bad for him. I feel like he could have been in a lot worse movies. I really liked the main villain. His name is M, and he is a man who's very loyal to a country that doesn't need him anymore. So he's not a bad guy, in a bad way. He's a very interesting character. I'm not saying that M isn't interesting. He really is. The villain in this film was really fun to watch, too, even if he was kind off. I mean, he's a pretty bad guy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ What is a good movie? ______________________________ What's a bad film? ___________________________________________  The first thing to remember is that a movie is a representation of something. And in the case of the story of The Godfather Part II, it's a representation about an Italian crime family. The movie begins with a simple question: Why did the mobster, Vito Corleone, murder his brother and get away with it? Why did he do this to his son, Michael?  What makes this story different from other mob stories is that we have to take into account the entire life of Vito and his family. It takes you from the beginning of Vitto's life in Sicily as a child to the time he was a young man, fighting in the war in Italy and his rise to become a powerful crime boss.  But, this is not a movie about a single person. The Godfied has a complex plot. There is no clear hero and villain. We can see the beginning, middle and end of Vittorio's life. We see the war. We meet the people who knew him. We learn what made him who he is. We also see him go through changes. He loses his love. We have to watch how he tries to reconcile this with his family and then eventually with his new wife. And he changes his own views about family. He realizes he can't live like his father did and he can only live in the way his father loved him.  of the movie. It's not a simple story about a man trying to make his way in life. In fact, I think that a lot of people, including the film makers, could have made this story about the life of one family, but the filmmakers chose to show a different perspective. And, it shows us how we are affected by life as it's happening. The film tells us about what it means to be a family, about how we all try to find the right way to live, how we try to make the right decisions. . There are many people that see this movie and think it's about a family. But, this movie is more about a person trying to change his life. It is not about the family. This movie is about the person who can't change his way of living. It tells the story that is the same for every family in the world. We all are trying to live life in the right manner. This is

Write a negative review about a bad movie: )  I've seen "The Hunger Games" twice. The first time was at the movie theater in the small town of Jackson, Wyoming. The second time, I watched it on the plane ride from Jackson to Seattle. I saw it for the first time in Jackson, a town of less than 15,000 people. And it was so different. I was expecting something similar to the first movie. There was violence and war and destruction. I wanted to scream. I didn't see that at all. Instead, I saw a world of love and kindness and a heroine that I didn`t know was a woman.  She wasn`t like the first girl. She didn` t wear a dress. She wasn` t a warrior. She was just a girl trying to find her place in the world. She struggled. She cried. She had to find a place for herself. I thought, "I can do that."  The movie was really good. The only thing I didn´t like was the ending. I felt that it was a little too abrupt and a little bit too easy. But there are parts of the book that are also too abrupt, a bit too soft, and too easy to accept. So, there was no way I was going to get that ending. But then I thought: If I did get that one, maybe I would like it. Maybe I wouldn`t.  of the movie. The third time, at home, I read the book and saw how it was different. It was a completely different movie, a totally different book. It didn`T feel like a movie. It felt like a book. So I read it again. And I got it. The ending is not the ending I wanted, but it is still a good ending. The way it is told, the way it was written, and the way the characters reacted to what was happening to them, is a good example of what I wanted. It is still about love, about friendship, about family.    It was very hard to write a book because I was trying to do something different, something more original, something I never would have thought of myself. The book I started writing was supposed to be a memoir about my life as a girl in the 1980s. I never thought I would write a story like this, a story about girls in a war and about how they deal with that, how they cope with that.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________  The first time I saw the movie I felt I was watching a very different film. It was a dark comedy with a lot of laughs. Then the story started to get more serious and the humor went away. The movie ended up being a very dull and bad film with some interesting parts. I think it's one of the most boring films I have seen. I don't know why it got a remake in 2010 but I hope it won't have a remake.

It was our first day in town and we had the same general attitude about everything. It seemed like we were trying to make the most of our time, but it seemed as if our lives had been so long, and our dreams so unfulfilled, that we had become so cynical about everything, even the things we most wanted. It's hard to be happy when you're in a bad mood. - Robert Palmer

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ (This review is for the "bad movie" - NOT the "great movie" that I watched last night. It was a very disappointing movie, which I'll discuss in a bit)   This movie was made on a $20,000 budget. That's not cheap, and the cast was under-qualified. This is a very bad movie. If you're a fan of the book, you're going to hate this movie. The movie is based on the first book, and some of the scenes were recycled, but still, it's a good movie.   It starts out with a couple (played by Michael Pitt and Jennifer Aniston) talking about their marriage. They have two kids and a house and they're very happy, but they're in a very unhappy marriage. After a little while, Pitt says "I have a problem" and he opens up his wife's drawer. It's filled with pictures of other men, mostly men that he was with.   in one picture, there's a man in a suit with a huge cock, but Pitt said it was the other guy's cock that he wanted to get inside her. He says, "I can't keep doing this." But then Pitt says, that he knows he's going to do it again, and he knows that he wants her to watch. So he pulls out a huge dildo, and puts it in her mouth and says,   "Here, take it. It won't hurt."   She starts sucking it, and says that she doesn't know if she likes it, but that she's not going to stop. He starts fucking her, and then says "Here, suck it." She starts sucking him, and eventually he starts to fuck her, then says, (I can hear her voice in the movie) "Now suck it like you want it."  - "I love sucking dicks. I love sucking dick."   the woman then says that her mouth is too dry and she needs a bath, so she gets in the bath and goes to take a shower. The woman says, when she gets out of the bath, she sees her husband's cock in her hand. She says that it's huge, and she has to have it. So she starts sucking the man's huge cock. She's enjoying it, she says, and that she loves it, then the guy asks her,   a little bit confused, "When do you want

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ The worst movie I've seen since I've been in this business. This is a horrible film. It is a waste of time and a disgrace to the industry. I hate it. This movie has nothing to do with horror, I'm sure you know that. This film has nothing about horror, there is a scene where the guy is eating a piece of flesh and it is all bloody, and there are many scenes that are not even horror, but it is a stupid movie. I don't want to be rude, but this movie is very bad. There is not a good moment in this movie. Not a good laugh. The best scene is the guy running through a forest, but that's it. There are no good scenes, there are no interesting things, nothing. It just ends. The worst part is that I don''t care about the characters. They are very stupid. The only interesting thing is that it was made by a woman. It was supposed to be an "adults only" movie, and the director was a woman, but I don�t know. I think the movie is a terrible film, but at least I can't say that about the director, the actor or the actress.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ I have been watching the movie for a few weeks and so far, it is a good movie. It does not have much story. It has a lot of action scenes but it is not that well written. The story is about a small group of people who live in a village and when a group of robbers come, they kill many people. The characters are the most important. They are not very interesting, they are not smart and they are also very stupid. But the movie is not terrible. The movie is made of good acting and interesting plot. The ending is pretty good. The sound is good too. The soundtrack is okay. The action scenes are not really exciting. The acting in the movie has a really good quality. The whole movie is good. It is not the best movie ever but it's a good watch. It gives the viewer a nice feeling. The only bad thing is the ending. I would say that it is the same as the ending of the first season of the TV series "The Walking Dead" and it's pretty bad. This movie has not a lot to do with the TV Series.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. It's a movie about a man who decides to take a trip to the other side of the world, only to realize that he was in fact, in the world.  That is pretty much the exact plot of "The Man Who Fell to Earth," the 2001 movie directed by Luc Besson. That's because the film is really not about a guy who goes to the moon. It really isn't about an astronaut who goes back to the Earth. And it really isn  The movie opens with a group of astronauts on the moon's surface talking about the future. One of the astronauts (played by Sylvester Stallone) says, "The first step is to realize you're in the middle of nowhere. That there's nothing out here but trees, and we're all alone." And we see the moon as a giant empty plain. A man walks across it. He looks around and says, "...there's nothing here. No people. No life."  Advertisement  This isn't a bad thing. It has a lot going for it. There's a sense of isolation, and a feeling that you're going to die alone. There are some good laughs to be had, and some nice dialogue that gets you chuckling. But it's not really about that. It is a movie that's about how a man decides to come back to his own planet, to his home, and how he gets over it. And when he does, he decides to stay. He decides to never leave again.  and what the movie does very well is show us what it's like to go from the Earth to the Moon. That trip was really hard. In fact, it's hard enough to get up in the morning. It was hard to make it to the space station. And to make a trip back to Earth was just as hard. And the movie shows us how it is to make that journey. How it's easy to get bored and how it's really hard to get out of bed. . The first thing that we learn is that there are no trees. There is nothing out there. It just looks that way. There was a lot of work put into that. When the astronauts come back from the moon, they're given a lot to think about. The film is a real slow burn. But after a while, you do start to feel like you're back there again. And then the movie moves on to show us how the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You are wrong, and you should feel bad about it.  But it's not the fault of the movie, it's the fault of you, and of your attitude. Â You've been spoiled, you've been sold a pig.    You think it's cool, you're getting all the girl.  But no, no, it isn't.  You want the girl, you want the sex, you think that's cool.  So you can do all the cool stuff, the stuff you were supposed to do, and the girl will like you and want to be with you.  The girl you thought was hot, the girl you imagined yourself being with, is just a con, a cheap, fake, toxic lie.  And you know it, and so does the girl on screen, and even if she doesn't know it you know that.  All the girl does is go on and on about all the things she loves about you, the things you're supposed to like, the sexy stuff.  She wants you to see her as a human being, not a sexual object.  This is a movie about two people who are having a very bad night, a movie about a relationship that's falling apart.  A relationship that she thought she had to have.  One that has failed, it failed for many reasons, but primarily because the girl wasn't a good fit.  There's nothing sexy about a woman who won't take a chance on you, who's not comfortable with being sexually involved with you,  who isn't a strong independent woman, who isn not a leader, who won the last fight, who can't get a grip on herself, and who's only ever cared about her own needs.  For a movie like this, the woman you thought you'd be with is a pretty bad choice.  Because she's not what you thought she was.  It's like she's always been there, but you didn't see it.  A movie about two people with a broken relationship, a woman who's been used, and a man who's a loser.  In the movie there are two people: one a bad person, one a good person.  Both have problems, both are broken, and both are in pain.  If you can't see that in the movie you're wrong.  Either the bad person isn't going to be able to

It might be easier to separate this article into two pages, if that would be acceptable to someone.  For the record, the film was released on January 28, 2018.

The film was also released on Vudou, which is an online video platform for renting movies.  to me this looks like a really good film. but im not so sure about the ending. The ending i mean if you watched the movie you can see it for yourself that it's not that good. i mean it has great characters and some nice action but it's so rushed. Also the movie has a very boring ending. and it really makes me want to watch a movie again. so the ending sucks.  the film is not bad but i just think it has to be rewatched atleast once. and the reason i was saying it has been rewatch atleat it is because i know the characters very well. i have seen the movie twice already.  and there is a part of the movie i dont like. it's called the fight scene and it is a very weird and cheesy fight scene. and i think it's very stupid because it was so forced. and also i dont think it was good for the characters because they were so boring and not that strong. I also think the movie is too long for what it has. , so that i can say i have to rewatch this movie atlea and not just once. And to say the movie had good characters because i love the characters in this movie. so that the movie should not be rated a 8/10

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________  The film is a re-telling of the classic fairy tale "The Frog Prince", but with the addition of a magical potion that turns a man into a frog. The film takes place in a world where the human race is slowly dying off due to a curse put upon the frog prince by a witch named Nana (played by Susan Sarandon). The plot involves the prince attempting to make a pact with the princess to save the human population, but the witch also wants to use the potion to kill the prince. The two then team up to get the potion from the witch's daughter, who is actually Nana. The princess is a bit of a ditz, but she is cute when she is drunk, and she is a good girl who is willing to help the prince, even though she hates him for killing her mother and stealing her magic ring. She is willing, however, to kill anyone who stands in her way, and it turns out that the prince is a tad bit smarter than he seems. The whole thing is very silly and I think that a lot of people will enjoy the film, even if they hate fairy tales. It's a great film that I highly recommend to anyone who likes fairy tales, especially those who like the Prince and the Frog. I would recommend this to anyone, even to the ones who think that the Prince is a bad guy. This film is very entertaining, but if you're not a fan of fairy tales then I don't think you'll like it as much. ___________________________________________  Review written by: Mike W.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ _______________________  A man and a woman meet at a party. They both seem to know each other, but don't quite know why. They are both married, but the woman is married to a guy, and they don't seem to have much in common. They go out to a party, and there is a great deal of drunken sex. When the woman leaves the party, the man starts to see her again. She is an attractive young woman. He gets her phone number and begins to text her, which she ignores. He starts to look for her, and she starts to get more interested in him. But the more they meet, the more she starts liking him. Eventually, she tells him to meet her for a drink. He arrives at the bar and she is there, but she doesn't recognize him. They start dancing, and he starts to kiss her. But then she breaks it off. The woman's name is Mary, and the man's name has been changed to Jack. He leaves, and finds a note on his dresser. It says, "Good night, Mary." The man reads the note, and it says, ""Good night,"" and it then says "Love, Jack." The woman has no idea that Jack is married. When he returns to the party a short time later, she is gone. When she comes back a few hours later, he's there, and now she knows that he's married. She asks Jack if he was married, and Jack says, no, he was never married. But he has a picture of Mary. He then asks if she would like to go out with him. She agrees. They get to a park and Jack gets in a cab and leaves. He tries to find Mary in the park, but doesn't find her. He decides to go back to her house and try to find her again, but there is no one home. He goes into the house, and when he goes in, the door is closed. He looks around, and then he finds Mary, lying in bed, with a glass of water by her head. She tells him she's not sick, but he tells her she is and that she should get some rest. She says she will, but says she is going out, so he goes to her room. She doesn't want to go, so she tells Jack she's going out. He takes her by the hand and goes with her to the dance

If I had one wish for the future, it would be for _______ to not make it to the silver screen. :)  _________   My wife and I went to see this movie in a theater at my son's school. We were not really looking for a good time, just a good movie. This is not that. The entire time, I was watching and thinking about my children. I wanted to see the movie with them and just be with them. The worst part about it was I was so angry at myself for watching it. I didn't know that there were other people in the theater. I was not trying to hurt anyone. I did not mean to make them uncomfortable. I wish that if I knew then what I know now, that I would have made a different choice. I hate myself for what I did. "You cannot make something good out of something evil" -Edgar Allen Poe. If someone told you that you were going to be happy in this world, you would probably believe them. If someone told this to you and told you it was true, would you believe them? I think most people would not. So, here I am, still angry, angry at what I have done. I can't change what I've done. It is what it is. I think about the fact that it is over. I'm sure that everyone would love to have my children back. I would love for them to see me and my wife and be proud of us. But I know that will never happen. I know they will always have to deal with me and how I was as a parent. So there I sit, still pissed off at myself and angry at the world. And that's ok. I guess, if it wasn't, I'd be dead. This is a movie that I don't really think needs to be seen. I've never liked it. But, like many movies, it has a certain charm that it cannot help but bring out in some people. I loved that this movie was shot in the late 1800's. And I thought it was cool that it was set in

There are only two people in the movie, the one you want to like and the one who is just there to be in it. I think it's a great movie. I have seen it three times and each time I felt I could see the movie better. I wish it was a little shorter and had less stupid characters, but if you have seen the original, you won't get that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________  A big thank you to my son for watching this with me last night. It was the first time that he was able to watch the movie in the car with me. It wasn't the most amazing film but it was a good film with some decent moments. I think it's a good movie for a young adult who loves action movies. It's got a lot of fun action and explosions, but it's got good drama and heart as well. The film also had a lot to say about racism and the racism that existed in America at that time. The movie has an interesting plot that goes into many things and the film doesn't rush into any of them. It has some good and bad moments but the film does a good job in setting up the plot. I just wish that it had a bit more of the old school action that made the 70's and 80's so great. It would have been a great movie for an 80's fan, because I think that movie is a lot more like the 80's and a bit less like the 90's. But it's still a fun movie with some good action scenes. Overall, it's definitely worth watching, if you like action. It might not be your favorite action movie of all time, but if you have any interest in the action genre then it's worth a look.  _____________________________________________________  - Chris  P.S. I found this review helpful and it helped me out a lot, thank you so much. I have seen this movie in many theaters and in many different times, and I never liked it. I did like the idea of having a character with a black name (I thought it was cool that this was his first movie) and that he fought the bad guys with his sword. I also liked that he did not wear a cape, which is a bit rare nowadays. The acting was good. But I really hated the story. It felt like an attempt to get people to accept black people in America, and it didn't work. This movie just felt like a slap in the face to black people. I understand that this is a movie about an orphan who had to learn how to fight in a war-torn world, but there were no black people on the screen at all, and there were a few scenes in the movie where there was a black person who looked like me. There were a lot fewer black people and black characters in this movie than there should have been
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ This is one of the worst movies ever. I'm sorry to say this but this movie was a horrible idea. It was a complete waste of time and money. I had no idea why the producers wanted to make this movie and it just didn't make sense. It started out pretty good but then everything went wrong. It has the same actors from the first movie and they are all completely different people. The plot is ridiculous, I mean it's just a bunch of people getting killed and the only thing that is funny is how everyone is dying. The director thought it would be funny to have a couple people die and it would end up as a "wacky" situation but it's all so stupid. It's just too bad they couldn't have just changed the characters or made a new movie with the same characters. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 or 2 star is because it's not really that bad. There are a lot of cool scenes in it and I think it would have been better as a sequel to the first one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ I was so excited to watch this movie. I've been wanting to see it for a while. I was expecting to get a really fun and fast paced movie. This was all wrong. It was boring. There were many scenes in this movie that just did not feel right. The script seemed like it was trying to be all things to all people. There are times when the plot doesn't feel natural. The plot is not very deep, and there is little story development. The characters seem to have been given their own story arc. The character's relationships seem to be a mess, and they don't feel believable. The film was a big mess. It is hard to watch a movie this bad and have a good time. I have seen a lot worse, but this was the worst. It's not fun to watch, and the script does not help matters. It would be a lot better if they had used the footage from a much better movie to give it a more interesting story. I guess it's okay to take a movie from a good movie and make it worse.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ The film was a great action flick. It was just about what I expected. I really liked how it was set in New Orleans, and that they did a great job of showing that the movie took place in a ghetto. The main villain was great. I felt that it was not as much a revenge flick as it was a revenge drama. The two lead characters, the "Jazz" and the "Vicious" were a great pair of antagonists. They are both bad guys and they do have a lot of good moments together. The only bad thing about this movie was that the music in the film was very bad. The music was terrible and the action scenes were hard to watch.

The movie is boring, because it has no point, and is full of cliches. There is no humor in the movie, it's just like a kid's movie. I think the movie makes it look like a bunch of kids were playing pretend, which is the complete opposite of how it actually was. The other thing is, the movie has a bad ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Loading... Sorry, but this is awful. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I could not stop laughing at it. My wife and I loved it. We both felt the movie was very funny. The movie was about a man who was stuck with a kid. The man was told that he would be the man of the house for the child. So the man got married. He had a daughter and son. The mother was a very angry person. The son would throw things at the man and say mean things to him. The boy wanted to get a job and work for a living. The father was a great man. He wanted to be a good father for the daughter. The wife of the man was a bitch. She used to be married to another man and her husband was very bad to her. She got a divorce and the man wanted to make a change and start a new life. He decided to move his family to the big city. They moved to the city. His wife and daughter lived in the city and his son and daughter were in a small town. They both went to a local school. His son got good grades and was in the local college. His daughter was a loner and was always in trouble. Her mother was always there and was mean to her because she was a bad girl. This boy went to the local school and made friends with a girl. One day his friend was on the school bus and the bus was stopped. The girl got off the bus and she was wearing a dress. The bus driver asked her why she was dressed in a dress and the girl said that she was going to a party. The driver then took his time and told her to get off the school property and she got off. When the bus driver got back on the bus, the girl was gone. The next day the man came home to his wife and son and told them what happened. The guy was in shock. His friends said he was crazy. His mother said that it was the first time they heard of a child going to school dressed in such a way. When his son was 12 years old, he went to school in a little black dress and no pants. They had a dance the next day and all of his friends were in white clothes and no skirts. They all got up and danced. He told his mother that it had been a good night. She asked if he had ever had

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This movie is garbage. _________ The worst thing I have ever seen in my life. I can't believe that this is actually being released in America. The movie is all made up of bad acting and bad CGI. The plot is also made up in a similar manner to the Matrix. I guess it is supposed to be the story of a young girl that was born without a nose and she becomes the leader of a group of rebels. However, what is even more ridiculous is that the movie doesn't even have the decency to use a real female character. Instead, we get a man named Johnny, and a woman named Eve. Eve is supposed be a badass. However she has no personality. She does nothing and only makes her voice higher pitched than it should be. This movie makes no sense whatsoever and it makes me feel that it was just made to look cool. This is not a good movie. It is an embarrassment to the American movie industry. If you have seen it, then you know what this is. You know why I am giving it such a low score. I have a daughter and this movie has nothing good to say about her. It has absolutely nothing good about it. The only reason this movie is rated PG-13 is because of the "graphic" violence. But I am not even sure what this means. I am sure the movie had plenty of other graphic scenes in it. Why didn't the MPAA just get rid of the violence altogether? I have seen plenty of movies where they got rid of graphic violence. Why can't the US just do that? I really don't care about violence in movies. I do not need it in my movies. What I want is for the MPaa to be as strict and conservative as it is in the UK. The US needs to get rid off this stuff that makes it look like it is made in the 80s and 90s. The film is not even the best thing this year and I am just disappointed that it is coming out in the US. I would be happier if it was released in the rest of the world.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________. I've heard of a couple of these but not really liked any of them. The movie I saw was a great story but the actors all played the roles well but I couldn't get into the movie. I thought it was just a poorly made movie. The plot was great but the acting was terrible. I was very disappointed with this movie and the cast. The first part of the movie was great and the actors did an amazing job. I love a good old fashioned cowboy movie and this was just an average one.  Rated 5 out of 5 by jd from Very good movie. It's a western and it's not bad. The acting was good and the scenes were interesting. This is a good movie for cowboy fans. I'm a big fan of western movies and this is a great movie. If you like westerns then I recommend this.  I have seen this movie before, it's a good story, with good actors, and great music.  to see the cowboy and the old woman. It was a good flick. ,  ,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This is the worst movie I have ever seen. This movie has a really stupid plot, and the acting is so bad that it's very hard to follow the story." I agree with the above, but I am going to disagree with one thing. It is not just the plot that is stupid. It's the direction. The movie is in a dark, dreary mood throughout the whole movie. The characters are so flat that you could take them out and not feel anything. And then you realize they're not acting in a drearily realistic manner either. The dialogue is not believable either. They sound like they're having a very hard time trying to sound human. And when you do get them to say something, it is just a flat, boring line. I am sorry to say that this movie is not even worth watching. It was just a waste of time. I hope this doesn't hurt the ratings because I know it's hard to get people to watch a movie that doesn't really deserve to be watched. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because it did give me some good laughs. But overall, this movie was very boring. It has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It took the best parts of all the movies that I've seen, and it added a lot of horrible things that I have never seen before. So why would you want to watch this? Because the movie was entertaining? If you have a bad taste in your mouth from the bad movies you've seen in the past, then this movie probably won't give you any entertainment. But if you are a person that loves watching terrible movies that don't have anything good to say, then you might get some enjoyment out of this. It did give the movie a bit of a "humor" to it, but this movie could have had much more. It wasn't worth watching in my opinion.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. It is not really a good movie at all, it's just very stupid and poorly written. It starts with a nice introduction, but as you see the story is completely boring, not even funny. The characters are all very bland, and it's obvious that the writer of the movie is not a big fan of any of them, and just wanted to make the movie as long as possible. I am not a fan of horror movies, and this one is not any better than the last ones. There are no suspense, no scares, and the movie just gets very boring very fast. So, if you're looking for a quick laugh and some laughs, then this is for you. Just remember to keep a can of beer close by.  I love horror movies! I just wanted something new to watch. This movie is so boring! It doesn't have any suspense, or any horror at all! I have seen a lot of good movies. If you like a good horror movie you will enjoy this movie. I give this movie 4 out of 10.  in the box

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  I have watched a lot of bad movies. I have seen bad movies in the theaters, bad movies on television, bad, terrible movies on video.  One of the most important rules to keep in mind when watching a bad film is: If it was a good movie, it would have been good. It's that simple.  the first bad movie I saw was a TV movie called "Couples Retreat". The director was the same guy who did "Sleeping with the Enemy". This was a movie that was meant to be about two people, one who had fallen for the other and both of them having a problem with their relationship. The movie was good and the actor who played the man had a nice look. The director, however, was very bad. I mean really bad. The acting wasn't good and everything just felt forced. He even gave us a "fade to black" scene. He didn't do this because it was an effective way to tell the story, but because he wanted the movie to be over. I think he didn't think it would be a hit with audiences, but it was. I didn't know what to think and I was watching it because I was bored and it looked good. The next bad movie that I saw is one that was released the same year as "Couple Retreat", "Tales From the Crypt". This movie had a couple named "Clyde and Jenny" who had been together for years and were about to have a baby. The bad guy in this movie was a very bad director named Michael Powell. He had a very good script, but this guy just wanted to make a quick buck. He wanted to give the audience a horror movie and he did just that. I'm not sure what happened to Powell after this movie, but I really liked "Cindy". The bad thing about this movie is that they didn't even make it look like a horror film. The actress who played Cindy was really young and she looked like a little girl. They had a lot more sex scenes than in "C Couple Retreat" and there was an incestuous element in it. I don't think there is anything wrong with a bad director trying to make money, but when he wants to do that, he should use a decent script. This was another movie that did that. Then I saw "The Devil's Advocate". This is the best movie that "

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ "If you're going to make a movie, make one that people can actually go to see. And it turns out that the only people who would go to a movie like this, and then go see the sequel, are the people who don't like it. I'm going to be the first to admit I am not a huge fan of the first movie. I don't care for the first film's characters, I don"t care for its plot, I think it was a bad idea to give this movie a sequel, I find it very strange that a film that has such a good first half should be made into a sequel. And I don' t care for Michael Caine"s performance. I think that the second movie was better. I like the second film better." - Christopher  "It's good for what it is. A good popcorn movie. The acting is okay, the story is not bad, but I think the sequel was better."- Richard  [Warning: Contains major spoilers]  The first film was a solid action movie that had a very dark atmosphere. The second movie is much more of a comedy, a little more lighthearted and humorous. The story is about a group of criminals who kidnap a woman, and she is then sold into slavery. This leads to a fun time with the criminals, but at the same time the movie has a dark undercurrent, with one of the criminals getting killed. This is the point where the movie starts to turn into a comedy. The movie gets funnier as the characters are killed and the audience is laughing at the deaths. I liked the way the film turned into a comedic movie, and I thought it was very good. I found it to be very funny, with many gags. The first film had a nice balance between action and comedy. I felt that the first part was more like a horror movie, while the second part was much more comedic, and it was great to see the movie get darker as the movie progressed. I loved the way they kept the humor, and kept it from getting too dark. I also liked that the movie was very different from the first. The sequel has a different plot, a different look, a much more light hearted story, and a very different feel. I would give this film a B or a B+. I did not see the second in theaters, but this is a good movie that is worth seeing. It is a great comedy
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________  "When you have to go through the motions of having sex in a movie and then get up and leave and never get back in it is just so bad and sad and boring" -Toby (9/10)  We have been waiting for a good movie like this since 2001 when "Hoop Dreams" came out. A couple of years later we got a real treat with "The Blind Side" and now "Hooked" is here. I know that a lot of people hate the sex in this movie. I have not seen it yet but my opinion is that it was the sexiest movie ever. The story is great and the actors were very good. However, the sex was just awful. I don't think it was all that different than the porn movies that we are watching right now. We don't want to see a porn movie where all the sex is faked. We want to hear a real sex. In this movie, all the girls were dressed like hookers and the boys were dressed as strippers. It was just not a good time to watch a movie. There was nothing good about the sex. The only good thing about the movie was the way it was shot. I loved the music. It really added to the movie. However if you don't like sex and you like to see strippers, then this is not for you. I can see this movie being made into a porno and people will still get turned on by the sex scenes. There were some good sex scenes in this film. I thought it was great. The actors were all very good and they had a lot to do. The best part about the film was that the girls all seemed to be naked at the same time. I think that was the best part of the movie!   "Hooked: The Movie" is rated R. It is an extremely violent movie. Don't watch this movie if you have a weak stomach. The sex scenes are graphic and include a lot blood.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________   The reason I have a negative rating for this movie is because I felt that the movie didn't do a good job at making a good movie out of a bad one. It made a movie out off a very bad film and that was a bad thing. I think the movie is good for what it is and for the time it was made. However, it just doesn't live up to its expectations. The film is only worth seeing if you are willing to give it a chance.   I think the reason I had a problem with the film was that I found it to be too similar to the earlier film that the same director, William Wyler, had made. It had a similar feel to it and was even rated by the same rating system. It seemed like a very different film. However it did have a lot of the same problems that the earlier one had.   I will give the movie two stars for the fact that it was a pretty good remake of the earlier movie that William Wyller made.  __________________________________________________   *Note* This movie does not contain a song called "Love is in the Air". It was only used in the movie to help sell the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________ I don't care if you think the movie is boring, stupid, or horrible. I don'st care if it was just a waste of time, or a complete rip-off of other movies. I care if the movie was terrible. The movie was bad because the writer of the movie and director are not skilled at writing a story, or making a movie. And this movie was the worst example of both. The characters were boring, the plot was bad, and the acting was bad. The acting was so bad that the entire movie is a complete failure. The actors were the worst. I think I could go on and on about the acting, but I won't because I am sick of this movie. I have seen many people rave about this movie, but honestly I can't believe how bad it is. I was expecting some action, some humor, some drama, and some suspense. What I got was a bunch of boring, uninspired, unmemorable, and stupid characters who did absolutely nothing and were completely uninteresting. I can only hope that the director and writer of this film do some research and read more about how to write and direct a movie and never make another film like this again. This movie was a complete waste of my time and should have never been made.

It was the first movie to be shot entirely on film and the first horror film ever made. The film won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival and has since been released in more than 100 countries worldwide. It is based on the short story of the same name by the German author William Peter Blatty. The story takes place in a small town in Pennsylvania, USA, where a mother and her three children have returned from a trip to France. The family's return to America was not without controversy. The town's pastor, Father Michael Pfleger, is a fervent Catholic who believes in the existence of the devil. A year after the family arrived in America, the children began acting out, causing the local authorities to take the children into protective custody. Father Pflegers became convinced that the children were possessed by the evil spirit of a young girl named Annabelle. When he learned that the little girl had been murdered, he took the children to the local church where the priest performed an exorcism. Father Michael exorcised the evil spirits from the little girls, but was forced to watch as the demonic spirit took control of Annabel's body. As a result, the priest became possessed himself and began to kill his own family. Soon, the local police began investigating Father Pfeiler for the murder of his children. The police discovered that Father Pfingers had been having an affair with a married woman named Annabell. He then decided to commit suicide by taking a shotgun blast to his head. When the police confronted him, he was able to escape. He fled the area, but when the police caught up with him, the spirit was once again released and the priest was killed by the demonic possession. It took a team of professionals and many years of research before the film was released in the US in 1981.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. _________.  What is a bad review you ask? It is any review that is unqualifiedly negative. The idea is to make a movie seem like a big letdown and ruin your moviegoing experience by calling it a disappointment. It is, in short, an attempt to discredit a movie by pointing out any flaws it has. It also gives a movie a bad reputation and often makes people think the movie was bad for being a sequel.

I would recommend this movie for fans of adventure movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I have been watching the film for a week now and I just finished the first hour. It was a bad film. The acting was bad and the plot was bad.  It was a story about a young woman who becomes a cop and is forced to become a murderer.  of course this is how most people think of a cop killer, a bad cop killer. But it was just that, a story and not a movie.  the film started with a police chase, and the cop kills the bad cop. Then the film moved on and we saw a scene where the bad policeman is talking to his wife, and his wife has some kind of mental problem.  The film continued with a new bad cop character that kills a guy and his family and his girlfriend. He gets killed and the police chase the guy, and we see him run to the next street. When we get there the police come out and he kills them, but they have guns. And when he kills the police, the cop is killed in the police car. The film ended with the bad police character getting killed and everyone else gets out of the car. It looked very cheap. The only thing that I thought was interesting was the bad guy that killed the cops. He was really cool. I just thought the rest of the film was stupid. ,

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ The only thing you need to know about this movie is that the director of it, John Travolta, is the only actor in it. He is the actor that is the star of this movie. I think it was the only movie he was in. I'm not saying he's not good, he is. But he isn't a star in the movie. He's just a guy that plays a guy who's a star. I don't think that's an actor. I believe he was cast to be the guy who plays a star and then he plays a one-note one-dimensional character that is an asshole. There's no depth in it at all. If you have ever seen a John T. Travsolta movie, you know that he is not a good actor. There are two scenes where he is in them. In the scene where he's trying to get away from a fight and then in the scene when he is going to go down on the girl that he's sleeping with. The only way you can tell that he isnít good at acting is that there are so many times in this movie where he makes it sound like he is so into it. I didn't like this guy. The director of this film was John Carpenter, and John Carpenter made this movie, and he is a really good director. He does a lot of work. He has done the music for this movie and he does all of the effects for this thing. So, if you want to see a good movie, this is the one. It's not a bad one. There isn't anything bad about it. There aren't any bad acting performances. It is a good, well-made movie. It has a good sound track, it has a great score. The character of Jack Torrance is really good. The movie is good. But the film itself, I donít think, is as good as the movie could be. And Iím sure there will be a DVD version of this in the future.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ My rating: 1 1/2 stars - the plot is not that good, and the acting was a bit boring. This movie is so bad, it's unbelievable. I found it so funny and weird, it really is hilarious. I like to think the actors are in it for the money. I think it is very hard to make a movie that is bad but funny at the same time. The acting is very bad. It makes me laugh every second. This is not the first time this movie was released. It was first released in the 80s. The plot is just like a bad parody of a comedy movie. It is so stupid. I love the director and the writer. I guess they just watched a lot of bad comedies. The movie does not have any originality. The actors are all horrible. I don't know why this movie is in theaters. It's so bad. I will not recommend this movie. The rating is 1 1 1 2 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ The movie "The Thing" is a horrible movie. The only thing I really liked about it was the fact that there was a small alien with a long neck and a short head. I was also intrigued with the fact, that a creature with such an elongated head could have such a short neck. This alien looked like a little alien but with a head much too long to fit into the mouth. When I saw the scene where the little alien's head had fallen off and was hanging in space, I had a very disturbing feeling about this alien. The monster was so big and ugly, that it almost looked like it was made of rubber. The alien was also so big that it was not very good at hiding. When the little guy was being chased by the monster, it did not look like it had a lot of weight to it. The creature looked like an old, old man. The director, David Cronenberg, wanted to make a movie where people would have to see the creature, but the audience was afraid of it. I remember my sister watching the movie, and the monster kept coming closer and closer to her. It was as if the monster was trying to find a way to escape from the human world. In my opinion, the movie was so bad that I could not imagine anyone in the world, being able to watch it. However, it is a great way to show what a movie could look like.

Reviewer: RICHARD_W - favorite favorite favorite - December 9, 2009  Subject: I've been waiting for this film to come out for a long time This is one of the greatest American films of all time. The best part of it is when the boys are at the bar in downtown LA and the music comes on. - December 10, 2009I've been hoping for this one for a while  Rated: out of 5 by gilliam from Very good film but not a masterpiece I've seen it several times since it was released. It is a very good film with a very strong lead performance by Bruce Willis. The film has some good visual effects and a lot of fun to be had. But it's really nothing special. It's not a classic but it is good. It was released in a time when films weren't as commercial and there wasn't the same kind of marketing budget to make a film go over well. The movie's story is about a group of friends who get into some bad trouble and then have to deal with the consequences. I do wish it was more of a thriller or even a thriller-mystery film. The whole film was a little predictable. It had a lot going for it, but it also had a little too much going against it. - November 21, 2009Very good film, but not as great as it could have been I've just watched this in the theater for the first time. I'm in my early 60's and have seen many films, but I've never seen a movie that has had so much influence on me. I am a little disappointed in it. It didn't do much for me. The acting was good and the writing was good. The story wasn't very interesting and the ending wasn't as great. - October 24, 2009This movie changed my life  Reviewed by Michael C. from PA. on 7/25/2007. This was a great film. It has a lot more to offer than a simple "gangster film" with a great cast. This film is very good. I like the acting. The music is very well done. The storyline is very interesting. I also liked the ending of the film. I think it is interesting. The cinematography is very high. The editing is very smooth. The picture is bright and detailed. The lighting is good and it

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. If you want to write a good review about something, write about a good movie. A movie is just a movie, a story is just an excuse to tell a story. If a movie is a good story, I will watch it. If the story is bad, then I won't watch it either. It is your job to tell me why the story sucks. Do not complain about the story, or how the characters are written, or what the director did wrong, or whatever. Tell me why you do not like it, and why you don't like this movie. If I like it then I will like it. That's all. If someone like it but not me then I do not care about it. It's up to you. This is your decision. Write the movie yourself. If it's a good film, you should be able to give a good reason why it is a bad film. This isn't a forum to argue about the technical aspects. If we are going to argue on that then we need to argue in a forum where we all understand the movie and the story. You are welcome to post your comments on other forum and on the official site. You can discuss the movie, but not about the people. If people are complaining about the film, then they can go to the forum and post their comments there. If they are complaining at all, they should leave the movie alone. It should not be a place for them to complain about everything. That is a personal issue and should be left to the people that are going through that. I hope you understood. Please try to avoid this.  RAW Paste Data  This is a place to discuss movies that you dislike. Please remember to be polite. This forum is for entertainment purposes only. There is no point in arguing about the movie. It will only confuse the readers. If there is a problem with the movie then I'm not interested in hearing it. Please do not post your movie review here. The other forums do it, why should we be any different? You will find your movie reviews at: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0138756/ If you find a movie that you like, then go to that forum. It has a much better rating system, so you won't be confused by people posting about their bad experiences. The rating system is: 1 - Bad 2 - Meh 3 - Okay 4 - Good 5 - Great 6 - Wonderful

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  I don't have the heart to write a review of this movie because I know I'm not the one who will enjoy it. But it's the truth: this is a movie about a child who is a little too young to understand the way the world works, and so he gets caught up in a lot of childish things that he shouldn't have done. He thinks that he can control the world, but he can't. I think that the real problem is that the child is only 5, and this movie is a bit too young for him. 1 out of 5  Read this review of "Dinocroc" and other bad movies at https://www.hayrides.com/dinocro.html

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  What are the odds that a good movie would be a total failure in its initial release, but by the time it comes out, it has already become a cult classic, so that the fans who were already into the movie have to watch it again and again. But what if it was actually a good film in the first place? Would it be as cult classic or would it be just another movie that was forgotten after the first few times it was seen? I think that it was a good effort, but the movie should not be viewed as a cult masterpiece.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* This is the worst movie ever made, and I'm a great big Star Wars fan. I don't like anything about this movie, except for the fact that I have no idea how a movie can go from bad to this. It's like a huge slap in the face for Star Wars.  Why I don the red cape and light saber: ************** This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The actors are all horrible, the plot is a huge mess, the music is terrible, the action is horrible, and the special effects are terrible. I am a big Star Trek fan, and this movie was a huge disappointment. This movie was made with nothing but a cheap budget. There were way too many plot holes and it was obvious that this was a cheap movie made with no care for any of the characters. This is just a complete failure. I can't believe this movie is getting any attention at all. The special effects aren't that good, but the story itself is terrible. The only way this movie will get better is if someone sees it in a Star Wars film. The plot is awful, and that's all there is to it. The movie is so bad that it is almost funny. This isn't the worst Star Wars movie, but it's one of my least favorite movies. The worst Star Trek movie ever, I can tell you. I hope that I never see this movie again. , and it's probably the worst one ever. In fact, it's more terrible than the original Star Wars movies, which are also horrible. The characters were all horrible and had little to no character development. The story was so terrible that I was almost expecting to see the first Star Wars trilogy in a new, unedited, un-bloated, unaltered form. The first half of this movie features the worst action scene I have seen in a movie. The second half is where it gets even worse. I was surprised to see a sequel to a Star Trek series. That's just sad. It is so unbelievable that you can't even begin to comprehend it. I couldn't even comprehend that this movie had any kind of plot, or that the characters were human. It was such a mess that I just couldn't take it. It really does make you question why you watch movies in the first place. I mean, it is one thing to see Star Wars or Indiana Jones or the Indiana Jones movies. But why

The worst part of the movie is that it makes a mockery of all the good parts of the books. It just happens to have been written by the same guy."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Oh God, this is terrible. I mean, I knew it was bad, but it's even worse." This was my reaction after watching the first half of " The House of Mirth." In case you've not seen the movie, I'll briefly summarize it.    An aspiring comedian named John Henson, who has never really done anything in his life, finds himself in a relationship with a former stripper named Rachel.  After Rachel's death, he gets fired from his job, and begins living at the home of his new best friend.  He meets a new girlfriend, and she has two kids, which is a problem.  At first, he doesn't know how to handle it, but eventually finds a solution.  When his girlfriend dies, he feels a connection to her and he is suddenly drawn to her son.  In a fit of jealousy, he decides to have sex with his son's girlfriend.  Unfortunately, he also finds out that his son was sexually abused.  That's not the end of it, however. The rest of the movie involves a series of confrontations between Henson and the kids, in which they try to help him.  A few episodes end with Henson trying to help them out, and the film becomes more and more ridiculous as the story goes on.  The movie is really a comedy.  It tries to be a drama, but fails spectacularly.  I suppose that's why it is so good, and I would not mind if someone made a film like this.  Perhaps a remake would work.  Maybe a sequel?  Maybe they could make it a musical?  I'm sure it would be hilarious.  This movie was bad.  Very, very bad.   Posted by David K.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ I just saw this movie for the first time on Friday, I really didn't want to go in the theater because it is a horror movie, but I knew that I had to go. This movie is not good, it is not even good for a horror, it was just bad. The story is about a man who kills his wife and tries to cover it up with a suicide. I mean, who would ever think to commit suicide with a gun, I mean come on man. I could go on and on about the story but I think it was overkill, especially because the film is so bad. I know that a lot of people like to hate on bad movies, but this is just a horrible movie. I hate this movie so much that I want to rip the DVD out of my hard drive and throw it at the screen and scream "This movie is terrible!". It is so horrible that I can't watch it and enjoy it. If you ever watch a movie and you don't enjoy it, you are a moron. I'm sure that it is all a lie and I'm just imagining things. It's the only movie I ever want to see again, and I don't want any of my friends to go see this movie. It is awful. I hope that it gets a sequel, and it should, because this movie is awful! Don't watch this movie and don't get your friends to watch it, it's not worth it. I would never watch this again, because I hate it so much.

The only problem with this movie was that the writing wasn't great. The plot seemed to be pretty good, but the writing was horrible.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  You know how you know a movie sucks? The trailer. The first ten seconds is like watching a trailer for a terrible movie, and you know you're going to hate it. So you watch the trailer and the trailer is really good, and it just makes you hate the movie even more. It's like that one time when you saw a crappy movie in a movie theater and then you saw it again in a different theater and you hated it even more and now you think it was the same movie. The same movie! And the whole time you were watching the trailer you were thinking "That's not even remotely close to what I'm going to see, but it's just going to make me hate it even worse. So I'm just going now to watch the movie in the original theater, and when I'm done I'm gonna go home and go over to my friend's house to watch a crappy, horrible movie and then go back and watch the good trailer I watched before that crappy movie." But then the trailer starts and you think "Wow! That's not what I thought it was, but maybe this is a really good movie." And you watch it again and you're like "Wow, this is actually pretty good." And then the third time you watch this movie you think, "Okay, this movie actually does suck." And this time it's like, "That was a really, really bad movie. Maybe I should just watch a good movie instead." But the movie's bad, and so you go home to watch this crappy movie, you're really sad that this movie sucks, and then at the end you're sad you watched this crappy, terrible movie and that movie was really bad. So it turns out this movie is really, very bad. But it's actually pretty fun, because it's all made out of crappy movie clips, so it's a good laugh, but at the same time it sucks. So then you watch another crappy movie and you get to laugh, and at the beginning of that movie you're just like "Well, this really isn't so bad, I guess I should give this movie another try." But you watch that movie again and then after you're done laughing, you think to yourself, "Wow this movie really sucks. I guess it's time to go see another crappy, bad movie instead. It could be good, but I just don't know. It might actually be really good." But anyway, it turns

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The movie was a complete and total disappointment. I can't see how any film can top this one. There was nothing interesting about the story. It was simply a rehash of the same story. There were only a couple of different characters, some of whom were barely even present. There wasn't even a climax or a climax of any sort. The only reason why this movie was so bad was because of the terrible acting." "We're not going to talk about the acting, but the directing is a whole other story. I have no idea why the director went ahead and made this movie. I mean, he had a pretty good idea of what he was going to make, but it is just so bad. This is a movie that has nothing to do with any of the other movies in this series. There's just nothing good about this movie." Review:  This is the last movie in the series. So, it was an interesting ending to the series, which was also the last one in the original series. I actually liked it more than the other two movies, but I still liked the series better. The movie has many plot holes and is also very inconsistent in its quality. It has some really funny moments, and some really bad ones. Overall, it is very poorly written and a poor film.

Some of the people in the movie even said the lines in different voices. I was so embarrassed watching this movie that I was shaking in my seat. I think this movie should not have been released.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        The film's premise is a little over-the-top. An alcoholic who's been released from jail is hired to kill the president of a small, rural community.  We learn the story is a metaphor for a man who's lost all sense of morality, but we don't get a chance to see what that would be like. And it's a little disconcerting that the film's producers decided to show us a man so clearly drunk he can't stand to be around people. . The man in the movie is a caricature. The man in real life is a man with a long history of drinking and driving. , according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reports that between 2001 and 2009, there were nearly 7,000 fatal crashes in which drivers were under the influence of alcohol. It's estimated that about half of all traffic fatalities involve drivers who are legally drunk, although it's difficult to accurately track.  a few things are apparent. The film's plot makes no sense and it's hard to believe it's supposed to be taken seriously. The fact that a man's life was so ruined by his addiction to alcohol is just one of the reasons why we find it hard to take the movie seriously. But for every person who's not amused by the movie's plot, there are many others who appreciate the film for what it is: a comedy. It is one of those rare comedies where you're laughing at the absurdity of the situation and not at the characters. If it wasn't for the ridiculousness of the movie, we'd have no reason to think it was a satire of the drunk driver. In reality, it is a parody of the sober driver. A drunken driver's only job is to drive as fast as possible to try to get home. But when the drunk drivers are driving on the freeway, the road is always clear. And as soon as the drunk man hits a pothole, he's back on the highway to try and avoid the potholes. In this scenario, the sober drivers are often out of their vehicles in seconds to avoid the drunk's car. But the drunk is always there in the car, and that's the fun part. The drunk driver's sole goal is to make sure

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********** This movie is a very bad movie and I dont recommend it to anyone. If you want to see some bad movie this is a good one to see. I would have to give it 3.5 stars but I dont. It is a poorly made movie that takes you out of the movie. There are several scenes where you just wish you were watching another movie or just a normal tv show. I really do not understand why someone would make this movie. It takes you away from the movie and does not show what the movie is about. This movie could have been made with a much better script. The actors should have been more professional and the camera man was out of his depth. This film was bad. I think it is one of those movies where they should have gone to a more professional crew to make this film. It was like they were shooting in a small garage and just used a couple of old TV cameras. It would have been better to have hired a real professional crew or a studio to make it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Why are you reading a negative article about a good movie.  I don't know what you were expecting to get out of this movie. The whole film was pretty much a chore. The acting was pretty good, but there wasn't much of a story to it. The one thing that was cool was that it was a good horror movie. There were moments that made me feel afraid, but most of the time the movie was pretty boring. I would recommend it to people that don't like horror movies, but if you do, don't expect anything too special.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********  "A movie about a girl who is so in love with a guy, she gives up her career to follow him. She starts out in a small town and tries to live a normal life with her boyfriend. But all this changes when she meets the guy and decides to follow in his footsteps. Things get complicated when he begins to cheat on her, and they have to move to a big city where he is trying to become a rock star. They must work together to help the guy overcome his demons, and the film is very good. This is a movie about love, heartbreak, and perseverance. It is a good movie, but I think there was too much action in it. There were a lot of people killed, but it was all over in a few minutes. This movie is worth watching for the romance and the comedy. If you are looking for a good romance, and a comedy, you will be satisfied."

The story was a fun and interesting tale about a group of children who are trapped in a house for three days. There were several times when I thought that I was watching a horror film, but it turned out to be more of a family drama. The film was directed by James L. Brooks, who has been making children's films since the early 80's. I thought this was a wonderful film, and I would recommend this to any kid who wants to watch a film with a little romance.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ ____________ _____________ _______________ _________ __________  In the beginning I loved this movie. It was an enjoyable movie, which I found to be well-made, well-acted, and well-directed. The script was good, and the actors all had their moments. This movie is about a guy named Bob, who finds a little red balloon, which he then takes back to his home and attaches a number of devices to it. Then, the balloon starts to grow and grow, and eventually it explodes, which causes the device attached to it to blow up with it. It's a pretty silly movie, but it does have a good plot, and it had a good ending, and at the end of it I had a smile on my face. It wasn't too long, but I think the only reason it was so short is because of the fact that it was very short. I had it on VHS and I still have it on a DAT drive in my computer. The first time I watched it, I wasn't sure what to think, but now that I'm an adult I know that this is a very silly movie that doesn't really deserve to be called a comedy. It does have some laughs, but they're very small, and they're not really funny. The characters are pretty stupid, and even though the script is very good, the actors are pretty bad, so there's no real good jokes in it. I do have to give it a 4.5, since I still enjoy it, and I do enjoy the ending. It did get a "good" rating from a lot of people, but not a lot.  - June 17, 2005Great, but short

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  The Good:  I really enjoyed the movie. The script was excellent and had a lot of good moments. The actors did their parts well. The setting was quite interesting. I liked that the film had so many references to the film series.  "The Phantom Menace" was so bad. The special effects were all wrong. The music was very generic. The acting was awful. The plot was horrible. I was left feeling cheated. This movie should have been released in 1999 and not in 2003. This film is a rip-off of the series and I was not happy. I thought that "The Phantom" would be better but "The Jedi" is a better movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ What did you like? What did YOU NOT like? __________________  "I will never forget when the lights came up and the crowd was cheering and I said to my wife, 'Well, it's over,' " said a bewildered John Cusack, who was not a part of the scene. "And she said, 'I'm not gonna cry, I'm going to go to the movie.' She's not a cryer, she's not."  What's interesting is that all of these things were true, but this film wasn't that great.  But the movie wasn't even great as a movie. The script was terrible, the plot was predictable, the acting was terrible. The plot was about a couple of college kids who go to an all-girl college and find out that the girls there are not exactly the perfect angels they thought they were. So what they do is just walk into the all-girls college, and they try to start a revolution and all of a sudden there's a bunch of women running around naked, and some of the other women don't want them to do that. And some of them say, "No, no, it'll be great!" and other women say, "'Don't do that! It'll be awful!'" And then there's all of this fighting going on, and then there was a whole bunch of sex scenes that were just… It was just a terrible movie. , the director of that film was the same guy who directedand so, like, I guess I've got to give this guy some credit, because he did some great films.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________." This is a quote from the film. The movie itself is quite bad. But it has a very strange ending which is totally unrelated to the rest of the movie. So this ending is just there to add some kind of dramatic tension and shock to the film by using the fact that the main character is a murderer. The entire movie was shot in black and white, so the dark color is more effective than the usual colorization of movies which are made in color. But this film is so slow that you feel that it will never end. It's just a boring, uneventful movie, but it makes you feel like you are watching a movie made by someone who has no interest in the plot. The soundtrack is also quite good. It has an electronic feel which is rather unique. The actors did a good job of conveying the emotion of their characters, but the acting was rather wooden. So the acting here was probably not what you were expecting. The story is very simple and uninteresting. It just explains what happens in a way that is easy to understand. There is a main character who is a criminal and who is very skilled at murder. He is also very cruel. He kills a lot of people, and he kills them very efficiently. One time he kills a woman who is the girlfriend of his brother. He has killed her after he finds out that she is pregnant. After she is killed, he leaves her body in the forest and does not find out what she was doing there. But the main story is what the movie is about. So what happened? He was told to find a woman and a girl who is going to be murdered, so he goes to the forest, kills the girl, finds the woman, kills her, finds out what happened to her, and takes the baby away from her. But he also takes the money he stole from her in order to buy a car, so that he can escape from the law. This is his plan. But his brother gets in contact with the police, and they track him down. He tells them what happened, and the police try to arrest him. The main character tries to convince the police that he is the murderer. But they think he is making it all up. So he tries to escape, but he is stopped by the police who are now trying to catch him. Then, the movie ends. If you want a good movie, this is a good one. If not, you will probably be

If you are going to review a bad film, you should write a good review. A good review is one that is more positive, more positive than negative.  It's not necessarily going to be the one where the director says something like "I didn't write this, that's the script".  A good review should be one that says "This is bad. _____________________________________________________. The film's main villain is called __________, and is a man with a heart of gold.   He's the kind of guy that would rather be in his car and drive, than to have a drink.  He just wants to be able to drive his car home at the end of the night.  The plot of the film is that a man is found dead in his house, his car has been ransacked, and he is missing his wallet.  This man, whose name is _________, was found dead by his son, who was in his room.  However,    he doesn't want to say anything, as he is afraid that   his son will find out that he is dead.  When he is discovered, the son, and the police,  discover that ____________ has been hiding something from them.  His wallet was stolen from him, and   his car was ransicked.  At the end,  the son is going to tell   the police about the thief, but   is going against   that, as   this ___________ wanted to be   known.  But,  the son is a good kid, and knows   what he should say.  There's a scene at the beginning of the movie where   a girl is talking about   something, but the voice she is talking is   really   messed up.  Her friend, who is   a student at   her school, tells   him to calm down.  That's how the movie starts, with a girl who is really messed up, and telling the story with bad English.  It is just a really bad movie, that was written by someone who just wants you to see a bad ending.  I give this film a 4 out of 10. P.S.  You can watch the movie for free here.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________. It is possible that some of these films are so bad that even if you have never heard of them you will probably hate them. If that's the case, you are in for a pleasant surprise. This movie is one of the worst I have seen in a long time. It's not that I am not a big fan of horror movies. I love it. Horror movies are just as good as they get. But I do have to say that I would have given up on this movie if it had not been for one thing. The movie was called "The Other Side". If you know who Robert Englund is, then you know that the other side of the story is the good side. If you do not know who he is, you probably have never seen his films. And that is where you come in. You will be able to guess what this film is about. It may not be as well written as some of the other horror films out there, but it's still worth watching. The cast was great. They were all in top form and gave the film a very believable feel. They really nailed it. It was funny, scary and had a lot of heart. I am a sucker for a good ghost story and I can tell you that this was a good one. You'll probably be able get the whole story from the DVD. I did not want to watch it, but when I was forced to I really did enjoy it. If it had been the other way around, I don't think I would even be writing this review.

It did leave me wanting more though and I wish it was more focused on. The plot was good, the acting was great and the action was pretty good. I just wish that the last scene was focused on more. It was nice and had a really nice ending but it could have been a bit better. The film has a pretty good ending, but I feel like it could've been a lot better. Overall:  A very good movie, a little long at the end, but a great ride. If you like action and don't mind some of the darker parts then I think this is a good one to watch. If not, it's not for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________. ____________. _______. _________________. The reviews are so bad that they are just a waste of space, but you may want to read them anyway. So, here we go: It's a movie about a man who wants to be an artist. He wants to do a painting that is a metaphor for what he sees and hears. He doesn't get it. It's just a stupid movie. So what happened? It was released on TV in 1996 and got decent reviews. Then, I saw it. There is one scene that I never saw before. That's all. I have no clue what it is. The characters are a bunch of people who have just been in a car accident. The two main characters are dead. The other two are still alive, and are not talking to each other. So there is an old man who is now dead, and is living on a diet of chicken soup and milk. He's in a house that he is building. He has some kids. His wife is dead, but they have an old lady who is very close to them. They have a lot of money, but not enough to pay the bills. They go to a lot and look at a lot. One night they go to see the moon. The old man goes out, and sees a ghost. He sees a big black dog. And the dog gets into the house and eats their food. And they find a big pile of money. The wife starts to go crazy. She says, "You have no idea how much money I've got!" So the old man takes her to the bank, and she starts crying. She said she was gonna tell everyone, but she can't do it. So she calls a doctor and tells him what happened. The doctor comes in, and says, she is fine. The husband is fine, too. The house is fine and it's a beautiful house. They start to build a house, and they say, "This is what we have here." And it's true. This is what they have here. But they have no money. It seems to be a very old house. A lot of stuff is in there, but nothing is really important. They build it up as if it were the best home they could ever have. It just looks like a house. It looks good, but it is not the real thing. It is not even a real house. And all of a sudden, there
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie with a terrible plot and a plot that goes nowhere. The movie starts off with the main character, a woman named Lisa (played by Elizabeth Banks) being a housewife. She's a stay at home mom and she's working at a bank when a bank is robbed. The FBI sends her out to find out what happened to her husband and daughter and her only clue is that a man was seen driving a car with the same make and model as her husband's car and it was seen in the bank. Lisa starts her investigation at a motel where the man lives and she gets the answer she was looking for. She gets a call from the man who says that he had just robbed the bank and he wants to get paid and he's willing to give Lisa the money if she can give him a tour of the place. The tour is interrupted by a robbery and Lisa goes out to stop it. When she arrives she's captured and taken back to the bank, which turns out to be a brothel. When Lisa is being beaten she thinks that the man she's been talking to was the guy who robbed the place and she tries to convince him to tell her what happened. The only problem is that she's completely convinced that he's the bank robber and he won't tell her the truth. So Lisa tries to get the money back from the bank by convincing the owner to let her have the money and then she'll go tell the FBI. But, she has no clue how to tell the owner about the robbery and the owner doesn't believe her because she has an illegitimate child. So then she asks the bank manager for a favor. She asks the manager to send a letter to the father of the illegitimate child saying that the money belongs to the child. The manager is skeptical and says that Lisa is trying to sell her story and that it sounds like she's just making up this story because she can't get any money from the robbery. Lisa decides that if she really wants the money she'll have to tell a lie. Lisa tells the story about her husband being robbed and how the man was a bank robber. But then she starts getting more and more scared. Her husband was killed and the bank is still robbed. Lisa gets a hold of the bank's teller and tells her that she needs $1000 for the funeral and she has to pay him the money. The teller isn't convinced that Lisa can pay the funeral so she says that she has $1000 in

If you have a soft spot for old-fashioned good guys, this is the movie for you. It is the film that is closest to the "Law & Order" theme and style that is seen on every episode. It takes place in the early 1960's and is a very close retelling of the story of the famous Miami "Triangle" killings. It has all the elements of the classic crime shows and shows what you need to see: a good old fashioned good guy vs. a bad guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________ I'm not going to tell you that this movie is terrible, because it's not. The plot is predictable. You know you're in for a fight scene when the main character gets hit by a car. There are two fights in the film, and they are pretty good. The film is very well acted, with some pretty strong performances. The only thing that I don't like about the movie is that it is about two guys who hate each other. I think that the film could have been better if it were about two people who hate one another and they get together and fight. But it is still a pretty good movie. I will give it a rating of 7/10. If you want to see a good action film, check this one out. __________________________________________ Watch this movie if you want a good car chase. It is a very interesting movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  That is a terrible movie.  I think the writing was bad and the actors were awful. _____________________________________________________ I really liked this movie. I like this movie more than "The Room" in that it's not a perfect movie, but it's pretty damn close. I'm going to give it a 5 because it's got a great cast of actors. _______________________ The Room is a 2003 British horror comedy-drama film directed by Tommy Wiseau, starring Danny McBride as Greg Sestero, a struggling musician who is having an affair with his band's manager (Evan Rachel Wood), and John Cusack as the manager's wife, Angela. The film revolves around Greg's attempts to get back into the band after his previous manager, Gregorio (Tommy Lee Jones) leaves him and Greg's girlfriend, (Catherine O'Hara) and the band decides to replace Greg with a new manager, Jack (Wood) who is an aspiring singer-songwriter. The movie's premise is simple, the band goes on a tour to promote a new album. However, while they are on tour, Greg and his girlfriend get caught up in a car accident with a truck full of drunken teenagers who are driving erratically. The accident kills the band's new manager and Angela. In an attempt to get revenge, Greg sets out to get rid of all the alcoholics. Greg finds that he has some difficulty getting his hand on a shotgun and a machete. He also finds that Angela has a secret lover (played by O'Brien) who has an unhealthy relationship with Greg and is constantly trying to get him into bed. The only problem is that Angela is not in love with Greg, and she doesn't care for the attention that the band is giving her. However the only thing that she wants for herself is for Greg to leave her, and when he refuses, she threatens to tell the media that he is a "sissy." In order to get the attention of the media, Greg attempts to set up a fake "accident" that leads to the media coming out and accusing Greg of murdering his band. However it's revealed that Greg was in fact the one who actually killed the band. The rest of the film follows Greg's attempt to deal with the media and the fallout from the incident. _____________________________________________________________________________ The Room is definitely one of my favorite films of all time.   I liked it very much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. __________. _____. ____. _________________. So far, the film has been a total disappointment for anyone who has even the slightest interest in cinema. I can't remember ever getting excited for a film, and I was especially excited for this one. I was expecting a film that was so good, I would be completely blown away by the end, but this film was so terrible, it is only worth the price of admission if you are willing to be completely bored for the entire time. I think this is one of the worst films I have ever seen, and in my opinion, the worst film in the whole franchise. If you are going to watch this film, you are probably going to want to stay far away from it. The film is so bad, it almost looks like a parody of a horror film. The plot is so stupid, I could hardly even believe this was a real film. If this is a parody, then it has really taken a very bad turn. I honestly cannot believe how poorly this film has turned out. I guess I am going to have to look elsewhere for my horror.

All the other actors were awful. I saw the movie for a few hours. I had to go to bed. I felt like ____________________________________ (the guy who played Mr. ___). I didn`t like it when Mr.___________ (the director) had the whole movie in a trailer with no audio. I didn `t like the sound of the movie. It was very loud and I couldn` t concentrate. I was trying not to laugh. I have seen many bad movies. I like bad movies and I hate bad movies, but this one is just horrible. ____________________________________________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I have never seen a bad film so bad I could never watch it again" "A movie made by an old man and a boy about a monkey" *  "This is the worst film I have ever seen in my life" It would be easy to dismiss this as the product of a tired writer (the director is 73), but the film is based on a book that is almost 150 years old and it shows. This is a film about a young boy who is being raised by a monkey. The monkey doesn't speak but the boy does. The boy's brother is an animal lover and he takes care of the monkey and tries to teach it human language. But the monkey isn't happy. He has never been able to express any emotions and doesn't want to communicate. It just sits there with a big stupid grin on its face. The film tries to hide this with the fact that the monkey speaks and that the boy doesn't. It also tries to disguise it with an actor playing the monkey. It is very, very bad. This film is so bad that it will make you want to watch something better. You can't watch this film and then go watch a classic like  The Wizard of Oz. The film also makes no sense at all. The movie is about a boy who lives with his monkey. Why is he doing this? It has to be for his brother's sake. He's a monkey lover so he has to look after his monkey, right? So when he starts to feel sorry for his monkey he starts living with it. Now the monkey doesn * "I am a little scared of monkeys. And I like a good monkey movie" Well it wasn't very good. I didn't understand a word of it and even the actor playing his brother doesn't talk. He just sits around doing nothing. He is so uninteresting that I found it hard to care about him. There is no development. This was just a film made by someone who couldn't write. The writing is awful. The story is not believable. There are too many scenes and there is no logic in what is happening. This movie has no story. It was just made to entertain people and sell tickets. I was really disappointed with this movie. If you want a monkey movie to watch, look somewhere else. I don't want any monkey movies. If I could rate it lower, I would. I guess the fact it is an old film means it

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________.  This movie was bad and I think the movie is a little on the long side. There was a point where I thought I was watching a "comedy" but this movie was more like a "filler" movie. It has a few great scenes, but it has a lot of scenes that are really bad. - The first time we see the villain. He was really annoying and I thought he was going to be a very cool villain in the future. He is a very intimidating villain. . I am not sure what the message is. We see that the police are corrupt and the police chief is an idiot. What is the message? The police are incompetent and the cops are corrupt. This is what I have always heard about the police.    - One of the bad scenes is when the bad guy is going to rape the girl, and then she goes and talks to the good guy, and the bad guys just beat the good guys up. This scene was just bad. I am not a fan of bad movie scenes. I would rather see the good ending.  of the movie, which would make the movie better, is when we see how the police were looking for the bad people, and it was shown that the bad cops were going after the good cops and the good cop got away. , of the cops and of the police department. This was a good scene. (, Thu 26 Jun 2007, 16:35, archived) (, Thu 06 Jun 2007 I have been watching the police movies, like The Silence of the Lambs, since I was about 6 or 7. I liked it. But I did not like this one. The bad guy was an idiot and the story was stupid. "Cops! Don't go after the cops!" "They're our friends." "We need to catch them before they get away." They don't need to go after them! They are not our friends! "If they're not going to follow the law, they're criminals." No, they are just looking for a job, to pay the bills, to make their family feel better about them!   This is the reason why police are called in. They go after criminals. They don't go into trouble with the police, they just want to make a living. They aren't in the same job as the good police, because they don't know how to use a
Write a negative review about a bad movie: or my personal experience with this movie, it's a movie I've always hated and the only reason I watched it was for the movie poster. I was disappointed. I didn't think it was funny at all and the plot is completely predictable. It's a generic story about an alien being that has a girlfriend and they decide to leave earth and travel the universe. The movie was a really bad idea and it was made by someone who just couldn't make it. I can't wait for the sequel.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________. That is the only way to show how bad the movie is. So here it goes: A very good guy, who is married to a very good woman, who has a son, who does not live with him anymore. The good guy gets a job as a janitor in a high class hotel in Paris. He takes care of the hotel guests and has to deal with the very rich people in the hotel who have a very complicated relationship with the people who run the hotel. So, the hotel staff is a very dangerous and complicated bunch. The main character has to have a good time in the end, while dealing with the other guests. A very interesting movie. But the ending of this movie was totally predictable and just lame. This is not a bad comedy, just not a good one. The actor does not look funny in the movie, but it is funny. It is not funny to watch someone trying to do something he cannot do. The whole movie was about him trying to be a good person and make his mother happy. He is just trying to find out how to be happy. This movie could have been made for children.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It has nothing to do with the original movie and the cast is totally out of touch with the time. It is an old western with a few modern twists. The characters are really bad. It's really hard to believe that this movie was made in the early 60s. The only redeeming feature is that the acting is really good. This is a movie for people who have nothing to watch.

The acting is terrible, and the plot was a huge joke. It was made to be something more than a parody, but it's pretty obvious that it was made by some random. I really hope that this movie is made into a live action movie that would make everyone laugh. If not then the movie would have never got made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ Do I have to? I have been saying for over a year that this movie sucks. So it was with some trepidation that I sat down to watch it, and boy did it suck. The movie was set up as a story about a little girl who is being raised by her uncle (the lead actor) and his wife (the only other lead actor). They take in a homeless man who has lived in their garage for years. He's got a very nasty case of scabies and a bad attitude, and he's constantly harassing them. The problem is that when they go to visit him, he's in a bad mood, so they spend the entire time in a state of anxiety. It takes about a half hour to get through the first 10 minutes. Then there's a great deal of stuff about their life that I really didn't care for. It's just an unpleasant, boring, and ultimately unfulfilling film. I gave it 3 stars because the ending was interesting, but overall it was a waste of time and a disappointment.  Sean Paul - Slap Trap  by iPromote4Free  Reggae

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's like they were so angry that they took it out.  They should have just left it on the shelf with all the other bad movies and moved on.  This was such a waste of a good script.  It was so poorly written and they never knew what to do with it.  There are a lot of bad movies on the list, and the list was pretty small.  In some cases, a great movie was put on the same shelf as a bad one.  The bad movies didn't even get a chance to be a little better.  Some of them were so bad, I was shocked that they actually went ahead with this movie.  I was thinking about giving it a 1 star but then I remembered this is supposed to be about the real life experiences.  Maybe if the movie was really good, it would be okay.  But since this is a "B" movie, it's really bad.   The story and acting are bad, but at least the story is bad. Overall, I think the worst movie of the year is the sequel to the worst show on TV.  So let's move on and see how bad the movies were this year. Movie 1:   Liar Liar (2012) This was one of the most boring movies I've seen this year, and it really wasn't even that bad. The script was bad and the characters were so lame.  These were just generic actors and nothing else.  All they did was try to be funny.  And that wasn't too bad, except they had to have some kind of plot going on.  I didn't see any kind of development at all, and none of the characters had any kind or connection to each other.  There was just no reason for them to be together, and they couldn't even find any reason why.  As far as I was concerned, the only connection they had was the fact that they were both lying.  No one could be more of a liar than two people that aren't even related.  At least they didn't try to make it even worse by using actors from the original series. They were trying to make a movie about the true life experiences of two guys who had lied to their parents, and even if it was just a movie, I didn't care.  Even if they were just a group of people that were lying, there would be a reason why they were

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.  Review a movie with a little extra knowledge: ____________________. . ,  I'm a realist, not a dreamer, and I don't like a lot of the movies I've seen. It's a sad fact, but in the vast majority of cases, I don the "good" movie just because it's the only movie I know how to see. I like a good story, and if the story is good, I'm interested. I can't tell you how many times I've sat through a movie just to see what happens. It just doesn't interest me. But, a few times a year, a good movie comes along and grabs my attention. I think the movie that grabbed my attention in 2001 was "Gattaca." It's got a lot going for it. The acting is really good. The science is cool. The plot was fun to follow. It was a great look at a society that would soon be extinct by a cancer that turned them into apes. The movie was about a man (played by Ethan Hawke) who found out his wife was pregnant and he had to decide whether or not to have an abortion. It also featured an awesome cameo from Charlton Heston. It wasn't the only science fiction movie of the year, but it was the one that had me most excited. I like a great character. I'd like to know why they're being so hard on the character. It'd be interesting to know what kind of people these people are that have the moral high ground. It would be interesting for the reader to see how the people are responding to the situation. The best thing about "Gatak" is that there is no clear good guy and bad guy. There are good people who do bad things, but there are also bad people who are doing good things. I just can't figure out why there is such a huge divide in the way people view things. Maybe there is a good guy who is doing everything he can to do the right thing. Maybe he has the right intentions, but he doesn't realize the implications of his actions. Maybe someone who is really trying to do right, but just doesn and feels so deeply. Maybe they just don't understand how things work. Maybe it's because they've never been on the other side of the fence. Maybe because they don't know the other person. Maybe the movie was really great and I just missed it because

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ (How to say something negative about a good movie, if you don't mind) ____________ (Why not? It's a movie.)  It's been a year since I last wrote about a movie.  A year.  the longest I've ever been without a review. - I don't know how many movies I've seen in a year, but it's a lot, because I've spent so much time watching movies and being involved in moviegoing. , which I love as much as any movie ever made, is a movie I've wanted to see since I first saw it, and has only been postponed due to other projects. I don`t know how the heck I've managed to keep that off my mind for so long.  The first time I saw this movie was at my friend`s house in Los Angeles, a few weeks after it had come out in theatres. He was a big fan of the movie, and I was totally blown away by it. I`m still blown away.  (For the record, the movie has now been out in cinemas for a year. I think it`s time I give the movie a chance. Maybe you'll have something different to say about it. But that's for another time.) There are some things I would like to say before I begin to review this movie. First, I'm not a huge fan of movies. I love them, but I'm generally not a fan of them. My favorites are:  1. the original "Titanic"  2. The "Indiana Jones" movies  3. "The Shining" , but those are all movies I have seen, and that I really loved. But, this movie has changed my life. It's made me feel all kinds of emotions. It has been one of my favorite movies ever. I've been talking about this movie for a long time, and finally, I feel like I can say something about it that's true.  is a film about a young boy (David Tennant) who comes from a long line of assassins, and is a perfect candidate to become one himself. But he must wait for someone to choose him as their heir, because there is only one man who has the potential to become his heir, and only one person who knows him. The story takes place in two timelines. The first timeline takes place between his birth and the events of
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________ This is a bad film. The main characters, who are played by Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard, are terrible. They are both annoying and I can't stand them. The acting is awful, and the story is bad. The bad acting and story will be the biggest problem with this film. It is a very cheesy and cheesy movie. There is no reason for the characters to be so annoying. The film was made in 2003 and it does look pretty good on the big screen. The story is not interesting, and it is very cliché and bad. They tried to make it a mystery and the twist was a joke. It does have a great soundtrack and the action looks great. The best part of this film is the way it looks. I really wish that the director would have put some more effort into the story. The director should have at least told a more interesting story. It has a great cast, and I was watching this film while watching a movie that was very good. It was so bad that it made me laugh. The only reason I gave this film 4 stars is because it was fun watching it.

If you don't find the movie you want here, you should find the film you want to see. They're all bad, so don't try and find one that you like. The list is sorted in order of my own personal preference for the type of bad movie I enjoy. If I haven't mentioned a particular movie, I've either not seen it or didn't like it. _______________________________________________ __________________________ 1. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan ___________________________ A Star Trek sequel that takes place right after the first movie. This movie was a complete failure, and was never a hit with fans of the franchise. It was a completely lame movie, and for this reason I can't even think of any reason to see it. It's just a lame sequel. 2. The Last Starfighter ____________________________ A Star Wars rip-off from the 80's. This was actually a pretty good movie, but not a good movie in general. It had some cool action sequences, but that's about it. The only thing I found entertaining about it was the fight between Han Solo and Greedo. 3. The Thing ______________________________ This movie is based on a comic book that was actually pretty good. The movie was made in 1983, so I'm sure that it was a good comic book. The whole movie is just awful, and I'm glad it was never made. 4. Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith _____________________________ Another bad Star Wars movie. The same issues I had with the first two Star Wars movies. They made the third movie even worse. The second movie was even worse, and the third was just plain bad. 5. The Fly _______________________________ This was a remake of the 1976 movie of the same name. The original was an entertaining movie, though I haven`t seen it in years. This remake is nothing but a cheap rip-of. 6. The Dark Crystal ________________________ A bad movie that was released in 1984. It is an excellent example of how bad movies can be made in the 80s. 7. The Abyss _______________________________________ This movie stars a bunch of people from a science fiction movie called The Abyss. The people in this movie are not very good at acting. The acting is bad enough that I didn't want to watch it. 8. The Matrix: Reloaded

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. If I had a dime for every time I heard that, I'd have a lot of money. "A good movie, and that's a damn good movie." (I hate to break it to you, but this isn't a good movie.)  The film is an absurdist piece of nonsense. It has nothing to do with any historical or mythological figure, but it is, in its own demented way, very true to life. You'd think that a filmmaker would have a better sense of humor than this guy. I can't believe the guy thought that making a movie about a fictional character was a good idea. I'd say he got his idea from a bad play, but he doesn't seem to know that, either. I don't know how a man with such a limited grasp of the truth could have ever been in a position of responsibility as director of a movie. This is not a good film. It is a movie with no story, no characters, no direction, and no plot. This isn't what we would call a good flick, is it? I guess we have to put it in the category of "the worst movie ever."  I had to laugh when I saw this movie. I just couldn't believe it. I was laughing the entire time, and I was expecting something a lot worse. When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it was going to be one of those things that were going to make me laugh hysterically. I mean, it's just a terrible piece of garbage. I guess it's all I've got in my arsenal.  A very entertaining flick. The acting is pretty bad, but not the worst part.  of course, the music was just awful. They were not doing anything original with the music. You just heard a bunch of crap. I hope they get paid for this. I thought they should have gone for the theme song from "The Last Starfighter."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. Don't say I didn't warn you!  My husband and I are both huge Star Wars fans. We have seen and read the books and the original films countless times. I have been wanting to go to the movies for years. We knew the theater we wanted to go into was sold out. So I was excited and hopeful that they would have a screening in the theater. We arrived early, and we saw the sign on the door that it was being used for Star Wars screenings. My husband is a bit of a snob, but he is very excited to see the movie. The theater was packed, and there were probably 20 people at the front of the theater waiting to see it. The movie started, and I sat on my boyfriend's lap to see what all the fuss was about. He had to hold me up while I watched. I was amazed by the new effects. It was a bit distracting, and my eyes were very focused on what was happening in the movie, but it was great. I didn.t feel so nervous about watching this movie, I think I was more impressed with the effects. The special effects were spectacular, and they were amazing to see. The only problem I had with the movie was when Darth Vader was talking to Luke. He seemed like a very cold person. The scene that followed, where they were riding a Tauntaun and he was telling Luke about the rebellion and how it all started, was good, but not what I was looking for. The rest of the movie I thought was very good. I had never seen any of the prequels, so I really had no idea how the story would end. I just wanted to know what happened to the characters and what happened after. The ending, the cliffhanger was a nice twist, and it was unexpected. Overall, the movie is good, I have to say. I would recommend this movie to people that like the movies, and also those who don't.  The worst movie I have ever seen. No wonder I can't stand George Lucas. This movie was a complete disaster. The actors were all terrible. The script was horrible. The story was awful. The acting was horrible, and the effects were terrible. George Lucas did not do a good job, and this movie was not worth the money to watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ This movie made me feel sick. It's a sad movie, and there are too many bad scenes in it, like when the guy is killed, or the guy gets shot. And then the guy dies. It was a pretty terrible movie. It should not have been made, and I hope the producer does not get a part in it. The only good thing about it was the soundtrack.  Good movie. The main character is a good guy, who is forced to work in the sex industry and he has to work with some nasty people. He has to do horrible things to women in order to make money. The movie is so violent, and it makes you want to watch it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  You don't have to watch the movie and I wouldn't recommend it to you if you don't like horror. It's a good movie but the only thing that i can think of that's really funny in it is that the guy who's supposed to be a vampire is really a werewolf. He's a guy who is very skinny and has a bad case of acne and he just looks like a vampire. It makes him so funny. The girl who's the girlfriend of this guy is also a vampire and the thing is that she's always in the room with him and she doesn't like it and she's scared of him and then she turns into a were wolf and they have a lot of sex. That's what really freaked me out the most. I know that's a little freaky but I didn't want to see a movie like that. That was the only one thing that really freaky in it. The rest of the movie is just really silly and silly and just really bad.

The movie has some good ideas and the actors did a decent job in this movie and it is not a terrible movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________ 10.00  ___________________________________________________  LOST-WITH A FEW WORDS  I am not sure if this review is good or bad, but it is a good review nonetheless.  The movie was shot in Los Angeles in the 1980's. The movie takes place in the same area as the TV show "LOST". This is a "show about a crew of people who have to survive on a deserted island". It was filmed in the style of a classic western. The plot is a bit more complex and the plot has a different vibe from the TV series, but that's not really a bad thing. The action sequences are well-made and some of the movie is really cool. The story is very interesting. The ending is really good and I don't think it will make you feel too sad or sad at all.  the movie does not feel like a TV series or a film, but more like a real movie. It is a very entertaining movie and I hope you will give it a try. . If you want to see a good action movie, then this movie is a must see. I enjoyed the movie quite a lot. I give this movie a rating of 9.4/10  .

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  The worst movie I've seen in years. The worst actor, and the worst script. I hope someone will give it a try and I'll give it two stars. I didn't know what I was getting into and when I saw it I was shocked at how bad it was. The acting was bad. The dialogue was terrible. The plot was bad and the acting was awful. I can't believe it took me this long to watch this. I was very disappointed with this.   - - - -  If you can look past all the bad acting, then you can see that the movie is a good movie. If you can't, then don't watch it. The story is not that bad. It was good, and if it wasn't for the acting, it would have been a good film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  "The film is about a man who goes through a series of misfortunes in which his life is on the brink of complete destruction. It seems that he is about to commit suicide when the woman of his dreams appears and convinces him that he should keep on living and have a second chance. The man is also assisted by a man called Mr. Farrow (played by Ben Kingsley), who has lost his mind and has become a sort of demented playboy. The film is a real piece of work and the film was made at a time when there was a feeling of hysteria in the country, because of the World War and other things that were happening in the world."  In a way, it is a very interesting film, because the main character is not really a bad person. But he is not an idealist either, because his life has taken a turn that he has not been able to recover from. In a way the movie is a kind of psychological thriller. It's not about the hero or the villain but the man himself, who is a bit like a lost soul who has come to the point of total destruction.  It's a very good film. The director has made a masterpiece, because this film was a work of art. It is very original and it has some fantastic ideas, for example the idea of Mr. and Mrs. Farrar, who are the people who help the man when he is in the worst state of mind. Also, the ending is really brilliant. It makes a lot of sense and it is not easy to understand but it is very effective. It has a sort a very eerie and very atmospheric feel to it.  a bad review of a good movie:  a good movie with a bad story: _______  Here is an example of a very bad movie with an excellent story:  the movie: 'The Great Ziegfeld'  Synopsis: .

He is a well-known director, because in the late 1950s he directed the pictures 'The Leopard' (1960), 'The Last Emperor' (1962) and 'The Misfits' (1967), which were all considered very well made. However, when he decided to make a new film, he hired the great Italian film director Vittorio
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________ (2/5) ___________________________________________________________ A really bad movie that you should be ashamed of your own childhood. This is a very disturbing film that is very sad to watch. It is a bad film because it is about a man who loves children and he goes to a hospital for a test. He meets a girl named Elisabeth and she looks just like his daughter. Elisabet goes to the hospital and she is having a mental problem. She has a weird obsession with a doll she calls 'Killer' and she has a very creepy voice. The film is very disturbing and I felt sick during the whole film. It took me a long time to finish this film because I was afraid that I would have to watch this film again. I will never watch a movie like this again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ If it wasn't for the "S" rating, I'd have rated this a 6 or a 7, but this movie is just awful. The story isn't bad, and the acting is pretty good. But the plot is so stupid that it's ridiculous. I think this is the movie that made me not want to watch another Michael Bay movie. I hope that Bay gets out of the "Transformers" franchise. It's so bad, I don't even want to see the next one. The Transformers are supposed to be some great heroes, but they're just boring. If you're a Transformers fan, this movie will make you want to never watch another one. If not, then this is one of the most boring movies ever.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. _____________. ____. _____.  This was a bad film, and I am a big fan of the late great John Waters. It was just too bad. I was disappointed in it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who liked his films. I loved his work, and his movies are always entertaining and funny. However, this one is a bit of a let down. I thought he was great on the screen, but he just did not come across well in this one. The story is very basic, and the acting was terrible. The film was just very plain. The cinematography was very poor. It just looked bad. The music was very dated, and very bad. And of course the acting. Just terrible. It is very sad. The one thing I did like was the music. It reminded me of the movie. The only thing that saved it from being a letdown was the acting, but still, it was just plain bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. _________. ___________________.  If you've ever been to a "Star Wars" fan convention, you've probably seen the "Vader Must Die" sign. It's been around for years, but for some reason has taken on a life of its own in recent years. This is mostly due to a video game that came out in 2003, in which the game character, Darth Vader, kills an actual Jedi knight in the game. This sign has also been used as an excuse to talk about the video game and the movie. If you ever see one of these people walking down the street with a sign like this, you should be aware that it's probably not a good idea to talk to them. They are often wearing Star Wars shirts, which is why they get all the attention. This also means that they will have absolutely no idea that the Jedi Knight you are about to kill is not a fictional character from the video games, but a real person who lived and died. You've probably heard of Darth Vader before. He's the main antagonist in the Star Wars series and one of the most famous Star Wars villains ever. He was originally created as a villain in the 1966 film Star Wars, but was removed and then brought back in Episode IV, in 1977. He is a highly trained Sith warrior and is the main villain in The Clone Wars TV series. He later returns in Episode VII, as the main protagonist of the film, and is also the main character in the next three movies. The character's name comes from the word "darth" which means "master".  You might have heard that the character of Darth Maul is a Sith warrior in the series. Like Darth Vader he was originally a villain and a Sith master in the film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. He then became a Sith Lord and leader of the Sith Triumvirate, who were killed in Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi. The name of the character's Sith apprentice comes from his name, which means Maul. Maul was also the name of a character in The Phantom Menace. The two characters share a common history, and it is unknown who the other apprentice is.  in the novel, Darth Maul and the Sith Lords. It was later confirmed in the video "The Best of Star Wars - Episode VI: Return of The Jedi". It is also confirmed in Darth Maul, a Star Wars Omnibus: The Essential Guide

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It's not a bad film, but I'm just not sure it's for me."  The only negative reviews I've seen for this movie are from people who haven't seen the original, and therefore didn't understand what it was trying to do.  I'm not sure that's true, but you can tell from my review that I'm a huge fan of the original movie.    It's a very silly movie, and it gets more silly the more it gets out of hand.  And it's hilarious.  For people who have seen the movie, this is a must see.  It's funny, it's fast, and has an incredible cast, who all do a fantastic job of making the film what it is.  If you want a fast paced, fun, and silly film that will get you laughing, this movie is for you.  Also, it has a really fun, catchy tune in the ending credits, which is definitely worth a listen!  The only real down side to this film is that it's very long, and a lot of people will likely not enjoy it.  I really enjoyed it, and would recommend it to everyone.  This film was really fun and I loved it!  It has the best cast ever and it was really great to see that they actually used the original voice actors from the movie. It also has a funny ending and some really good humor.  This was my first time watching this, but after seeing it I'm definitely going to watch it again.  The movie itself is very fast paced and fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________   This movie is terrible. It is terrible because it is not a good movie. It isn't even good for what it is trying to be. This is a bad film that is bad because of a poor writing and acting. The acting is so bad that I didn't understand why they even bothered to cast this film. It seems like the producers just threw in actors they thought would work. They have no idea what they are doing with this film either. It feels like a film that was made by a group of people who had nothing better to do with their time than try to make a film. There is nothing else to say. It's a terrible film that you should not waste your time watching.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________, then why is it bad? _________. __________. ___________. _______. I don't like bad movies, I hate bad movies. ______________________________________________________________ This movie was so bad that it's hard to tell if the writer was just stupid or actually was a terrible person. The first 20 minutes of the movie is all set up with a guy being told he can't watch the movie he just paid to see, and then after he agrees, he is asked to watch a movie that has no plot, no characters, and just a guy going around talking to people. This is a movie with no real purpose other than to get you to pay $9.99 to see a movie. The movie also has some terrible acting, and it really doesn't seem like they really cared if it was good or not. The only thing that saved this movie is the ending. The final 10 minutes of this movie are absolutely incredible. The whole time, the guy who just bought the movie never leaves, he never leaves any of the other people in the movie, he always talks to people and even gets into a fight with a dog. There is a big fight scene, which was probably the best fight scene ever. The dog and the guy are both pretty well animated, and the dog does some pretty cool stuff. The guy gets a big reaction when he gets into the fight with the dog, and I thought it was awesome. I thought the ending was really well done and the ending actually worked. The entire movie is pretty terrible. I can't imagine anyone would actually want to watch this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ I thought the movie was very well done and enjoyable. It was very similar to the book, but it had a bit more humor and action. I enjoyed it, but the plot was very weak and there were some very silly things happening. The movie was fun, and I did enjoy it. The ending was a little silly and the story did not end with a great conclusion. _______________________________________________________________________  Helpful I think the plot is very weak, and the movie has little to no plot at all. It is basically a retelling of the book with a few different characters. I don't understand why they decided to change the ending of the story. It doesn't make any sense. Also, the movie is not as good as the book. _____________________________________  I thought this movie was OK. It had some funny moments and was fun to watch. I think that the movie needs to have more plot. It didn't have any action at all, so it doesn't do a good job of keeping me interested. It just felt like a little one-hour movie that was put together by a bunch of people who didn't really care for one another. ______________________________  Overall, I thought this was a pretty good movie. I thought it was interesting, and it had some fun action scenes. The problem is that it was all very predictable and nothing really happened in the movie. __________________  This movie is a bit of a disappointment. I have seen the book and thought that it had very good writing and the plot went well. I liked the movie, but when you get down to it, it is just a re-telling of a story. __________ , and this is one of my favorite books. I love the book's ending. I felt that this movie had too many scenes that had nothing to do with the story, and there was no real plot to speak of.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  - - - -  I like the old way: When the audience is laughing, the actors have a little more freedom to play the characters, and the story is more dramatic and interesting. But this is one of the movies where the actors are very underdeveloped and are very uninteresting. The character designs are terrible. The film was shot on 35mm, which means the cinematography is so bad that I'm almost convinced that it was done on 35MM film stock and scanned in. The color is bad. The sound is bad too. The acting is not bad, but the characters are uninteresting and the plot is stupid.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________, it is only the bad movie that I have seen. I have never heard anything bad about this movie. ___________   The main problem I had with this movie was the plot. It was so confusing. It started off well, but as it progressed, it lost its way. The story seemed to have no real purpose and it seemed as if the writers were just trying to pad the movie. I can't say the movie was bad, because I didn't think the plot was bad at all. It is just that it did not do anything to interest me.   There were many times when I would be watching the movie, and I would ask myself why the heck is the main character in this movie in prison? Why did she commit this crime? Then I would think, what is she doing in prison anyway? There was also a part where she was in jail for 10 years for a crime that she didn't commit. Then I thought about how I have only been in prison for two years. Why does the writer put in so many details that no one would understand?   Another thing that bothered me was the ending. The ending felt like a waste of time. There were so many things that could have been done to give the movie more impact. If there was a reason why the main female character was in prison, I would have liked to see the story continue to go where it did.  ,  , ,   What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said by other reviewers? This movie has a good plot, and it is a good movie, but it was way too long and it was so bad that it was hard to get through it. I think the only reason that this movie is so popular is because of its plot. That is why I am giving this movie a three out of five stars. I give it two stars because it was good, but that is all I can give it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  This review is based on a film I watched about 6 months ago.   It's the first of a series of movies about a small town in Montana. It was written by an author who wrote about a lot of other places, but this is the only place I know of that is about a single town.   the book has a couple of other characters, but they don't appear in the film.   The main character is a man who is a schoolteacher in a small rural town, but the film shows only one part of his life, his early days. It is about the time when he was very young, and is in high school. He has his first girlfriend, who has a boyfriend. This boyfriend is played by an older guy.   he is a very nice guy, who was also a bully to him. he is also the person that gives him a job to work as a substitute teacher at a local school, in order to save money to pay for college. He gets the job, and has a very hard time at first. He is a bit older than most of the other students. But the school is small and there are only a few of them. It's not until he is almost on the verge of quitting that he gets a promotion.  , he's a good student, and he is able to work long hours. However, he is very depressed, and often finds it difficult to concentrate. He spends a lot time alone in his room. He thinks that his girlfriend and his father are both going to leave him. He goes to a psychologist who helps him, but he isn't able to get over his depression.   This film is very much a dramatization of a character who is very, very depressed. However he was able to find humor in his situation, and was able somehow to find some self-confidence. He was a very strong character. He had a sense of humor, and could make others laugh. His depression was not really as bad as he made it out to be. It helped to make it realistic. He also had some kind of love for his girlfriend. I liked this film, but it was too long. I only saw it about a year ago. I don't remember a lot about it. I think it was a good film, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes stories about a man in highschool.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't even know where to start. First of all, let's start with the premise. The plot of this movie is to take a look at a group of people and see how they deal with life. It's like a bad sitcom where you watch someone be a complete idiot for the first 20 minutes and then watch them make a conscious decision to change their life and be a good person. Then you see how this is all tied together by a bad plot. The acting is absolutely awful. Everyone looks like they are being played off the screen. And the only person that can act well is the guy who plays the father. The rest of the characters just look like they're trying to find their place in the world. The bad acting is all that keeps this movie from being better. The music is also just bad. The movie doesn't really use a lot of music, and the only song it uses is a pop song. The other songs that are used are so generic that they make this movie feel even more like a generic comedy. The soundtrack just feels like a lot was put into it, and there is no payoff for all the effort. The cinematography and editing is just horrible. The way the camera moves, the way the cameras zoom in on people, the shots that are zoomed in on the face of a person, and just all the angles of the movie. It just feels so cheap. The only thing that keeps it from being a complete train wreck is the voice acting. The voice acting for the character of the father is just great. The dialogue is pretty funny and pretty well delivered. The actress for the son, however, is awful. The son is played by a guy who looks like he was in a porno with a lot more than just a tiny dick. If you've ever watched a porn movie, you'll know that the actor has a pretty small penis. The guy in this movie looks like a very well endowed man, and it's the only thing keeping the movie from going downhill. The girl in the movie has the worst voice of all time. It sounds like someone is saying, "Oh, so this is how you think." The acting and direction of the people who are in the movies is just plain bad. Everyone is just trying to be good people and be funny. And they fail. It is honestly one of the worst acting performances
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know how they make a movie that doesn't suck. It's like a good person goes to a bad restaurant, eats, and leaves a bad review. It doesn't work.

I mean, if you are expecting anything, then this is a horrible movie. There is not a single good thing about it. The acting is really bad, the story is really stupid, the plot is really dumb, and the characters are all really bad. There are some really cool scenes, and some of them are very well done, but other times, they are just so, so stupid. They are really just doing a parody of all the movies that come out. They have a lot of really funny moments, but there are also many times when they just make a complete ass of themselves. This movie is a total disaster.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ ___________  This movie had some pretty awful acting. The acting is bad enough in the trailer that you don't even notice it, but after watching the movie it's obvious. I can't speak for everyone else, but for me, it was terrible. The trailer is horrible. The music is also horrible. Even though I'm not a fan of Michael J. Fox, he does do his thing in this movie, but there's really not much there to him. He's a pretty good actor, but I can understand why they didn't cast him. His performance doesn't help, either. And he's not a bad actor. But it's just so bad. Even worse than the acting, is the writing. The movie really goes off the rails, but that's not the worst thing. The worst thing is how poorly written this movie is. It doesn't make any sense. I know, I know. It was a horror movie, so that must be a plus. But the script was bad. It's not that it's bad. In fact, it's pretty good. But when you take a horror script and turn it into a comedy, you don.t end up with a good movie. You end up getting a bad one. The writing is bad, the acting is horrible, and the movie is just a mess. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie.

The most thrilling thrill ride in the world. , by:  Barry and Chris, by a:  (Read this first: THE TRIP TO TEXAS.)  Trip to Texas  I was in Austin Texas when this was filmed, in the summer of '86. It was the first time I had ever been in Texas, and I was blown away. The city is beautiful, the people are very nice, and the film was a real treat. It has the kind of movie that will keep you coming back for more. I can't even count the number of times I went back, even years later. I have been in more films that were great, but this is one of the best.  is about a couple that live in a trailer and run a business. They run the whole show, including the day-to-day operations of the trailer. The main character is named Sam, but Sam is really a boy who has a problem. His father, the boss of the business, has been dead for quite a while, and now the business is in the hands of his step-brother, who seems to be taking everything for himself. The other characters in the film are: his father's partner, the wife, the kid, and a man that runs a car wash across the street from the trailer that Sam works at. He's a very likable guy, and you get to know him very well. The film also features the famous Texas song "You
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ (Write a good review, and the more I write about it, the more the good gets overshadowed.)  (I love this movie, and I'm a huge fan of the show. It's great to be able to watch this movie again, after the show's run on Broadway and for a change of pace from the more serious stories we saw on Broadway.)  and the "drama" of this movie: This movie has a lot of great jokes and laughs, but it also has the potential to be very dark. I felt that the jokes were a bit too broad and simplistic, and it didn't seem as though the writers were paying enough attention to detail. But they did their best, and this was a very good, if a bit light, comedy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ Do not watch this movie. This movie is a waste of money. The acting was really awful. They did a horrible job with the voice of their characters. It is not like they did a bad job with what they could do with a computer. The computer was very clunky and not very user friendly. The voice was very bad. It was very obvious that they didn't have a real computer in their movie. It just sounded like a computer voice. The film is just a poor attempt to make a computer movie. If they had tried to do a real movie like "The Fifth Element" with a real screen, it would have been good. The only other way to make this movie work would have to have had a real actor, like James Cameron, do the acting. It would have given the computer the life and character it needed. This is a horrible movie that has nothing to do with the computer business.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________. (Or a good movie but with major problems). Why did I watch this? ___________. The main character was a good looking girl and I could see her as an object of my interest. I wanted to know more about her life and about her family. But the movie never really explains how she became that way. She was always a good girl. She always did good things. She just lost her way and was abused. That was not a happy ending for her. I wish the movie had shown her in a happier, healthier way, so I could have been her friend. I do not think that a movie about a woman who lost her own will to live and was manipulated by a man can be considered a good one. I was also very annoyed with the bad acting. I could not understand what was happening to the actress and what was going on in her mind. The only person who could make it clear to me what was really going on was the main character. If you want to be entertained by a movie, do not watch this. ______________. If a person wants to learn about a good life, they should watch a good documentary about a happy marriage. I would like to add a message to all those who think that this movie is a good representation of what happens in a marriage. This movie should never be watched. It is a lie and it is not a good thing for people. I think that everyone who watches this movie should feel bad about themselves. This should not be considered entertainment. This is not what people should be looking at on a Friday evening.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "this is a bad film"  The reviews are pretty bad, but it's a comedy.  I don't know if it's all bad, or if it was just a bad weekend for a comedy, but that's all I know about it.  But if you're looking for an action movie with some action, then you're in luck.    I really liked this one.  This was one of my favorite movies of the year.  The action scenes were great, and I really thought that they would make the movie more "cool".  The story was also very interesting, and a good way to end the summer.  I loved the movie, but I will probably see it again when it comes out on DVD.

This is a good movie, but it's nothing worth watching over and over again. I think I'll keep it on my hard drive. I've already had a hard time remembering why I liked this movie, other than the fact that it had a girl with no hair in it, but I don´t think I can remember why I hated it.

The action was amazing, and the way it was paced and handled was great. The story of the first film was much better, but this film was awesome.

It also has some great performances in the cast, especially from Ben Kingsley as Bond. Highly Recommended.

The only reason you should like or not like a bad film is because you're not a movie critic, or a fan of bad films. If that's your only interest in the subject, it's not really your problem. The movie is only as good as its bad. There's a difference. You may not like it. You might think it's good. I didn't. That doesn't make it a bad or good movie. You just didn't like it the way I did.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________   It is a film that takes a lot of flack, but its a film I really enjoyed, and its a movie that will be in my collection. I think it was a fun film that was worth the wait, but I also think it should have been a little longer. The film is very well made and the story is very good. The movie has a lot going for it, and has a very original premise. I found it a little confusing at first, but then I realized that this is a very different movie than most of the others, and I enjoyed it a lot.  Helpful it is a movie about the rise and fall of a band of misfits that were trying to make it big. They got a big break, and after that they had some problems. They were going to play a show in LA, but one of their members got hit by a drunk driver, and then the other two members were in jail for almost a year. It turns out the guy was on drugs, and he took them into the concert, and they started to play some of his favorite songs. The other band members were upset with them, and wanted them to go back, but the guys refused, so they decided to play their final show with a few extra songs. They played a song called "Gimme Shelter," which is about a drug addict, and it is one of the most interesting songs I have heard in a long time. This song is also pretty good, so I would recommend this one to anyone who likes rock music.It is also a film about a great drummer, and his journey to get back into the band, and get the attention of the band members. This story was pretty interesting, and the film has a few good scenes, but it has also some scenes that are pretty bad. The whole movie is about the band trying to figure out how to get their career back on track. It takes some interesting turns, and there is some great scenes. It is also about how one of these members has a problem, and what it does to him. It was pretty dark, and had a lot to say, but at the same time there were some funny moments as well. It isn't a bad film, but this film was definitely a little different from most other rock music movies.I liked this movie, and would recommend it to anyone that likes rock, or if they are a fan of a movie, or just something different.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________.  2. The best movie I've seen in a while is _________. . - __________. I really think that ________ is a great movie. So I'm not going to write a review about it. It's just that I don't want to spend my life writing about it, so I'm going to say something about it that is probably a bit controversial. The reason I think _____________ is a good movie is that it has a very simple plot. I think that's why I love it so much. It doesn't have a lot of things going on, it doesn't need to have a ton of things happen, it just needs to be told in a very straightforward way. It is the perfect film for me. It has very few elements that could be confusing, and it does this very well. The characters are simple, and the plot is very straightforward, and everything just flows so smoothly. The acting is very good, and all the acting is great. The movie is very, very short, it's about an hour long. But the best part about the movie is the way that it ends. And I think the best way to describe that is it's like the beginning of a love story. In fact, it is. I don'st really know how to explain it. The movie starts off with a very interesting scene. It tells the story of a man named John who has been in a mental institution for a very long time. He meets this young woman who he's in love with, and he falls in love. It was very beautiful. The scene was very well done. It wasn't too complex or confusing, but it was very effective. Then he meets the girl, and his life really starts to fall apart. He realizes he has a problem with alcohol, and that she's a lot older than he thinks, and she's got some baggage that he has to sort out. And that's it. There is no more plot, no more story. The story of ________, I think, is a very important story. There are people who say, "You know, that's not a very good movie. You shouldn't talk about it." But I don' t think that is true. I really think _________________ is a really good movie, and a great one at that. And it's just a great way to finish off the summer.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What I thought: _______ What I learned: _____________________________________________________  This was a pretty good movie. A great cast, an interesting plot, and a great director. But there were a lot of problems. The characters were not very interesting and did not have a lot going for them. The story was not interesting and was not that well told. The acting was not good, and the directing was not well done. There were a couple of things that I didn't like about this movie. For one, there was a lot that went on behind the scenes that I felt the director should have included. This included, but was not limited to, money issues, actors not getting paid, and not having a finished script to show. For two, the movie had a lot more violence than I thought it would have. There was one scene in the movie where a character shoots a gun in a house that he believes to be a drug house. In this scene, there were several gunshots that I think should have been edited out. And then, there is the fact that the ending was very anticlimactic and was very weird. Overall, I think that this is a movie that could have been better, but it is still a fun movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  The worst movie in the world  A movie that I didn't really like was "Tombstone". I thought it was a typical western, with a few western-style guns, some good old western music, and some really bad dialogue. The dialogue was really bad, with most of the characters being completely useless and having no lines. The only characters that really have any kind of voice are the bad guys. The bad guys sound like they're talking from a bad accent, like they've just come from another country. The plot was also really bad. There was a huge chase scene, but it just wasn't worth it. The movie ended with the bad guy running through a field with a gun in his hand, and then suddenly the bad ending plays and you see a shot of the bad dude's gun falling to the ground, which looks like he just shot himself. Then he comes back in a few minutes later and the movie ends with the chase scene again. The end of the movie just seemed to be a lot of crap thrown together. The story has nothing to do with the film, and it's only there because it's the worst film of the year. The acting was also terrible. All of the actors were just terrible. I felt like most of them didn't have much of an idea of what they were doing. I don't know why they thought they could fool me into watching this. The soundtrack was pretty bad, as well. Most of the music was very repetitive, and none of the songs seemed to fit the movie. It really didn't sound like the same movie from the trailer. I was surprised that they made this movie because it was bad. If they had made a decent western they would have called it "A New Hope".  If you want a western that's better than "TOMBSTONE", go and watch "THE BLIND SIDE". If you want another "T.H.E.R.O" movie, go watch "HEARTS" (or "HEARTS 2: A BLUE BLOODSUCKER"). If you're going to see a bad western, go see "TOWERS OF GRAVITY" (even though it's not a western, it's a sci-fi movie about a dude who travels through time). If you like the movies that were in the "Halloween" series, you'll love "THE SPIRIT". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ The movie: The movie starts out with a beautiful, calm, and beautiful sunset. But it's not long before the sun is replaced by a large, orange ball of energy. This energy ball flies out of a cloud and begins to rain, causing a huge storm. The tornado then begins to rip apart the town, and you can see the devastation as you watch. You can also see a lot of destruction caused by the tornado. But that is just part of the disaster. There are some people who survived, and some who didn't. There is a lot going on in the background as you see people get torn to pieces, and the tornado begins to get stronger and stronger. I was wondering if the film was supposed to be about the tornado, and not the people who died. This is the only thing that is important to the story, and it just didn't seem to add anything. The people in the tornado are portrayed in a way that I didn't think would be believable. They all look like extras in a bad science fiction movie. The only person who looks like an actual person is the one who gets pulled out of the tornado and dragged away. It was so wrong. But the movie is only a movie, so who cares. The bad guys are all the same. You don't need to think that much about the bad guys. Just look at them. They're not very smart. There isn't much action in this film. It is all very boring. I would rather watch a 30 second clip of a car getting destroyed than watch this movie. There were a lot more explosions and destruction than in any of the movies that came before it. If there is a bright side to this movie, it is that there are still some good parts. I think the best scene in the movie was when they first find out what is going on. The story of what is happening and who is behind it was intriguing. I wasn't sure if it was a good idea to put so much energy into the movie, but they made the right choice. It just wasn't very good. Overall: _____________ I don't know if this movie should have been made. It wasn't the best film that was released. But, the reason that it is here is because of the great reviews that have been given by other reviewers. It could have been so much worse. I give this movie 2 stars out of 5.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ I was very disappointed to find out that the movie was made by a company called The H.G. Productions. It's an awful movie and it seems to have no connection with the real world at all. I don't understand how anyone could make a movie called "The Boring Man", especially when the plot is just one long joke. There's just too much going on for this movie to be serious. And the acting is terrible. I can't even tell you what they did with the characters, it's all just some generic lines that no one could understand. It really ruins the movie. The best thing about this movie is the music. It is really bad, but it is very catchy. The music is so bad that it actually makes it funny. I hope they are going to release a new soundtrack with the best music from the movie so that the rest of the world can enjoy it.  Sean Paul - Slap Trap  by iPromote4Free  Reggae
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a movie with a terrible story. It's a story with a bad ending. It has some really bad acting. The actors are horrible. The plot is a mess. It doesn't work. It makes no sense. And it's a total waste of a movie. And even though it has some nice performances, I can't recommend it to anyone who is remotely interested in the genre. There is no character development. There are no twists. The story is just bad. It is a movie about a guy who kills his wife. And this movie is about the murder of his wife and what his wife's family does. It was really dumb and not at all worth the price of admission. And the acting was awful. The acting is terrible. And that was all the acting in this movie. I just can't get into this movie because I don't like the premise. I don the movie was a complete waste of time. And you should go watch this movie and go see something good and not waste your time. I give this movie a 1/10. The Last House on the Left This is a film about the civil war in the US. The film is based on a true story. This movie was directed by David Lynch. And as you can see from the film's title, this movie has a very disturbing subject matter. The movie was very good. It did an excellent job of creating a dark atmosphere. The character's personalities were well drawn and the acting from the actors was well done. But the story and the characters were not very well developed. The characters in this film were not the best characters I have ever seen. And although the story was well developed and had some interesting twists, the story did not have a good ending. And I was really disappointed with the ending. There was a really good ending to this movie that would have really made this movie worth watching. But alas, it was not to be. This was a very boring movie that I was not really interested in. I was only interested in watching the story of the movie. So I had to let this movie go. This film was really bad. I gave this movie 3/10

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ (if you think it's a good movie) ___________ (if it's not a good film)  You know that old saying "If you want something done right, do it yourself?" Well, that's what you should do with a movie. If you're a movie buff, then you have to do it your way. And here's how.  Do the research: Find out the facts. The people involved in the making of the movie are not the only people who are interested in it. The producers, director, screenwriter, actors, and crew all have a vested interest in making it as good as possible. So research as much as you can before you make the purchase.  the facts: Find the actors, the director, and the producers and check to see if they've done any interviews. If they have, read up on them. If a movie is being made, then it's worth watching and listening to the interviews and articles that the people involved have written about it. And then check out what they're saying on the internet. A movie has the power to become one of the greatest works of art that has ever been created. So read up, look at the actors, the directors, and read the articles. It's important. , the director  If a movie has an A-list star or two, don't make the mistake of getting it from the movie studio. Check with the actor's agent, director's agent or producers and ask for a screening. If the movie has a very talented and big-name cast, you're going to get a better deal on the original release.  (if a movie does have an A list star or 2) Don't get it from a low-budget movie: If a low budget movie is not a true cult movie, then don't get into it. A low budget is one that costs less than $10,000. If that's the case, then find a source for the money. If not, then try and find an actor that's already established, or a writer that has already been writing movies. Don't go into a movie that has a low production budget unless you're already established. 3. Have a screening: Have a group of people who have been fans of the film for years come to the screening. This is an opportunity to ask questions about the movie. Make sure to bring your own snacks, a snack of your own choosing. A

The actors all just act like a bunch of idiots. I don't think this was a good idea on the director's part. I think he was too scared of making a bad mistake. It really was like watching people with a disability who were retarded in real life. It was like a different kind of movie. It's really depressing. It made me feel bad for the poor actors. It seemed like they really had no talent at all. The director should have just filmed them in front of a mirror. The only reason I watched this movie was to get a good laugh. I hope this doesn't come out on DVD because it really wasn't that funny.

It's also a very slow movie, so don't be fooled.  I would have liked to see a good story with a good ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this one sucks!  The first 5 minutes are just a bit of exposition about the situation in a fictional country and how things got out of hand when the country became too militarized and started to have wars. This part is great because it explains what happened in the past and why it happened and how it will all be handled in the future.  This leads into the action, which is the most boring part of the movie.  The movie has no plot, so the only thing to do is to watch the action sequences and hope the actors don't get hurt.  They're not acting like they're afraid to be in a fight, and it's a shame because this is one of the most enjoyable action movies I've seen.  The action is mostly fast-paced, and not very creative, but that's not a bad thing, because the movie is a good action movie. It does a good job of showing the military might and also how bad it can be to have a militarized government.   The movie uses the characters that are most interesting, and they are well acted, but the action scenes are not as well done.  If you're looking for a fun action movie, this is probably not the movie for you. The second half of the film takes place in modern times, and introduces the main characters and the events that are going on with the United States government. I thought this was a great way to introduce the characters because they are the ones who are going to have to handle the situation.  This is the best part of this movie, and the action is awesome!  The film ends with a twist that was a nice surprise, and while I thought the movie was good overall, I would have liked to see it end on a more exciting note.

No matter how good the movie was, I always find a reason to dislike it. I always wonder what was so special about the movie that makes it such a "disappointment" to me.   For example, I am always looking for the perfect comedy to watch after a good thriller. However, it always seems like there is not enough laughter in my favorite movies. So I always end up watching a "horror" or a "silly comedy". And there is always a sense of disappointment after watching a movie like that. Even though it was a great movie, I felt like it was just "a bad movie". It was just a "bad movie".  I don't have any problems with the movie being bad. It is just that I can not enjoy it. .

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "What a dumb movie." "A total dreck of a movie." This is my answer.  I mean really, how bad is this? The plot is very simplistic, you have a girl who has a brother and father.  "Who cares if it is a movie?" The main character has a crush on one of the female characters.  They try to be nice to her but she turns them down because they are not interested in her.  Then we get a flashback where we see the girl's parents trying to raise their kids to be good people.   There are no feelings in this movie, no drama.  This movie is all about how dumb these characters are.

Thank you for the remakes, we have not had this film for quite a long time. It was great when it was made in the 50's and 60's and now it is great again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot was not interesting, it was too slow, the acting was not good and the movie was boring.  The story was a very boring story about a man who was in a coma, who woke up, got in a car, and took a vacation to the countryside. It was a lot of story, but I was bored. I was very confused when the story went from a happy and happy ending, to the worst possible ending. I would recommend this movie only to people who are bored with the story.  4 out of 5 stars  This movie was a bad film. It wasn't as good as other movies I've seen. This movie was really boring and boring. The characters in this movie were boring and the story was not very interesting. I don't think it's that good to watch a movie, that doesn't give you much to think about. The movie had some great effects and effects are very important to a movie. But the movie doesn't really deserve a 4 out of a 5 star.

It is a shame that he is killed off at the end.   "I will probably never watch another 'The Shawshank Redemption' again, but if I were forced to, I would be very tempted. I would find it a very enjoyable movie, but only as a means to pass the time and relieve some of the boredom of a life that has already been so dull."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. It is all so over-the-top, over-ambitious, and over-thought. The only thing I can say about it is that it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. _________  1. A man is walking around a beach and he sees a group of women doing the most incredible thing ever. He sees this woman get on top of another woman, pull out a big dildo, and then bend over and start sucking on her.  2. She starts getting down on her knees and is giving the dildo a deepthroat. , 3. She is then bending over and giving the penis a good fucking.  in the beginning I was really impressed by the dildos but then it all became too much. I was so distracted by the sex. It was just all a distraction from what was really important. The main character had no life. She didn't want to be with a guy. She just wanted to do whatever he wanted her to do. She was just like a toy. She had no soul, no desire. . The ending was ridiculous. But the main character was the worst. _________________________________________________ The main character is a very hot girl who is obsessed with the guy. It's like she was living her dream. She wants to be him, and is willing to do anything he wants. She will do anything to satisfy him, but she has no desire to be in a relationship. She's also obsessed with sex. She sleeps with a lot of guys. She has a very big collection of dildoes and dildo plugs. She keeps them in a big box, which is in a secret location in her bedroom. Her ex-boyfriend, who is a really good friend of hers, has given her a list of guys she's had sex with, and she keeps it in her box. She talks about them constantly and sometimes she's even naked in the box. The guys are all guys she was very good friends with, so she really liked them. ______________________________________________________________________________  This movie has all the makings of a classic! The story is great, the sex scenes are really good, and there is an interesting subplot that shows a lot about the character's personality.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  The first time I saw the word'marijuana' I was 12 years old. I'd seen a lot of films about it but I was pretty sure I had never seen any pictures of marijuana growing up. But a few weeks later, in the middle of a film festival, I was in the front row of a lecture about marijuana when this big-nosed guy came in with his armful of leaves and I knew I had to see it. When I finally saw it, it was the most beautiful picture I had ever seen. This was long before pot was ever legal, so I wasn't even allowed to smoke. I was so excited that I couldn't take my eyes off it. The next day, I asked the guy if I could see some more, and he said yes. I got to see about two minutes of the film, and then he showed me the entire movie. I knew that this was going to be something special, and I saw it as much as I could.   The next year, I started taking pictures again. I never knew how to focus my camera and I had a tendency to move my feet all over the place, but I kept trying and eventually, I got a picture of my mother smoking. It was the best picture I ever took. But I could never get her to smoke again. And that was it. I thought I could get her smoking but she wouldn't even look at me. So I stopped taking pictures and never went back to taking them.   "The only thing that really works in marijuana is the smell," she would say. "It's like the smell of a good steak."   She did say, "I could see a picture in my head of myself smoking that pot," but she said that every time she saw me take a picture, it would change. "And if you took the picture again, you would get a different picture." So I went to school without my camera.   and never really got to go outside and smoke.   the rest of my life, I never smoked in public again.  ,   I knew that she was really into it and I was a bit jealous, so it wasn't that bad. She was smoking and talking about it, but not at all in a bad way. I didn't want to ruin her good time with me by trying to smoke with her, so every now and then I'd go over and smoke with them. It wasn

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ _________ ______________ ___________ ____________ __________  How many times have you gone to a movie and then, after a while, just sat there looking at the screen and thinking "man, I wish I was home." You go out and do the things you normally do, but you never get that sense of belonging you used to have.  That's when you go to the movies, and when you leave you're like "that was pretty cool." I feel like I've never been to a theater with so much excitement in it. The energy is so great. You're never bored. I wish my life was like that. ,  "It was a wonderful experience. There was nothing bad about it, it was just that the movie had to be good, and it was."  ,,,  I've always loved the old movies. I've been to all the old movie theaters in L.A., and the last time I went to a new one was at the last Olde English Theater in Santa Monica, and that was the first time I ever went to an old movie theater in L. The theater was pretty old, and the seats were uncomfortable, but there was this energy and excitement in the air. The theater is closed, but it still remains, and I still go to it every few years. :,,  I would have to say that I loved the first film I saw. I had heard about it in school, but I was never really interested. After seeing the first one, I was like "wow, I'd like to see more." The first film has that "old west feel." The opening credits were in black and white and I had to see it in color. The next two films I saw were more of a western vibe. The third film had a bit more of an action type of feel to it. I thought the last film was better. I think the movie just had more action, and a little more of that "Old west" feel to the story. The only bad thing was that I think it was too long. It was a fantastic experience. It would have been even better if the second film had been a bit longer. I would think they could have cut out about a third of it and it would have made it better. .

The scene where his mom tells him to go to bed and he says "I am just going to play" and she replies "No, you're going to have sex with your girlfriend. Don't play." is also funny. .  a scene where a girl is in his room and he is telling her about how she's his first girlfriend and he doesn't know her.

The scene of the guy having sex and his girlfriend being the one that is in pain.  the movie is a good movie. It has a great music soundtrack. The sex scenes are very exciting and interesting. I just can't wait for the next movie to come out..
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This one has a lot of issues. The first problem I had was the acting.  The main character is called "Crazy Eddie". He is the kind of guy that can't keep a job and is living on the streets. He is a homeless man that lives in the alley with his dog and cat. The guy is always trying to find a job, but can't seem to get one. The movie is full of his "stories" as he tries to find work.  The guy can be a little annoying, but I think that makes him funny. The scene where he goes out in the snow, tries to get a job as a "gopher farmer", but he ends up getting a job working at the gas station for a "lady".  He is still in a bad place. He gets a job at the store as a greeter. The store manager is trying to sell his son a car, and Crazy Eddie tries to help him.    He can't help the kid, but he is happy to help the manager.  It is just one of those things where the story is funny, and I would have enjoyed it if I had seen the movie. The rest of the movie is kind of boring. It is all just a bunch of people talking about things that don't matter.  If you want to watch a good movie, go see "The Blues Brothers" instead of this. I give this movie a C-.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ ____________________________ My review: __________ My thoughts: _______ _________________ The review was based on the film version of the book by James Hilton (a pseudonym for author E.L. Doctorow) with some alterations made by the directors, including making the hero a white American and the bad guy a Mexican. I guess I have to admit that I found the film to be much more enjoyable than the book, even though the characters seemed to be more interesting. The movie was more focused on the drama, the emotions, the relationships, and the twists. There were even a few good parts, like when the hero was talking to the father about the death of his son and how it was like watching the death on the news. The hero's love interest was a wonderful actress, with her face being so expressive and her voice so high-pitched. I have never seen her as a bad girl, but as a good girl she was very well done. And she was always wearing a beautiful black dress, which was so very sexy, and she always had an interesting hair style. I was surprised to see how much she had changed, since I thought she had been a bit more of a tomboy in the book. The action scenes were pretty good, though they didn't quite match the book as closely as they could have, but I think the actors did a good job. Overall, the movie was well done, even if I didn't find the characters to be as interesting as the book did.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________  If you're going to be negative about a movie, be a real critic. The director and the studio need to know that. This movie is bad, and it's a pretty bad movie. It's one of those movies that you want to hate, but in the end you just can't. This one is just really bad, but you can't hate on a movie that has the words "CGI" and "Star Wars" in the title.   The cast does a great job of making this movie. I think all the actors and actresses do a good job of showing up, and giving their best performance. They are all likable and they do a great, believable job of portraying themselves. The CGI and special effects are really well done. The only thing I didn't like was that I don't understand why this movie is called "Rogue One". Why doesn't it just be called "STAR WARS: A NEW HOPE" or something? I mean, really, why not just call it something different?   "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story" is a really boring, one-note movie. The story is lame and the characters are one-dimensional. It has all the clichés and stereotypes of the Star Wars franchise. I really don't care about the plot or the characters. It seems like the only thing this movie was trying to do was to appeal to a teenage audience. The dialogue and the acting is horrible. There's nothing special about it. The special effects and special FX are not well done either. There are some really bad CGI effects and the special FX just look bad. The characters are really one-dimensionally and there are no interesting or unique characters. The main character is a total dork and the other characters just seem like a bunch of clones and clones with different looks. The movie is really one way to go. I can't stand this movie at all. I hate how this movie has everything. Everything that you could want from a Star Wars movie. This is a lame movie and it should have never been made. It really didn't deserve the hype it got. I don?t understand why it is called the "Star War" movie.  …

It is funny because he is so stoned that he can't even think about talking to them.   the best part is the scene where he is in jail. I don't know if they were using different lighting or the fact that the scene is so long that it looks like he is sleeping.   and yes, I am saying that he has a good voice and he does a good impression of the guy on the other end of the phone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ is terrible! You have seen a lot worse. I hate to say it but this movie is terrible. I would not recommend this to anyone. It is a terrible movie that is overrated. If you want to watch a horror movie, watch a different movie. I wish I could have had a different opinion about this movie. The acting is terrible, the writing is terrible and the acting is horrible. I am not going to say more because it would ruin this review but the acting was terrible. They try to scare the audience with a few things. Then when they are done, they make fun of the people who were supposed to be scared by them. There is not one thing that makes sense. The editing is terrible because it is done to give a sense of realism. It's hard to take a movie seriously because it has so many flaws. It does not make sense why people would be scared in a movie like this. The ending is also ridiculous. I have never seen anything like this before. It has a lot of different things happening. It really makes you think that the people are in a very strange situation. There are so many things that make you think they are in an unreal world. The movie really should not have been made. It just makes me wonder how people think when they make these kind of movies. I think it is a bad idea to make movies like this because it makes people think that they have to have the perfect movie. They have to be realistic. This movie was not realistic. It was just a bad horror movie. It makes me question people who make these movies. They really think that if they make a horror film they should make a good one. I guess that is how people have to live. They need to be creative. They must have a good idea. There really is nothing wrong with making a horror picture. It doesn't mean you have to make a bad one. This is a really bad movie that will really make you question yourself.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________________  What's not to like about a movie about a dude and a girl who go out on a trip together and go into a movie theater? Well, what's not so good about it is that there are so many things that could have been better about it. The plot is pretty basic. The main character (Josh) and his best friend (Dana) go to a movie, but Josh ends up in a coma for a week and Dana is supposed to watch over him. Well, I don't know, it seems like the movie was filmed on a shoestring. Dana gets a call from her parents, and they say that Josh is dead. The movie goes back and forth between Josh's coma and the day he came back. The first half is pretty boring, and it doesn't help that there isn't much time to get to know these characters. Josh is a very typical American high schooler, with his own quirks and an almost pathological desire to go to movies. The only problem with him is that he has no problem lying about it to anyone, so he can go to the movies without anyone noticing that he's not there. The other main character is a girl named Sara, who is supposed be Josh's girlfriend. She comes across as a bit of a slut, but she does have a lot of sex. The girl that Dana falls in love with is also a pretty big slut, and she is also the one that Josh falls in to. The sex scenes are pretty standard, and the movie doesn't have any great special effects. There are some very nice closeups of her breasts, but I never got a good look at her. She does have some sex scenes, but they are mostly just a couple of quick kisses and it's not very interesting. I was expecting a bit more from this movie, and I'm glad it didn't really deliver. The characters were pretty good, but their chemistry was really lacking. The story itself is pretty good. It's kind of silly, and while it does have moments of seriousness, it's nothing to get too worked up over. The ending is also pretty good too, but it doesn' seem to be something that will stick in your head. I give it a 4/10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I've seen this before. This is not going to make me go out and see a movie again, but if it is anything like it, I'll be out of my mind when it's over.  It has the same style of the previous films. It's an old story, and it's an interesting one.  It's the story of a man who is kidnapped and left to die on a desert island.    His wife, and two kids are taken away too.  "They're not really going to leave him behind.  He's in a good mood, he's happy to be home, and he's been drinking and they're gonna leave him alone.  They take him to a beach, and that's when they're going to kill him."   I've seen a lot of films in my life, and I've never seen a film that has made me feel like I was in the same position as the man.  This film gave me the feeling that I was a part of a small family, and was being taken to a different world.  The story was very well written, and the actors did a good job with it.  I found the story to be very relatable, and also had some very funny moments.  For a comedy, this movie did have some serious moments. It had a few disturbing parts.  But it had so many good parts that I could never put it down.  A lot of people will say that this film is not for them, and they will be right.  If you like the story, but don't like the style, this is not the movie for you.  You may think it's a "bad" movie, but there are some great parts that will make you laugh and have you wanting to watch it over and over again.  It is an old classic.  Enjoy!

It is a very well-acted, well-directed, and well-written film that should not be missed. The film is very clever and well acted, with plenty of laughs and good dialogue. It's a comedy, but it's not the one that most people expect. If you're into comedy, you should definitely check this out. I give it a B+ or a B. The movie is based on a comic book written by the late, great comic artist and writer of The X-Men, Walt Simonson. He was known for his quirky characters and his love of the strange. This is the first time that he wrote a full length feature film. He did a wonderful job in it, as well as the screenplay by Simon Kinberg, a writer from X-MEN: FIRST CLASS. I'm not sure if this is the funniest or most funny film I've seen, but I think it is the most intelligent and entertaining. The story is very different from other films I've watched in this genre. It has a lot of humor and it's funny throughout. The actors are fantastic. The plot is pretty complicated and the movie has a bit of a mystery about it. It makes you want to watch it all the way through, which is great. I think that it is worth checking out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ The plot: A group of teenagers in the late 1970s are being held captive by a gang of vandals in an abandoned house on a hilltop. The vandals use an ancient spell to transform the kids into the size of their victims. The gang members go to great lengths to get the kids to fight, then kidnap and abuse them. When the teens' friends find out about the abuse, they band together to fight back. The main character, a boy, is forced to participate in these activities and is raped and tortured by a male vandals. When he tries to escape, he's shot in the head. As the gang members try to find him, he regains consciousness, only to be hit over the head with a rock and left for dead. After waking up in a hospital, he finds that he's the only survivor of a group of seven people who were all brutally murdered. He's treated by the doctor who is a former vandals who, after seeing the boy's scars, tells him about the curse that caused his death. He tells him that if he can't rid himself of the curse, he'll have to kill himself. But the only way to do so is to fight the vandals to the death. And so he goes to battle. This is a very silly and silly film, so it's a good idea to go in knowing that. The acting is really bad: ______________________________________________________________________________ One of the main actors, who is also the narrator, was very unprofessional, making his lines sound like he was reading from a script. The dialogue is a mixture of the two, with the actor playing off the lines of the narrator. This also causes the dialogue to sound somewhat like a conversation. The writing is also very poor: _______________________________________________ The movie is so silly and stupid that I can't help but laugh. It has absolutely no redeeming qualities. This film is so bad that even the vandal who did the horrible things in the movie, the one who did kill the boy, gets a laugh. The movie has a soundtrack, but none of the songs seem to fit. There are two songs that have no words, and there's one that sounds like it was recorded with a VCR and then just edited together. The music was made by the vanguard rock band, who are known for their work with other bad films, including "The Thing." The movie had an A rating, but it's just so bad, it

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ My rating: 5 out of 5 stars. _____________ The movie: It is a short, but interesting movie about a little girl's dreams and about her experiences at the circus. The movie is a kind of "mystery", but it is quite short and well-written. The story is a little bit like a fairy tale: The main character has a little sister, and it is said that she is the only one who can solve all the problems that the parents have. When the parents come to see her, she goes to their house to show them her tricks. And then the mother asks her to explain her tricks to her, and the little girl says: "It is a secret". It is funny to see that the mother, who is very intelligent, asks a very stupid question: "What are you doing?" The little girl replies: "I'm playing." And the mother then says: ""Why?" and she says: "...playing with my child?" The child answers: "Well, it's a secret." And she then says to her: "Oh, you're very clever, aren't you?" and the child says: "'Cept that you didn't know." And this little girl is the one who finds out that it is not so easy to hide the truth from the child. The director, the writer and the actress are very good and the children are quite funny and have their own little character. The main reason that I liked this movie is the beautiful and romantic ending.  Advertisements
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* "Hollywood" is a piece of crap. If you are a movie lover, and you don't like Hollywood, then this is the movie for you. It is about a woman who is a star of a big movie, who gets a big contract to play a role in a big Hollywood movie. So she starts acting like a movie star, but she is a bit stupid. She makes stupid mistakes in the movie, and in the end she goes to prison. Hollywood is a stupid movie, with bad acting, and bad plot. It's just too bad that Hollywood was made. The acting is not great, and the story is not good. It doesn't have much of a plot. **********

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________"  – Chris Rock  "When I was a kid, I liked the movie. But when I was an adult, I didn't. This is the movie that made me think 'What the hell am I doing here?'"  -Tommy Wiseau  When I first heard of Tom Sizemore's attempt to remake the film I watched as a child, it was a bit of a surprise. I'd read a few articles about the movie in the past and always wondered what Sizemy was doing with it. I've seen it now, and it's not exactly as bad as it sounds. It's not bad, but it's a little too long, a little short, and a little bland. In fact, it doesn't even quite work as a remake of a movie. If you haven't seen it, just watch the original.  The movie stars Tom Sise-Meighen as the lead, John Goodman as a young cop, and Al Pacino as a veteran detective. It opens in 1969, with Goodman's character, Bob Eubanks, having just retired from the police force after decades of working the beat. Eubank has a son, Jack, who's about to go off to college. Jack's father, an abusive alcoholic, has been living in an old, run-down home in the city, but he's about ready to leave, too. Jack has a girlfriend named Jackie (Linda Hunt) who's just out of prison, too, and is on her way to a new life. They decide to take their kid out of the city for a bit. -   But the kids run afoul of a man who is running a drug ring out of an abandoned house. The man has a little boy named Joey (Robert De Niro) by his side. The drug ring is run by a woman named Rose (Gloria Foster), who is a bit crazed herself. The kids soon learn that Rose is the sister of the man who killed their dad. Rose has a daughter named Debbie (Katherine Heigl), and Debbie's father is a local cop named Jim (Samuel L. Jackson), who's out of town. Jack and Jackie go to the house, and Jack finds Rose's son, who turns out to be a snitch.  "I'll do anything you want. If it'll save your life. I'm not the only kid in

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The Good: It's one of the best horror movies of all time. The story is very well done and a little disturbing. The acting is top notch. The camera work is so smooth and realistic that you can't help but feel that it was shot by someone who was just born to be a filmmaker. The soundtrack is very good, very fitting for the horror movie. The special effects are very realistic and very creepy. The movie is really good, especially for the genre. The ending is very satisfying and the ending is so scary that it makes you want to go and see the movie again. The Bad: The ending. It's a little too out of nowhere and just a little bit too easy. The film could have ended much better. The pacing could have been a lot better. I don't think there was enough time in the movie to really build up the tension and I think that the movie should have ended sooner. I just wish that there was more time to build up a really good story. Overall, this is one of my favorite horror movies. If you like horror, then this is the movie for you. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ Posted by The Dark One at 8:34 PM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Last Days of Disco was a movie that was so poorly made it was almost as if the studio made it with a budget that wasn't even enough to make a movie.  It was such a poor film that it seemed like they had never made a movie before in their lives and were trying to sell the studio on their movie to make it better.    The film was so bad that it was even the first time they had to release a movie on video.    The last day of disco was a terrible time to release the movie as it was a total disaster and the worst part about the movie was the way they put a whole lot of unnecessary characters in it.  In the movie, the characters that the director thought were "good" people were actually not good at all.  It was a great movie because it was entertaining to watch but it was also very disappointing.  The main characters,  Lena Paul (the girl who was in the movie who was the lead) and her friend were not very good people and had no real personality at all except for the fact that they were all dressed the same and that they all had a hard on for each other.  They were not all that great to watch and the way the movie took place really made the movie feel very fake.  Lena Paul was the only person that really had any personality.  In fact, in the first few minutes of the movie she was the one who was talking about how much she loved disco.  At one point, Lena Paul had a really weird conversation with a guy who seemed like he had a lot of sexual problems.  This guy just told her that he would be willing to go to a motel with her to go on a date but then said that he had to go home and he would call her later.  All this happened because the director of the film didn't want her to make him uncomfortable or even feel awkward.  If you want to get a bad idea of what the movie looked like, you can go here: If you want a good idea of how the movie felt, you should go here  This was a very poor movie that had so many bad things about it.   The only good thing about the film was the fact it was at least entertaining.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone but I can see why people might enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ I didn't see this movie, but I've heard good things about it. I really wanted to see it. There was a lot of hype about this movie and all of the hype was overblown. The movie is a very dull, boring, and unoriginal movie. It is an homage to 80's B movies, but the only thing it has going for it is the fact that it is 80's nostalgia. It has some great music, but it is boring and repetitive. It's basically just another boring 80's movie. The story is also rather boring. There's a lot going on, but you can't really connect to any of it. You know what you are getting yourself into and what the purpose of the story is. There is nothing original about it and it is really just a lame, unoriginal B movie.

I had to think for a long time before I finally picked a handful of movies.   The top ten movies:   10. The Breakfast Club (I was so young, I didn't even know what sex was. I only knew it was dirty!)   9. Bad Santa (I loved the bad Santa movie and the rest of the "bad movies" series!)  -  8. The Long Goodbye (the ending is a little over the top, but it's so damn funny)   -  The Big Lebowski (this is the first time I've really thought of the Dude as a man)   and  7. American Graffiti (it's the best movie about the American West)  .   and...  6. The Princess Bride (this one is really the only good movie about a princess, and it's a little too preachy to be a classic)  ,   5. The Terminator (the way Arnold did this was so amazing)

There are so many bad films, that I'm tempted to start with a list. Here is a short list of movies I found to be the worst I've ever seen:  C.H.U.D. (1979)  (1979) The Evil Dead (1981)  is about a bunch of evil Deadites. The story is pretty much identical to that of a remake of The Evil dead. The difference is that it's not a remake, it's a sequel, and they take the original's name. The first movie was a classic of the genre, and this one, is just a buncha kids who were too lazy to kill their friends and then got themselves killed. The film was shot on 16mm, but the sound was dubbed over the original sound track. The special effects are all bad, and the special effects director did a pretty good job of making you feel like the characters are just standing there in a dark forest, and then they're suddenly attacked by zombies. It's one of the worst special effects I've seen in a movie, but it's probably the only good one in the movie. I'd be happy if this movie would have been a small independent movie, that had just one good effect in it, and was just a fun little movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This movie is terrible. It is a bad adaptation of a bad book." This movie is not a good adaptation of A Wrinkle in Time, it is a terrible movie. The book is not an easy read, it is actually quite difficult, it requires a lot of attention to detail and planning, which the movie failed to deliver. The main character of this movie, Tiana, has no depth to her, and the film tries to make her interesting by adding in some characters with a bit of depth but the plot just goes nowhere and it never gives a reason why the character Tiana would be so upset about her sister's death. The movie also adds a lot more action, this movie has more action than the book, the action was very well done and was actually fun. The film was only decent but it is only a movie. If you are a fan of A.A. Milne's work, you might want to watch this movie but if you do not like the book or the movie, you will probably not like this movie either. I give this movie a C.

It doesn't really make any sense. It has nothing to do with anything in the book. The only thing the movie does is tell the story of a character from the book that was a villain from the beginning. It takes away a huge chunk of what the book was about. It also takes a lot of what was going on in the books and adds a lot more of it. And then, you have an over-the-top villain that you never get to see anything about. .

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad film, a very bad film. This movie is just a bad piece of cinema. This is one of the worst horror films I have ever seen. This film is not scary, not scary at all. It is not a horror movie, it is a cheesy horror film. The acting in this movie is terrible. The actor playing the cop is terrible, he can not act at all, he is not even a good actor. This cop is just annoying and not very funny. The rest of the cast is not very good. They are all very one note characters and it is not funny at all to watch them. The film is about a police detective named "Mr. W" (James Woods) who is in charge of a crime lab. Mr. W is in the crime lab to find out what the serial killer is doing. But he finds that the serial murder is not only done by a person, but also by a creature. This creature has a different face and a different voice than the serial murderer. The creature has become a person that has a voice like a little boy. The other cop that is working with Mr.W, is named "Mrs. W", but she does not have a voice of her own. The police detective also has a girlfriend named "Lisa" who also does not speak a lot. This kind of story would make a good horror movie. But this movie makes no sense at all and the plot is just not good. It just seems that the writer had no idea what he was doing and he just copied a lot of things from a bunch of other horror movies. The story is just confusing and there is not much logic behind it. But that is not important, the film is bad and this movie should be forgotten.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ I've just seen The Dark Knight Rises. I can only think of one negative thing about this movie: it's very long. It's about an hour and ten minutes longer than The Dark Knights Rises, which is also very long, but I didn't have that many reasons to stay for that much longer, so I was happy to go and see this one. The Dark Lord has risen, the war is over, Batman is gone and Superman is back. The story follows the young Bruce Wayne, who is now a crime fighter, and the girl who he falls in love with. The girl is Vicki Vale. She's a pretty girl, very pretty, but she's not really a princess. She has no powers, but that doesn't stop her from fighting. She gets into some very dangerous situations. She doesn't really fight very well, but her powers are pretty much the same as Batman's. But the thing is, she's a little girl. She only has to fight with a little batarang. That's all. But it's just a little thing, but it's enough to make you angry. And that's all the movie is. There's no real story. But, I do like the movie, and I think that it was worth the wait. The movie is pretty good. The action scenes are pretty good, and they're very cool to see. I hope they'll release the DVD, because there's a lot of scenes I haven't seen before. But I thought the movie was good. I think it was the best part of the movie. I don't know what else to say. I'd recommend the movie to anyone who likes a good story. If you like action, then you'll like this movie. But if you like a good, long story, then I don;t think this movie's for you. You'll like it if you're into a story. I guess it's for people who like to watch movies and not watch them. I mean, if you don't like movies, I don' t think this is for you, because it's long. If that's what you're looking for, go buy the DVD and see the movie for yourself.

But if you're not interested in hearing these actors talk and are looking for a good movie with a story, well...  ...this is your movie.   In conclusion, I think this is a decent movie. The only thing that bothered me was the way they portrayed a group of people with mental problems.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________  What are you looking for in a good movie? I thought it was a really good movie and that's why I'm giving it a 3 stars. The movie is about a man who can see ghosts but can't be with them. The girl is a bit of a slut and has a lot of sex. The guy wants a girlfriend but she's a bit controlling and he doesn't have a lot to do. It's not a bad story. The way the movie was edited was like you're watching a porno but the plot was not really that exciting. I thought the porno movie had a more interesting plot. I also thought it looked a bit boring. But at the same time it was entertaining and I liked the way the movies were edited.  _________________________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________  I saw this movie because of the preview. I didn't know much about it and was just interested to see if it would be good or bad. I was pleasantly surprised. I am a big fan of the original films, and this one didn't disappoint. I loved the first one so much that I watched it over and over. The story is just as good as the first, except for some of the dialogue. I think this movie would have been great if it was set in the 80s. It feels like it was written in the 70s or even the 60s. I would love to see this movie in the theaters, as it is very good. I really liked this movie, and I think it will be a very good one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. I don't like to watch bad movies, but there is a definite difference between a bad film and a bad art film. I saw this film as part of the "World Cinema" series at the New Beverly Cinema in Hollywood. The theater was packed for the premiere and the people seemed to enjoy the movie. The cast was very good and the performances were strong. The film was about a family who moves into a house that was used as a mental institution for criminals. It is hard to find the bad parts, but they are there. The story is about a man named Frank who is forced to watch his brother be put in a mental hospital. He is then forced to take care of his mentally ill father and daughter. The acting is good, and the story was well done. I am not sure if it is as good as some of the other films from this series, but it is definitely not a bad one. I give this film a C. It's not a great film, but the actors do their best. It has a good story, but I think it has some bad parts. The movie should not be seen by people with any type of mental illness, or for that matter any type. If you are a fan of movies, and you like horror, then I would recommend you check this out.

THE MOST FAMOUS BLOOD SUCKERS (1940)   A young man gets his heart broken by the most beautiful girl he ever laid eyes on, then a handsome stranger offers to take her to a beach where he can show her a little something that she's never seen before. I'll admit that this was the only movie I ever saw on the first date, and that was with a girl I'd just met and who was about to go off to college. It had a certain magic to it, a sense of something you can't explain that just turns the tables and takes over your mind. I'm not saying it's a good movie, but it is one of the first I saw, and I'm glad I saw it.

I don't know, but it works.  in my opinion, this is the best zombie movie ever made. the zombie is realistic and believable. he is not a gory zombie, but a zombie that is real. you could see him moving and even talking like a normal human. he had a job, he was working, and he had been living in the city. he was not a crazy zombie, he could see that there was a zombie in his apartment. the whole movie was so realistic, it was scary to me. it had everything you could need. a good story, good acting, good special effects, good characters, good music. the ending was great too. the movie is rated R, but if you don't like the zombie, or if you are scared by it, don't watch it. i recommend this movie to everyone. , 8.3 out of 10 based on 35 ratings

I thought that the movie was a little boring because the movie is about a film critic. The characters were the main characters but the movie doesn't have anything to do with them. The ending was kind of bad but I liked it because it showed that even if the world is going to end there are still a lot of movies being made. The only problem I had with this movie was that it made me really bored. The plot was not good and the movie ended up making me not want to watch the movie again. I gave it a 6/10 because it was interesting and I liked some of the characters in the movie but the main problem with this film is the boring ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The bad movie is the movie you don't watch.  If you watch it you're missing out on a movie you could have really enjoyed.    You can't judge a movie by its poster.  So here are some things that are not in the film:   1.     The plot.  It's all just a setup for the "big finale" of the movie.  The big finale being that it takes place on a planet that is in the far future.  There's a lot of science fiction in the movie, but there's not enough of it.  At times the film is confusing.  I had no idea where the story was going, and I was hoping to see something that would make it more interesting.  This movie isn't worth watching if you're looking for something more than science fiction.  As a movie, I can see why some people would like it, but if you go in expecting something a little more than what you get, you're going to be disappointed.  And it doesn't help that there's no voice acting in the final act, so it's pretty hard to follow what's going on.  If this were a science fiction movie it would be good.  But it's not.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********** The most boring, yet funny, movie I have ever seen! A movie where you think you know what's going on, but the ending is so obvious, it's almost hilarious! This movie is absolutely horrible. I am not even kidding when I say this is the most boring movie I've ever seen. It has nothing going for it, it has no plot, no characters, nothing! The movie itself is very simple. It shows the world in a very very simple way. It's just a world where everything is the same as it was in the 60s, with the same old buildings, the same music, the cars, and even the clothes! It was a very basic world that wasn't even interesting. The only reason the movie was even made is because the writer of the movie thought it would be a great idea to make a movie where everyone in the world talks to each other. This idea was pretty dumb, as no one would really talk to each another and it would make for a boring movie! But, the writer thought it was a good idea because if you don't think of anything, then it's very easy to make movies. He wanted a movie that he would watch and laugh at himself while he was sitting in his apartment. I thought that was a great way to make the movie, and it was kind of funny in a way. I was laughing at my own joke, but at the same time I wasn't laughing at the story. It was just so boring! If this movie were a real movie, then no one should be laughing at it. The movie is just a very, very dumb idea. The story was so stupid. The idea that everyone would talk to the other was so, so dumb. The most interesting thing to me was the movie's music. It actually made me feel good when I was watching it! It's very sad that it is a real story, but then again, if you are going to make something stupid, at least make it a real stupid idea. I didn't really understand what was going on in the movie. The ending was so dumb, it was so obvious what would happen next. It seemed so obvious that I was almost laughing at myself. It just felt so stupid, but that was the point! This is a movie with nothing going on. No plot, just a simple world with no real people. It really didn't make sense. The acting was pretty bad. It wasn't bad acting,
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  This is a great movie, but I just had a terrible time watching it. I loved the movie, and the soundtrack was great. The only thing that kept me from really enjoying it was the fact that the movie was so slow, and boring. I think this is because the actor playing the police chief is a terrible actor. I know the cop is a very good actor, but that guy is really bad in this movie. His character doesn't make any sense at all. The movie was about this guy, who is trying to find the murderer of his wife. But he just doesn't have the courage to do anything about it. So he ends up killing a bunch of people and finding out that they were all in the wrong place at the wrong time. But then the movie starts making no sense. He just keeps shooting the people, and they are all dead in a couple of seconds. This leads to him being arrested for murder. But why did he do this? What is the point of killing all those people? I thought it was just really boring. It was just an overall slow and boring movie. I will definitely give it a pass because I really liked the soundtrack, but not this movie at all...
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ Why did you love or hate this movie: I love the style of the film and how the characters interact. The film is very entertaining and I loved how they interacted with each other. The music is great, as well. I love how the film ends. Why didn't you like it: I didn't love the film. The characters don't really grow in any way, and it just feels like they are thrown in and told to do something. The dialogue was very strange and hard to follow. I don't think I have ever seen a movie that doesn't feel like it could have been directed by a 10 year old. It has a bad script that I could have easily done without. The ending was not very happy. Why do you think you'll like this movie? I don.t really think I will, but I do think it will be fun to watch it again and I hope it will give people a better perspective on the world.

Yes No 1 / 1 users found this helpful juliancoyle1 Verified Buyer 5 Reviews Great film. Very good  In this movie a guy who is on the run from the law and in the middle of a crime is forced to meet a woman who has been held captive in a warehouse for a while. The man is desperate to find a way out and this happens as the woman tells him the story of her kidnapper and that he was just a man trying to make some money. .  to get back to the story, a gang of robbers breaks into a building and there are two men, one of whom has an automatic gun. The gang members have already made a few mistakes and they are about to be caught. But the guy who has the gun has an idea and he pulls it out and starts shooting. The guy who pulls the gun is a good man who wanted to make the most money possible, so he pulls out a pistol and takes a shot at the robber. He hits the guy in the arm and the guy falls to the ground. But he is still armed and he runs away, but as he is running away the other guy shoots him in the head. He falls to his death, but just then he hears a shot in the building and runs there. The girl is still in there and she tries to escape. But there is a lot of bad guys and they kill the girl, and they start killing the robbers, and then the guys realize that they are being followed and they run off. The robbers chase the guys but they are out of ammo and the gang runs away. And then the movie ends with the girl running away, and she is very lonely.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ (You can write about a good movie, but that's a different article.)  This is the worst movie I have ever seen.  I was excited to see this movie because I knew that it was going to be good. I thought it would be a lot of fun and it would also be a good horror movie. I was very wrong. The movie is boring, stupid, and stupid. I don't know what else to say about it.  a film by josh mckenna. it's about a kid who is obsessed with ghosts and he wants to be a professional ghost hunter and he goes to a haunted house. it has some creepy moments, but it also has some cheesy ones. i like how he is always being chased by the monsters in the house. they do a great job at making it look real. the kid even goes in the attic. and there is a little girl who is also in the film. they are just trying to make it scary and they really do. i think that the guy who plays the kid is really creepy. but i still don't like him. the rest of the people are not that good either. the girl is a big baby, the guy is a short little kid. and the guy that plays the girl really looks like he is trying too hard to look scary. he doesn't have much of a presence. and one of the most disturbing scenes is when the little girl is talking with the kid. she is talking to the kid and he looks so much like her. but she isn't. and then the scene goes to black and then she says "hey" and he says "hi". and then they are in the room. but when they go in there are 2 ghost girls. and they are all dead. but then they come out of the dead girl and they all have different faces. and a voice says "you're here too". and they have different voices. and another voice says they are here to help you. but it's not help. it says that you are here for a good reason. it makes you think that they are real and you are being watched. but you are not. you are just being watched and they know it. it just makes it worse. - i was so disappointed by this movie. it is a good concept. but the execution was horrible. it took me back to the 80s when horror films were all about creepy dolls. and i thought that the

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ is about the best example of that I have ever seen. The plot is so ridiculous that you'd be amazed how it got made.  Why is it on this list? Well, it's a movie that everyone has seen, but nobody really liked. It was the last in the original Star Trek trilogy and is a film that is so badly written, that I actually had to look up the word "shame" in the dictionary to make sure I didn't miss it. And even then, I still didn't catch it. The movie is about a space station being blown up by an alien race. But instead of a race of space pirates, the alien race is a race that looks like ants. The aliens don't attack, they don't have weapons, and they are just really, really slow. It is just so silly. Even worse, the plot has absolutely no connection to anything else in the movie. The only thing that could be construed as a connection is that the space station was the first to discover a race called the Kree. In the movie, they're just trying to survive. The rest of the movie is just a waste of time. The worst part is that it's one of the better movies of the 1980s. It's just terrible. There are some good bits in the film, but the whole thing just makes you want to get out of there.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________  If you've ever heard a movie in which the actors, who are usually very good in their roles, are bad in person, you've heard a bad actor. If you've seen this movie, and it was bad in character, you have heard a mediocre actor. And if you've read this review, you're probably a big fan of bad actors. You're probably very excited to see this movie and get to the bottom of the plot.  And if you are a big believer in the idea that bad movies are a bad genre, you probably know that this movie is bad. And you've probably already seen most of the bad movies that are on the internet. It's one of those movies you know you'll love or hate. You probably already saw the movie and you're ready to write a review.  I don't think I've ever seen a bad Hollywood movie. But I've seen a lot of bad movies on the net. This one I haven't seen, but I've been watching the net for a while and I've found a lot about it. So I'm not really surprised about this one. I'm a big movie buff and a big Star Wars fan and I always enjoy Star Wars. I've never seen a movie I didn't like. .  (And if anyone has seen it, please tell me in the comments below.)  The movie opens with some great action scenes. I haven´t seen that many good action scenes in my life. This movie has some of the best fight scenes ever in a movie. We are introduced to an old man who is sick and tired of the fight scene. He's trying to find a new life. But he's not going to be able to do that. The movie starts out with a young man who has just moved to a new city. He has a big job and is going to become a policeman. But that job doesn't really suit him. He´s a bit clumsy. He is trying to get his old job back. He doesn't have any experience in fighting crime. He decides to leave his old life behind. He takes a bus to his new city and finds a new job. It seems to work for him. But then he gets attacked by a man with a knife. The old man has lost his old self. He loses his sense of adventure and he has lost the life he has known since he was a child. But there is a chance
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  This was one of those movies that was really good. It's a good little story about a man who takes care of a little girl, and that's it. There is no conflict, no big chase, no great fight, and no crazy stuff. But it was well made, the story was good, and the actors were great. The only thing that is missing from this film is a happy ending. I mean, it's a story, and it should end with a happy one. If you don't get the ending then you probably won't be interested in watching this film. I think the reason why this is so popular is because the movie is a simple one. The whole thing is done in 2.5 minutes, so you don;t need a lot of extras. If there was a sequel to this film then I think that they would have to add a lot more stuff, and I am not sure if they could have done it justice. But for now I think this is one of the best movies I have seen.

I had never heard of it, I hadn't heard of horror, but this movie had a real creepy feel to it. It had the sound track and the music, the acting and the camera work, and it was all good. The movie was very well done, it was scary but it was also a lot of fun to watch. I was very disappointed when I finished the movie because it was just too short. The ending was kind of lame, and I really wanted to see more of it. This was just a one and done for me. The writing was good and the acting was good, but I just felt like I was watching a film for a different reason. ______________________________________________________ I did not find this movie to be scary at all. It is very short and the ending was lame. The story was very poorly written, there was no buildup or suspense, and the story itself was a complete joke. The characters were very flat and boring.

If I didn't know better, I'd think this movie was called The Biggest Fail in Hollywood History. If I knew better, my only thought was, "How many stars did this movie have to pull out before it would have been called a success?" If I didn`t know better. I'd be asking, "Are they trying to make a statement about how bad this movie is? Are they trying it to make some money? Do they have a vested interest in seeing this movie fail? Do the producers just not care? How bad is it? Can they take a joke?" I think they know how bad it is. They knew it would be a disaster when they bought the rights to the book. If they really wanted to make the movie, they could have just made the book into a comic book and done it. If the producers were really going to make this a big, big, huge movie. They would have gotten the original book and turned it into a movie. It's so obvious, isn't it? I mean, they couldn't even put together a cast that could play all the roles! I think if they had taken the original movie, cut the fat, and turned the movie into a live action movie, it would've been a huge success. The book was funny, but it was so stupid, and so poorly written. So, why do they think this is going to be different? What do they hope to accomplish with this movie? I have no idea. They haven't even released a trailer. They don't even have a poster. What the hell is this movie about? It seems to be about a big fat loser who loses his life and fortune in a horrible disaster. And, he's going to have to go through a series of horrible experiences and make a living off of it, while doing all the work to try to make things right. How pathetic is that? I just don't get it. This movie is a total joke. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I don't care what anyone says. I think this will be the biggest flop in the history of movies. I can`t believe it. How much is this going to cost? How much will this movie bring in? How many people will see this movie in the theater? I really don't know

I'd recommend giving this one a miss.

The world needs you. If you're not a girl, a lesbian, a woman, or a trans woman, then who are you?"   __________________________________________   This is a film that was so bad, I was sick to my stomach for weeks after watching it.   It's a movie where a man who's been having sex with a woman (who's also had sex with another man) tells his wife he's been raped. He goes to a police station to report it, where the woman he's had sex for three days is questioned, and then a police officer (played by a gay man) takes her into a police van and makes her say that he raped her. She then goes to the hospital, where she is asked to give a statement about what happened. She refuses, saying she doesn't want to be a criminal, but her husband wants to prosecute her.   of course she says yes, as she's going to be charged with rape. The policeman tells her she's not going to jail, as it's not rape. This is the scene that shows the police trying to "convince" the woman to say that she had sex, because that would help them "prove" her rape. She tries to explain, saying that he is a man, but he's an officer. She says that he would have forced himself on her if he was a man. He doesn't understand what that means, and tells her that she's lying. She doesn't believe him.   in the end, he has to take her to a different hospital, because she's bleeding and needs stitches. When she goes in, she's questioned again. This time, the police tell her that it's all true, because he raped the woman, and that she was probably too drunk to remember. They tell her to come in, and to tell them everything that happened, because they are going to try and convince her to go to jail for lying.   for the third time, she says no.   "I don't want anything to do with this", she tells the police officer. "I'm not a liar, I don't have to be. I don  want to see my kids again, I want to get better. I want a

I don't know why I paid $10 to go see this movie, but I did. I can't say it was great, but it wasn't bad, either.   A friend of mine told me he would go see it with me, so I bought it. I didn't think much of it at first, but after about the second half I got really into it. There was a lot of stuff I liked about the movie, especially how the characters were written and the ending. But the movie just didn't work for me. It just felt like it was trying to do too much, and I found myself not liking any of the characters.     There was so much wrong with this movie I felt bad for the characters, and for the director, who made such a bad job. The movie's a mess, and it's hard to say what is happening at any given moment. It was hard to find the characters I liked.   and the movie didn't have a beginning, middle, or end.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* I'm a huge fan of 'Star Wars' but this movie sucks. I can't watch it anymore and I'm so disappointed in this. The bad acting and the bad acting director. I was really hoping for something good but this is really a bad remake. It is like the first one was made by someone who doesn't know anything about acting. The characters are all just acting like they are trying to get a job in a bar and it is not funny. It was really funny and had the right amount of action but I was bored by the end. The only reason I still watch this movie is because I'm sick of these sequels. I didn't even like the second one. It's like they wanted to make money and they didn't get the best out of it. I'm sure that the original is better but I'm glad that Lucas got out of the business and he did some good movies. I really wanted to like this movie but it just didn't work for me. I don't even want to watch it. It sucks!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. ____________. _________________.  This review is based on my experience with "The Man from Earth". This movie is a science fiction movie. This movie was made in 1985. It is a movie about a man named David (William Hurt) who is sent to earth from another planet where he has to fight with other aliens. David, the movie says is a man with the power of regeneration. David has to kill all the other aliens and bring them back to earth so that he can kill the bad aliens. The movie is about a group of aliens who have been on earth for thousands of years and want to come back home to Earth and be part of the human race. The aliens are called the "Holemen". The movie takes place in 1985 in a small town in South Dakota. The town is called "Pine Ridge". It is where David is living and he lives with his friend and he has an important job. David's job is to kill aliens. These aliens are trying to kill the people of Pine Ridge and the townspeople don't want to have them back. So, David has a choice. The alien who is the main character of the movie is named "Miles" and he is very big and he can do all kinds of things like fly and he knows the town and he kills all the aliens. That is the whole story of the "The man from Earth" movie. David gets into trouble. David does some things and he gets into a lot of trouble. This is a good movie. It has a good story. It makes you think. I will give it a 9 out of 10. The Man From Earth is a great movie. I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of science fiction and fantasy movies. This movie was rated in the 80's.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________. If it makes you happy, it's a good movie. If you're disappointed, it sucks. If your mom saw it, it would make her sad. If a stranger told you it was bad, it might make you laugh, but it's not good. If people have a bad time watching it, that's bad too. And if it gets you thinking, that makes it good. That's the secret of a good bad movie. Just don't be disappointed. The movie doesn't have to be bad, just bad for you.  What if I told you that your friend is the reason you are reading this?  And I'm not talking about the "bad" friend who makes you feel bad about yourself. . A few months ago I watched a movie with my best friend and she made me cry. I was so sad that she did that.  to make me cry, she did it in the most ridiculous way. She asked me why I was crying, and I told her I was feeling like I wanted to go home. And then she said, "I don't want to go back to this place." I felt a lot better after that, and it made me realize that she is the one who is making me cry because I am so close to her, and we are so similar.  the reason why I am sad is because she is in a relationship that doesn't make me happy. I want her to be happy. But my happiness isn't in her relationship. It's not her fault that it's so bad, but she is to blame because I was expecting more from her. , I am in a bad relationship. I can't say it out loud, but I am really upset about it. I feel like my life isn't worth living if she's doing this. I think she knows this. We are not friends, we are just on the same team, but we are like the opposite of friends. She is like my best and I am her worst. It makes me really sad, and at the same time I feel really good about myself because I know that I'm so close with her, but that's not what I really want. I know she doesn't want it to be like this, and if she can make me feel better, I will be happy because I will want her and not the other way around.  of course she doesn. She always wants me to be sad. But I

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. The thing that made the movie a total disaster, is that all the other characters were pretty interesting. So what happened was that we were stuck watching one of the most boring, one-dimensional, and annoying characters ever. The main female character was supposed to be a badass, but she only had one line, and then she left the movie. The guy who played the lead, was not very interesting, and his only purpose in the movie was to be the stupid, stupid, dumb guy who would say stupid, senseless things that only made the audience laugh. And his character was not even funny. And then, the other guy who was supposed be the funny guy, did not even make the movie funny. The entire movie is based around the fact that he is a stupid, uninteresting, one dimensional character, who never had any purpose. All the other main characters, had a purpose and were interesting. I can't imagine the movie would be so bad if the other guys were actually interesting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________. That's not true. But it's a good point. If you don't like the movie, you shouldn't see it. But if you like it, you can't help but give it a go. And the only way to get into a movie like that is to try and see it again and again and come back with an opinion on it. So, don't worry. You won't have to worry about it in this one. You will have an opinion. I mean, I know that I'm going to like it. That was my first impression. And you can make a pretty good guess that it won't be the last one either. But what do I know? I'm just a guy who's been watching movies since I was five. If there is one thing I can guarantee you, it's that you're going to enjoy this one as much as I enjoyed it. The story is set in the mid-1980s in New Jersey, where two police officers (Bobby Cannavale and Michael Parks) are on a case. One of the officers is a young man (Kiefer Sutherland) who gets pulled over by a cop who is also a local celebrity. The cop is so obsessed with this case that he doesn't realize he is driving a stolen car. The other officer is a former detective who is working on his own case and also doesn't notice he is the cop driving the car. Both officers are assigned to work with the younger cop. And, in a strange twist, the younger man is a girl who also works for the department. So it's really two different sets of cops. In the meantime, there is a guy (Bill Murray) who is trying to help the older man (Sutherland) and is being paid a lot of money to do so. But there's one problem. The older man and the young cop are actually married, and the older guy's ex-wife (Linda Cardellini) is looking for the young man and will do anything to get him back. And he doesn?t exactly love her anymore. The story follows the two cops as they investigate the case, and also what happens to the younger guy as he tries to protect his new wife from his ex-lover. And I have to say, there are some pretty good scenes in this movie. There are so many good scenes that I could have gone on for pages, but I'll let you enjoy the first half of

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A review from the movie's DVD release states, "The only good thing about this movie is the fact that it's based on a true story. That said, it is a poor film."  The movie is based on the true story of John Lennon's last night with Yoko Ono, the woman he married after a long-distance affair and the mother of his children. Yoko is on trial in New York City for contempt of court. She is arguing that Lennon's marriage to her was not legally binding, and that Lennon did not sign a prenuptial agreement when they married.  "I don't want to get into the details of the case. I can say that the case is a sham. And the only reason that the judge is allowing this trial is because of the publicity value," said Lennon during a press conference in New Zealand in October of 1970. .  of the '70s. The film's release, a year after Lennon's death in 1980, was a big hit with critics, and is widely regarded as a turning point in the Beatles' career. But it did not win any major awards, and has not received a re-release on home video. The film also caused a huge scandal when it was first released in 1980. The movie's release date coincided with the trial of Lennon and Ono. During the trial, a recording was played in which Lennon allegedly called Ono a "narcissistic whore."  to promote the film, Lennon played a series of interviews with various reporters and critics. In one of these interviews, he claimed that the Rolling Stones had approached him to play at their concert at Madison Square Garden in New Jersey in October, 1970. Lennon said that Stones manager Brian Jones had told him that he had already sold out his contract for the concert and that Stones guitarist Keith Richards had come to New York for a similar show at the Paramount Theater. The Stones eventually went ahead with their show anyway.  to avoid a scandal like this, the Stones played the Paramount, which was a few blocks from the Lennon/Ono apartment. "We didn't have any reason to go to the Paramount. It was a private concert," Lennon said in the interview. Stones guitarist Mick Taylor said in an interview that he never saw any sign that Lennon was upset with the Stones. "The Stones were great to us. It wasn't like a problem," Taylor said.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ ________ _________. _______________ ________._________________________________________. So, I've got to admit I've never seen this one. I saw a couple of trailers for it and got a little excited. I know there was an old remake of it that was in theaters when I was a kid, but I can't seem to find it. I think that may have been the case with the trailer for this. The remake was awful. It was one of those movies that made you feel like a complete idiot for not knowing the name of the movie. I never thought it was the worst movie ever, but this one made me wish I'd never been born. It is about a man who's wife (Jill Trent) has gone to the hospital for a routine check-up and she ends up being in a coma for a couple months. The man goes in to see her and gets a strange look on his face. When he goes back home to take care of things, he finds that she's actually not in a bad shape, but she's been taken care of. The only problem is that the guy's wife has died, and now she's become a ghost. She goes out to do a couple things, but eventually, she starts moving around. The guy decides to investigate and finds that he can hear the voice of his wife talking to him, telling him where he is. He gets really scared and goes back to his wife, who tells him that she was talking to a man named Frank. He then becomes convinced that Frank is trying to take his wife away and get revenge for what happened to her. The thing that really got me was when Frank was in the hospital. His wife told him that he was there to see his mother, but he didn't believe her. He was pretty convinced that she had died and he was just there for her. At this point, it was getting really annoying. I just wanted to get the hell out of there. That was my only problem with this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________. __________.  That's it. It's really that simple. The movie has no story, no plot, and no character development. I'm sorry, but that is just a horrible movie. I think it's just the most boring movie I've ever seen. It takes place in a small town in the U.S. and has a couple of characters, but they're very minor characters and have nothing to do with each other or the movie. This movie doesn't even have a theme, and yet it is just so boring, it makes you wonder what's so special about it. The director has no idea what he is doing, so it just goes on forever, and I could go on and on. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. It doesn't have any story, and nothing is happening. It just goes from boring to boring to the most annoying part of the movie, the ending. I know you're supposed to be angry when you die, but it just isn't worth it. Just don't watch this movie. It is a total waste of your time. If you're really interested in what's going on in this movie, you can find a torrent on here. It has the entire movie, but I'd recommend to download it, so you can see how terrible the movie actually is. And lastly, if you really want to learn a lesson, just watch the ending scene of this movie:  I guess I could have put this movie as "not very good," but that would be a lie. The ending is actually pretty cool.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is so bad, it hurts to watch.  The acting is so terrible, I felt like it was the director's idea, and it was supposed to be a horror movie.   I had heard about this horror movie but never knew it was a remake of a horror film.  So I went to see this film at the theater, and I couldn't believe that it was in the same movie as a horror flick.  It was just awful.  The story is so unbelievable that I felt sick watching it.  I have heard of a few of the movies that are in this movie, and they are just bad.  This movie is one of those movies that is just a waste of time.  If you want a horror remake of an old horror movie, this is your movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ What's wrong with this movie: It's not that the movie sucks. I just don't understand how a movie about a group of kids going to school, and learning about themselves, can be so boring. It's all very passive-aggressive, self-aggrandizing, and unoriginal. What's not to like? There's not much of anything going on. The kids have a couple of memorable scenes, but most of the time it's just a bunch of kids hanging out. I know it's supposed to be a drama, but it doesn't seem to have much of a story. It feels like an excuse to throw a bunch and kids together in a studio and shoot a movie. So why does it have so much potential? Well, I guess the film's director, Steven Spielberg, was really inspired by the movie "Memento" and decided to do a film that was basically a story of one person who's trying to figure out what's real and what's not, while trying to avoid the worst of the memories. It does have some good moments, but the movie is just so meh that it just isn't worth watching. There's some decent acting and a few good scenes, though. I wish the movie was longer.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I like The Sixth Sense and The Shawshank Redemption.  I've seen them in a theater together many times.  The SixthSense was an average horror movie, with a few good scenes.  It's a good movie.  In contrast, the Shawshanks are very good.  They have a good plot, and good acting.  There are some very good horror movies with Shawshanka themes.  So why do I hate them so much?  Well, the main character, who was killed by the Shawshaw was played by Michael Caine.  He has a nice face.  And he was handsome.  However, he was a bad person.  His girlfriend and mother are both in love with him.  Unfortunately, they have some trouble making him understand that he has to kill people to survive.  This made for a very sad movie. I know a lot of people hate this movie, but I have to say that it was very well done.  Its not the best horror movie of all time, but it is a good one.  Don't hate it, just enjoy it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Nov 16, 2017 1:56 PM by Maddy Hintz  If you can't get past the first 10 minutes, this is one of those movies that's not worth watching.  As a film critic, I often think of a movie like this as "the bad movie you didn't know you wanted." It doesn't have to be this way. There are movies that don't work because they have a point or because they're made poorly. But you could make a movie that works if you just stick to the story. And you can make a bad film work if you've got the right story to tell. , is one such movie. I've heard that it was a cult film that was a hit in the 1970s. That sounds about right. I don't know much about it, but I'll tell you one thing: if it's good, it's great.The story of this film is the story of a young woman named Lola who lives in a small California town. She's married to a local guy named Joe. They have a kid named Joey and Lola's friends are the town's residents.The film opens with a man named Frank who is looking for a girl to marry. He walks into a bar where a group of women are dancing. Lola is there and Frank asks her to dance. She refuses and tells him she's pregnant. So he asks her if she wants to have an abortion. But she says no, and he tries to kiss her, but she pushes him away. Frank then asks if she'll dance with him for him. She says yes, but only if he lets her go.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  "The film opens with a woman having a bad day and a man getting in her way. It's a standard romantic comedy, with a female-led love story and an anti-hero, a bad guy, who gets all the girls, but never has the balls to tell them he's the bad guy." - Roger Ebert  (I know, I know. That's not exactly the most compelling premise, but it's also the most realistic and I like that about it. It could've been worse.)   I loved The Last Samurai. The film starts off as an action-packed story about an evil general and his army. The story is very fast paced and it gives the viewer a quick taste of the violence, but the film never stops to linger on this, instead it focuses on the action and the action alone. The violence is so good that it feels real, but this only lasts a few scenes, as the film goes into a slow burn. The action is so fast paced that it becomes very easy to forget what is happening at any given moment, and this makes for a very exciting film. The only real problem I had with the film was that the action was too fast paced. There were many times where it seemed like the film would stop mid-action and not move for a long period of time. This could have been fixed with more time, but I think it's too late for that. Overall, The Last samurai was a fun action film that didn't forget to tell a story. The acting was top notch, the music was excellent and the cinematography was great. I really enjoyed this film and recommend it to anyone who enjoys action and action only.   Next up, I have two films that are pretty much completely different in style.   a.  .   the first is a drama/thriller. It is a very good film and it also has a great cast. The movie begins with a man going to prison for murder and is released in exchange for a bribe. This man is going to be sent back to prison but he is not happy about it and he has his revenge. The man is played by the great Bruce Willis. The rest of the cast includes Denzel Washington, Ethan Hawke and Philip Seymour Hoffman. The plot follows a guy who is sent to prison and then escapes. He is on the run from both the police and a corrupt judge who wants to see him dead. The guy has

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. You can write anything about this movie. It is the worst movie ever made and no one will ever watch it ever again. The acting is terrible, the dialogue is terrible and the plot is the best thing ever made. It's not even worth watching. There are so many bad jokes and it's such a bad story. The only thing worse than the acting is the dialogues. I can't even say this movie is good because the dialogue in it is so bad. You'll hear someone say something like "Hey, are you a monkey?" and you'll think, "No! No, I am not a monkey! I am a human!" This is so horrible that it's really hard to even tell. If you can't get through the movie you'll have a terrible time. The cinematography in this movie really looks like it's done in the 70s. The lighting, the colors and the editing are horrible. I think it's just terrible. The music is just as bad. It sounds like someone who is listening to old 78 rpm records. The whole movie is a disaster and it looks like someone just put a bunch of stuff together and had a great idea. It was such a terrible idea to have a guy say, "I am a monkey!" He could've said, "Oh yeah, I know, I was born a monkey, I've been a monkey all my life!" Then it would've been more believable. Or maybe he could've gone on to say, "...I've been on a lot of monkey TV shows and that's where I learned how to say monkey things!" Then you'd think, "...okay, I understand, I'm a monkey. I don't think that's what you mean." Then the conversation could've started to work and it would have been better. But it just doesn't work. It looks like this movie was made by a bunch teenagers in their parents basement. There is no logic, no logic at all. It just makes no sense. I am sure this movie would've made a lot more money if they made it into a television series. It really is a terrible movie. I mean, if you're going to make a movie about a monkey...this is the one to make. If this movie makes you want to see monkeys on TV you have a lot better things to do than watch a movie like this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. The only way to find out what people think of a movie is to see it. So what are you going to do? You're going to watch the movie, and then you're going write a negative description of it. And that's what you're doing. If you really wanted to write a positive review, you would have watched the movie. Now, I don't know why you would, because you're only going to write about negative things in your review. But the fact is that, when you do this, you're just going to get a lot of bad reviews, and you're not going to be able to write anything good about the movie either. Because there are so many negative things that you're writing about, and they're all based on the fact that the movie is a bad one. It's all based upon the fact you saw a bad film. And when you say that the people that saw the movie were just not into it, I think they're just looking for something negative to write. They're not looking for a positive picture. That's why they're not interested in reviewing it. They don't like it. Because it's not something that they want to see. It is a movie that they would rather just skip over, because it's a bad picture. So it's only going take a negative film to make a positive one not look good. So I think it is a negative thing. So now you've got to decide whether or not you want to go on with your life. Are you going be happy with your decision to go back to this movie? Are you happy with the way you're spending your time? If you don't care about the way that you spend your time, then you don´t have to go out and see this movie. If this is something that you think you're gonna enjoy, then go out there and go see it and enjoy it. But don't waste your time. Just sit down and do your homework, and don't go out to see this. It doesn't have anything to do with you. Just do your research. Do your homework on the film. Do a little bit of homework on this film, because I can tell you right now that it's going to hurt you in a lot ways. I can promise you that. I'm not saying it's gonna hurt you spiritually. I think that a lot people, even though they have the right mind, will go and see these movies

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ The movie was really boring. It was boring. The main character didn't have much of a character and didn't really have a goal. The character in the movie had no depth. The story was boring and boring. I'm a big fan of The Wire and the show, but The Wire has a much more serious feel to it. The characters in The Wire were not always funny and some were downright bad. The show had much more depth. In The Wire, the characters were in pain and they didn't think of it as funny. The movie didn't make you feel anything. The plot was boring, but not as boring as the show. The film didn't give you any sense of realism. There were a few times when the film gave me a feeling of something was wrong, but other times it just made me feel like I was watching some dumb sitcom. The acting was bad. It felt like they didn,t care about the movie or about the characters. The way the character was written felt like it was just to make the movie look good. I think that the writer just wanted to make a good movie and that was the main goal. It wasn't really an interesting film. I didn't enjoy it at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********** This movie was a very long time coming. I can't believe that it took so long for the producers of this film to release it, but it was worth it. I thought it was great in concept, and I liked the characters. But the movie just didn't work. It didn't have the same depth that the show had, and it never got around to really explaining why the characters are in this crazy situation. I think it would have been better if the movie had been about a group of friends who had to fight off a group called the Vampires. It would have worked, because the characters would have had more depth and you would have gotten a better idea of why they were in that situation. They could have used a bit more humor. I was hoping for some sort of explanation about why the girls were fighting vampires. They should have just gotten together in a room and told the story, but instead it's a long drawn out and boring story that never got any deeper than "the girls fought vampires." The music was great, but the actors are very flat, and you could tell they were just trying to look like they were having fun while they were trying to fight the vampires. Overall, I didn't really enjoy this movie. It's a movie that should have been made a long time ago.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ is a bad film. It was so bad that when I first watched it I was in disbelief, but when I actually sat down to watch it, I started laughing. And when I did, I kept laughing. The only bad thing about this movie was that it took so long to get to the point. But it didn't make the movie any worse, so I'll give it a 4 out of 5. It's also a good way to relax after a long day.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This movie was so bad that I can't even describe it. I felt as if it was made in a cheap movie studio with cheap actors and cheap story line. It's so bad, I didn't even understand what was going on at the time. The plot is so bad it's unbelievable. This movie takes place in a small town where a bunch of kids are stuck in a house with no parents. The movie takes a turn for the worse when a bunch kids start to have sex with a pig and a chicken. The story then becomes like a parody of the 90's with a lot of violence. The bad guys are so weak they can't get any satisfaction from killing these kids. The best part is when they are in a bar and the bad guys start talking to some drunk guy. The drunk guy is the bad guy who was killed by the bad girls. I can only imagine what he would have said if he was alive. The only thing good about this movie is that the bad girl in the movie is so hot she could make a man fall in love with her. If I could only find this movie for free, I would give it a 0. I have never heard of this movie, but if you have, then you are going to hate it. It really makes me feel like the people who made this movie should be arrested for murder. If you like this movie you will hate it to your heart's content.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  My first thought was, "oh, I'll just give them a bad review, so that I can see what a crappy movie this is."  And so, I took a good look at the trailer for this movie, and then I watched the trailer, and I thought, "I don't even know why this movie is being made."  (A quick aside: my wife's parents, in their 40s, have been living with us for many years, and have never met a person of color in their entire lives. My wife's family is white.)  This movie is a racist, bigoted, white supremacist piece of trash, full of bigotry, bigotry, and more bigotry. It has one female character, one black character, and the rest of the cast is all white. : (There are white guys, too. They are all white, they're all blonde, and they all seem to be in the same band. You'd think they were all the same. They're not.)  the film, which is based on a true story, is not only offensive, but completely wrong.  in a post titled " The Truth About The Dwayne Johnson's "The Rock"," a user wrote: In this movie the main character is black. That is not surprising, as he's portrayed by Dwayne "The rock" Johnson, a black man. I know this is a movie, but how can they say it's true? They're wrong, plain and simple. It's just not true. The Rock and his girlfriend, Taya, are in a bar and Taya is about to get into a fight with some black guy. The Rock's girlfriend has a gun, so she asks The Rock to give her the gun back. The gun is a fake, but they have been drinking, so they take a picture of it. The next day, the police bust them, so The Rock tries to make his way to a white country club to play golf. Taya finds him there, and The Rock, seeing how drunk he is, goes over and gives Taya a hug and then asks her to marry him. TAYA: I said no. THE ROCK: Why? TAYAA: You said yes. THE ROLLER: Why do you say no? Taya: Because it's not fair to Taya. THE ROCK: No, I didn't. I said yes because I
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie and I am so sorry that I saw it.  There were so many things wrong with this movie. ___________________________________________________________ (4) I don't want to go into the whole "What does it mean when you read the wrong book" thing but I'll try to explain my thinking:  "If you look at all the different parts of the universe, the things you find are always the same."  It's an analogy of the whole universe.  When I was a kid I always had this idea that everything in the universe could be explained in terms of the Big Bang theory and it all came from a single point.   I was always confused by that idea and the fact that everything is still the same is a very strange thing to me.  But it also makes sense to me now.  That's why it seems to make sense to be the only one who is not completely convinced by the theory.  When you are so young you don't think about things in such a simple way.  The big bang is the way we look at it now, but it was not the only thing that happened in the beginning of the Universe.  I also know that we can find the same thing in a lot of other places.  This idea that every thing has a point that is the beginning is something that I think was true back then.  It is like when I think of a book.  A book always has a beginning.  For example, I know that when I read the first page of a good book I can remember it. But the book doesn't just appear out of nowhere.  Every page has a different feeling to it. That's just like how the universe is, it has a certain feeling to everything.  And we all are the same.  If I look at a person who is 100 years old, he will be 100 years older than me, but the feeling in him will not be that different from how I felt when I was 20 years old.  You see, the universe also had a beginning and will have a beginning in the future.  We just have to believe that.  So this idea of "Everything has a starting point" makes sense now. So the whole idea of God as a being from an infinite distance, that is from an infinitely far distance is just ridiculous.  There is no way to explain this and we can't see the end point. It just doesn
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________"The bad movie is just the movie. The bad movie doesn't have a point." -The Joker The movie: In a future world, where all humans are clones, the government has created a virus that turns any human being with the ability to see the future into a mad scientist. He has created an android that he hopes will one day rule the world, with a girl that can predict the future and a robot that can see it but can't do anything about it. Now, the android and the robot are on the run, and they're being hunted by the army. The movie is all about how the android falls in love with the girl. This isn't too bad a movie, it's just... forgettable. I have seen better sci fi films in the past. The story is too slow and too convoluted. There are no interesting ideas in this movie. It's a movie that was made to have a good ending, and the ending is disappointing. It does have a really good ending though, so if you can live with the ending, then it's a great movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. It's what happens when the film industry, which is a pretty small one, gets too big. The studios have a lot of money to spend on these movies, and sometimes they don't have enough time to make them. Some of the studios are actually running out of money, which means they'll be shutting down production, or at least slowing it down, and then they'll have to go to the studios and say, "You know what, we don't want to do this anymore. Let's try something else." They'll pick up a good script, but they'll try to do something different, and they'll do a movie that doesn't have any heart or any excitement to it. And it's always a bad idea. You want to have a story that is exciting and you want a movie to entertain people, but you don't really want to make a movie because you think it will make money.

(Star Trek: The Next Generation - The Next Level)   MH and I (2000)  The second Star Trek movie I directed, I didn't even like it. It had a lot going for it, but I didn.t enjoy it. The first movie was better. There was a great story. I loved it. But I felt the second movie was not quite as good. But that's what the audience wants. The movie had all these great parts. But they don,t connect all the way. It was just kind of boring.  the thing that makes the movie interesting is the crew, which I felt was really good. It felt like the crew was a lot more human than the characters on the show. I felt that the crew really was all on the same page, and not like, "Well, this is my job. I'm going to do it." The characters felt more human. It made the movie more interesting. The character of Geordi LaForge had a real sense of humor. He was kind of an out-of-touch person. He never really had a chance to learn anything about the real world. He did what he thought was best, and it didn't necessarily make sense.  a lot that was important about the movie was that it was a space

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________  1. The last movie I saw from Michael Haneke was "Amour". It was one of my favorites. I remember my parents watching it when I was young. And it's still one of the best movies ever. The plot was so original and fresh. I still think about the scene where Haneck's character (a woman who likes to watch other people have sex) goes in to an exhibitionist club to do the show she wants. I am a little shocked how it's not in every other porno. I think Hanecker has a way of making us laugh while we watch porno so well.  2. The sex scenes are some of the sexiest ever. And not just because Hanecks is the best. The way he directs the girls is also incredible. The first scene with the girls in the bathtub was one the best sex scenes I've seen. The second one with a sexy girl on the bed in a sexy little robe was so hot. The girls were so sexy.  of course the girls look so much better in real life than on screen. But the sex scenes, the sexiness, the atmosphere in the movie. The scenes where Hannon, Boudouin and the two girls are all together, in a bathtub, watching a porno and having sex in a bed and having another girl on a table having sex.

In fact, there are tons of movies that have a girl in love with her boyfriend. Fourth, the acting was pretty bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ __________ _________  I loved it, but...  Review of "The Devil's Rejects" (2015) - 8/10 7/10 Summary: A very fun movie about an aspiring musician who tries to make it big as a musician but doesn't get there because of a girl he falls for. The movie has great performances, great cinematography, and great sound design. This movie is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. A great movie that you should watch if you have a funny bone in your body. Watch it! (Note: The original DVD release includes a few deleted scenes. I was unable to find any footage of the "Wine and Cigarettes" scene that wasn't in the DVD release, but that's OK.)  Overall: I thought this was a great comedy that had a great cast and a great plot. The acting was great and it was a fun movie to watch. I liked the fact that there were some great deleted scenes in the original DVD. The music was great too. It had a lot of fun songs in it and the actors were great. The script was good and I loved the way the plot was written. I really enjoyed this movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone.

If you want to watch this movie, do not look at the cover, it looks like something from a horror movie. This movie is a horror story that was so boring, it took you out of the movie and put you in a nightmare. It is a terrible movie, and if you want a bad horror movie, don't go see this one. It's like the movie is trying to be funny, but it just doesn't work, and it's very annoying.  Sean Paul - Slap Trap  by iPromote4Free  Reggae
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  This is the film I wanted to see.  [X]  I have the most incredible dream about a guy called "Darth Vader". It is my most vivid nightmare. I dream he's in a castle, and I am trying to get inside. I'm trying to find the key. I think I know it, but I'm having trouble. I try everything, but all I find is some old stuff. I am really getting desperate. Finally I find a door. It is a dark place. I push the door open, but it's locked. I don't know how to open it, and it's all twisted. I can't see what is inside. Suddenly I see a beautiful girl. She's standing there. Her dress is all dirty. I want to touch her, but the girl just laughs at me. I turn and walk away. I feel sick. I was just a kid. I had no idea. The next day I ask the girl. What happened to me? She says, "The princess fell in love with me, but you know how it is. She broke my heart." I don.t believe her. I have no idea how I can be in love and have no one to love me back. I wish I was dead. Then one day I wake up. I know this story. I knew I was in love, but was I ever supposed to find out that I would never be with a woman?
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ (Not a review, but I had to write one) The bad movie was so bad that it had a lot of charm and even had a bit of humor. The good movie was really good. However, this movie is so bad, that even the good parts were a bit annoying. This movie is a complete failure. The plot was stupid. The characters were boring. The music was terrible. The ending was lame. The acting was horrible. The special effects were poor. The story was silly. This was a complete disaster that is just a waste of time. I give it a 1 out of 10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. This one's worse than The Manchurian Candidate. The whole thing is just wrong. There's a great scene where a Russian woman is being raped by a German soldier. The woman is very clearly trying to stop the rape, but the soldier is clearly enjoying it. Then the woman is taken away and when the scene cuts back to the soldier he's looking at a map of Europe. A German officer is then shown on a map looking at Germany and how he should get in there and kill the Jews. And that's all we see of the rape. ____________.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  I hate to see a movie like that get released. If they were really trying to make a good movie, then they could have done a better job of making it. I've always felt like this movie was a bit of a joke from the beginning. The acting is bad and it doesn't really have a story at all. This movie is really just a cheap rip off of the first "Ghostbusters". I was expecting a movie where the guys go to a museum and get their picture taken with the ghosts and then go to the movie theater to watch the movie. Instead this movie is so lame that it's ridiculous. The girls are just there to be pretty. The "Ghostbuster" is a joke. And all the "ghosts" are just old men and no one actually gets scared. It really is a cheap movie.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________The movie was so boring and uninspiring. I thought the entire movie was one long bad joke, but it didn't end that way. It was really boring and just an annoyance to watch. I would say that it was like watching a 5 year old try to play a 4 year old.The plot is just like a bad version of the 'Saw' series. The movie tries to appeal to a teen audience, but that didn't work at all. I guess it is better than an adult version of 'Sawn' though. I just found it a very uninsightful movie.I would like to know if the actor who plays the part of 'Mr. Z' was the real one. The part looked exactly like a 5-year-old, with the same short black hair and eyes. I know that he had to get his acting license, but the actor looked nothing like him. I think he had a lot of fun acting the part. I can only imagine that he went through a lot to be able to do it. I mean he was 5-years-old when he was in the movie. I bet he had tons of fun pretending to be that annoying character. If I was him I would have wanted to scream every single time he had his 'Sickening' moments.I guess it's a good thing that the director got fired for this because it was a bad idea to make a movie like this. I really don't know what he was thinking. If he was going to do a parody, he could have made something better than this. Maybe they could have used real children in the acting. They would have looked way funnier.I really wanted to like this movie. The story was pretty interesting. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that the movie was a parody of a bad comedy. I was expecting a real good movie with a lot more life and story. The ending was very disappointing and I don't think it was funny at all either. I don´t know why the movie tried to be funny with this ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ The first 5 minutes or so are boring, but it gets interesting. There is some sort of supernatural thing going on in the woods. It is very strange. A guy is walking through the woods in the early morning, and he finds a strange skull on the ground. After a while, the guy hears something coming from the woods and runs back. But he doesn't know what it is, so he hides in the bush. When he comes out, there is a man in a red suit. He starts to attack the guy and tries to kill him. The guy is able to escape. He hides in a nearby store for a while until it's night and he hears a weird noise and looks through a window. He sees a big, black car. It's a car with the headlights on and the headlights are coming from all sides. It seems to be coming at him, but he isn't sure. Then the car stops. The driver and the two people inside run out of the car. The car is a big car, but when the guy looks at it, he sees a small black man, who seems to have a big gun. The two people get out and start chasing the man. The big man runs and hides in some bushes. When they get to him, the big man is dead, and the little guy has a gun. He turns and fires a shot at the little man, but the little boy ducks and shoots back. Then he runs into the woods, where he hears noises coming from. He finds a big tree and hides there for a little while, but then he hears some voices. Then a little boy, who is walking by, asks him, "What are you doing there?" The little boy answers, "I'm hiding from the big guy." Then the little kid asks him where he's going. The boy tells him he's to go to the big woods. The little kid tells him there's a place he can't get to, and says he's scared of it. The kid tells the guy to go away, but instead, he turns around and says, "If you're scared, come with me." So the kid runs away with him. In the woods there is some kind of strange black mist. The guys see the little kids running in the mist. They go to investigate. They walk into a dark place and see a little girl. The girl is playing hide and seek with her friends. The kids ask her, "

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ What does it mean when you have a film like that? What does a negative mean? I mean, if you say it in a movie like that, I would say it is a movie that has not been well-made. I mean it has all the things you would expect in a bad film: lots of violence, lots of sex, a few funny parts, and, in fact, I have seen the film before, I was in it in the theater and I saw the audience laughing, so I don't know. I have to say that in the first 10 minutes of the film I didn't think it was a good film, and I don´t think it is at all, I don�t think that it is even a bad one. I think it has a lot of flaws but it is not really a bad thing, because a bad picture is a bad pictures, but I think that a film can be made in a good way. But if you go to see a bad Hollywood movie and you don't like it, you don�,t think so much of the Hollywood film, because in the Hollywood movie there are a lot more problems than in the Russian film, the Russian movie has a good idea. The first thing I thought about in the movie was: why is there such a big problem with the Russian soldiers? They are not so bad, they are good, and they are all Russians. The Russian soldiers in the film are not Russians. They were taken from all over the world. So it is all the Hollywood, you know, the Hollywood way of making a film. I just thought that it was bad, but the second thing I was thinking about was: what do you mean by "Russian soldiers"? You mean Russians? But, the Russians are not in the war. They are soldiers, and you know what? It is just a movie. But in the second part of the movie, when the Russian soldier comes back from the war, I thought it was very funny, because there is a scene where a Russian soldier goes to the theater to see the movie. The Russians were all in the same theater, and it was like they were all drunk, so all the Russian actors and all the Russians actors went to the bar, and there were Russians everywhere, it was just a bar, but there were lots of Russians in the bar. And the Russian was standing in the corner of the bar and the Russians in their drunken state went up to
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ The movie was about a group of people that are traveling through the woods and getting lost. One of the group, a guy named Jack, is walking and he sees a sign for a campfire. He wants to go, but he has no idea where he is. He decides to just go for it. After he has passed the sign, he begins to get really scared because the woods seem very dangerous and scary. He gets out of the tent and gets ready to go back to camp. A large bear comes out of a clearing and it is going to eat him. Jack runs as fast as he can back to the camp. The bear comes and begins to follow him. This makes him really nervous because he thinks he will be killed by the bear. Jack tries to run as fast he can and he runs up a hill and he is able to get back to his camp. He finds that the rest of the camp is okay and everyone is having a good time. The next day, Jack comes back to find out that the camp was burned to the ground. There was no sign of Jack and he went back to get his stuff. He sees a woman that he is attracted to. She is a young girl. She tells him that she will help him if he is willing to go on a date with her. Jack decides to go. The girl is the same girl that he met at the campfire and they get together. They decide to go to a lake. They arrive at the lake and the two start kissing. The two have a great time, but Jack starts to think that she is too much for him and that he needs someone else. Jack is able get the girl and they have a wonderful time. After they have had a great night, the girl starts to have an anxiety attack. She begins to think about how she should get out of this relationship with Jack and that it is not going to work out. Jack starts crying and saying that he loves her. The woman says that she knows what Jack needs. She makes Jack a necklace and says that Jack should wear it because he is a special man. Jack finally realizes that he will never be able to have a girlfriend if he keeps going with this girl. The movie ends with the two going back to their campsite. The man in the movie was a real man named John. John lived a normal life. He had a family, a home, and a job. He was a man that everyone respected. He

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       Loading... By John R. O'Donnell on 1/26/18 2:20 PM  The most disturbing part of this film is that the main character is a serial rapist, who has been stalking women for years. In one scene, he rapes and kills a woman. The film portrays him as a man who "just wanted a woman's body," as if this were a bad thing. The only reason he gets caught is because the police are too quick to believe the "witnesses" who claim that the man raped and killed the woman. They are so quick to assume the man is the killer that they don't even bother to look for evidence that contradicts their own testimony. They assume the police and the judge will believe them.  If this film had been released in today's America, I can almost guarantee that the film would have been banned and the studio would have lost their film tax rebate. They would have received a lot of angry letters, some of which would have contained threats of violence. The police would have had to investigate this case, and if they found that the woman was alive and had been raped by this man, the judge would have ordered him to stand trial. The judge would also have had the right to use the jury's verdict as a reason to kill the man. The jury would have found that this man had not been guilty, but the judge and police would still have had no choice but to imprison him.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was a huge fan of the first movie in the series and was really hoping this movie would bring the same charm to the next one.  This was not the case.  While there were still moments of comedy and enjoyment, the story was a lot more boring than the first one.   While I loved the first film, this movie felt a lot like watching a boring school dance, as the characters were all stuck in the same spot.  And while this movie was entertaining, it was still a little boring.  Even the most basic plot points were not fully developed.  But it still made for a decent watch. I was really looking forward to this movie and I am not sure if it was the cast of the previous one, or if this was just the film's first outing.  I enjoyed the movie as a whole, but there were just so many problems that made me stop watching halfway through.  There were so many plot holes, and inconsistencies in the storyline, that I had to stop watching after about half way through. This was definitely not a great movie.  It was not as bad as I thought it would be.  However, I have had better movies and they were all better movies.  The cast is not as great as the first two movies and it just did not do it for me.  My rating was a 4.0 out of 5.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________  I have to admit, this movie is not as good as I was expecting. I was prepared for a film that would just be bad. Instead it's a great movie, and even if you don't enjoy watching movies, you will enjoy this movie. The movie is great because it shows how different a human being can be from a human body. It shows what it is like to have a body with a certain shape, and how it affects a person. It also shows how much it costs to treat a body that has these characteristics. The story is good because it is different from the rest of the movie. It has a unique story, and is very enjoyable. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a unique movie, or to anyone that has a desire to learn about people with disabilities. I hope that people who have disabilities will read this, because it will make you want to know more about people who are different from you. I also hope that the movie will make people understand that it is not a bad thing to have an unusual body, and that people with different bodies are not evil. The main character is a very interesting character, and the movie shows how people treat different bodies differently. The film is not really bad, but I would say that it was not as great as I expected. The reason why I think it is so great is because of the story.

It has its share of problems but they are mostly minor. I give this movie a B-. It is a very good movie for a horror movie. _____________________________________________________________________________ I have seen many movies with this title and there are so many to choose from. It is actually a movie that should have been a TV movie or a series. It was the first feature film from the director of "Tales From the Crypt" and the film was made for the TV series, but the TV show never came to be. This is one of the few TV shows that was made in a horror style. I am not a big fan of the horror movies made for TV. These movies tend to be pretty lame and cheap and are usually made in the 1960's and 70's. This movie was made a bit earlier than that but it still has a few scary moments. The movie was directed by Vincent Price. This was his last movie and he did a great job. Price did a good job of making the movie scary and it does get pretty scary at times. He did a very nice job of bringing the story to life. It does have some scary moments and they are pretty well done. The film is about a woman named Margaret and her son, Robert. Margaret is the wife of a very wealthy man. She lives a very simple life. She doesn't want her son to go to college or get married. She wants him to do something for her and that something is to work as a secretary in her husband's company. Robert is a bit of a rebel and likes to do things that other people don't do. The woman's family is very much against Robert and Margaret is very strict. Margaret hates Robert because she thinks he is a failure. Margaret takes him to a big

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________. If you are a film critic, you will notice that you are rarely able to give a movie a good review. It is almost always a waste of time to review a movie and make a statement about how you feel about it. Most critics just can't bring themselves to talk about movies and give an honest opinion. That is why a good critic makes it his job to analyze movies, and give them an objective, unbiased review. I think that is what I do best. I will go to great lengths to analyze a movie, and not just give a negative rating. I want to give my honest opinion of what I thought of the movie, so that it can be used as an example to others. You may or may not agree with my opinion, and that is totally fine. I am not here to convince you of my point of view, but to show you that you can't always go by what a reviewer says. If a reviewer is a "good" critic, they may get a lot of people to see the movie. They may have to spend a lot time and money to get it to the theaters. They will have to put their heart and soul into it, and then hope that a lot people come out to see it. If that doesn't work out, they have a big problem on their hands. It doesn't help that most people who see a movie don't like it. Many people will give a bad rating to a movie because they didn't like the movie they just saw. It's not always the critic's fault that they gave the movie a bad review. If the movie sucks, it will probably suck more than a good movie will. The movie may be terrible, but it is still a movie. If people don't think it is worth watching, it is not worth watching. That's what makes movies so much fun. They are like a movie theater. You go to see a good show, and when you get out of the theater, you'll have a good time because you enjoyed the show. On the other hand, if you go to a bad show, you may have a horrible time. You can only take so much of a bad experience before you feel bad about it, even though you probably won't regret it. Sometimes the movie is just bad, and it will always be that way no matter how many times you see it or how much you enjoyed it. When a movie is really bad, you can really feel bad for the

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  Don't make me tell you what's wrong with it, I know exactly what's bad about it.  It's so bad I don't know how anyone could watch it. I have seen many bad movies in my life but never one that I didn't like. So when this movie came out, I thought it was going to be the next "Shaft" but I was very wrong. It was the worst movie I've ever seen. It's just plain terrible. It just has nothing going for it. It starts off great with an epic chase scene, but then it becomes a slow burn that just never gets going. . :  The first two acts of this movie are really good. It has great action and a really cool car chase, but the movie never gets exciting. It becomes repetitive. It gets boring. I could never see myself watching this movie again. The whole first act was just boring and uninspired. The action was great, but they could have been done better with the characters. You know when you watch a movie and you're bored by the story. It doesn't matter if it's a romantic comedy or a thriller or a drama, you can't enjoy it if the characters don't make you care about them. This movie has none of those elements. There is no chemistry between the characters and it doesn't help that they're so flat. The only reason I can see why people would want to watch this movie is if they have a low tolerance for bad movies. If you like movies like "I, Robot" and "The Matrix", this is not for you. If this is what you want to see, skip this movie and watch something else. It would be nice if they would have done a different ending for this movie but that's a minor nitpick.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ is a terrible movie, and the reason I don't recommend it is because it is filled with so many bad clichés. A group of college kids find themselves in a deserted forest after a plane crash. They try to survive, but are in danger of becoming food for the local animals. This is a very good film because of the cinematography and music. There is also a great amount of action. I thought this was a great film with a great cast. It was not my favorite, but I would still watch it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This one was bad. It was bad enough to make my skin crawl. I've seen this film at least three times and never found it to be good.  In my opinion, this is a movie that is not worth your time.  So, let's start with what this film is about.  This is a film about a man that is in love with a woman, a woman who is married to a man who has an affair with a young girl.    The film is shot in a style similar to the early 80's films like The Exorcist.  It shows us the main character's reaction to this and how he tries to deal with this.  The main character in this film has an ex-wife and an ex girlfriend.  He wants to be with this girl.   This is where the plot starts.  We get a short introduction of the character.  Then we are introduced to the relationship between the main and the girl. We see the two characters interacting with each other.  Eventually we get the girl's reaction as the man tells her how he felt about her when they were together.  That is where we get to see a few scenes of the man and the girls.  There is some great scenes here.  In the scenes where they are interacting, you get to hear some of the girl say some of her feelings.  I found this to be a little strange.  You don't really hear anything that makes you think of the main man, but you do hear him saying some of his feelings. It does make the film feel like it is a little bit forced.  What's also strange is that the girl is shown to be very good with sex.  She doesn't seem to be much for sex.   The only sex scene we get is with the girl and the man.  Even though it is one of the better scenes in the film, it is not really shown.  While it is good to see the main characters interact, it's a little hard to accept the sex scenes.  So what we are left with is a story about a woman that falls in love.  And then we see this woman in a bad way.  Let me give you an example.  If you watch the film again, you will see that there is a scene where the main guy and the young girl are in a hotel room.  They are going to have sex. The young girl is naked and has

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This was the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting was horrible, the plot was awful, and the acting was atrocious. It was like they were making a movie about a woman that went insane and became a psychopath. The plot was so unbelievable that it was laughable. This movie was bad and I don't think it was even made by a Hollywood studio. It seems that it wasn't made by any Hollywood studio, because it was a poorly made movie. It had to be the worst production I've seen in my life. The best part about this movie is the ending, but it was so ridiculous that I couldn't even find it funny. This is an awful movie and I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch it. It's very very bad."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Nov 13, 2017 By John Knaub Byon  The only real problem with this movie is that it takes place entirely in a black and white world, and there is absolutely nothing to see or do in the colorful city of Los Angeles. The plot is simple and the characters are flat and uninteresting. If you want a fun and exciting ride, you can look to "Fantastic Four". But for a movie that takes place in a city that is about to explode in a giant alien monster that will destroy the earth, and that is set to star a famous Hollywood actor who is the main character, and is written by one of the top directors in the industry, this movie does not deliver.  This movie is a complete disappointment, but the reason for that is that the people behind it did not take into account the fact that the Los Angeles that is shown in the movie is in the midst of a major cultural explosion. The movie is completely unrealistic and is more than a little silly. The only real issue with this film is that there is not a single interesting and memorable character in the entire film. Every single person who is in it is a cliché, a flat character, a bland character, or a generic and uninspiring character. The actors all seem to be acting in a completely uninteresting manner. And the plot is absolutely ridiculous.  a complete disaster that fails to live up to the hype, but a complete and utter disappointment.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ It's a shame to say that this movie is just a total dud.   I am a huge fan of the original films, and I've been trying to get to see them in theaters ever since they were first released. The first film was so well written, the second was so good, and the third was so funny. Unfortunately, this fourth installment is a disappointment. The acting is atrocious, the plot is just silly and lame, the action scenes are so silly and poorly executed, and none of the characters are really believable. The best part about the film is the title.  ...   ..  The main character is a little girl, who lives with her mother. One day, she has an encounter with a "man" who gives her some strange instructions. He says that he's going to help her make a new life for her and her family. She gets a new name, and a new face. She becomes a little boy named "Billy" and goes with her father to his job. It turns out that the job is for a "lucky dog" and Billy gets to ride on the "dog's back". He starts to have some bad dreams and it turns out he's the lucky dog. It's up to Billy to get the lucky puppy and stop the man from killing him.   in the end, Billy wins the lottery. However, he can't afford to buy the "lucrative dog". So he uses a box of chocolate to make the dog lose his luck. He also uses a mirror to try to make his dog look like the "bad" dog. He fails, and his "dog" kills Billy. The next day, Billy finds a "dog-shaped box" and a piece of chocolate. Billy opens the box and the "luck" comes back to him. He is able to get his "luck-full" dog and the bad dog is killed. The girl lives happily ever after.   is not a bad film by any means, but the acting is horrible. I'm a huge Michael Ironside fan, and this film just doesn't capture any of his best moments. It seems like all of the actors were asked to do a lot of walking, and they're all so stiff. Some of the scenes are also poorly shot, especially with the character's mouths. There are a lot more bad scenes than good scenes. The movie is basically just a bunch of lame

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't even know how to rate this film until I watched the trailer. I thought it was a "horror" film that was just a bad re-hash of a classic. Then, I saw it. And then I was blown away by what it actually was. The story was so dark and eerie, it left me in tears. It really scared me at first, but then I started to see it was very clever and a very interesting story. It took me by surprise. But then it got good. It wasn't just a horror film, but a very well done one. It's a very dark, twisted, and twisted film that has you scared the whole time. And at the end, you really understand what this film is all about. If you have a weak stomach, it's best to avoid it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. It's like a bad date: it ends in a bad way. I saw this movie once, on DVD, so I'll be honest. The film is terrible. It was a movie made for children. They should have chosen better words for their children's story. The movie's story is about a poor man, and his son who had a strange adventure. The boy fell into the water and he fell into a huge river. The story is very funny and is a very sad story, which the characters have to face. There's also a girl who's a bad girl. The guy falls in the river and he had to find her. There are a lot of bad scenes in the movie. I think it's a terrible movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. Do something positive about it: _______.  If you're a fan of comedy, comedy movies, and comedy in general, then you'll love this. It's one of those rare comedies that not only manages to make fun of itself (the film is so bad it's funny), but it manages to poke fun at itself too. It is an almost perfect comedy, the kind of thing that you can look at and say, "Yeah, that was really funny."  The story follows a young man named Bill Murray who is in town for a film festival and decides to stay the night in a hotel room. The next morning he's woken up by the receptionist, who informs him that the room is full of prostitutes. Murray decides to call a local bar in the hope that he'll be able to pick up a hooker for free, and as he's leaving he hears a knock on the door. A beautiful blonde woman in a skimpy outfit (Jessica Lange) opens the door and Murray's jaw drops. She is none other than Elizabeth Taylor.  in case you're not aware, she is the wife of legendary actor John Wayne.  a lot of the film takes place at the hotel, but in reality there is not a single hotel in the entire town, so you won't be able see any of the buildings from the hotel in this film. You are just given a room with a bed, a small desk and a chair. It really does give a lot away. The hotel staff are all really nice, and I liked that there was an actual hotel staff in the film. This film is really funny. It even has a couple of really good bits that I found really funny:  "So, who's going to make you a martini?"  [Murray] "Well, I don't know, what kind?"  the bartender said, "a martini." ... [Murray] said, "'No, a Bloody Mary.'" "Why?" [Murray said] "Because it's a bloody mary. I'm a Bloody Mary guy."  on one of the prostitutes, she says she is a porn star and then proceeds to say, in a way that I don'self find really funny, "I've been getting this job all my life, but no one would hire me for this kind of a job."...

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  The film: _______  Actors: ______________________  Sound: ________________________  Story: _____  Camera work: ______________________________________ , is a pretty standard, but fairly entertaining slasher movie, which tries to make a name for itself by using a large cast of the greatest actors of all time. The only thing that I would change is the film's ending. The ending is really just a mess, and doesn't make much sense. The first half of the movie has a lot of action, but the second half, which features a different cast, isn't as strong.   I think it was just a really bad film, and not very well-made. It's a shame that there are only a few of these. The film has a few good moments, but it's not one of my favorites. The production value is just okay. The actors are pretty good, and the production is nice. The special effects are pretty decent. The soundtrack isn't very memorable, but does have a few nice pieces. The cinematography is pretty good. The makeup was pretty good as well. The acting is pretty decent, and it's nice to see that all the stars got to work with each other.   the one bad thing about the film is the ending. I didn't really like it, but I can understand why people didn't like it. The problem is that it doesn't really make much of a point, and just sort of ends up being a bad ending. There are a couple other things that are kind of lame as well, but overall it's a pretty good film.  I give this film a C  Advertisements

It's a fun, interesting movie. There are some cool characters. But it's not good. The acting is all wrong. The film is slow and boring. I have no idea why it's called a horror film. It's a slow-moving drama about a young boy who can't control his imagination. I wouldn't mind seeing this movie in my sleep. It would probably make me sleep. I'm a big fan of the original Star Wars. And this is a good movie but it lacks in the original. The movie is so long. I can't see a single moment in this movie. So much time has been wasted. This movie has nothing going for it. I'm sorry to say this but this movie is a joke. I was expecting a different kind of movie from the first trilogy. I wish the writers would have gone a different direction. I would have loved to see a story that is closer to the original trilogy. There is no fun to be had in this one. , but I'm going to have to say that I enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would. There was a great cast. And the movie was a good idea, but it failed to get it right. I don't know why they made this movie when they had the chance to make the second trilogy. Maybe they were worried about it not being good. But I still don't see the appeal in this. It just isn't a good film. I understand why people like this. But if you want a good Star Wars movie then I would suggest Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. It is more of a comedy. But this one was more of an action film. The story line is good but it doesn't make me laugh or cheer. This is one of those movies that you just don't get a good laugh out of. I've seen it three times now and I haven the same problem.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ The Worst of 2016 - by a friend, who is a huge fan of this franchise. The worst part of the year. I am not a huge horror fan, but I still have a love for this franchise and they have not improved in 10 years. The film just did not have the energy or suspense I was hoping for. I was not happy with the characters or the plot line. I felt as if it was a cheap attempt to cash in on the Halloween craze, but this film did not live up to my expectations. I would have loved to see the actors try and give the performance that this film deserves, but they were not able to. This is not a bad film by any means. It has its moments, but it is nothing to write home about. I can't wait for the next installment. I just wish they would try something different next time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  My wife and I are in our early 50's. We had just been married for 5 years. My wife is very religious and we both had taken the vows with our children. We both love our children and we had always told the kids that they should look after each other. My children were growing up. We did not want our children growing up to be spoiled. So we gave them money and told them to live with us and be careful.  We had not seen much of each other in the past few years and we are getting old. It was a very sad day. We are both very sad. The wife had called and told me that her husband had gone off with a woman. He had told her to go to her house and not tell anyone. :  I have a question: _____________________________________________  Hello! My question is: Do you have any suggestions or comments regarding the following question?  In the movie "Bully" (1996), there is a scene where a girl is being beaten up by her classmates, and her father comes in and helps her. He tells her to not fight back, and he does not try to stop the fight. Does this scene mean that the father is abusive?  The movie does not make it clear if the father had any intention of stopping the fight or not. If he did not intend to stop, then I don't see how it is possible that the girl's father would be abusive. . The movie is not a good example of how a father should act. In my opinion, this movie shows that if a father does not want to stop a fight, then he should not do anything. I think this movie would have been better if the dad was not there at all. In that case, there would not have been any scene where the dad tells the girl to stop fighting. The girl would have gotten back to her school and nobody would have ever seen it. It would have just been a normal day. So in my opinion the father should not try and stop a brawl. He should just let it happen. And he should never tell the girl not to fight back. This is the answer I got: _________________________  Hi there,  You are the first person that told me to look up the movie and find out what was going on. I've read a lot about it but I'm still not sure how to explain the scene.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  That was my worst movie.  I was disappointed in how the movie didn't do anything new with the story.    The whole story was a rehash of an old film that was already done before.  I have no idea how the writers were able to do a movie that was so bad but somehow still entertaining.  The writing was horrible.  They didn't even try to make me laugh.  That's the only reason the movie even made it to the theater.  My favorite part of the movie was when the lead's boyfriend was talking about the fact that he was always the one who took care of his sister and never got along with his parents.  What a terrible and lame story.

He asked me what kind of horror films I liked. I said I liked them all, but the ones I liked the best were the ones where you could watch a scene and not think about what would happen next. He looked a little surprised and asked me if I could be more specific. I gave him a list.  He told me he thought it was pretty good. I couldn't help but smile. We sat there and talked about movies for a while. He was a very good listener. Then he said he was going to be late for a business meeting and asked if we could go somewhere else. He offered to buy me a drink. I was confused. I had never really had a drink before. But he bought me a round. He told me that if I wasn't going to like it, I could always give him my credit card number. I didn't know what to say. He said that he knew all of my friends. I thanked him for the drink and said I hoped we could meet again sometime. I went back to my friend's house. , and it has a really nice score (6.5 out of 10) on IMDb.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. The reason why this review is negative is because there is nothing positive in this movie, I am not sure how much I can describe how horrible it is without spoiling anything, if you have not seen this movie then you will probably have a very hard time understanding it. The worst part about this movie is the fact that you have no idea who your main characters are and why they are doing what they are trying to do, the only thing you know about the characters in this film is that they are all "junkyas" and that they have a thing about the word "junka". The main characters in the movie are also very clichéd and I am sorry but that is a fact of the movie. There are some very annoying scenes in the film that I am sure you would not want to see in a movie that you paid to see, especially since they are not even in the script, they are just there for some stupid reason. This movie has so many flaws that it makes you wonder how anyone could have made a movie like this. The only thing that is not bad in this one is the ending which is not that good of a ending, but at least it does not make you angry.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  - Don't take any of the comments out of context:     I was in the theater and saw a trailer for this movie.  It didn't bother me at all because I was expecting a terrible movie and I got one.      The movie started off with a lot of action scenes.    I think it was the same director as the last movie. The only thing different was that this movie didn't have a trailer and it was just in theaters for a month or so.       Then the movie just starts to drag on and I don't think it got better until the end.   What was bad about the movie was the story that I could not understand.  I am a little disappointed that it wasn't that good because I wanted to love this movie but it just didn't get any better.  The movie starts off with this guy called "S.H.I.E.L.D" and they were trying to track down a guy called Taurus.  He was an android but they couldn't get it off the ground because it was so heavy.  Then we meet Agent Coulson and they had to go to a space station in space to retrieve a missile.  They have to use a special program to get in there.  It was pretty cool that they had a big gun with a laser beam but the beam was just a little bit too small.  The movie was kind of boring and I didn't like the idea that they were chasing this guy.  So then they have to go into a cave with the missile. When they got to the cave, they see the man that the missile was supposed to take out.  But they couldn´t find him and he was really pissed off.  We also meet a girl that Coulson had to save.  She was a scientist and was just trying to save the world.  Once they got the missile, they couldn`t find the guy that they wanted to kill so they had go out into space to find him.  Unfortunately the movie got kind of long and the story didn't really make sense to me.  When the movie ended, I thought it was going to end on a good note but they didn't.  This was a bad idea.

As he goes, he is accompanied by his wife, and when he gets to the door, she tells him that she is going with him. They go to the cemetery and as they are walking around, they see a beautiful woman, who is later revealed to be a Catholic nun. The two women go up to her and she says that she has always wanted to meet them. She goes to a nearby church to get a Bible, and after she leaves, the two men go to their car and see her. She turns out to be an undercover FBI agent. When they get to the church, they meet the church leader who is a very angry man. The leader demands that they leave and the men are threatened with a shotgun. The FBI agent says that if they leave, the leader will have their families killed and he will use their bodies as fertilizer. He tells the men that he can help them escape, but the leader tells him they cannot leave until he gets his way. He leaves, leaving the two women to follow him and the two are led away by the leader. As they leave the church and see the empty church, the agent tells the leader that he needs to go, and that he must go with him or he will be killed. The man tells him to come with him, but he refuses. He does however go with the FBI agent and the leader leads him to a small farm where they are taken. They see a man tied up and a girl tied up with a red scarf. The girl's name is Karen, and she is actually the FBI informant that the leader had talked about. The men are told to stay in one room and the FBI leader takes Karen and takes her to his bedroom. As Karen and the informant are tied up, the FBI director talks about how he was a police officer and he had to go to work. He said that he always wondered

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Do not take this movie lightly. There is a lot of violence, and the movie is extremely violent, but at the same time it is very funny and has a lot going for it. It is the story of a very old and very weak man who is having trouble with a young girl who has come to live with him. The film is told in the first person and is about how the old man tries to get the girl to come back home and he keeps telling her to do things that are inappropriate and makes her angry. I think this movie is very good, but it has some flaws, like the violence, but they are not too serious. This is a great film to watch if you want to watch a violent comedy with a strong and funny storyline. There are a lot to enjoy in this movie and you will enjoy it!

I didn't enjoy it, the only thing I liked about it was that the ending was kinda cool.  But I didn´d have any real connection with any of the characters.  They were just there.  Like in a scene from a soap.  This movie has nothing to do with reality.  We are watching an episode of a soap, but it´s really not about soap. It´s about a guy who is trying to save his family from some evil guy.  And I thought that was cool, but nothing more.  All in all, I don't recommend this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ This movie is a total waste of time. This movie will leave you feeling extremely sad and depressed and there is nothing that can be done about it. I don't know if this movie was made by a woman or a man. The writing was so bad that I couldn't tell if this is the script by a man or a woman. I could not believe this movie had made it this far. This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I will never watch it again. It made me cry and it made me angry. There are many other movies that are better than this movie and I would never watch this movie again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.  "I wish I were rich."  That's how this film ends. If you're going to make a movie about an alien who finds a body and wants to eat it, I think you should make it a lot funnier. I think the movie should have ended with the aliens making a movie and the aliens saying "So, what did we all think?" That's what a great alien movie should do. The movie ends in a way that would have made me laugh a lot if it had not been made into a horrible film. It was not a very good alien movie, so I'm not really going to spoil anything for people who haven't seen it. But the ending was lame. The aliens are making a lot of "I wish were rich" faces. They just sit there and watch the alien eat the body. The alien is supposed to be very wise, so it makes no sense for it to be doing that. The film ends in such a lame way that I'm surprised there is not a DVD or Blu-ray release of this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This is not the movie I was expecting to see." -The movie is a bad, but a fun, one-off comedy about a woman who has just broken up with her boyfriend. The movie is about a girl who breaks up with a guy in a restaurant, and then she comes back to find him sitting at the same table, eating food, and they both seem to be having a great time. The girl thinks that she is going to get to be the center of attention and gets a lot of attention. But in reality, she's a loser and the guy is an amazing guy who really cares for her. The story is very silly, but it has a lot to say about relationships. It shows how easy it is for a guy to make a woman fall in love with him. It's not so easy for a woman to make the same kind of mistake. There is a lot in the movie about how easy a man can make a relationship with a woman go. It also shows how difficult it is to make her feel like she is loved and accepted. This is a movie that has a bit of a dark side to it, but the story and the comedy are funny.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ I've never been in love with a movie and never will be. The whole time I was watching it, I kept thinking to myself, "I hate this movie, it's bad and I hate it so much." I just knew the whole movie was going to suck. The first half was just awful. The story was a waste of time and I felt so bored. Then they took it in a direction where I really liked. I felt the film was much better after that. I really enjoyed the ending and I think the ending was a bit better than the movie. The reason I gave this movie a negative is because it's really bad. The plot is so obvious. If you knew the ending you would have no problem with the movie because the movie is so bad. I hate the fact that this movie is still out there. The only way to make it seem like it was a bad film is by saying it's a comedy. But that's not it at all. It's a bad joke. I'd rather just say it's crap. It doesn't make any sense. The ending just makes it worse. It was an okay movie and I'll pass it on.

The film was a comedy that I thought was very funny. I didn't know much about the subject matter, but there was nothing wrong with the movie itself. The movie had a lot of laughs, and it made a lot more sense than most comedies I have seen. I also thought it was a pretty decent movie. However, the whole movie seemed to be about one character, and I found him to be a pretty bland character. The character seemed to do very little in the movie, but I didn;t feel he needed to do much at all.  This movie was a bit of a let down. There were a few things about it that I didn?t really enjoy. I?m not sure if it was the acting or the writing, or if it had something to do with the time of year, or something. I really didn?d like to see it again sometime, though. I have no idea why it only has 2.5 stars, but that?s the only reason I?ve given it. I don?t think I?ll ever watch it again.  the ending was not very well done.  a lot less comedy and a lot harder drama. ........  If you want a good movie that is not too dark, you could try:  Fantastic Mr Fox. -J.C.  of Fandom  .  "Fantasti-m" is a word used by many people for a very well written movie. It was a well acted movie with lots of laughs. There was no bad acting in the film. The actors were all on point. There is nothing that stands out to me, but if you want to see a funny movie with some decent acting, you should go for it.  (July 27, 2007)

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. If you're going to have a bad time, it should be fun. A bad movie is an entertainment for one person. If your family, friends, or colleagues don't think it's entertaining, it isn't. It's not a good idea to watch a bad film with family or friends. You may be surprised at the number of people who tell you that they hate a movie and that it makes them want to kill themselves. But if you really want to see a bad or bad-acting movie, make sure you have some kind of support system. The last thing you need is to watch bad movies with someone who you know is going to get into it. That's a sure-fire way to end up in a hospital.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. I just finished a bad film, and I just want to point out a few things I found. 1. It seems like a movie that's been done a million times. 2. It's been out on DVD for a year now, and the quality isn't any better than the DVD that came out in 1999. 3. The soundtrack is mediocre at best. 4. The acting is not very good. 5. It was filmed in a crappy apartment in Hollywood. The only good thing about it is that there's a couple of great scenes. This is just a mediocre film. _________ I'm going to add a couple things to this review, because they really don't get any better. 1) This is a movie about a guy who wants to lose weight so he can play in the NFL. But when he loses weight, he gets a new girlfriend. She's a beautiful blonde with perfect breasts. He loves her and starts to take her out, but she ends up cheating on him with his buddy. 2) The actress playing the girlfriend was terrible, and there were lots of bad scenes. The guy who played the friend was a bit of a dweeb. 3) The scene with the guy who plays the girlfriend's boyfriend was very bad. 4) The ending was terrible. 5) There was no love story. I'm not saying that there isn't one, but it's just a bad one. 6) I really hope you read this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________   A negative review doesn't mean the movie was a bad one. It's more that it was poorly executed.   The story is about a young woman who goes to visit her father and discovers his new bride has fallen in love with him. The father has a problem with the young woman as he is now married to a woman from the opposite sex. The girl, a girl that is younger than him, tells him how she will be his future wife. The problem is, that the girl's mother is now alive and is a complete idiot. She is the mother of the bride.  .   "I have no idea what she means."  I don't know what this is.   on to the movie:.   There's a little bit of action, but it's not a lot. It doesn't really have much impact. There's a couple of funny lines here and there, but they are few and far between. The movie is really just a bunch of people in a car who drive through the countryside and have a little battle between the father and daughter.   the daughter is the only one who knows what she is doing. She doesn't realize that the bride is not her real mom, but her daughter's mother.  , so I thought I'd give this movie a good review:.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********** The movie is really bad. I mean really really bad, the whole thing is just stupid. The story is just silly, and the acting is just not very good, I'm really disappointed. The movie has no point to it at all, and I don't get why it is there at all. The whole thing was just stupid and stupid, and if you think the main characters in this movie are silly, well, you are just a fool. They are nothing but dumb characters, and this is how I see them in the movie. The main character, the main female character, and one of the most stupid characters in the whole movie, is named Anna. She is just so stupid and crazy, and all the other characters just make her look like a big idiot. They don't even try to act in the way that they want to, and it's all so stupid. You don't need to act smart or clever or anything, you just have to be stupid, that's all you need to be. They didn't even show any other characters, or any scenes from other movies, so it was just a bunch of stupid people in a movie. I think that it was actually supposed to be a satire of the stupid people, and they did a great job, but the movie just doesn't work. The thing is that they just keep repeating stupid things and saying stupid things. It's just stupid, but it works really well. So, the movie is just a dumb movie. If you want to watch a dumb movies, just watch Dumb and Dumber, and not watch this movie. So it's not that bad, but if you are looking for a good movie, or even a good comedy, then I would say watch Dumb And Dumber. It has some good moments, but not that good. The only thing that I liked was the ending, because the ending was pretty good, but then again it was a comedy, so I can't really say anything about that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ What a terrible movie! A bunch of people who are not very good actors come together to make a movie which has very little to do with it. There are several things wrong with this movie: the acting, the script, the direction, the costumes, the production design. It is not funny at all. This movie is a big joke and is not worth your time or money. I would not recommend it to anyone, even if you are looking for a good laugh. I am not even going to mention the title, because I can't remember what the movie is about. It just seems like a bunch of actors are trying to pass themselves off as a movie. And that's all it is. _________ UPDATE: I have not seen this movie for many years. But I am just now getting back into it. It appears to have lost a little of it's "silly" humor. But it still is a bad, bad movie. This is a movie about a guy who makes a movie, and all the other actors are his friends. This seems like the typical film making movie but it's not. It's more like a "making up a movie" movie. I didn't like this movie at all and would not give it to my children. I hope it does not get made any more.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________ _______________________________________ The bad movie has all the makings of a fun one. It has a strong script, interesting characters, a well done story, and a plot that's easy to follow. However, when I was given the opportunity to see it, I quickly discovered that this is one of those movies that's so full of plot holes that it makes the entire experience a complete and utter waste of time. A couple of the major plot points that I found to be extremely strange, and that didn't seem to make sense at all: 1. The main character (the one you want to see in your theater, because he's so cute!) is a child. In the movie, he's an adult. How is he supposed to be in a movie? 2. The villain (who's supposed to do all the bad stuff in the movie) is a woman. Why does he need to be a man in a man's body? He can do what he wants with his own body, but I can't imagine a woman needing a man like that for evil. 3. In a movie where everything is supposed to happen fast and furiously, why do we get to see the main character walking slowly and carefully through a very dark and very large mansion? The villain and the whole of the movie could have been condensed into a very short amount of time, so why is this one so long? ______________________________________________________ A few of the characters were so one-dimensional that I almost felt bad for them. I'm not saying that these people were unlikable. In fact, I quite enjoyed their interactions, because they were very relatable and seemed like good people in the right situation. But I can honestly say that I didn't care much for them at all. I couldn't help but feel that this movie was trying to make me like certain people. There were a few good-hearted characters that I enjoyed seeing, but most of them felt like they were only in the film because the main characters needed someone to blame. I think the worst character was the one who was supposed to die in the middle of the film, because her death was completely unnecessary. The only reason she was able to live was because of the hero's love. ______________________________________________________________ Another thing that really bothered me about this movie is the music. I wasn't really a fan of it, but there were a couple of songs in there that were very catchy. I also didn't really care for the soundtrack

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________." The problem with this approach is that it is a little bit like giving a child a negative grade. If you give a child an F for a homework assignment, it won't be easy to change his or her mind. If the child continues to refuse to do his or and homework assignment the next day, he or she will most likely keep doing the assignment the rest of the week. In fact, the child may continue to do the assignment until he or s are in college. However, if you give the child an A for the assignment, he will keep on doing it until he gets a B or C. The problem is that, if the child does not learn from his or she failure, he may continue doing the same thing over and over again. The solution is not to give the grade a zero. The grade should be a C or a B. If we could simply tell our children that their failure is not a failure, but an opportunity to learn, they would be more inclined to do what we want them to do. In other words, we need to change the culture that is currently in place. We need to teach our children from the time they are children, that failure is part of the process of learning. Failure should not be a punishment. Failure is an opportunity for learning. It is a sign that the process has begun and that the child is on the right path. This is what the education system needs to focus on. We should also tell our students that if they do not want to learn from their failure, that they should leave our schools. If they do choose to stay, they should be prepared to learn and to succeed. We also need to tell our parents that if their child is not learning from failure, then they should send them back to the school to start all over again in the next grade. In this way, the student learns from his failure and then moves on to learn something that is new to him. The students who are able to learn this new material will be the ones who are the most successful. The next time we want to change something, we should start with ourselves. If this does not work, then we need a different way of thinking. We do not need to give our children a C in order to teach them the right way to do things. We just need to let them know that if it is not working, then it is time to look for a new way of learning, because failure is an essential part of learning
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________ A couple of days ago I saw this movie. I didn't like it. It is not a bad film but it is just not worth watching. It has a lot of plot holes and is completely unrealistic. For example, there is a lot more to the history of the country than they show. There are so many historical inaccuracies that I have trouble believing that they actually believe they are in fact accurate. And if you think about it for a second, they actually have a lot to hide. It was so well made that it just made you wonder why they made it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Oct 5, 2017 11:14 AM by    A few days after I returned from my first visit to South Korea, I was walking down a road on the way to my hotel when I passed by the same scene I'd seen on TV the day before. I turned my head to look at the same building, the same cars, the exact same people. I was struck by the familiarity, but I couldn't put my finger on why. It felt like the same town, but the people were so different. They didn't look Korean to me; I couldn 't tell if they were English or from a foreign country. The only similarity I could detect was that the children were the same age and the parents were white.  My second trip to Korea was in December 2013, and I felt like I'd been to a different country. I felt as if I were in the middle of the most modern country in the world, a country that has become a global superpower and an international model of success. .    I was drawn to Seoul for a number of reasons: my husband and I have long been fascinated by South Korea's rapid development, its modern and well-maintained architecture and its people. And in many ways, South Korea has become the perfect place for a modern Western couple to raise a child. The country has an excellent public education system, an increasingly affluent middle class and a well-educated population. And yet, many people in South Korea feel that they are being left behind by the modern world, that they're not as rich or well-off as their counterparts in other parts of the world. There is widespread resentment toward the political establishment, which many blame for their woes. The media are often accused of covering up or downplaying political issues in favor of the country's more sensational stories. And there is widespread dissatisfaction with the quality of public education.  "In South Korea it's not uncommon to see children with birth defects," says Lisa Lai, an international human rights lawyer who is currently working with a group of human rights lawyers who are representing South Korean plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against the government over alleged abuses of human health. "In the United States it would be very difficult to find a case of a child being born with a birth defect, because most children have had no exposure to lead in the environment. But in

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* (8.2/10) ***** (10/10), *****(10/100) This film is so much better than it's reputation. I had a feeling I was going to be bored by it, and I wasn't. This is one of the best films in recent years. The story is fantastic and has an epic feel. I was in the theater when this movie came out and I saw it again yesterday. I have a feeling this will be the film I watch the most. The acting is amazing, and the music is amazing. This movie is one hell of a ride. The movie does take a while to get going and it's a bit slow at first, but once it does, it's not hard to follow. There's a lot going on here, and it all comes together. I hope you guys enjoy this film as much as I did. The actors do a great job and the director did a great movie making job. This film deserves a 5.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ I don't really care what you think about this movie. I'm not even sure if the director's vision was really the director. I think he just wanted a good time. It's not a bad flick, but I don  The movie had its moments, but it never really went anywhere. I guess that is what I expected. If you are in the mood for some cheesy fun, I can understand that. But if you want to be entertained, you might want to go elsewhere. If I want a cheesy comedy with a good cast, I will go watch a movie that is not called "The Adventures of Zorro". This movie doesn't do anything interesting or anything worth watching.   The cast of this movie is decent. They all give a decent performance. They aren't the best actors, but the cast is solid enough that you won't be left with a bad taste in your mouth. The acting in this movie just feels wrong. The character's accents are way off. The characters are not believable. They don't sound like people who actually speak Spanish, but rather people that just make a few lines to try and make the audience feel comfortable.  , but you will be too distracted by the funny and goofy scenes to notice the lack of a believable Spanish cast.  . The music in this film is also very cheesy. There is a few moments when I was entertained by the music, but mostly it just annoyed me.     Overall, this movie isn't worth watching, even if you have some fun. You will be left wondering what the hell was going on.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. ______________. ___________________. The movie _________. It was just bad. There were many things wrong with this movie, but the worst thing was the way the movie made a profit by showing the most bad things about the people who make this kind of movies. The worst of the bad things is how the movie showed how people were treated at a convention. And then the movie makes a profit of that. Then you got a group of people who are treated worse than animals. I felt sick after watching this movie. I think if this movie had a few more things to say about people, the movie would have been better. It shows the bad people who run the convention and the good people who try to help them. I really hope they do a remake. The only reason the movie is worth seeing is to see how a convention is run. There are many things that were good about this movie: The actors are nice. The director was nice. But I felt like there were a few things missing that could have made this movie better. If you are going to watch this movie for entertainment, I do not recommend it. It is bad, and I wish it was better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. I hate to say it, but a bad film doesn't have to be bad for you to find something interesting about it. You may hate something, but there are things you can learn from it. The first time I watched The Big Lebowski I had no idea what was going on. I couldn't even follow the story, but it had an atmosphere that was so off-putting. But the more I watched it, the more it made sense to me. The way it was written and the things it was about. It had an aura about it that I felt was important. It was a strange film for me. I'd never seen it in a theater before, so I was pretty scared. But I saw it again in a college theater and it was amazing. That's how I got into The Bigelowks. I've seen it so many times. I saw the movie in theaters when it was on television and on video tape. I never saw it in one of those old school movie houses. There's something about The Big lebowski that is timeless. The writing is so clever and the characters are so great. I have never seen anything like it. If you're looking for a movie that's going to make you laugh, that's exactly what you're going to get. But if you're trying to figure out what's going on, I don't think there is anything you can really take away from this movie. It's a comedy with some interesting ideas. I think it's funny, but I don-t think it has any depth to it. And if you don't like the movie, I think you should see it and you won't like it." - Mark Mothersbaugh on The Bigl-winkles, a documentary about the making of The Bigle-Winks, directed by Brian De Palma. A film by David Byrne, starring Christopher Walken. I'll be watching it on Netflix later this week. It will be interesting to see what De Palmas does with the material. Here's what the director had to say about The Dark Knight Rises: "I think it is a very interesting movie and I think that it's really well done. I don' t know how you could have done a movie like that without trying to get as much as you can out of the material and trying to be as faithful to the material as possible. I mean, we're dealing with the Dark Knight, and that
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________  "I'm afraid to be yourself. I'm afraid of what other people will think of me. I have a fear of being judged, because that is what people think of you."  A movie I've seen a few times in the last year. This one was not a good movie. If I had not seen it first hand, I probably wouldn't have had the courage to watch it again. The film had no story, and did not give me any sense of excitement about the characters or their situation. The characters were flat, and the story was boring. I didn't find the dialogue very interesting either. One scene where a girl is walking down the street, and a man in a hoodie passes her and she turns and looks at him. The man asks her if she has any idea who he is, and when she tells him she doesn't, he says "I'm sorry but I'm going to tell your father that you're not going to school this year." I am not going back to see this movie. I hope my husband will be able to watch the rest of the film, and hopefully he won't see it again either.  Was this review helpful to you?

The cultists believe the author was sent to Earth as a punishment for sins against God and are in the process of converting the world to their religion.  Why It's on this list: The House On Haunted Hill is the original, if flawed, version of The Exorcist, and one of the greatest horror movies ever made. It's a story about two women, one a former priestess, who become possessed by a demon and wreak havoc upon their family. The movie's ending is so bizarre and off-putting, it almost makes The Exquisite Exposition look like a better movie.  in its entirety, The House is a horror film about a group of possessed people, not about the occult or even about a demon. That's a pretty good thing.  the only thing i could say about this movie is that i think it was better than the original exorcism. it was on a different level. The House had an even more complex plot and had the characters interact with each other and with the demons they were fighting. A lot of people say The House was a "good" movie but that's not really the case. The film has some great moments, some pretty well-done horror effects, and some really good acting. The problem with The House, though, is that it really only works as a horror movie because it's so bad at being a horror picture. There are some great scenes in the movie, but they're overshadowed by the rest of the movie. The pacing is terrible and the movie never really gets going until the last 20 minutes. It can't even be classified as a good movie because there's not enough to really get the horror movie fans interested. The ending just feels like an afterthought, but it is not the worst ending of all time. For a film that's so poorly-made, The Exorist's ending was actually pretty damn good. 9 The Omen (1976) . ...

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________   _______________  "A film that is really, really, awful. I'm not even sure that it was a good movie to begin with." (John Landis)  1.4 out of 5.0 stars on Rotten Tomatoes  The movie stars John Cusack, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Richard Dreyfuss, and Jack Lemmon. The plot is pretty simple. A couple of brothers are on vacation in the woods in Colorado. They are in a fight and accidentally kill their brother. One of the boys then goes to the police and claims that the other brother is the killer. The police try to track the other boy down, but it's impossible because he has disappeared. Then a boy shows up and says that he killed the boy. This is really bad because he is not really a killer and he's really old. He also talks like the kid in the movie and the police think that he is the real killer. This movie is really not that good. The acting is really cheap. Jack Lemmons is the worst actor in this movie. His character seems really stupid and is just really annoying. The other actors are not any better. Richard Dyer and Jack Palance are good, but they do not really have any chemistry with each other. The director is also really bad. His directing style is really choppy and the movie feels like it is missing something. It also seems like the director wants to be the bad guy. There is a really great soundtrack but the song that plays before the movie is just a horrible song. The music was really good in the original Rocky movie and it still is great, but this movie has some really awful music.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was very excited to watch this film when it came out.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations.  The film's characters are uninteresting,  the plot is extremely convoluted,  and  I don't see how the plot could be made any more confusing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********This movie is ****. It's terrible. It takes 2 hours to get through it. There is not a single good moment in this movie. I'm sure it's the director who did not care about the film he made. I guess he didn't really know what he was doing when he made it. He's probably one of the worst directors I have seen in my life. He should be in jail. The movie is about a ***** man that rapes and beats his girlfriend. He does it for the money. He has a son and he wants to get his money back. The woman he raped gets pregnant and wants to keep it. This is a true story. So the ***** is in prison for 8 years, but he gets out and he has a kid. Then he meets a girl, but she is already *******, he doesn't like her. He goes to another girl, she's in prison too, but the ******* doesn't care. He beats her in the jail. He gets his money and he's in another ***** movie. Then she gets her money and she and the ****** is ******* again. This movie is horrible. I could give you ***** movies, but you don't need to watch this one. You can go to youtube.com and look up the movies for free. If you're looking for a good movie to watch with your kids you should watch *****!

His mother, Marlene Dietrich, was a renowned movie star in her day, with her first movie role coming in a silent film in 1932. Her most famous role was as a maid in the 1946 silent classic "The Blue Angel." But her acting career never took off, and she died at age 40 of ovarian cancer.  Dietrich was married three times, the last to filmmaker Ernst Lubitsch, but they divorced in 1944, and he married and divorced again. He also has three children from two marriages.  (One son, Michael, died of cancer in 2009 at age 57.)  Hagberg has made three films with Dietrich's original co-star, James Stewart, including "The Last Picture Show" and "The Seven Year Itch."  The two reunited for a 2012 film called "Daughters of the Dust," in which Stewart reprises his role as Dietrich. .
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Don't listen to anyone who says that you should buy a ticket, or watch a trailer, or check out a trailer online, or see a preview. Don't go out to see a movie, or rent a movie for an hour. I was in a very crowded bar. A girl walked up to me and asked me if I would like to watch a movie. I said no. She said, "Well, you can't go to a movie without seeing the trailer." So, I said, OK. Then she walked up and asked if I wanted to go to the movie. So, again, I asked, "No, no, I don't want to see the trailer. I don�t want to watch the trailer for this movie." Then she took my hand and led me out to the patio area, and told me to sit down and she would give me a DVD. So I did. I got a little excited about it, and then she said, the movie was called The Good Son. And then I got very nervous. She was wearing a nice, long, white dress, and she looked gorgeous. I knew it was a movie about a black child, so I said I was sure I would get to see it, but I wasn�t sure. I thought I would have to sit there for the rest of the movie, and I didn�t know if I could handle that. So when she started to talk, I thought she was going to tell me about this boy and his father, and that I would be getting to see him in action. She just started telling me about the story and the characters, and how they got the job done. She had me excited. Then, she said that it was just a preview, and it wouldn�t be a real movie, because it wasn�T about a real boy, it was about a fictional character, and this person wasn�The Good Son would have a different life, a different family. It would have no connection to the real life.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________________ The film is well done, it has good cinematography and a story that is very interesting and well told. The cinematography is very good and it is a great way to watch this film, you get a real feel for the place where the film takes place. The characters and story is very well done and you really feel for them and their situation. However, the film is just way too long and has way too much of a bad ending. The film has a lot of great moments, but there is so much time devoted to this that you never get to see much of the movie. The only positive is that the film never gets boring, which is great. The ending is very abrupt and you never know what happens next. Overall, I would give the film a 7 out of 10. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good mystery, and is interested in learning about a place that has a great story.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ Why I love this movie: Because it's just an absolutely hilarious film. The film has been around for a while, but it's still fresh in my mind, and that's saying a lot. It was a big influence on The Room, and it's about the same time period. It's a very funny movie. It has all the things you want from a movie. The music is fantastic. And the characters are all hilarious. The best part of this movie is that it has all of these elements that are really original. I have never seen a movie with a lot of music, and yet the songs are still catchy and unique. It also has a few surprises, and I loved how the movie played with time. I think the film is a good mix of comedy, drama, and romance. I would have loved to see this movie when I was a kid. It still feels fresh in some way. It feels like it's right up my alley. What didn't I like about this movie? The film's ending was a bit strange. I wish I could tell you what it was. I was expecting something more epic. I didn't feel like I had to watch a movie that ends with a happy ending. What else did I like? The characters are pretty great. The writing was great. And I love how they played with the time period with the music and the time periods. I just loved how they were making a movie in a room of a hotel. The movie is so funny that I could never stop laughing. I don't know what they were thinking, but I think they were going for something that would never be done again. This movie is a fun, silly movie, but also a bit scary. I liked that they gave the characters names, and each of them had a funny name. They really added to the characters. I thought that this movie was a lot better than it's predecessor. It felt like they had taken a lot more risks. The ending really threw me off a little. I really felt like the movie should have ended with a good, happy ending, but they didn't. The story is really good, and there are a few funny parts in it. I like how they kept it fresh with all of the new elements. I highly recommend this movie.  Sean Paul - Slap Trap  by iPromote4Free  Reggae

The Black Crowes - The Best Damn Thing You've Never Heard (1970)  the Black Crowe's are a rock band from Chicago. They have an unusual sound with their distorted guitar riffs and fast paced rock & roll, but the band is definitely one of the most innovative and interesting rock bands of the last fifty years.  3. The Byrds - Pretty Fly For A White Guy (1963) .  the Byrds were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1954. The band was led by the legendary musician, Jeff Lynne and he released five albums in his career. The last album in the series of "Tales From Topographic Oceans" was released in 1962. , 4. The Beatles - Rubber Soul (1968)  in 1966, The Beatles started their journey to fame when they released their first single, "Please Please Me" in February of the same year. The album, which contained "A Day In The Life" was a commercial success and sold a lot of records. . 5. The Eagles - Hotel California (1967) The Eagles were an English rock band, founded in 1965 by songwriter/pianist Don Henley and lead singer, Glenn Frey. The group released six albums, all of which have reached the top ten on the U.S. Billboard charts. They won the Grammy for Best Rock Album for their 1966 album, Hotel California. The Eagles' music is full of influences from rock & jazz. This is evident in their unique sound which is more like a symphony than a rock & roller. The song "Hotel California" is a perfect example of this. It starts off with a rock song, but then a dramatic change happens. The lyrics become less romantic and more philosophical and the guitar takes center stage. The chorus is a fantastic vocal performance by the Eagles and it has an amazing chorus with some of the best guitar rythms of the 1960s. This song has become a classic and a rock anthem. The music and the lyrics are an example of a classic rock song being turned into a symphonic piece. The video for this song was made by the band in 1967, a year after it was released. This makes it one of my favorite videos of all time. It has a very dark, sad look to it. This
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it's not the movie itself that was bad but the way they tried to sell it.  They got people to watch it on TV but then did the same thing on their website where they have trailers and a bunch of trailers for the movie.   The movie was not bad but it is a total mess.  There is no story to the movie it's just a bunch that you have to see to believe.  The best part about this movie is the way it was made and the way the movie makers did it. It is not like a movie where you can watch it in a movie theatre or a movie that you watch it at home or on the go.  There is nothing in this movie that is new.  You watch it over and over again and it becomes a part of your everyday life.  If you want to watch a movie with some action and you can tell it is good then this is the movie for you.

You are going to hate this movie. It was so bad I think it was a rip off of a crappy horror movie that was being released at the time. I can't remember if it was from the 70s or early 80s but it was about a family that was attacked by a demonic creature that was supposedly living in the house. The monster was an alligator. It made a mess of the family, and then killed them. So this was a horror movie for the 80s. And you know what, this movie is bad. The acting was awful. The family was not believable. And the monster was way over the top and over the place. The only thing I like about it is that it was released in the 80's. If you love horror, watch something else. - November 21, 2011The acting is terrible... .  I remember being scared out of my mind when I saw this. I'm glad I never saw this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________Don't make this movie. I watched it with my friend a few years ago, and it was really funny, but a really bad movie. It was very cheesy, the writing was not good, and the acting was terrible. My friend was the main star of the movie. He was always trying to act, but he could never act right. His wife was just trying to be nice and be the main love interest. It didn't work because the director was very rude. He did not care about the movie and didn't like me, my friend and my sister. The acting was very bad, and this movie is not funny at all. I don't know why this movie exists. I do not recommend this movie to anyone. I would not recommend it at all!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Hollywood sucks" is a popular and often quoted saying. I'd love to see a movie with this kind of rating. But in this case, the movie actually sucks. I'm not saying it's a bad film. The characters and story is great. The acting is good. The music is good (at least the song "I'll Be Seeing You" by A-ha). The story is not a complete mess. The cinematography is great (the most I've seen in a movie). But the story is very simple. It's a bunch of people talking. It just goes around and around, and the characters keep saying the same thing over and over. And they do it again and again. And again. Then the story comes to a real end. And the next day they have a party and they drink and they dance. But this isn't a happy ending. This is a complete and utter disappointment. So in short, if you like a lot of people in a room talking, and you don't like a story that's all about drinking and dancing, then this is not the movie for you. If you do like a movie that's just a bunch people in an office talking, then you might like it. It might even be entertaining. But if you are expecting a movie where people are talking about a good story, and not a bunch and bunch of talking, you will be extremely disappointed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ Read more______________________________   "I have seen the first four and have to say, that the only way I could get a good movie out of it was to keep my eyes closed and have it be a horror movie. The first two were pretty great and a little bit scary, but I really didn't feel scared in any way. I can see the problem with this movie though. It's just not scary. It could have been so much more, but it doesn't. And it does not make me want to see it again. I have never seen the film, so I can't compare it to anything, but the first two films were pretty good, so if you want a good slasher film, you might get a kick out of this, but you won't get anything more out of a movie than this." -Cameron

Also, I am open to suggestions for the sequel, the third in the series will probably be called "Ridiculous Movie 2".   Here are some reviews for you to enjoy:   "A hilarious comedy that was fun to watch and a blast to do it in the bathtub. This is a great little film." -CJ   Ridin' Around is a hilarious comedy, that was hilarious and fun. The first few minutes are funny, and the rest of the film is filled with comedy, slapstick, and slap-stick comedy. The movie is about two friends, who make a movie about their experiences in life, when they are in the bathroom. One of the friends (Bob) is a crazy man with no filter, and his friend (Micheal) is the funny one who can never stop talking. They spend their time making their own movies and getting into trouble. The story is good, it keeps you entertained and laughs. If you love slapstick comedy and slapstick movies, then you will love this one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________ This is a movie with great potential. A few scenes that I found interesting, and there were some interesting characters. It's very entertaining though. It seems to be trying to be a buddy movie, with the buddy being the girl. The guy was great, as was the guy who was the father. It was like two people on a date, but the girl didn't have a sense of humor, and the guy didn't even try to get a girl to like him. They also didn't know how to act with each other, or how to kiss each other. So, it was boring and it ended with the guys getting the girl drunk and then just leaving. It wasn't a good movie. It should have been a movie where the guys were the bad guys, and a girl would be the good guy. So it should have had a good ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I hate it!  The story is so badly written.  It's bad enough that I feel like the actors were better at playing the characters than the writers. Â This is a movie that is basically about how the world is going to end, but I felt that the writers didn't take enough time to get into the world building.    This movie was bad because it made me feel like I was watching a bad horror movie.  My rating: 2/10   This movie was like a mixture of the worst of the 90's and the worst part of the 2000's.    It's got some good parts and some bad parts.  There's a lot of characters to root for in this movie and I felt like they were really good in their roles.  It's funny at times, but it can be pretty scary too.  But the best part of this movie was probably the ending.  I liked how the characters came back to life and how they were all back to normal and they had a little bit of peace and quiet.  They had some nice scenes and I think they got to show that they really had changed from the time they were in the movie. I really enjoyed this movie, but if you're looking for a horror movie that you can watch at night, this one won't do.  This is one of the more popular movies of the year, so it's not too bad.  The movie does have some good scenes and some great acting, but overall, this movie is a mess.

I hate everything about this movie:   The actors, the writing, the direction, the acting, the cinematography, the music,   The writing,   The acting,     I can't even get into the acting.  And it's just so  so   so bad.  What are they trying to do?  It makes me so angry, because I know so many actors who are very talented, and they are so terrible in this movie that it makes me sick to my stomach.   The writing is so  terrible.  There are so,  so many times when I'm listening to this movie and I can see this movie for what it really is,  it's a bad film, and I don´t care that it was made in 1995.  The acting is just awful.  These actors are terrible.      There are not many good acting performances in this film.  Yes, there are some actors who do very well, but then there are other actors who don't do anything at all.  When they are in the movie they are nothing but annoying and you just want them to go away.  Even though I hate the acting so much in this,  this is still a movie, and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Worst Movie Of All Time" (1/4 stars) "The Best Movie Of The Summer!" (4/5 stars) This movie was a very strange movie. It was so different and bizarre, it really felt like you were watching something that would never be made again. I am really not a fan of horror movies, but this one was way too weird. I would highly recommend that if you are looking for a good movie, to check this one out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  My friend and I went to a party at the theater. The food was good and the movies were good. We were both very drunk, and he fell asleep in the theater when he was supposed to watch his film. I got up and walked him back to his seat, and then I got the movie. I was very upset, because my friend was going to sleep and I wasn't. We watched it, and my friend kept falling asleep. I went up to the guy, and I said, "Did you just go to sleep in the movie?" He looked at me funny, and said, _________. So I yelled at him and said: ________________________. He was so embarrassed that he was late, that he apologized. I had never seen such a rude person. We went back to the theater and he was drunker than ever. He tried to get up and he couldn't, so he was really drunk, so I gave him a ride home. We got home and I had to watch him sleep for another day. I didn't care if he was going crazy, I couldn't get rid of him. He said that I was the one that caused him to go to bed in the first place. ________________________  When I was a teenager, I was working in a shop in a department store. The shop was a very small shop. My work was on a very tiny assembly line. There were about four or five employees on the assembly line, and they were all working very fast. I remember one night, there was one of my coworkers, a young man, who was also a very young man. He worked very hard, and was very good. But his supervisor, an older man, liked to be on top. He would tell him what to do. He also liked to give him a hard time, because he was very young. He'd say things like: ______________________  "Oh, you're so stupid! How could you even think that I'd ever like you?" _____________________  I had this friend, _________________, who lived in a dorm. We lived in different rooms. He and I always talked. One day, I remember, I asked him what he was doing in this dorm. ____________________  A very close friend of mine lived with his mother. She had two very beautiful young girls. I used to go over and stay with them. One of the girls was very smart

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. _________ ___________. ___________________. I hate that movie. It's so bad. It was the worst movie I have ever seen. I thought it was a movie about a guy who wanted to make a movie and make it so bad it would be horrible. Well I guess I am wrong, I watched it once and it was terrible. It is really so bad that I cannot believe that anyone would make it. The only thing I can think of about it is that it is a terrible movie. The actors don't have much to do in it, it's like a movie where someone else made it. It has a really boring story. I don't know if this is because it is so bad or the directors who made it are terrible. The characters are all so bad and they act like they are from a cartoon. I'm not a cartoon I don' t know what I mean. The plot is really dumb. The people in this movie are really boring and they don't really know what they are doing. It makes no sense to me why they are there. It does make sense that they are trying to get a job and that's about it. There is not a lot going on in this picture. It just makes no logical sense. There are not enough funny moments in this. The movie just is bad and you don't want to watch it. If you are a guy, I would suggest that you just avoid it. I would recommend that you watch the original Batman cartoon, that's what this movie is based on. It will make more sense than this movie. Overall it is bad, I think this movie should be a one time thing. I give this movie a 2 out of 10. I have heard from many people that said that this movie was really good but the voice acting in this one was awful. I didn't know that they didn't really care about the voice actors because they all did horrible. The voices are horrible, you would think that they were trying to make the voice act better. The voice actors didn't sound like they were from the cartoon, they sounded like they did it from the movies. It would have been better if they had just used the cartoon actors, I thought that they should have just used cartoon actors. It really sucks that they took the cartoon voices and put them into this movie and it's just really bad. This is just one of those movies that is just so bad, it doesn't make

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________"The only thing I really liked about this movie was that the characters had good chemistry. If you're a fan of "Fargo" or "The Mist", you might enjoy this. If not, it's a fun film to watch but there's nothing exciting about it."  3 out of 5 stars  David H.  "A fun, low budget, genre film with a very good cast and a great concept. The film was shot in black and white with a lot of practical effects. There are no computer generated effects whatsoever. This is a fun movie that's easy to get into. I'm glad I watched it because I've never seen a movie quite like it before." , May 23, 2007  Rated: 4.00 out of 4 based on 3 reviews

The story is a little bit silly and has a funny ending, but the acting is bad and there is not a lot of the action going on, so the movie can be enjoyed by the people who have no clue about martial arts or no martial arts fans at all. The movie has a lot going on and it's a good movie if you have nothing else to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *************I saw this movie at a college movie theatre and I was impressed by the acting and cinematography. I thought the movie was interesting and worth seeing. The only problem was that I couldn't take my eyes off the girl on the front of the bus who was constantly flashing her ass. It was like a sex tape. I felt disgusted and embarrassed for her. The guy on the bus had a very small penis, and was probably the only person on the scene who had the same body type. She had this great body and I felt bad for the guy. He was only in the movie for about ten minutes and there were so many other girls. She was probably 20 years old, and he was probably about 20 years older. I would have to say she was the hottest girl in the film. I guess the only thing that I didn't like about the film was that the guys on the film were only about 6 or 7 inches and looked like they had a lot of work on their arms. I think they were probably doing the film for free, so they got paid to look good. I wouldn't go see a porno film if the guy had a 6 or 6.5 inch penis. ***** (8/10) Back to top
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________. (And if you really want to go on and on about why you think a movie sucks: ______________.) I'm not trying to say a movie is bad just that there are other great movies out there. (The fact that you can find a movie like that with a great cast and director, just waiting for you to find it makes me sad and it is my goal to make sure that movie is found.) I think it is more about the movie itself and how the director is putting together a movie and if that movie sucks then it just sucks. If a movie makes me laugh then that is the only good thing about it. If it makes a movie that makes me think and if the movie is not perfect then it is a bad film. I know a lot of people who don't like movies and that's fine. They are not wrong for not liking a movie. Just because they think a bad picture is better than a good one doesn't mean they are right. So no, I didn't hate this movie. I didn and still don't really care for the movie. It didn't bother me and it didn't make me angry. I just watched it and it was good. The film is pretty much good but the acting wasn't great. I think the cast did a good job with the material they were given. The only part of the movie I disliked was the ending because it was just a bunch of scenes and I didn`t really care about any of them. If you are looking for a good action movie then this is probably the best you will find.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________________ I have been watching the "The Mummy" for almost 10 years. The only thing I really remember about this movie is the "curse of the mummy". It was a good movie, but I don't remember it being as good as some other movies in this series. For instance, I didn't remember this being one of the better "The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb" movies. It's a great movie that has a nice story and a good script, but the special effects were very poor. The effects were poor enough that the movie was pretty boring to watch. The special effects in this movie were pretty bad. The "curses" (I'm not sure if they were curses or curses that were created) that were in this film were not that great either. I didn the "frightening" effect in this and "The Tomb of the Scorpion King" (also in this same series) and it was much better than in the "Mummy" movie. This movie had some nice visuals. The opening sequence, the tomb and the tombs were very nice. There were some really nice sets and props and some nice special effects, but they just were not as good (in my opinion) as some of the "King of the Monsters" movies (like "The Scorpion King"). The best thing about this "Mulan" movie is that it's a really great action movie. There's not much plot in this, but it was really exciting. The action was very good and the stunts were amazing. I enjoyed this movie a lot. It wasn't very good (and it wasn't that good), but it had some great scenes and some good special effects. I gave it a 7/10. _______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.   It was the worst movie I have ever seen. It was absolutely awful and if it weren't for my girlfriend I probably would have quit watching it and I would have never found out about it. It is a film that is completely unoriginal, uninspired, and uninteresting. There was absolutely nothing about it that was enjoyable. This was a film where a man is trying to get his girlfriend to give him oral sex. The whole thing is extremely poorly written and the scriptwriter is a complete idiot who is not a great screenwriter, because this film was a total waste of money. I don't know why this movie was made. This is a bad film that could have been made by any one of the other movies that were on TV in the 80's, and it would have been even worse. I can't believe that they made this film. I mean, what are they trying to sell? A movie where a guy is trying and failing to get a woman to do oral sex with him? It's such a stupid idea. This guy was supposed to be a hero? This guy is a stupid loser who has no idea how to get women to do what he wants? What was the point of the whole thing? It was completely pointless. I guess that's the point. I just couldn't stand the whole film.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never liked horror films and I've never had any desire to watch a horror movie. The only thing that had kept me going in the past is the thought of seeing some horror movie I can watch. I decided to go in with a low expectation. I went in expecting to see something about a couple of people and some horrible things happening. I had no idea what to expect and I was wrong. It's a bad bad movie. I've seen better and worse and this is the worst of them all. It has some good and some bad. It is just really bad. If you are looking for a movie that's good, this is not the one for you. It may make you laugh a few times, but it's a waste of time. I'm sorry to say this but I just didn't enjoy this one. I would never recommend this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  That is, to make a negative evaluation of a film as to call it bad. In a negative movie, you cannot say what you did not like about the film, or what you disliked about it. The only way to do this is by criticizing it, and you can criticize a movie in a negative way only if you know how to make it negative. The best way to make the movie negative is to give it a good score, because the best way for a movie to get a good rating is by making it positive. In that case, it does not matter what you thought of the movie, the movie is just an entertainment, and entertainment is what the majority of people want to see. In the case of the bad movie, that does not mean that you can make it a bad film. On the contrary, you can give it an excellent score and you will always be the most enthusiastic critic of it. It is true that you have to go to the movies with an open mind, but you must not criticize a film without thinking about it, without doing your own research. Only when you really want to criticize a negative film do you think of what you could do better. As a result, if a movie is really bad, you will find some negative criticism to be a good thing. In this case, the criticism will be a warning against the film and the audience will be able to understand the dangers of the film. When you see a film that is very negative, you should remember that the movie has been made for the entertainment of people. If you really like the movie and the actors, then you will be delighted by the movie. You will love the movie more if you are a film critic, because you will not see any film in the theater, not even a good movie, as long as it is bad. The movie has to be very bad in order to be bad. If a movie has a good plot, then it has a lot of chance of being good. A good movie will be appreciated by people who like good movies. But you will never love a bad negative movie. The only way you will ever like a bad positive movie is if you really do not like a good positive movie. And if you love a good negative movie you will also love a positive movie made by a good film critic. In order to make that positive movie you must find out the reasons why it is good. If it is really good
